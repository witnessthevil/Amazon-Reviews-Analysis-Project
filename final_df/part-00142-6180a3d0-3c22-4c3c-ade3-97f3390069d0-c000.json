{"product_name":"B00005NZ1M","description":"When Microsoft releasedNFL Fever 2000on the PC in 1999, it gaveMaddena serious run for its money. It's been a few years, butFeverandMaddenare once again going head-to-head on the Xbox,  and once againFeverproves itself a serious threat to EA's perennial  football powerhouse. That's not to say thatNFL Fever 2002is a perfect  game, because it isn't, but it does offer great graphics, decent AI, and plenty  of bone-crunching gameplay.NFL Fever 2002features several gameplay modes, including practice,  single game, and season, which itself contains a couple of different options,  including dynasty and fantasy challenge.Fever 2002has a full NFL  license and includes all 31 current NFL teams--and 15 fantasy teams--along with  all the current stadiums. Dynasty mode is where most players will find  themselves, as this mode lets you manage all aspects of your team, including  signing and cutting players, negotiating trades, and making sure that your team  comes in under the salary cap.A great feature in dynasty mode is Dynamic Player Performance, which adjusts  players' ratings (which determine how well they play) based on past game  performances. So if you have a second-string running back who rattles off three  or four great games in a row, his rating will increase, which should keep him  performing at that high level. On the flip side, if a player has several poor  games, his rating will decrease.Because it was designed specifically for the Xbox (unlikeMadden NFL  2002, which was ported to the Xbox from the PlayStation2 version),NFL  Fever 2002looks awesome. Player animations are highly detailed, the  stadiums look fantastic, and the weather effects are topnotch. Beyond the  obvious features, though, there are many subtle details that really add to the  experience: the field will get torn up in wet weather, player uniforms will get  stained with dirt, and the crowd will begin to thin out if the game is a  blowout.In terms of gameplay,Fever 2002delivers a solid experience. The AI is  pretty solid, especially on the defensive side, and if you call a perfect game  it's possible to get a shutout against the computer, even on the higher  difficulty settings. On the downside, the computer rarely runs the ball, even  when it has a high-powered running back like Corey Dillon, and AI play calling  is rather suspect at times.Those complaints aside,Fever 2002is a lot of fun. It offers great  graphics, multiplayer is a blast, and the dynasty mode features a good deal of  depth. If you only want one football game,NFL Fever 2002deserves your  consideration.--William HarmsPros:Dynamic Player PerformanceGreat graphicsSolid defensive AICons:Computer rarely runs the ballGameplay a little arcadelike at times","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"Easy to learn, good gameplay Annoying commentators","reviewText":"When everyone sees this game they gasp, why it looks like real football on TV, but in this day and age, all football games look like you are watching it on TV. So what it now comes down to are features and gameplay. The gameplay for this game is ultimately easy to learn and master in a few hours with the game's training camp and practices. Press B to tackle, press A to have a burst of speed, press X to select a different player and press Y to do a taunt as your running down the field! To throw the ball, press A and then look at the players on the field, they will have colors above them, and then press the color button of the player to throw it to them. A big feature is the season mode and the single game settings which feature night or day play, snow, rain, heat, player fatigue, referee toughness, quarter length and even wind speed! Its quite amazing to play with different elements in different fields, it makes for game longevity! The downfall are the commentators which just play get annoying especially when you are losing! Also the transitions of the game between plays, such as it will show the players getting down on the field and dancing and taunting, it just makes for wasted time, no wonder why football games last 3 hours!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2001"}

The graphics is good, the storyline stupid but tolerable, and lurking somewhere you can sense a fun factor, but the difficulty and insanely unpredictable controls make this game sadistically unpleasant to play.  A total letdown.Another thing that pisses me off is, this is a time exclusive title for the Xbox.  While it's nice to have an Xbox-only game even if just for a few months, this game is so poorly programmed that I'm thinking we Xbox fans are being used as guinea pigs.  If the PS2 version plays better than this one, I'll never buy another Namco game again.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"BillofGoods","summary":"Impressive - Better Than I Expected","reviewText":"Let me start by saying I'm another one of those Assassins Creed fans that owns all of the prior releases. The one thing I did not do though was pre-order this installment because of the dissatisfaction I had with AC3. It wasn't so much the story of AC3 that I disliked, but the glitches and the add-on DLC I purchased with the season pass. I felt they (Ubisoft) got away from the story in the DLC and tried to do too much by introducing Connor to some special abilities (Wolf Cloak, Eagle Flight).  The one area that this series always seems to shine is the amount of data they include ....... to enter historical facts and descriptions of characters, buildings, etc ... that's a lot of information to include.  Very informative stuff if you take the time to read everything.Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag does have a &#34;pirate theme&#34; and I can't say that I've ever played game (story wise) that compares to this. Its actually fun navigating a ship !!  AC3 introduced this but I found it a little awkward at first but once you catch on its pretty straight forward. The sense of steering on the rocky waters is fantastic, Ubisoft did a great job in my opinion. As far as the gameplay goes I'm only at 12% completion but I've put in quite a few hours, mainly due to the side activities.  I'm one who enjoys finding all the treasure chests, scaling all of the viewpoints and doing every contract. The different ways to assassinate never gets old, whether its a &#34;double&#34; or whistling from a haystack to lure a guard over you can have some fun doing it. There are also some great cinematics that are triggered when you make stealthy kills, they never get old. The most surprising thing is I have actually put down GTA5 (which I have not completed) to start playing this and now I'm hooked.I'm very glad Amazon alerted me when this game was being offered at a discount price. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

I am a huge fan of computer and console game that involve brainpower over button mashing. I had great hopes for Ico on the Playstation 2, and in general those hopes were fulfilled. With a few minor exceptions.First, the graphics are lovely. The moody castle, with textures and ghosty monsters really draws you in. You're a young boy with horns that is being sacrificed by your village &quot;for the greater good&quot;. Lovely. You manage to escape, though, and you come across a waif-like young girl that seems pretty helpless. And this is where the story begins.You &quot;drag&quot; the girl around, really grabbing her hand and pulling her after you, to get out of the castle. When monsters appear you defend her, then tug her along again. She's pretty inept. She can't get many places that you can. So you leave her behind, go around to find a way through for her, then go back and bring her through.It does tug on your heart strings a bit when she jumps to join you and you reach out to catch her, pulling her to safety. But you have to wonder - this boy is half her age. How come all she can do is stand there in the center of the room, going &quot;Jeez, I don't know WHAT I should do now. Won't you come yank my arm out of my socket and show me where to go now?&quot;Also, many of the puzzles are mighty contrived. Most puzzle games these days have puzzles with some sense - something has broken and you're trying to put it back together, say. But in Ico, the puzzles are old school. There's a box on the floor. When you push it, stairs appear out of the floor. Excuse me, and this makes sense why?Also, the game is REALLY short. Maybe 10 hours. Compare that to something like Final Fantasy X where you literally play it for months and months and are having fun the entire time!In general though, this is a great game for kids to play, ones that you want to keep away from Grant Theft Auto 3 for a while.

The game was a hit back then, and it isn't difficult to understand why. A racing game that emphasizes on sabotaging your opponents with weapons like banana skins, flying shells and lightning bolts was almost unheard of then, and to do so with your favorite Nintendo characters was, quite simply, pure bliss. Not surprisingly, the game captured the hearts of many gamers then.Fast forward to the year 2005. Fans of the series have seen a few sequels through the years, but the DS version of Mario Kart was greeted with much more anticipation than its predecessors. The main reason, obviously, is the game's inclusion of integrated online play. For the first time in Mario Kart's history, gamers can now take on players from all over the world as long as they're using a wireless router that is supported by Nintendo. The game also allows up to eight players to multiplay in close proximity with only one copy of the cartridge, which essentially means that a gamer who decides not to buy the game can still perform a download play and race against a friend who owns a cartridge.Of course, to enjoy the other features in Mario Kart DS, you'll still have to purchase the game, especially when you're interested in taking on the single-player campaign. As with previous instalments, Mario Kart DS has a grand prix mode, which comprises of four races each that are span across eight different competitions. This means a total of 32 tracks for your racing pleasure. 16 of these tracks are brand new, but the rest consists of classic ones from previous renditions of Mario Kart. These include the Moo Moo Farm from N64, Peach Circuit from the GBA and even the original Mario Circuit from the SNES.  These will no doubt bring much joy for Mario Kart fans.Yet, even in the presence of the classic tracks, the newer tracks do not pale in comparison. The innovative minds at Nintendo have once again developed a series of circuits that are visually stunning, mildly challenging and always entertaining. You'll get to race through a pinball machine, a clock and even an airship fortress! The combination of both old and new tracks is indeed a masterstroke that allows you to engage new challenges, as well as indulge in some nostalgia.Mario Kart DS also has a mission mode that requires you to perform a series of tasks within a certain time limit. These include collecting a designated number of coins, passing through a series of numbered gates in sequence, and even hitting specified enemies with specified weapons. The missions are divided into \"worlds\", and each world various stages. Completing all stages in a world will unlock a \"boss fight\", which could involve winning in a race against the boss, or even to knock him out from a platform. Defeating a boss unlocks the next world, up to a maximum of six worlds and a total of 54 missions. Obviously, the missions get tougher as the game progresses, but they aren't exactly impossible to complete. Gamers who enjoy more than merely racing should find the mission mode in Mario Kart DS a fun and captivating feature.The other modes in the single player campaign include a VS challenge and a battle mode. The VS challenge basically pits you against seven CPU-controlled racers in a never-ending series of races. This is the perfect training ground for learning the techniques of the game. The battle mode consists of a balloon battle and a shine runners game. The balloon battle requires you to burst the balloons of your opponents, while the shine runners game requires you grab as many shines as possible. These two mini-games are quite forgettable when played alone, so it's recommended that you engage them with a friend or two. Bursting balloons has never been so much fun.A Mario Kart game is never complete without an array of usable weapons against your fellow racers. In Mario Kart DS, the arsenal gets even better with the inclusion of some new items. One of these new weapons is the Bob-omb, which causes an explosion. If used accurately, the Bob-omb's impact on an opponent is tremendous, as it drastically slows down his or her progress. The Bullet Bill is another new item that is extremely cool. Using it will turn you into a flying bullet. You'll find yourself bursting forward with much speed, knocking over anyone who dares stand in your way, and most importantly, covering a lot of ground. The Blooper, one of Mario's nastiest enemies, is the third new addition. It'll squirt ink onto your opponent's windscreen, causing a temporary loss of vision. The range of old and new items more than complement each other, and you'll no doubt find great usage with them as you progress.The controls of Mario Kart DS are extremely simple, making it a game that anyone could pick up and play without much hassle. Of course, learning more techniques are useful when you intend to go online for some real challenge, and the game does give you a repertoire of skills to master. One of them is turbo drifting, which requires you to drift, and then quickly press the left and right button on your D-pad to cause your tires to catch fire. Releasing the drift immediately after that will result in a temporary burst of speed. This technique is extremely useful in chasing a seemingly loss cause.The real meat of the game, obviously, is the online feature. Once you get connected, you'll be able to search for players who're also online at the same time. It may take a while for you to get a full quota of four players, but the game works with one or two opponents as well. You'll have to race through a standard Grand Prix in an online game. You'll also get to vote on which track you want to race, so that you can at least gain an upper hand by (hopefully) getting a track that you're familiar with. It's also advisable for you to practise on the various tracks before proceeding, since you won't want to finish last all the time!As mentioned earlier, you can also play with fellow friends with the use of only one cartridge, but the player who doesn't have a cartridge will, by default, be using Shy Guy as a character. The player only needs to turn on his DS when another player hosts the game, and he should be able to \"download\" the game into his DS for a quick race. As with online play, it takes a while for the connection to be established, but my experience with multiplaying has found no lag at all during the gameplay, which is definitely great. Beware, however, when you send a bolt of lightning towards your friend - regular attempts at this could possibly lead to a loss of friendship at the end of the races!If you're a fan of Nintendo-style graphics, Mario Kart DS will not disappoint you. The game retains the usual awesome graphics from the past, and provides a great sense of details even for a supposedly \"cartoony\" presentation. The DS' dual screen also comes in handy here, as you can watch the action on the top screen, while still referring to the touch screen for a real-time map. The map is especially useful for dodging attacks from behind. The audios are also highly enjoyable, combining great music and sound effects seamlessly. Somehow, the sound of \"vroom vroom\" seems to blend perfectly to the lively, catchy tunes in the background. If only prime time radio is that good.In summary, Mario Kart DS is everything you can expect from a Mario Kart game, and perhaps just a little more. The inclusion of online play makes the experience a little better, but even if you've no access to it, the single player campaign should still be good enough to keep you going back for more. Just remember to change your underpants.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2005"}

Much of this has to do with the fact that it's first person though; the fact that you aren't always looking at your feet or seeing your hands.

{"product_name":"B000KLNLUK","reviewerName":"PG \"2 Many PS3 game...Too little time\"","summary":"Just about perfect except for that stupid last boss","reviewText":"PSN ID GremDUDE. Well, to be honest I did not finish this game. I was one well placed glave hit from finishing it and was killed for the 10th and last time by Mezner--the final boss of the game. After that I pulled the disk out of my PS3 and smashed it to bits!!I still feel that this is an excellent game worth playing once. Since there is no Game Plus feature(from what I hear) there is really no reason to play it again. And with no trophy support, it is not worth my trouble to do everything required to get that last Glave strike again to beat this game.With that one thing out of the way, let me tell you why this is still a game worth getting(even at the original purchase price and especially at the price it is now... Gameplay, gameplay gameplay!! Everything that could be done right from the beginning to the end with regard to gameplay is done just right. The guns have good weight, nice power and cool look and feel. A limited weapons upgrade system adds further to this. The use of the glave is excellent--especially the aftertouch and some of the other cool powers you get as the game progresses. The cover system(ripped right from Gears of War) is done very well. No blind fire but overall is exactly as good as you want a cover system to be.Graphics are sharp(although by the end all the areas really end up looking the same) Load times are NON-EXISTENT. In fact, several times after finishing a hard stage, I was not ready and the game is ready with the next area!! Very well done. Checkpoints are for the most part well spaced. Shame they didn't split that last boss battle into two parts. I probably would have kept going if they could have done that for me.THe other bosses have just about the perfect balance of puzzle solving and coolness that it is quite satisfying to take them down. To be honest, this would be a 4.5 star game even with the cheap last boss.There are a couple other negatives though. One, why not have some kind of Game plus? This game would have replay value and it would have given me a another incentive to finish Mezner. Second, there is no story really to speak of. Just kind of a cheap Resident Evil rip off story about world domination and destroying all humanity--yady yada yada.Now I know I am going to get some flack about not finishing Mezner but seriously, he takes the cake of the most ridiculous cheap boss that any game has had ever. Infamous had an annoying last boss but he had a couple checkpoints in the battle. The last button pressing mini game of God of War 2 was pretty annoying but it can't hold a candle to Mezner. Even that annoying constantly talking boss of Uncharted 2 is a welcome party I will go to daily for month if it meant I would never have to see Mezner again!!In conclusion, buy this game. If you like shooters with smooth graphics, nice framerate, no load times and non-stop action, this will fit the bill with about 9 or 10 hours of enjoyable gameplay!!

You get 10 new characters (actually only 2 who are brand new) new stages, new ultras for every character and even new rivals for some characters and new endings for every character. I particularly like the new African Safari stage with all of the animals in the background and the stage actually has a day/night cycle. The Inland jungle stage as well as Seth's laboratory stage should have had this feature since you have two different versions of those stages. I like the new characters, they are great additions to the cast, especially Juri. If you want to get the most out of this game, you must have either PSN or XBox Live. Most of the new features from this game can only be accessed online. From what I understand, alternate character outfits can only be obtained online through downloadable content. This is the only negative thing that I have to say about the game since I don't have Playstation Network. I was hoping that character outfits could be obtained offline in the game itself. This game is a must have, even if you owned the original SF4.P.S. If you owned the original Street Fighter 4, you can trade it in for hopefully at least $9.00 and use that toward your purchase of Super Street Fighter 4. When I did this, I only had to pay $32.00 for SSF4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2010"}

Much, much better.","reviewText":"Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2 (MW2) is obviously the latest offering from Infinity Ward in the long-running Call Of Duty franchise. Although this time they've gone away from a COD number and just called it Modern Warfare 2. In case you've been asleep for the last year, MW2 is a sequel to COD4, set in the here-and-now. It picks up the story where COD4 left off and again you get to play a variety of different people in combat in different areas around the world. The gameplay is essentially identical to COD4 which is no bad thing - it's a tried and tested formula: first-person shooter. Having said that, there are options available later in the game to unlock 3rd-person over-the-shoulder mode for some of the online multiplayer games. If you've read my reviews of other games, you'll know my venomous hatred of this camera mode for shooters. It's pointless and irritating, and it's appearance in MW2 is inexplicable. Fortunately it's never forced on you so you can play the whole game and 90% of the online element without ever having to use it.Another gripe right up front is that MW2 now supports rumble controllers. Obviously it's just me, but I just don't see the point in these things. Essentially I'm now trying to control a game which is giving me feedback in the same way an adult sex toy does - through varying levels of vibration. It's pointless and it wastes battery life, and fortunately for me, you can turn it off. If you like rumble controllers, then I'm sure that you'll be thrilled that when you pull the trigger, your virtual gun now buzzes in your hand. Apart from that oddity, the controls are the standard Call Of Duty fare - one analog stick controls where you move, the other controls where you look. The aim / fire / grenade shoulder buttons are the same as before and the control customisation supports inverted Y-axis for looking around (ie. up is down and down is up - like aircraft controls).The gaming arenas are pretty large this time around (for a video game anyway) and there's plenty of variation. The most talked-about level of course is where you are undercover in a terrorist cell and have to shoot up an airport full of innocent civilians. Without trying to defend this particular choice of level design, I will say that the level itself is rather critical to the storyline of the game - in fact the whole plot (such as it is) pivots on the outcome of this particular event. Infinity Ward have done the politically correct thing though and if you don't want to play this level, you don't have to. It doesn't affect the outcome of the game or the availability of trophies.From my perspective, the level which was uneasy to play is the one set in suburban America. It's very close to home and roaming through burned out houses and garages, and having to defend a mini strip mall was exciting but unsettling at the same time. As with COD4 there's a \"sneaker\" level in MW2 which is based entirely around not being seen or heard whilst achieving your objective. This time around it's set in a snowstorm and is a great change of pace from the pure run-and-gun design of other levels. One level which was clever and thought-provoking at the same time was the post electromagnetic pulse (EMP) Washington where all electronics have failed. No holographic sights, no street lights - no power for anything. The entire level is dark and lit only with the burning wrecks of aircraft that fell from the sky, and smouldering building fires. Very creepy and a great level to play.The multiplayer boards are well designed and have a wide variety of scenarios from the wide open \"Wasteland\" to the frantic fragfest that is \"Rust\" (think \"Shipment\" from COD4 but with a tower in the middle of it). Each level has hidey holes for snipers and campers, narrow passageways for surprises and claymores, and wide-open tracts of land for the brave few who fancy their chances sprinting from A to B. The game modes from COD4 all make a welcome return - deathmatch, capture the flag, domination, headquarters etc. A nice addition this time around are 'ricochet' modes. These are for the hardcore games where friendly fire counts and are designed to get rid of griefers who join the games simply to irritate their team mates by constantly shooting their own side. In ricochet games, if you shoot one of your own, the bullet ricochets and kills you too. For the MTV / OCD types, there's now team deathmatch express which is basically deathmatch but with only 5 seconds in the lobby between each game.For the uninitiated, the multiplayer modes are grouped into four broad categories. Free-for-all is exactly what it's name implies, it's everyone for themselves. Deathmatch is team-based - all of your team vs. all the others. You get individual scores but the game is won by the team score overall. Capture the flag involves you capturing an enemy flag from somewhere on the board and getting it back to your home base. The gotcha is that your own team flag needs to be in your home base at the same time. The fourth type of multiplayer game can broadly be described as 'tactical' and covers a number of different styles. Domination sees each team trying to capture and hold three flags around the board. Headquarters sees each teem trying to find and destroy enemy HQ buildings with briefcase bombs and similarly, Sabotage see you trying to grab a briefcase bomb from the middle of the map and place it in the opposing team's home base. There are some other variations on those four basic game types but essentially that's it. There are achievements that can be gained for completing a certain number of each game type, and that could make you experiment with all of them, but typically most players will find one or two types they enjoy the most and stick with those. For example my two preferred games are Domination and Hardcore team deathmatch. (Hardcore modes make bullets more realistic in terms of damage, and take away your always-on radar map).MW2 introduces bang up to date weapon sets. You get to use a variety of guns and missiles in the single player mission but in multiplayer you get to unlock and use a much larger array of destruction. New to MW2 are thermal sights on some of the guns. These give you a medium-wave infra-red view of the world through a narrow field of view scope, meaning that enemies show up bright white (hot) against the ambient background. In multiplayer games, a silenced sniper rifle with a thermal scope is a great weapon to have, and a nasty weapon to be up against. Each weapon has challenges that unlock weapon additions from red dot sights to silencers and different paint jobs. Unlike COD4, the weapon challenges are easier to attain - they need less kills - but there's more of them. For example a red dot sight in COD4 took 25 kills. In MW2 it takes 10. But them if you get 25 kills whilst looking through the red dot sight addition, you unlock the holographic sight. In COD4 you had to earn a perk to allow you to carry two primary weapons - not so any more. In MW2 your second weapon can't be one of the primary weapons, but it can be a variety of anti-aircraft ordnance, shotguns or machine pistols. This is a welcome addition and whilst the machine pistols don't have the power or range of an SMG or assault rifle, they're sure handy when you get stuck with no ammo for your primary gun. One of the interesting additions in MW2 is the riot shield. It is bulletproof but not idiotproof. If you use it in multiplayer games, people can shoot your ankles below the shield unless you crouch. If you crouch, your movement is severly restricted. Either way you're vulnerable from the rear unless you stow the shield and use your primary weapon. In this case you now have limited bulletproofing from the rear, and nothing from the front. Worth using a couple of times, but the novelty will quickly wear off.Fortunately, the perks make a welcome return in MW2 multiplayer but with a nice new feel to them. Perks are the additions to your class loadout that can be defined to make life a little easier in multiplayer games. Most of the COD4 favourites are there but with different names, and the new feel is that they have two levels of perk now. So for example if you add the \"Marathon\" perk to a loadout, you have infinte ability to run. Once you've run 26 miles in multiplayer games, the \"Marathon Plus\" perk is unlocked which adds the ability to climb objects more quickly. Perks are arranged into three categories as before and it won't take long before you find the three you like playing with the most. For every benefit the enemy can have in their weapons, you can have a perk to defeat it - for example the cold-blooded perk means you don't show up on enemy air support or thermal vision. Having a sound-controlled room where my PS3 is, the perk I can't live without is Ninja Plus which makes my footsteps silent. This means I spent a great deal of time in online games finding the enemy teammates using sound alone.One perk/weapon addition worth mentioning is the Akimbo mode. In this mode you get two of your chosen weapons - one per hand. This means you can no longer aim through the site because the left trigger becomes the gun in your left hand. However it does double your firepower. It's nice to have twice the firepower if you're a bad shot, but not so nice because you can't aim properly at anything. It's more \"random spray of lead\" than anything else. However, when panicking in close-range to an enemy teammate in multiplayer mode, \"random spray of lead\" beats \"accurate aiming\" every time....In addition to perks, there are now deathstreak rewards. Similar to killstreak rewards, you get deathstreak rewards if you're sucking particularly badly. For example the third time you die in a row, you get the martyrdom reward where you drop a live grenade the next time you die. Or you can get a supercharged reward meaning the fourth time you spawn you have super health - similar to Juggernaut in COD4. And that's an important difference - two of the most hated perks in COD4 have gone and been replaced with deathstreak rewards - martyrdom and juggernaut.Of course there are killstreak rewards too - things you earn for getting 'n' kills in a row. In MW2 they're customisable so you get to choose which three killstreak rewards you can receive. The more kills you get in a row, the more impressive the rewards become, although this time around, anyone you kill as a result of a killstreak reward, doesn't count towards the next one. For example if you carpet-bomb 5 enemy teammates, those 5 kills don't count towards another killstreak. The rewards start out fairly mundane with UAVs and counter-UAVs for three or four kills, and range up to a heavily armed and armoured Pavelow helicopter for 9 kills, right the way up to tactical nuke for 20 kills which slaughters everone in the game but wins it for your team. ie. Mutually Assured Destruction. The killstreaks are interesting in MW2 in that you don't just acquire them, but rather you acquire a marker beacon that you have to toss into the map somewhere so a chopper can airdrop the reward to you. This means two things:1. The enemy can steal your reward if you're not careful.2. If you stand exactly where you throw the smoke marker, the reward will kill you as the crate drops on your head.Some of the killstreaks are controllable from a briefcase controller. For example the AC130 gunship, the chopper gunner and the predator missile. You're vunerable whilst you're doing this though so you need to find a hidey hole in each map where you think you can lie low for a minute or so without anyone finding you. From the other side of course, you can terminate almost any of the enemy killstreak rewards yourself, from finding them when they're lying low using the briefcase, to using anti-aircraft missiles against airborne threats like Harriers, choppers and UAVs. It all adds up to a much more logical feeling of playing the game.One thing which is nice with MW2 is that the attack helicopters and harriers with guns don't have the same 20/20 accuracy they did in COD4, meaning you don't necessarily need to hide when someone calls one in. They can shoot at you, but that doesn't mean they'll hit you. The only one to be truly wary of this time around is the Pavelow - the gunners (plural) in that thing do have unnerving accuracy.Special Ops modeMW2 introduces a new gameplay mode called Special Ops. These are short challenges set within maps from the single player game. You can play them on your own, with other people on the same PS3 as you, or networked with other players online. Special Ops games require tactics and actual teamplay, so far from the chaos of online play, in this mode if you don't actually plan the game, you'll be penalised for it. These levels range from the simplest running the training course in the shortest time possible, to more complex ideas like defending an area of the map with nothing more than a box of claymores and a sniper rifle. Special Ops mode takes a while to get into, but once you're familiar with the style of gameplay it demands, it adds a whole new dimension to the game.GraphicsThe graphics in MW2 are are good and bad as they ever were. Clearly most of the Hollywood-movie-like budget for this game went into level and asset design, although having said that, there's an obvious amount of re-use. For example the rusty blue air conditioner unit, the corrugated steel bus stop and the white box van from COD4 make a return (amongst others). The textures are detailed and rock solid, the level designs are clever and twisting. However the bad points of the graphics engine from COD4 are still present and annoying - you can see the change in level of detail on objects very clearly - ie. when they pop from a low level of detail to a high level of detail, the change is sudden and jarring and in some cases far too close to the eyepoint. For example in the Wasteland multiplayer map, the telegraph poles pop from a three-sided pole to an eight-sided pole right as you walk past them. The PS3 is capable of much better scene management than this and I suspect once again that limitations like this are there because the code is written to work on the lowest common denominator (in this case Xbox). Whilst many gameplayers will never notice stuff like this, it can be distracting enough when it happens to draw your eye to it, and in online games, that can be all it takes for the 6-year-old kid on the other team to find you and kill you. Stuff that has improved though is the detail in your own weapon. The weapons in MW2 make those in COD4 look almost cartoon-like in comparison now. There's a lot more depth to the detail and texture as well as moving parts such as straps. Altogether they look a lot more like real weapons this time around. Also the amount of \"stuff\" in the air - dust and dirt blowing around, butterflies in the flowers, paper and trash blowing around the streets - all this has been ramped up considerably from COD4 and it all helps create a much more immersive environment - you can properly believe the areas you're doing combat in are real places because they're used - worn and unclean like the real world.SoundsThe sound in MW2 is a vast improvement from COD4. The guns have a wide variety of different sounds now - much more varied than originally, and the bass has been turned up a little in most of the f/x. Whilst this is a bit Hollywood - a bit artistic license - it's no bad thing. The ACR assault rifle I'm sure doesn't have quite the punch-in-the-chest sound in the real world as it does in the game but I prefer it like that. In the real world, the sound is coupled to the feel of the gun and the recoil - neither of which you're going to get through a PS3 controller - so amping up the noise level is a nice substitute. In the same way that the graphics have added a lot more dirt and dust, the sound design has added a lot more ambient noises and effects, and if you're playing with a decent surround sound setup, the constant echoing distant gunfire in some levels is fantastic.Music-wise, there's a variety of ambient tracks that play at key points in the game - some to denote misery, hardship and despair, and others designed to get your pulse up for impending action. It's OK but music in a combat game is always going to be so-so at the best of times.The voice talent is middle of the road in MW2 with one particular quirk - most of the middle-eastern voices have a very distinct and obvious Scottish twang to them. At first I didn't notice it but playing the multiplayer games more and more, it's become very obvious that at least one of the voice artists is very Scottish.The bad bits with the online mode.The three biggest problems with online play from COD4 have not been fixed in MW2. These are:1. If you drop out of a game (for whatever reason) and go to find another match, MW2 still has a preference to putting you back into the game you just left. If you left because someone was hacking or you were just plain old being handed your backside on a plate, it's bloody irritating being dropped back into the same game.2. It still allows you to join games that are either 5 points from ending, or have just ended so you join and are then instantly kicked out to the lobby again.3. It lets you play massively one-sided games instead of timing out. For example if everyone else on your team leaves, you can (and will) end up in games where the opposing team has 8 or more players, and your team has 1 - you.Having said that, the one problem that was bigger than all others has been fixed. That is when the player who is hosting the game gets irritated at being constantly killed and leaves, no longer does MW2 simply kill the game. Instead, it now tries to migrate to another machine to carry on the match. Whilst this gives an interruption in gameplay, it's infinitely preferable to the hundreds of hours spent playing half a game in COD4.Three online tips for you:1. If you come across anyone with the [DooM] clan tag, drop out - those are almost certainly Infinity Ward developers who are using a myriad of developer backdoors (for example tactical nuke with zero kills, 5 seconds into the match). I don't know why they think anyone will play with them because everyone seems to know about it now - if you're in the pre-game lobby and a bunch of DooM players turn up, you'll just see everyone else leave instantly.2. If you come across anyone who is using the 'Ranger Akimbo' secondary weapon loadout, you might as well leave and find another match. Those are pirate-style double barrel blunderbus guns. When you trigger both together, you're effectively getting a 4-shotgun blast which is bizarrely accurate at long range and entirely unsurvivable. I played one match where the average kill score was 3 apart from the guy using Ranger Akimbo, who had 41 kills and one deaths. It's not cheating - it's entirely legitimate, but people who've earned this particular weapon and perk will be able to ruin your day, and do it very quickly.3. If you see someone running around carrying a Javelin missile launcher, do not shoot them. There is/was a game hack involving Semtex and the Javelin launcher that meant as soon as you shot someone using this hack, you and most of your team died instantly in a map-consuming explosion. I believe this has now been rectified in the 1.6 patch of the game.ConclusionSo should you buy MW2? If you're into the Call Of Duty games, then this is an obvious no-brainer. If you've never tried one before, then it's a great introduction to the series. It's easy to play and addictive - hideously so. And just to make you feel a tiny bit embarrassed about how addictive it is, there's a total gameplay timer available in the multiplayer barracks. This serves no other purpose than to let you know how many hours of daylight you've missed playing an utterly unmissable title.Why 4 stars and not 5?I'm still not sure the 5-star next generation game exists yet. 1-star ratings are typically from people with an axe to grind and 5-star ratings are typically from people so besotted with a game that they can't see any flaws in it. I think a 4-star rating is a reasonable achievement whilst we continue to wait for a game that will properly show off the PS3 in its true light.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2009"}

For others this will be a good thing that the action is different.The menus are very similar to the last years game with alot of the same match options.WWE Universe seems to be a little deeper this year and you can customize what titles, arena , and brand name you use for you show. For instance I put WCW instead of Smackdown.There is a ton of title belts and arenas in the game as well as the option to make your own arena. Problem being that the arenas  are glitchy, about 50% of the time half the ring canvas is blacked out.The new game engine has it's pluses and minuses I start with the positivesThe wrestlers move much smoother than in SD gamesthe match pacing is more realistic, you don't win a match in 2 minutes.The moves seem to be more dramatic and just look way better in general.The game just moves better and everything is more fluid.I really like the new submission system alot better.The negatives that I found in the actual wrestling in game is thatI don't really care for the control layout ( I believe this can be altered and I have not checked into any others yet so this may be moot).There seems to be less moves overall that your wrestler has at their disposal and I seem to pull off alot of the same moves over and over again. Especially early on in the match before you opponent gets groggy and are able to execute the bigger slams.Pin system seem hit and miss. Sometimes i hit the meter dead on and it still counts on me.Then there are somethings that are good and bad like the AI seem to be smarter and actually attacks appropriate to the situation for the most part. They still dont do a wide variety of things and the reversals are out of control this year.There is alot more that can be said but I just wanted to weigh in objectively for people who have not played the game because there is not many reviews up for it at this time and they one of them I saw was a 9/10 IGN and Game Informer gave it a very low score like 5.5/ 10.  I myself would give it a 8.5 out of 10. It is alot of fun and the new predator system is a step in the right direction IMO but the game also has it's fair share of glitches , none game breaking but some are pretty significant. It is different enough from the last smackdown game that if you are on the fence about buying it you may want to rent it first. I think some people may not like it do to the fact it is slower paced and more difficult.(update) I reloaded the game and haven't had any more issues with the ring shading and tearing problems.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

Note, the term eternal peace isn't written here. That's because the peace is far too short-lived. You hold fort at the Vigil's Keep as you seek to deal with a Darkspawn outbreak in the area of Amaranthine. You must recruit a group to assist you in battling your enemy (only one of which is a returning member of the original party you had). You have a raised level cap (I got as high as level 34 before I ended, so I don't know if the cap is 35 or non-existent) and a wealth of new, quite awesome talents and abilities.The plot is a bit hard to delve into without giving a lot of it away (though, to be honest, it is rather baffling to try and grasp unless one read the books...which I did not). Your party is quite well fleshed out, with Justice ending up as being one of the most memorable characters Bioware has yet to produce. The quest takes place over a lot less area than the original title does, but there is no lack of content and the add-on pack if one grinds through missions alone, will probably hit about 10 hours. But, there are side missions aplenty and many other distractions to drag things out longer.One of the big things the game introduces is that you have to try and keep the peace. Which means, you have to pick sides in domestic conflicts, which can lead to some rather difficult choices (feed the peasants, or allow them to ransack the granary and possibly starve everybody?). That they do give your character ample reputation in the realm is a nice touch. The game doesn't tend to draw itself too closely to the original title (you will run into some of your old allies here and there and everybody knows what you did earlier...but the game still feels really distinct from its original).You are also given the much-desired ability to re-spec yourself. Hate the build your character has? Pay 6 gold to a merchant, buy a Tome of Focus (or something like that) and you can reallocate everything. This helps a lot because you can easily pursue a path of development that doesn't work very well for you and, in the original, you couldn't do much about it. You have a lot of different abilities and some new classes as well. Unlike the original, you unlock all of the special classes by buying them at merchants and not via missions or the like.There are some issues. Bringing over loot from the original is really random as some stuff will be in your inventory and lots won't be and there is no explanation why some things are missing. Some of the major villains aren't explained at all in the story, which definitely hurts things. The big new ability, runecrafting, just seems like a tedious waste of time. Then again, I also thought poison-making and herbalism were bores in the original, so perhaps the issue is on this end.The biggest thing the game provides is the power to make one feel like a righteous bad dude. In this game, make no bones about it, you are brutally powerful if you want to be. You have talents and abilities to make yourself overwhelmingly strong against all but the mightiest enemies and it is rather enjoyable to be able to just slaughter several foes at a single time. Giving a warrior attacks that work over a large area definitely makes them quite valuable. Mages are still comically powerful, but such is life.DAO: A is well worth the $40 and a truly phenomenal expansion pack in a world where nobody seems to do them. It's not a sequel, but it's a nice addition with some really good changes to the original to make it well worth the investment of time and money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}

The computer's that assist you are not only good, they're BETTER than YOU!  Tired of the computers that destroy the realism by getting stuck on a chair or in a corner and then destroyed?  NOT in this game.  While the computer will never leave you behind (it's against their programming =) they will NEVER shoot you while shooting hundreds of zombies all around you with an M16, or even BETTER, sometimes the computer chooses the Sniper Rifle and with DEAD-Eye accuracy shoots zombies standing on buildings 200 yards away.A WELL programmed INCREDIBLY smooth game that just goes to show you, that like Blizzard Entertainment and Sid Meier's, Valve is one of the MOST trusted companies in the Video Sphere.WELL DONE VALVE!!NOW WE WANT MORE!!!

That's how good the game is.

Again! + Counter-Strike: Source beater","reviewText":"\"Call of Duty\" series lovers will eagerly want this after finishing the other WWII fps. COD3 did let down PC users as it was only available on console but COD4 makes up for it in aces. In 2004 the next best single player shooter to \"Half-Life 2\" was \"Call of Duty 1\". COD4 is up against some of the best games out there but whatever about the fabulous single player mode, the multiplayer destroys the competition.Needless to say COD4 brings us yet another fine sequel effort to rival anything else on the shelf. COD has firmly taken over where \"Medal of Honour: Allied Assault\" first got our attention in trying to recreate the \"Saving Private Ryan\" experience for us all. Instead of WWII though we get modern warfare and gosh it is good.The COD series is built on the same concept as MOH except there is more action, more high-octane moments and a very different type of enemy AI. COD4 has upgraded the enemy and platoon squad AI from COD2 so that your comrades can identify the enemy and instead of scripting each action sequence as in COD1, COD4 depends on AI so that a rerun of any level will play differently although the situations remain the same. COD4 maybe has the best storyline to date although you don't pilot and drive.COD4 retains all the cinematic intensity that its predecessor successfully claimed and even expands on each of the earlier episodes over the course of several different story arcs. You play as Marines and SAS. There are tons of very well designed missions. The smoke and explosion effects are absolutely photorealistic and have set a new benchmark for graphics quality. The environments and maps are genuinely war like all the way through and can not be faulted. The enemy AI and your own team AI are much more realistic than COD1 +2 and your team is very reliable. If you get too close to the enemy you can engage him in close quarter combat. Although Call of Duty 4 was never meant to be a war simulation, but more of a 1st person war adventure, to be honest, does exactly what it says on the tin.COD4 is more of an experience than a game. You will turn to it time and time again, however it is worth it for the experience of the single player missions alone let alone the stunning multiplayer where you can increase in rank and earn weapons and skills.COD4 lasts much longer than COD1+2 and OU, where COD1 had a 1.5 day game span and UO had 3, COD2 had a week this one can last longer. The pandemonium of war is all here in a spectacular fashion because the story is a winner as you play a mini version of what is happening right now in Iraq.Like COD1+2 you even feel loss at the end but for some reason the connection to your comrades in COD1 was a lot stronger because it was more scripted. Here your friends are replaced by mission leaders and specialists. That is my only gripe with it.Try to play it in Directx 10 (the standard for all the cutting edge new first person pc shooters) if you can. The new Geforce 8800 card handles this game well. If you don't have a very high end machine then you may want to hold off as the specs are pretty high. This war multiplayer has pretty much replaced Battlefield 2 and Counter-strike as the leader of the pack. COD has always been a contender for game of the year and COD4 is no exception.Pros:- Multiplayer- Cinematic gaming- Best new war game and a worthy 1st person shooter- Awesome war atmosphereCons:- Needs more friends and less experts in your team- High system specs","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0014ULQB2","reviewerName":"El Loro del Fuego","summary":"A ton of destruciton but not much else","reviewText":"I have been a red faction fan ever since the first game for the pc.  I loved the sequel as well.  The destructibility in those games set the standard for destructible environments in my opinion.I was excited to hear about another red faction coming out.  I was worried when I heard that it would be a third person shooter instead of a first person one like the last two. In some ways my fears got put to rest after playing through the game, but others were only realized.I start out by saying that this game is fun.  Right when you jump into the singleplayer game you get to experience the awesome destruction you can create with game's impressive destruction engine.  At first you just have a hammer and some charges.  You first just learn how to take away the base supports for some buildings and then watch them topple under their own weight.  Its an awesome sight to behold.  Especially since the buildings are structures that you could enter and explore beforehand. This is what the game does extremely well.  It puts plenty of tools in your hands and pretty much just lets you loose on the enemy and their base structures in a good sized open world.Yes, there is a story campaign set in this world but that is where this game starts to falter.  You see, this is just one of those stories that just gives you context for why you are blowing the crap out of everything.  You just go to a mission starter and then a guy tells you what to go and demolish.  That's fine by me, however since destroying things are a lot of fun.The fights are pretty intense in the game.  It can be fun but sometimes they get pretty frustrating.  If you stir up enough trouble with the enemy they will just send endless waves of guys to take you down.  It can get to be you against one hundred.  Your health does regenerate but if you can't get anywhere without enemies to let your health regenerate you experience a frustrating death.  This is one of those games where you get in, destroy, and get out as soon as possible.That being said, it is the biggest problem toward the end of the game.  The story gets kind of dumb and the missions get frustratingly hard.  You pretty much just get sent on a bunch of suicide missions toward the end of the game.The game runs well and looks pretty good for an openworld game.  There are a few bugs here and there, but nothing too bad.If you are a fan of the other red faction games then you may or may not like this game.  The story is a let down and doesnt live up to the standards of the previous games.  There is a ton of fun to be had, however, leveling huge structures to the ground.  Its some of the most destructive fun you can have in a game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2012"}

Taylor","summary":"SubHuman","reviewText":"I was foolish enough to doubt the countless bad reviews this game got. I figured I'd give it a fair shot.This game is bad. So bad that I will keep it short and sweet.Graphics:  I really could care less about graphics but I know it is a major selling point for some gamers.  Too Human has beautiful \"large\" environments.  I say \"large\" because the levels seem huge, with backgrounds that go on for days but you are basically confined to halway size paths that you run through and repetively slash at enemies.Character equipment designs are gorgeous.  Facial textures look laughable on some characters though.  Mainly Baldur himself.Sound:  Sound along with equipment design are the only 2 stars I will give this game.  The musical score is good and so are the sound effects.Controls: The right-thumbstick controls are controversial.  I see what the designers were trying to do and in fact the combat controls seem to work, however a totally broken lock on system breaks the controls.  You will litteraly have a GIANT 2 feet in front of you.  Tilt the thumbstick in front of you and there's a good chance you will forego this behemoth to target some random midget that is minding his own business 600ft away.  This is inexcusable. This problem is compounded with a horrible camera system.  Forget about using the default camera and pull back to ISO mode. Even ISO mode, however, cannot save you from camera seizures that happen when you try to turn a corner or even turn a 180.Gameplay: Ok this is where I could rant forever but I will try to be brief.- Game is made of only 4 ungodly massive levels.- Combat is broken by the camera and lock-on system- Character classes are totally unbalanced.  Certain classes are dying machines.  Imagine playing an MMO, where every class has a purpose in a team concept but there is no team, only you (maybe one friend online)- Speaking of online, it is broken as well.  The enemies level to the highest lvl character in the group. So.. I got my game a week before my friend.  I reached level 35 he was lvl 15.  We figured the game would find a happy medium to scale the baddies to. WRONG!!  Every creature was lvl 38+. Resulting in my friend dying every 2 secs.- Pointlessly boring cyberspace quests.- Bosses have way too much health( GARN especially)Story:  The story is pretty bland with bad voice acting and dialogue.+ For choosing Norse mythology instead of Greek or something else that's been run into the ground.- For choosing Baldur as the main character when you have Thor and Tyr as supporting characters.  Baldur is so sissified that his mother had to beg everything in creation not to kill her son but he ends up dying at the hands of the only thing she thought harmless enough not to ask.... MISTLETOE.  :(- The story could be compeling but nothing is explained.  The designers must have figured that Norse mythology is the #1 religion in the world and everyone knows it like the back of their hands.  Nothing is explained only refered to.  Characters are introduced with little to know backstory.  The story in this game basically sucks because of presentation.So on a final note, there is a lot of complaining about the death scene.  It is there to mask the loading/game over screen you would see in any other game.  I actually think this is a good idea.  The bad part of it is that  you will die so many times in this broken game that you will see the valkyrie animation 100+ times.For the love of God, if this did not detour you from playing this game at least rent it and judge for yourself.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2008"}

This is probably the most fun I've had with a sand box game ever.  There's nothing quite as satisfying as spending a little time in Paris circa the 1940's making life completely miserable for the Nazis.  Even long after I had completed all of the main story missions and tackled the easier side missions-I still wanted to keep playing.  This really is a darn fun game.  Luckily, there are over 1000 \"bonus\" targets players can tackle during and after the main story, as well as \"perks\" you can work on as well.One of the few downsides to the game for me was the combat.  I know it's not wholly necessary to spend a lot of time on combat, but this is one element that could have and should have been implemented better.  It's clunky at best.  Also, the ability to disguise yourself as a Nazi and sneak into Nazi strongholds is a good idea in theory, but about 90% of the time you get about three feet inside the perimeter, the jig is up for no apparent reason, the alarm is sounded and all bets are off.  After a while  when I finally discovered that being cautious just didn't pay, I would just run like hell-popping Nazi's off before they could kill me.  The sloppier I played, the faster I seemed to advance.  Go figure.  I think however that one mission in particular REQUIRES the Nazi disguise-as I could not complete it any other way.Regardless of a few minor flaws, this game is not to be missed.  With it being bargain priced and a lot of bang for your buck, there's no reason not to pick this up.  I had a lot more fun with this than Call of Duty World at War.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2011"}

They couldn't have nailed it any better than that. The game begins with Wolverine's arrival in New York city to rescue a young mutant, Magma, who's being hunted by the Brotherhood of Mutants. Saving her sets a series of events in motion that lead to a cataclysmic battle of epic X-Men proportions. Legends lets you play as 4 of 15 classic X-Men(including my favorites: Gambit, and Nightcrawler)on a huge quest that will take up easily 30 hours of your life, depending on your skill level. While not perfect by any means, Legends is a meaty action RPG that will almost certainly please fans of the X-Men or of these types of games. Graphically, the game sports a cel-shaded look to give it that comic-book feel and, while it doesn't impress visually, it serves its' purpose in bringing things in the X-Men Universe to life. Control is very good for this type of game. It's all about battling, anyways, and battling here is fun and addictive all the way throughout. The game truly showcases what has made the comics great for three decades. I applaud Raven Software on doing such an excellent job on the game. You can tell Raven are fans of the comics, themselves.

{"product_name":"B00000I1BR","description":"Let me go on record and say that I was never a fan of the original Crash Bandicoot. Even though Crash was disarmingly cute and fuzzy, and even though the game's graphics were just about as good as they got in those days, the frustrating design of the game made playing it such a painful experience that I still have flashbacks when I see small marsupials on the Discovery Channel. But just one short year after his debut, Crash is back in a sequel that is so far superior to the original that I'm willing to forget the mistakes of the past.The new storyline is simple: A very gullible Crash is corralled into collecting crystals for the evil Dr. Cortex and gems for the terrible N. Brio. There are 25 levels in all; each level contains an easy-to-find crystal and hard-to-earn gems. Instead of being forced to approach the game in a strictly linear fashion, you progress through a series of five warp rooms. Each warp room contains five levels, which you are free to tackle in any order. After you have found the crystals in each level, you can progress to the next warp room. This system of warp rooms is a great innovation; it's clear how to progress in the game, and yet you have the option of moving to a different level if you're hopelessly frustrated with one area. Best of all, you can save your game in the warp room at any time (a big improvement over the original game's horrific save system).A lot of variety is packed inside this game. You'll navigate through simple run-and-jump areas, try to outrun a very mad polar bear, work your way through sewer systems, and even fly around with a jet pack. Within each level, the basic gameplay is similar to the original Crash: Running, jumping, and spinning are still the order of the day. Even though most levels are set in a semi-3D environment, Crash Bandicoot 2 is a platform game, plain and simple. The graphics are in a league of their own among PlayStation games, and the music couldn't be better. Unlike the original, Crash 2 is rarely frustrating enough to make you want to throw your controller at the TV. In fact, some expert gamers might find Crash to be a little on the easy side.There are only two real problems with Crash Bandicoot 2. First, the semi-3D setup is sometimes hard to navigate, and you'll find yourself missing jumps because you're unable to judge distances properly. Secondly, the game is just plain cheap at times; in some areas you must sacrifice many lives until you memorize a level's layout.In any event, these problems are balanced out by the game's excellent gameplay and intelligent design. Crash Bandicoot 2 is a topnotch platform game. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this title out. -- John Broady--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Both versions (Sega & Nintendo) have pros and cons....Here's SNES'....Pros: The graphics are much more accurate to the arcade than the Genesis version.The sound is better & more clear/sharp than the Genesis version.It has all characters (as does Sega's)Cons: No bloodNo fatalities exact as the arcade versionThe controls aren't horrible, however, they feel a bit delayed or stiff.Overall it's still a fun game for the SNES & for the nostalgia of it. The game has obviously aged since it's release 20yrs ago. Still cool though....Best played with a friend or family member. I'd say this is worth picking up for farely cheap. MK2 is where SNES incorporated the blood and fatalities like the arcade.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2012"}

Dean \"John\"","summary":"Another awesome edition","reviewText":"LBP 1 has been my son's favorite video game, even more than halo or mario kart.  It's the one thing we always go back to.  And it's the only reason I bought the PS3.  For that one game.  And I never felt ripped off, since it was worth it, the game is so enjoyable on so many levels, especially with a young child.  And it's still the only game I have for the PS3, until now.This one just takes it to the next level.I love the grapples.  So much more playability and complexity now.My 7 year old had an initial rough time mastering them, but is happy with them now.Graphics are ramped up, better views in many places, and the changed types of gameplay are just awesome.  I can't wait to see what kind of levels people end up making with this engine.  We only got about half way through the first game's levels, since we spent all our time online searching for fun things.Others have gone into great detail about the pros and cons for the collector's edition.  My .02 is that the sackboy is cool, but my mother already made my son a couple of foot tall sackboys, so the smaller, stiffer one in here wasn't something I planned on him glomming onto anyway.  I'm planning on hanging him from the rear view mirror of my smart car as my \"navigator\".The book ends are alright, but again, not very well made.  Like a very firm foam, about the consistency of balsa wood inside, covered by the colored paper with the designs printed on it.  But part of the charm of them is that they are very much like the game itself, the pod - kind of made to look like it was cardboard and such.As others have said, the DLC is where it was at.  I wanted the extras that will only come with this, since my son loves changing all the costumes he can.So for the extra $20 for the bookends, figure, and costumes and such, for me was well worth it.Now back to the game, and looking forward to all the hours of enjoyment it's going to bring both of us.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Mark Carson","summary":"Make no mistake, this is an excellent game.  However","reviewText":"How could anyone who loves this series not have sat down to play UC3 with incredibly high expectations? Count me squarely among those who could not wait for this game. To be fair, it is a great game and takes its place solidly in Uncharted lore. But it reminds me of the review I wrote a long while back for Bioshock 2 I titled, \"A great game that buckles a bit under the weight of its predecessor.\" Truer words could not be spoken about UC3. For all it does right, it makes some missteps that surprised me given the overall leap in quality from UC1 to UC2.Pros:- As always, excellent production values...this game is beautifully presented; graphics, voice acting, music, etc do not disappoint- The portions of the story that were more character centered were well done and added unexpected depth- Outstanding action set pieces- Some nicely done puzzles during the game's first half- Melee is likely a source of debate, but once acclimated I thought the system was overall an improvement- Multiplayer, while not really a selling point for me, is nevertheless a fun additionCons:- The overall \"quest\" part of the story breaks down a bit over the last few hours, including what I felt were some re-hashed ideas from UC2 (trying to remain as spoiler-free as possible so will not go into detail)- Some \"different\" sections of gameplay felt a little out of place and almost like space filler as much as anything- For some odd reason the clever puzzles of the first half were largely abandoned in latter stages of the game- For me, a few of the gunplay sections seemed noticeably more difficult than many in the other games, quite a few frustrating deaths- Some parts of the \"endgame\" battles felt a bit anti-climactic to me- Have to say it, unfortunately...noticeably shorter in length than UC2Despite these issues, I have still given UC3 five stars and still feel it is a worthy addition to any player's collection. This series IMHO is the quintessential single player experience of this generation, and this game does nothing to tarnish that for me. I was very happy to get a new Uncharted game so soon, but cannot help but wonder if UC3 could have benefitted from a longer development cycle as I think it certainly could have benefitted from some extra polish. All in all, I would say I prefer it over UC1, but UC2 is still my undisputed favorite game on the PS3 (as well as one of my favorites of all time).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2011"}

I waited all day, finally it came, I hooked it up and it ran great. I bought three games for it an started playing all of them.The second day started some issues with connecting to my HDTV. It would say \"no connection\". Then a week or less later it would freeze up, make a horrible noise and shutdown or restart just after a few minutes of gameplay. It also did this out of the games, just if I was sitting at the main PS4 menu. Now it's completely locked up and I can't turn it on and there is no video or audio at all. Luckily I was able to get in and delete my user settings and profile before it completely bricked up on me. Amazon said they have replacements, so I'll be sending my bricked up unit back and be getting a replacement.So, my PS4 symptoms are:Power issuesVideo connection issuesFreezing, jolting and just shutting downFinny noises coming from the unitBesides that, the system is amazing. I played Killzone, Assassin's Creed and CoD Ghosts. All looked and ran amazing! Short loading times and I love the controller. The touchpad is a really nice feature.Everyone with a system should we cautious of these issues as I didn't start having major issues until a week later. Also, Sony says the power issues effected like 1-4% of the one-million systems sold. So others should not be discouraged from purchase the system based off a few issues. I'm a PlayStation user all the way and I must say this system is amazing and they did everything right.Highly recommended!*UPDATE*I received my new PS4 system from Amazon the next business day. I hooked everything up and it's working great! The first thing I noticed was that it is quieter than my defective system, which makes me think it was an issue with the power supply, possibly over-heating. Just like the PS3, the PS4 saved my trophies, however I lost all my game install information, saves, and updates. over-all I am very happy with Amazon's speed to get me a replacement, they paid for shipping back of my old unit, and I'm just happy my new system works.***UPDATE*** 26 May 2014My PS4 just started a new issue this past weekend. During gameplay, or whenever a disc is in the system, the PS4 will beep and just kick it out. I looked it up and many others have also had this issue. I will be contacting Sony for a replacement or repair. It has been perfect since my first replacement, now it looks like I will be going to my 3rd PS4. The PS4 is still and will always be an amazing system, despite the little issues I have had. Remember, the flame which burns twice as bright only burns half as long. I will keep this review updated once I have more information.****UPDATE**** The ejecting of the disc on my PS4 is due to the little rubber foot directly below the eject button. This rubber foot pushes up on the button ejecting anything you have in there. To fix it, I simply pulled a piece of the rubber foot back and folded it under the PS4. If I had this standing vertically, I may not have had this issue as the rubber wouldn't be compressed. Regardless, the issue is fixed and that is how to correct it if you have similar issues.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

It was the time of PS2 and XBox, and I have not played a Nintendo game in several years now.I bought my youngest son a Nintendo DS not long ago - and this was one of the games I got him for it.Unlike most nostalgic feelings - this has been a real treat to revisit this part of my childhood.  My son was playing it, and asked me to get him past a certain part.  I was immediately hooked and continued playing until I had beat several more levels.  Since then I have been grabbing his DS at every opportunity and playing further along - and am about halfway through the game so far.It is classic Mario - if you ever played any of the original games you'll know the score - however new music, some new moves (downward slams, wall jumping, etc.) as well as delightful moments such as getting the super big mushroom which makes Mario as tall as the screen - while you laugh like crazy and burst through everything - walls, blocks, enemies, etc. like King Kong on crack add a whole new depth to the game - and keep the 80's classic fresh in its newest form.  If you grew up on the old games like I did - you will squeal with delight when you see a new enemy that was only in a select level or two from one of the older games - that brings the memories back fresh.I am extremely pleased at how such a classic character can be brought back in a fresh new way - and invigorate this franchise which is still going strong after two, nearly three decades.I had absolutely no interest in the Nintendo DS and only bought my son one because he had been really good this year.

I've played Persona (which I had mixed feelings about), and Persona 3 FES (which I also had mixed feelings about), so initially, I had doubts about purchasing this game. However, it blew me away: it was SO good that after beating it, I turned around and played it again, simply to see all of the elements of the story fit together.But enough; let's get to the meat of the review:THE GOOD:1) Characters - I have never enjoyed the characters in a video game as much as I enjoyed the foul-mouthed high school kids of Persona. Excellent voice work, together with excellent translation, made for a one-of-a-kind experience. I actually cared about these characters, and that's amazing.2) Story - very good for a video game. And when you think you've seen everything, there's more yet to see.3) Mechanics - everything that was broken in Persona 3 (combat, social links, etc.) is fixed in Persona 4. Kudos to the development team for working to improve the great ideas from the previous games.4) Persona compendium - Yeah, I might be a little geeky here, but the compendium information acted as an excellent introduction to many religions, angelic lore, etc. While this was present in earlier games, I really grew to appreciate it here, since it was far more reasonable to complete it.5) Extras - I really liked the art book sent with the game. In theory, I would have liked the CD as well, but see below.THE BAD:1) Music - easily the most annoying music I've ever heard. It pained me to listen to it, over and over.2) Dungeon design - The dungeons are repetitive. It's not as pronounced as Tartarus in P3:FES, but it's still annoying.That's it. So in short, if you can get past the horrible music, prepare yourself for a wholly immersive RPG experience. I can count only a few times that a game has been this satisfying.Happy Gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2009"}

It's time to move on to the next level.","reviewText":"Are you ready for an addiction that will grab you and never let go? I  sure hope so, because if you get this game then that's exactly what will happen.I am a big fan of all of Harmoix's music games. I enjoyed Frequency and Amplitude very much... the only problem was that I beat those games to death. I started to grow tired of rapidly pushing three buttons on a controller. Well, a short time ago a game called Guitar Hero was born. I was reluctant to plunk down the $70.00 at first, but everytime I went to the electronics store I would see that big box staring at me. Finally I gave in and went ahead and purchased the game. Boy am I glad I did!Inside the box you get a game, and one of the coolest controllers ever devised... the Gibson SG controller. This is a guitar shaped control with five buttons on the top of the neck. Also this controller has a functional whammy bar, which adds yet another cool dimension to this game.Here's how the game works.Notes will come streaming down a conveyor-belt and you have to hit the button that corresponds with the note as it crosses a threshold. The more notes you miss, the further your \"life meter\" goes down. If your life meter goes all the way down in the red zone (there are three zones, red, yellow, green) then the crowd will start booing. For every ten notes you successfully hit in a row, a multiplier goes up. The multiplier maxes out at 4X (unless you use star-power, more on that in a sec). Once you progress through the game, it gets much more difficult to hit every note and by the time you hit the expert skill level you will literally be hitting just about every note in the song (including all of the guitar solos). On the earlier skill levels you don't hit nearly all of the notes in a song, but you still get a good sense of actually playing that song. Also as you progress, you will start to play chords, which is when you have to hit two notes at the same time. Some notes you are able to hold (there is a visual indicator for this, you will know which notes you can hold). These notes allow you to use the whammy bar to create cool effects in your music. When you hit star-shaped notes your star-power meter will fill up. If you use the whammy bar on the star shaped notes that allow for it, that also raises your star power a little bit. Once you get this meter half way full you can raise your guitar vertically to active star power. When this happens the crowd screams, the notes turn blue and you get 2X the score you would normally have, which makes it so you can have up to an 8X multiplier going for a short time. Also while your in star power mode it's much easier to get your life meter back into the green zone. There are advanced techniques you can use such as hammer-ons and pull-offs. Did I mention that there is a strum bar which is the bar used for picking? The strum-bar works on both down-strokes and up-strokes. The better you can do on these songs, the more money you earn. With money you can unlock new characters, guitars, guitar skins, songs and videos which show you some behind the scenes footage of this game and how it was made.Also worth mentioning is the multiplayer mode which lets you challenge your skills against a fellow guitar hero. In this mode you both play the same song, but you alternate solos.There are 47 songs total (well, unless you have a gameshark, then you can unlock an insanely difficult song called Trippoli), but 47 for the rest of us. All of the music is produced extremely well. 30 of the songs are high quality licensed cover songs, the other 17 are bonus songs which you've never heard (most are really good though! Even Rats is my favorite) You get to jam Deep Purple, Jimi Hendrix (Spanish Castle Magic), The Ramones (I Wanna Be Sedated), Pantera (Cowboys from Hell), Megadeth (Symphony Of Destruction), Audioslave (Cochise) and many others.This game is extremely fun. I can't get enough of it. I have beat every single song on every difficulty level (including all of the bonus songs) and I still can't get enough, it's just so fun! If the only thing stopping you from getting this game is the high price then I would suggest you bite the bullet and purchase anyways. You will NOT regret it.Graphics: 8/10:The venus and characters are nice, especially the character animations, but there is nothing jaw-dropping in this department. Who cares though, you won't see anything but a bunch of notes flying at you anyways!Sounds: 10/10This is a music-based game which has hit the sweet spot as far as song selection and quality. The crowd noises are also a nice touch, you feel great when they are cheering and you feel bad when they are booing.Fun: 10/10I really have a hard time believing that games can get much funner then this. This game is amazing!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2006"}

The only appeal the Soul Calibur series ever had for me was the appearance of Link in the GC version of SC2.  So, when Soul Calibur 3 came out, I wasn't terribly excited.That was, until I saw a friend play it.I know that a lot of people take issue with the single player modes of this game, but I find them to be quite enjoyable.  The main campaign (Tales of Souls) is relatively short, which makes it easy to go through it several times to explore some of the different branching paths each characater can take (which will in turn unlock various things).The pseudo-RPG/tactical campaign, Chronicles of the Sword, lacks a lot of depth, but you can't tell me that you don't feel awesome creating your own character, levelling it up, and unlocking new and more interesting weapon disciplines for it (up to and including the weapons the main characters use).  This is also how you unlock the character creation parts, which adds a little more motivation for playing this campaign.There's also a \"mission\" mode which is full of minigames like \"turntable\" (where you're on a spinning disk and the idea is to ring out your opponent) or \"soul smash\" (where you deal damage to an opponent by smashing them into the walls).  This provides some quick amusement and quick gold which can be spent on more weapons or items.As far as the fighting mechanics themselves go, I find that SC3 manages to balance special moves with combo attacks very well.  I find it difficult to memorize long strings of buttons to pull of that sweet move, so I appreciate the fact that there are a good many two-button combinations which deal decent damage in every character's move set.Overall, I find all of this combined with SC's solid weapon-based fighting mechanics creates a really enjoyable game for even those who don't like this genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2005"}

It's actually quite fun, strategizing your order of attack and spinning into action!Your favorite characters of Star Fox are in trouble, and need to a series of enemies. First, you get the overall top-down map screen. Each character's ship can fly a certain amount of distance in a turn - simply draw a line to say where they go. Use the stylus to wipe out some of the 'fog of war', and your main ship can shoot missiles. You only have a certain number of turns available, so plan your movements wisely.When your ship encounters an enemy ship, you switch into real time combat. In this mode, you drag your stylus around on the bottom screen to \"steer\" while the top screen shows you where you're flying. You fly through rings to get power-ups, and shoot at enemies (with the D-pad on the left) to fire. It really is quite intuitive - no up/down, left/right issues. Simply drag your stylus as the ship flies. You spin your stylus in a circle to do the classic barrel roll, and there are two easy-access spots to tap to do a U-turn or a loop.I love space combat, and it was really fun to have this type of game available on a handheld. I kept expecting to put the game down after a mission - but I'd say \"just one more ...\" and keep going. Note that these missions aren't easy! Expect to have to replay some of them several times to get through. You do have to learn the strategies and tactics of three dimensional combat.The game expects you to go through a single pass rather quickly - but the beauty is that you then go back and re-play it, now having new options available at every stage. Instead of just contacting Slippy, now you have other choices you can do instead that are more difficult. You choose at each step what to do, and it affects the types of missions you take on and the endings you get to see. Think of it as built in difficulty levels.A key element of space combat games are the visuals - with you trying to move and think real time in three dimensions, it's critical that you can see the terrain, your enemies, and anything else that might get in the way. While the DS graphics in general are nice, it wasn't always easy to see what you were fighting. The graphics were sometimes unclear - the ship's faded graphic would blend right in to the background's faded graphic.Also, your ship is right in the center of the screen, and takes up a fair amount of it. This makes it challenging if you're right behind a ship, to see it. Surely they could have given you an in-cockpit view or at least a transparent ship.For vocals, they give you the high pitched gibberish that means it's perfect for all languages. No need to do new vocal tracks for this game! Still, in modern times, it would be nice to have a regular vocal track available. It adds a whole additional dimension of enjoyment when you have great voice actors bringing life to the characters.Still, this is a superb game for the DS, and one I really enjoy. Well recommended!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2006"}

But this year, they really took a giant leap forward.  This is the best Madden since the Super Nintendo days.  What makes it a great installment are the much improved graphics, the increased AI, the improved running game, the more realistic pass defense, and the SLIDERS!!Most of all the sliders.  You can change any aspect of the game, on both sides of the ball.  You can even change the speed of the game if you want to see each play develop more slowly, so play action passes actually have the potential to work for a change.  My favorite slider is the \"speed threshold\".  This widens the gap between slow lineman and quick running backs.  No longer will Adrian Peterson be caught from behind by a defensive end.  You can really see the ratings and differences in players shine through this year.  If you have your third string QB in the game, he will struggle with accuracy.  Good runners break tackles, and good linebackers make tackles.  You will actually notice an improved awareness on star players.Injuries are much improved as well this year.  If your QB has a sore elbow, you make the decision to play him or not at his dimished ability.  You have control over every single aspect of this game.  If you don't like it out of the box, tweak it to perfection.  EA finally gave the player full control to make the game the way THEY want it.  I'm in my third season of franchise mode and I the only possible complaint I can offer is that in one game I had three kickoffs run back against me. But A) it never happened again and B)  my special teams is horrible.  It took awhile but they nailed it this season.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1R2","description":"Conker's Bad Fur Dayis for adults, the ESRB has rated thisgame Mature; it should not be bought for--or played by or around--children. That stated, the story of the game is the following: Conker's verygoodnight turns into a very bad day. He has to deal with a crazy and abusive world, all while suffering through a massive hangover. Conker encounters abusive paint pots; jabbering dung beetles; trigger-happy, scar-faced Tediz; and a belligerent giant, with only a frying pan as a means of self-defense. He is resourceful, however, and makes the best of his situation. The game combines elements of 3-D exploration, combat, and puzzle solving. It features cinematic cutscenes, movie parodies, facial expressions, dozens of unhinged characters, and 1- to 4-player deathmatch games in a variety of styles.","reviewerName":"ajnrules \"ajnrules\"","summary":"One of the greatest games for the Nintendo 64!","reviewText":"Nintendo's reaction towards Conker's Bad Fur Day is a bit ambiguous. Conker's Bad Fur Day made headlines among the gaming industry when advertisements for this game appeared in Playboy and Maxim. I mean, this is a Nintendo 64 game! However, Nintendo had completely denied the game's existence in anything where people 17 or younger could access. Is it really that much worse than, say, Shadow Man or South Park 64, both of which received ample coverage from Nintendo Power and yet both of which had foul language and violence up the wazoo? It is hard to say (especially considering that I have barely played Shadow Man or South Park 64). Still, everybody I know that hates this game hates it not for its gameplay, but just the fact that the mad scientists in Twycross turned Conker from a cuddly, high-pitched squirrel with bland textures to a gruff squirrel with a penchant for beer, breasts, and 'bacco. (Accusations have been made that Conker had become rather foul-mouthed himself, but with only two swear words I know of, Conker's language is much tamer than those around him.) Still, CBFD is a welcome respite from the Rare platforming formula of collection and cute characters (you've got some darned ugly things in Conker's Bad Fur Day)...and when only one word that would have been censored from NSider was spoken.Conker's Bad Fur Day is a linear adventure game, where the completion of tasks in one area allows you to progress further into an adventure. You know...kind of like Ocarina of Time! Except in CBFD, A is your jump button, and B is the context sensitive button. With Ocarina of Time, the purpose of the context sensitive A button changes depending on the context, B in CBFD usually access the frying pan. The context only changes in the presence of a B-button pad or when a light bulb appears. This does kind of make the game feel forced, as if Rare is saying, \"Roar! This is what you have do at this time! There's nothing you can do to change it!\" Still, the levels and the situations have enough variety where you do not feel bogged down. The single-player mode is pretty short, but it is fun, funny, and full of strange situations that feel more like different episodes instead of a coherent, linear plot. It is strange to go from fighting a boss battle against a mound of anthropomorphic feces to a prehistoric world. But alas, such is the situation poor Conker must go through. Gameplay is also as varied as the storyline. While most of the game is platforming, there are times when the game switches to a Jet-Force-Geminiesque 3rd person shooter or a twisted racing game. Independent of the single-player adventure is the game's multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode is as fun and incoherent as the single-player mode. You can race on hoverboards, escape the wrath of the Tediz as unarmed civilians, or go at it in several types of free-for-all deathmatches. Some modes are stale, but others are delicious and can provide hours of entertainment.Even without the Expansion Pak, Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of the best games for the Nintendo 64 visually and aurally. By 2001, Rare had already established themselves as being very ambitious with graphics (so much as to cause severe slowdown, but that doesn't appear very often in CBFD), and Conker's Bad Fur Day is one of their best efforts. Everything has such wonderful textures, and even though some of the flowers and stuff are obviously sprites, they aren't as bad as in some other games. Rare has gone on to give Conker lip synching even more accurate than those found in Dreamcast's Shenmue, although everybody else move their lips in a way that resemble the animal characters in Mononoke Hime. Voice acting in Conker's Bad Fur Day tops Perfect Dark and Star Fox 64 to become the best on the Nintendo 64. This is perhaps aided by some of the best writing ever to appear in a N64 game. Virtually every line is quotable, especially the Great Mighty Poo song. Sound effects are truly awesome, but it definitely does not hold a candle to the game's music. Conker's Bad Fur Day has some of the best music of all time. The songs are amazingly catchy, and well-done. And when was the last time a piece of music had farts as part of the melody? If games were ranked on a technical scale, then Conker's Bad Fur Day would definitely be near the top.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2001"}

It's also cool that you can play with several different characters with different stuff there good at.

Well, Capcom finally delivered they're much hyped and promised online RE game with Resident Evil: Outbreak.  Taking place in the zombie infested Raccoon City, you control one of eight ordinary people; each has his or her own skill that can be put to good use in various situations as you run and gun your way to escape the city.  The gameplay elements are basically identical to those of the previous game in the long running series, although there are some differences.  The control scheme has been changed for the better, meaning you can now run in different directions without having to hold down a shoulder button.  However, Outbreak has plenty of it's own frustrations.  When playing offline, your AI controled allies perform acts which range from helping keeping you alive to doing some non-sensical and almost stupid acts.  When playing online, you are joined by three other players, and the game is seperated by five episodic chapters.  Where the game is really hurt is where the series has always had it's strengths: the storyline is almost non-existant, and the characters aren't much to care for.  There are still loads of CG movies and unlockable costumes and such, but nothing else much in terms of replay value besides the online capability.  The graphics are solid, and the score manages to give the game a creepy atmosphere, but one can't help but wonder what a marvel of a game this could have been.  Outbreak is still more than worth a look for fans of the series and survival horror in general though, and the online capability makes this definitely worth a look.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","reviewerName":"Dennis Laycock","summary":"I was not disappointed....","reviewText":"....but this game does have a few flaws that put it a little below Mario Kart 64.First, the good:  The track design is *amazing* and greatly improved from Kart 64.  The track in Wario Coliseum is impossibly twisted, and DK Mountain, the best track, has a cannon to shoot you to the top of the mountain, and you fly back down.  I also liked Baby Park for its simplicity - it's just an oval, but it's so small that you're constantly switching places with your friends, and there are weapons ricocheting everywhere during the seven (!) laps.Some of the other tracks have interesting premises (Daisy Cruiser, which is set on a cruise ship), but they're not quite as fun as they should be.  Other tracks are blatant rip-offs of the previous games... we get yet another rainbow track, Bowser's castle, a dirt-bike track, a jungle, a beach, a desert, etc.  How about switching things up a little?  How about a track on the moon, or a roller coaster, or a funhouse, or in a level from another Mario game?  See how easy that is, Nintendo?One thing about the tracks I do appreciate is that many of them have &quot;zippers&quot; that give you a boost of speed.  Only a couple of tracks in the last version had these.The two-characters-to-a-cart aspect works well... you can hold two weapons and switch depending on which one you need.  Although it's quite hard to reach the Z-button to switch characters while you're playing.  I also think the slide technique is not as effective in this game as it was last time.  Neither are some of the weapons.  The new bomb would be an excellent weapon; unfortunately, when you toss it forward, it always explodes when you're right next to it.  You should be immune to your own bombs.The new special, character-specific weapons are great, and the giant banana peel is hilarious.  I find it very annoying that you can't tap the brake after you hit a banana peel to stop from spinning out, as you could in the last game.  I like having a choice of many cars, as well.Some players will be angry that they cannot access four of the tracks until they pass the final level on the medium difficulty.  This is not an easy thing to do; I'm a veteran Nintendo player and it took me about a dozen tries before I could do it.  Although I do like the new point system for the tournaments that gives even the 7th-place finisher a point.The battle modes, which some people consider the heart of the Kart games, did disappoint me.  They aren't the slightest bit creative or interesting like the main tracks, and the variations are kinda stupid.  Amazing that the battle mode keeps getting less fun the more advance the graphics get in these games... or is it that it's just played out?  Nah, I don't think so.Overall, this is a great game, with outstanding graphics, fun sound effects and music and great replayability, especially with multiple players.  But when you're making a sequel to some of the most popular video games of all time, you've gotta be perfect.... at least to get my five-star rating. ;)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001BX6JUA","reviewerName":"Robin Solsj Hglund","summary":"The best and final music rhythm game","reviewText":"Yes, it's almost time forRock Band 3, the game that will change music rhythm gaming forever, with Pro-Mode bridging the gap between plastic button-mashing and playing actual chords on a stringed electric guitar. That will surely prove the be all and end all of music games; the only one you'll ever need, which makes the others look archaic in comparison, especially considering you'll be able to export all the songs from the first two games over to it, and can still enjoy all the hundreds of downloadable songs you've amassed so far. But for now, Rock Band 2 is the crowning achievement of music gaming; the music is fantastic (just to listen to), very varied, doesn't feel dusty, and there's even a song like \"Visions\" by Abnormality in there (and \"Hammer Smashed Face\" by Cannibal Corpse (!!) as downloadable content) for all you extreme metalheads.The only downside to Rock Band 2 is that the \"realistic\" aim comes with a price; conquering the game's Expert mode is a pipe dream for most of us; unless you've been naturally gifted or happen to live in a cellar with Rock Band 2 as your only way to engage the senses and maintain the presence of life for all eternity. With that being said, a \"normal\" player that keeps on playing and progressing can make it through about 70 or 80% of all songs on Expert without failing, but will have to step it down to Hard for those infernally absurd death metal songs and crazy solos. (It's also a shame that the Guitar Hero World Tour-guitar's slider pad doesn't work in the Rock Band-games, which might've actually helped one immensely with the harder songs).Harmonix is a studio that's trying to make the experience more real and immersive; they listen to their fans (yes, they quite literally listen to your opinions and try taking them into account when making DLC or improving their games), and they've built up an enormous network of downloadable songs with HUGELY varied artists (that amazingly go seamlessly into the actual game progression itself) as well as the Rock Band Network; where fans and amateur bands themselves (with the right tools and conditions) can add and sell their own music to users of the game, making for a living market of possibilities, and something that goes far beyond just a \"party game\". Harmonix know what it's all about; giving anyone at all, no matter what age, gender or background, the feeling (and skill) of performing their favourite (rock) songs to a cheering audience. Without the pressure of sex or drugs, groupies, hangovers, expenses, fatigue, new albums, piracy or a bad night for the vocalist. You're the star, and with the right friends and songs, that's actually what it feels like. The only difference is you're playing along, not producing any actual music. But most of us are just fine riding on the coattails of true artists when it's this much fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2010"}

It really does make it pretty awesome now that I can virtually control everything with this one remote control. I now only use my PS3 control when I want to play a video game instead of using it to control all the functions on Netflix and any movie I watch.For the price, this device is pretty awesome.

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Leonard","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"First off, if you have any problems with violent video games then you may want to skip this one.  Because this game is nothing but violence and some other, more mature, things (Aphrodite).  I haven't played the first two games in the series, but this one references stuff that happened in the previous ones.I enjoyed this game a lot more than I did Dante's Inferno.  This one seems to hold true to a hack and slash, instead of intricate puzzles.  Although, since I really suck at timing, I died more in the jump/run + jump/jump + hook + jump + hook portions of the game.  It reminds me of Castlevania on the NES a little.I don't know if it was my controller (doubtful, since it's only a month old), double jumps in this game became iffy.  As I would go to do the second jump then glide, and I would just fall to my death.  Boss fights can get a bit irritating at times too, as you only have a split second to hit the right button to advance the finishing sequence.  I use a THX certified 5.1 system, but the voices and other volume levels were off.  I suppose maybe I need to calibrate the sound for this game, but it isn't a problem in the other games that I have.What's good about the game is that it follows some of the mythology and its locales in the myths.  But the game needed to explore these locations a little more.  I would've liked to go a bit further into Underworld.  Fight, fight, kill, kill, destroy the remaining Gods and their minions in hopes to get what Kratos wants.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2010"}

Now in his third console appearance Kratos is back to finish the job he started and conclude the epic semi-cliffhanger of God of War II.  Does the Rage of Sparta have enough to ascend to the top of Mt. Olympus?? You bet he does!!!  Boasting drastically improved graphics vs the previous Playstation 2 versions and sprawling backgrounds that provide an epic sense of scale and wonder, Kratos strikes on the PS3 with the fury of the gods and shows no mercy.GAMEPLAYVery little has changed in the formula of God of War and that is a good thing for fans of the series.  If you are familiar with God of War I and II then you will feel right at home with the controls.  The buttons are mapped to be very simple to use, with the Trigger buttons (L1 L2 R1 R2) acting as block, alternative weapon, action and Magic ability.  God of War handles like an action game with platforming segments.  Often you end up in an area that contains bad guys based in Greek lore (Bulls, Satyr, sirens, centaur generals, cyclops, etc). Dispatch the enemies often leads to either a simple puzzle or platform segment. Combat is fluid and rewards skill over random button mashing.  Time that block perfectly you can counter by deflecting the energy back at an enemy.  This works great when a Medusa has you in their gaze; just reflect their gaze back at them and the entire room gets turned to stone!The beauty of the game is how the gameplay flows fluidly from one area to the next and keeps it feeling fresh.  Like God of War I and II, as you fight and platform through the 6+ hr campaign you actually end up revisiting places over and over yet it feels fresh and new.  Bosses are abundant in this installment, as with previous.  Not only are you taking down the Greek Gods one by one, but also famous and familiar figures from Greek Mythology.  This game does not hold back the violence one bit, and the ways Kratos dispatches of Bosses and large mobs is gruesome.  But this is Kratos after-all so no need to be neat and tidy about it.GRAPHICSThis is where God of War III shines yet also can disappoint.  The opening segment will have your jaw drop at the incredible amount of detail and view this game can pull off with a solid frame rate.  Looking at the Titans in the background, the distant horizon and how the camera pans about gives EPIC a new meaning.  The first 30 minutes of gameplay will just blow your mind.  That's the problem here with the graphics.  They start off at a PEAK.  After this amazing epic battle and beautiful camera shots, sense of scale and devastation, the game puts you indoors for a while.  The graphics still look really good but nothing tops that opening 30 minutes.  The good thing is, with very epic boss fight the sense of scale and sheer graphical beauty returns.In short.. this game looks amazing when you give it an epic viewpoint plus mix in battles with background happenings (like huge Titan's climbing Olympus while being attacked), but once you return to normal gameplay traversing the inner workings of Olympus things look fairly standard for a PS3 game.SOUND/STORYIn typical fashion God of War spares no expense.  The sound track is spot on and the voice acting is top quality.  A lot of effort went into this game and it has that nice polish about it.  From simple sound effects to the cinematic acting everything flows nicely together.  Story wise, the game doesn't disappoint.  Like most God of War titles, the storyline is simple.  Kratos wants Zeus dead and he will stop at nothing to ensure that happens.  Simple and to the point, which works beautifully here.  Get in Kratos' way... you will pay.REPLAY/LENGTHThe game clocked in at around 6 - 7 hours for me.  Not overly long, but not short either.  God of War III does not overdo its welcome like the previous titles.  They were perfectly paced for what the storyline desired.  As for Replay value; once you beat the game you unlock the Challenges.  Beat all 10 challenges you unlock the combat arena.  You also will unlock a costume for Kratos that lets him do 4x normal damage but also take 4x normal damage(makes for a good challenge).  Throw in 4 total difficulty modes, and various collectable items of the gods(which give perks on additional playthroughs) you have some replay here.  Not much will change other than the game getting harder or easier but like past God of War games, I can find myself easily picking it up quite a few times to play.OVERALL ... 93% (9.3) AGod of War III is a must have for any fan of the original two games.  Not only is there a graphical improvement, being on the PS3, but it gives a solid conclusion to the storyline.  God of War III brings everything to the table in just the right portions... Action, Platforming, Puzzle solving, blood and violence, Greek mythology! ... The game is an amazing experience that will keep you pumped the entire time.  There is almost no real faults to mention about this title other than some bad camera angles, but no game is perfect.Kratos storms onto the PS3 and deals a devastating blow to the Gods of Olympus... Gameplay, storyline, graphics it is all here and in perfect balance.  A must play title!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2011"}

I feel like I'm horribly underselling it when I say this game is an epic masterpiece - that's like saying the Sistine Chapel is a nice painting. From the very first battle scene to the climactic conclusion, you know you're in for a bloody good time with Kratos and his Blades.PLOT:Kratos has a bone to pick with the Gods of Olympus, but he's set his sights on the top dog, Zeus. They've got a bit of bad blood between them, and for good reason. With the help of Athena, Kratos will travel from the depths of the Underworld to the heights of Olympus to fulfill his destiny. Not even the threat of death can quell Kratos' bloodlust.Oh, that tingling emotion at the nape of your neck, Zeus? That's fear. You're going to have to throw everything you have at Kratos to stop him.GAMEPLAY:God of War 3 has decided to concentrate more on combat and less on time-consuming puzzles. For most of this game, you'll be running around trying to kill anything with a pulse and upgrading your weaponry. From time to time you'll get to switch to other game modes - jumping over gaps, flying at breakneck speed, and yes, the minigame-not-meant-for-eyes-under-17-to-see is back again.COMBAT:One cannot think of God of War without thinking about those blades seared into Kratos' flesh...and their vicious attacks.  We can do the standard light or heavy attacks, and as we attack some of the larger enemies or bosses, there are QTE (quicktime events) which ends with the boss/enemy being dead (or extremely sleepy).**NOTE: all the prompts for QTE's are no longer in the center of the TV screen, they are at the furthest extremes of the right, left, upper or lower edges of the screen. This is a HUGE improvement over the last 2 installments of God of War.Kratos uses the Blades of Exile to start, and he gathers other implements of death along the way such as the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip. Each one has unique attacks and some of these weapons must be used to solve puzzles and advance further in the game.GRAPHICS/MUSIC:Each installation of God of War improves over the previous installment, and God of War 3 is no exception. With the jump from the Playstation 2 to the Playstation 3, the visuals are now rendered in gorgeous 1080i, so even the slightest detail is given attention: from the speck of blood on the Golden Fleece to the rippling water effects on Poseidon's minions, this game is a feast for our eyes.How about the music? Well, the Skywalker Symphony Orchestra did not disappoint. With a 40-string section and a 20-horn section to blast out every crescendo and tension-filled moment, our ears tell us this is a truly awesome game, in every sense of the word.TROPHIES:There are plenty to earn here, from the very easy (Upgrading a Weapon) to the tooth-grindingly, patience-testingly, hair-rippingly difficult (Beat the game on Titan Mode).Another huge improvement from the first 2 God of War games is found in the Challenge of Olympus - you can choose the order you want to complete the challenges.Most of these trophies can be earned in about 2-3 playthroughs, but save that Titan Mode trophy for last.EXTRAS:For the person who wants to know everything and then some about God of War 3, the following videos are available (some only after beating the game):Making of God of War IIIAnimationCamera DesignCharacter ArtLevel DesignMotion CaptureMusicCreating PoseidonProgrammingQuality AssuranceTech ArtUser InterfaceVisual DevelopmentVisual EffectsVoice Acting (we get to see Rip Torn, Kevin Sorbo, and Malcom McDowell in the recording studio!)And the 8 game cinematic scenesFor those who didn't get their bloodlust quenched with the main game, there are two more gameplay modes available:Challenges of OlympusCombat Arena (unlockable after beating Challenges of Olympus)CONS:My sole complaint? This game only takes 2-3 days to beat. It looks like the reduction of difficult puzzles had a side effect of reducing the total gameplay time. However, there's high replay value for the trophy-hungry crowd.FINAL THOUGHTS:I cannot say enough good things about God of War 3. The gameplay controls never felt awkward, the quicktime events weren't very distracting, the bloodshed and maiming were kept intact, the special weapons were fun and simple to upgrade, and the story unfolded beautifully.It's THE game that makes us proud to own a Playstation 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2010"}

I don't want this to sound like a GTA IV-bashing session, but since it's a known fact that the SR franchise is basically a GTA-clone, I'll do this off by listing some stuff that you'll enjoy in SR2, vs GTA IV:- Mid-mission checkpoints: no more driving half the map to die, only to be told to drive half the map again.- Regenerating Health Bar: you've an option not to die now.- Three difficulty levels: so that even your five-year-old cousin can play this game and complete it, even though he shouldn't actually be doing so.- Driving that actually works: you can do an Initial D drift with ease, without crashing into something or everything.- Shots that actually register on your intended target: and not on someone (or thing) else just because you're pressing LT with five enemies ahead.- Co-op on the fly: havoc is guaranteed as your friend and you could appear on different parts of the map to do whatever you want to do, including beating the whole campaign and completing all the side quests together.- Customization: so that you can play the game as Megan Fox, your Homies can be dressed in ninja uniforms, and your cribs will have dance poles.- Side Missions: favorites like Insurance Fraud and Escort are back, but check out the reality show-style Fuzz and the \"like spraying s*** on buildings\" Septic Avenger. Guaranteed to tickle a bone or two.- No \"couzan\" to call you every five minutes for bowling: nuff said!The game has its share of flaws. Ugly graphics, co-op completion glitches, pop-ups and all, but I'm sure you know these already. I'll end by saying how glad I am for SR2 to resurrect my interest in this genre. Being able to kill Julius for revenge just makes it all the more sweeter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2008"}

It has its charms, and is a pretty solid game, but isn't without its problems.GoW2 operates under the same basic principles as the first game: you play as a bulky space marine, using cover-shooter mechanics to carve through waves of enemy monsters. Most shooting is either done \"blind\" (shooting from behind cover) or popping out and shooting. Like in the first game, there are a few things that separate it from other cover shooters. The first of these is the \"active reload\" system, where timing your reload properly allows you to do it faster or even improve the damage of your next magazine. The second is melee combat, most famously the \"chainsaw bayonets\" mounted on the standard assault rifle. However, for the most part GoW2's combat is formulaic, like the first.There are a few new weapons to spice things up, though. These include a gatling gun (that must be mounted on cover and cranked to fire) and a mortar launcher (good at distances, but less so at close range). The action is intense and fast-paced, but the main issue is that even with varying weapons, you're still basically doing the same cover routine over and over and over. There are a few sequences to break up the monotony, but they don't disguise the fact that the main game is kind of simplistic.Multiplayer is one of the game's strongest points. There are basically three kinds: cooperative, competitive, and horde mode. Cooperative refers to the ability to play through the campaign with multiple players. It's simplistic, but fun. Competitive refers to the standard set of multiplayer modes - deathmatch, capture-the-flag, etc. Horde mode is an expansion of cooperative mode that allows up to five players to try to survive against waves of enemies. It's probably the most interesting mode, and allows for the most strategic options (figuring out where to hole up, setting traps and killzones, etc).The game's production values are good. It's visually exciting, if a bit repetitive. The guns sound neat, and there's certainly nothing more ominous than the revving of the aforementioned chainsaw-bayonets. Gears of War 2 is most fun as a multiplayer game - it's the kind of game where you can get some friends together and play all afternoon. As mentioned, it gets kind of repetitive, but the multiplayer experience is enough to overcome that.Rating: 8/10.We purchased this game with our own funds from a game store.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}

The monsters and big monsters (bosses) look really cool.Sound is ok. There is heavy metal music in the background. I am not a great fan of it, so I turned the music to 50% while increasing everything else 100%.There are racy pictures of your girlfriend, Jennifer, placed throughout the levels. They are torn, so you need to collect several pieces to get the whole picture. They are Very Nice!The story is almost exactly the same as Shadows of the Damned.

Again, the forces of evil have taken your girl, and you must rescue her from darkness.The game is all melee, and the button mashing is like Castlevania:Lords of Shadow. But unlike that game, most of the boss battles are melee with only a few quick time events (QTE). These QTEs are usually the same sequence per enemy, although the same enemy may have slightly different QTEs to finish them off. The game is very gory, and even the language is 'M' rated. This was fun!Unfortunately, there are also arcade sequences within the game. I Hate Arcade Sequences! This is why I give Splatterhouse a 4 instead of a 5.

But despite FF13 having impressive graphics, and being relatively glitch free; I feel Skyrim completely outmatches it in nearly every category.For those unfamiliar with the series (which I started playing with the original back on DOS), Elder Scrolls was a ground breaking game based on the 'do anything' model that has become popular with open ended RPGs and action games.  Think Grand Theft Auto 3 and onward.  The series has become more popular, with Morrowind (part 3) getting more into the popular mainstream and Oblivion (part IV) officially becoming a mainstream title.  This game shares much in common with its predecessors, but improves on the formula in many ways.If you have played Elder Scrolls Oblivion, then you have a good grasp of the style of game play.  If not, then it is basically a first person action RPG.  You use the L and R triggers for most of your attacks while using the dual analog sticks to move your character and the camera.  It's a system that works well for this type of game (I remember space flight style games seemed to use this system a lot on PS2).  It's a control system that is smooth and fluid most of the time.  Far better than the setup for GTA 4.  Battle is much improved.  No worthless battles hitting the slash button repeatedly.  Instead the battles are quicker, more fierce, and more realistic.  Sometimes the game cuts to a deathblow scene which is actually pretty amazing.  Dragon battles can take a little time though... depending on your level.  Also, expanding archery skills almost seems cheap since I can pick off most enemies in one or two hits.  But the drawback is that if the enemies get close, you're screwed.  Archery is slow so you get wailed on while notching an arrow, so you might consider switching to magic or a blade.  Also, backing up while attacking is much slower, so you can't do the hit and run like in Oblivion.Major improvements have been made in many areas, but the two areas that come to mind are really the menus, environmental interaction, and  music.  The music in IV was always nice with an ambient touch.  But this is really the first Elder Scrolls game that has a soundtrack I actually want to hear prominently.  The developers really scored big points on this front.  The music still has an ambient quality, but it's just better sounding.  Whereas Oblivion's score sounded like a bad knockoff of Pirates of the Caribbean, Skyrim has a more Lord of the Rings style of music (think of the music during the Balrog battle or the celestial choir style of music during less tense moments).  Good job Bethesda.Environmental interaction has improved in my opinion, but others might like IV's system better.  The descriptions of items appears before you pick it up, so you can see the weight, value, and other notes before taking possession.  IV just had the hand icon which meant you could pick it up, but you couldn't see info until you looked in the menu.  Also interacting with things such as drawers is fun because it does show the drawers and baskets open up.  It's really kind of neat.  Taking herbs and flowers from the field is easier and the flowers (or mushrooms, or herbs) disappear when taken, so you know you've hit the spot.Menus are much more fluid, though the equipment menu was much more interactive in IV.  But other than the equip menu, it's a stellar menu setup.  It's easy to navigate quickly so you don't take too long of a break from the action.  There is a shortcut by pushing up on the d pad to gain access to favorite items, magic or weapons.Now for the issues:  with a game this graphically advanced, there are some slight issues with display and frame rates in some areas.  If you played IV, then you remember a few minor frame rate issues and some points where the game would stick for a few seconds.  There were also a few times in IV when the entire game would freeze and a hard reset of the PS3 was required.  So crashes were not uncommon in IV.  But at least the game auto saves at various points.  So not too bad.  The main issue here is that Skyrim doesn't seem to auto save as often, so those rare crashes or freezes are more frustrating.  The 360 version seems to have less issues with freezes and crashes, but both systems should be able to handle the game without these bugs.  Some online forums discuss some of the reasons behind these bugs, but it seems the latest patches have fixed most bugs.The main quest can be completed in a short time, but if you spend time completing optional quests and exploring, the game can take over 100 hours.  The game is open ended, but less annoying than in Oblivion.  I refer to the annoyance of super powerful goblins with priceless armor and weapons that crop up later in the game.  When you level, in this game you don't really gain too much power other than a nifty one point allotment to use for a skill.  The skills are capped though to prevent you from running through one skill tree without leveling the skill adequately.  Also, the main story is much better than Oblivion (no annoying Martin in this one).  It has a feel more like Lord of the Rings (though the big baddie in IV looked like Sauron).If you want a great action RPG, then this is a winner.  Despite the minor glitches this is still one of the best games on PS3.  It allows for open ended exploration with plenty of optional quests beyond the main story line.  I had the game completely freeze on me within two hours of my first playing it, but luckily frequent saves are my friend (I had to power down the PS3 to fix it).  I highly recommend keeping those save files going.  It auto-saves much less than Oblivion did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2012"}

This one is different. The opening sequence sets your expectations well: this is not an RPG where you obsess over stats and collect loot, although you can do that here too. No, Skyrim is a living, breathing semi-real world populated by fearsome dragons and a plethora of friendly NPCs that you can talk to. If you play on PC, visit YouTube for some incredibly detailed vistas that are coming close to Discovery Channel... I'm on PS3 and even then, I find myself aimlessly wandering around on my trusty horse, wanting to take pictures like I'm some time travelling tourist visiting New Zealand in the year 1057. Gameplay is slow paced, like real life. Moving around and interacting with the environment feels very natural, and I usually choose the first person view, although you can do 3rd person, which is handy in dungeons. Combat gameplay is standard-issue, and I find the overwhelming options for weaponry and enchantments too much, because there is no discernible difference when faced with an enemy. If you're battling an NPC with magic powers, you rarely feel a significantly different effect from their induced damage. In reverse, whether you choose to attack with fire or electricity or a sword or hammer, it all has only a minor impact based on the type of NPC you're fighting. The result is that you can pretty much stick to whatever equipment you like and never really have to worry about whom you're up against. So why, then, is there such an immense plethora of options? You can learn a zillion skills, and it hardly matters.The world is truly entertaining. After countless evenings spent helping denizens of Skyrim in politics, dragon-pest control, after literally thousands of loot chests raided and locks picked, after having concocted tinctures that make me invisible and after having learned bizarre spells that cast a wall of ice around me, my game stats insist that I haven't even found all of the roughly 380 discoverable locations, nor have I managed to clear the 150 dungeons. If you are not into fantasy RPG or any of the DnD type games, this is for you, because it isn't either of those, even though it sort of is. And if you wonder how deep the lore is, head to the UESP wiki for the elder scrolls and be astounded at the sheer volume of books and information that makes up this game's environment. Newbie tip of the day: take everything that isn't nailed down and sell it, because at first, money is a bit tough to come by.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2013"}

This makes it so I can check my trophies and have the game open without the XMB screen in the way.The one negative I've found so far is when the PS Vita is on the cradle, you have to hold the top or back of the PS Vita when you press the PS button on the Vita, otherwise it moves the would thing.It would be neat if the PS logo on the cradle itself were a secondary PS button for the Vita when the Vita is on the cradle. This would address that very minor issue.Although these are very trivial product features, it does exactly what it's meant for, so I give this product a 5 star.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000B43OXU","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"The XBox 360","reviewText":"What do you mean you've never heard of the Xbox 360? Where have you been living for the past 5-6 months - a life of solitude in the wilds of Timbuktu?Advertising? What do you mean there's been no advertising? With only 50,000 consoles (the number mentioned in numerous articles about the Xbox 360) being made available to the UK, do you think there's any real need to spend money on something that people have pre-ordered since late August, when Microsoft officially confirmed the release schedule of this console for the globe. Yes, globally launching the console within weeks of each area getting theirs. This has been an unprecedented move by anyone in the gaming industry, since typically they stagger the release of new hardware (and software on occasions) by a matter of months.But then again, Microsoft needed to be daring and ambitious this time round, with their first update of the Xbox console. Sony and Nintendo have been in the game much longer, with the former having the majority share of the industry. As with all things Microsoft, they want to be the dominant, the most widely used brand, and in order to attempt to take some of Sony's share, they had no option but to release the next generation of gaming hardware first - especially as Sony won't have their new PS3 out until late next year (2006) in Japan, then the US. We Brits (and Europeans), well we've been relegated to second-class consideration, by being put on hold, until February 2007. 2007?! - yes that's the rumoured expected date of the PS3 in Europe.So, because of that situation, most gamers (hardcore and casual, young and old) see the Xbox 360 as their ticket to the \"next big thing\".So, what is it about the 360 that makes it the next big thing? Well, Xbox Live is by far the best online service available for gamers - even hardened PC users accept that nowadays. The console will also allow you to connect your Apple iPod, and Sony PSP, to use for playing back your music files in a game. Equally, you can hook up a PC to the console to stream video across.The graphics on the Xbox original, were top notch - better than the Sony PS2, by any stretch of the imagination, but now that we're in the midst of a High Definition revolution (or should that be resolution), something the NTSC US and Japanese Xboxes have been able to do since day one, with games that supported the Hi Def resolutions (1280x720p and 1920x1080i), the 360 lets European customers finally have a gaming system that outputs Hi Def and enjoy the spectacular graphics quality that games have, and will have. The 360 will still work on normal CRT TVs, but you really want to go Hi-Def to see what all the hype is about. Equally, you can buy the VGA cable, and hook it up to an LCD computer monitor, which you may already have being used by your PC. If you have one with DVI and VGA inputs, and a graphics card on the PC with DVI, then you'll save yourself an awful lot of hassle swapping VGA cables over to use whichever unit you want.The bulk of 360 machines sold are the Premium version - the same as the Core system but only with a lot more included for a small price increase. There's the hard disk drive (20 GB), HD Component cable, wireless control pad, headset - for talking to your team mates online, and for a limited time only, a cut down version of the separately available media remote control, which can control a connected PC's Media Centre OS, should it be installed.Ultimately there will be a number of you who can't get hold of a 360 before Christmas, having to wait until possibly as late as February before you will, but whilst the delay causes frustration and disappointment, the reality is you will forgive Microsoft's ambitious attempt to rule the planet...er, satiate global demand for the new console, once you eventually get your hands on one, and play it for the first time on a HD display.All the frustrations and other emotions felt in the interim period will melt away, and you'll wonder why you stressed yourself out so much. Life is stressful enough, there's no point adding to it.The rear of the console has the power receptacle for the connector on the out-board brick-styled power supply, the proprietary Xbox video connector, and an Ethernet (RJ45) port, which allows hook-up of the supplied Ethernet cable to your broadband modem/router. If you've a Wi-Fi set-up, then you can always avail of the USB 802.11g wireless adapter, sold separately.The 360 can be can be oriented in an upright manner (&agrave; la Sony PS2), or horizontally, just like the original Xbox. Size wise, it's still big - Sony PS2 sleekness, it is not. The unit I have is noisy - the fans are audible but the main source of disconcertion is the DVD drive. It is very noticeably noisy, and spins practically continuously when playing a game. Watching DVDs is not the same; the main noise heard (if the TV volume is low enough) is the fans. This noise becomes background noise once you get into the game, but if your concentration is disturbed, or you're watching a cut scene, it becomes foreground noise once again, which is disappointing to say the least. It's been reported some units are quiet all the time; others likened to the noise of a jet aircraft - a slight exaggeration, but highlights the point that there seems to be an element of potluck which DVD drive and/or fans yours is possibly going to have. If you can place it in an enclosed space under the display, maybe it won't be so bad - but if not, then it could just spoil an otherwise excellent package.The new control pad design is another area for praise and criticism. On the praise side, the pad is slightly larger than the small controller of the original Xbox, which superseded the original control pad that shipped with the system initially. The shoulder now has buttons, the black and white buttons (too small and poorly located to be effective in most games) having been replaced by these. The `X' button in the centre of the pad lights up and is a switch for turning on or off the pad itself, as well as the console - talk about making us into even lazier couch potatoes! Still, it's an excellent feature. Of course, it's wireless as well - I shan't bore you with the technology employed, which means no more wires to get under your feet, tripped over, eaten by the hamster - and no I'm not referring to the gleaming teeth of Top Gear's Richard Hammond! - etc. The 360 system comes with batteries (AA) for the control pad, as well as the remote control (Energizer, no less!).The only negative of the design is the Start and back buttons - placed either side of the `X'. All to often, when pausing the game to change options or do something, the `X' button gets pressed instead or as well, resulting in the dashboard showing. It's a minor annoyance, but nevertheless, one that should have been caught at prototyping stage or early testing. Already one well-known 3rd party accessories manufacturer's wired (not wireless) pad has these buttons over on the left under the thumbstick, just like the S-controller has. Makes much more sense that approach, if you ask me. Still, aside from that minor gripe, the pad feels great and works a charm - especially as the 4 buttons (A/B/X/Y) are spaced further apart than previously.For the money - 279.99, it's a bit of a bargain, considering the additional gadgets it can work with and make use of, providing you with countless hours of enjoyment. Such ones as Apple's iPod and Sony's PSP, not to mention the other brands of MP3 players, of which, some, Lord Percy has had his leather gloved hands carressing in the past!With the new design of the dashboard, and use of colours for each sub-menu therein, you know Microsoft's design team have put a lot of thought into it, rather than being a case of \"that'll do rightly\". Similarly the games out now, at launch - they all look excellent graphically, and as the programmers get to grips with the system as time goes on, I'm sure there'll be games along that push the boundaries of what we thought imaginable in this day and age for a sub 300 games console.Also, whilst not absolutely perfect, Halo 2 works straight out of the box, and gets a welcome boost in visual impressiveness. There are a few areas where the emulator throws a bit of a fit; the main noticed one being the characters at the very start. They seem to take 3-4 goes at turning, and at first I thought this was an anomaly by standing beside them, but alas, it's not. They do it when standing well back from them. But that's nit-picking - once playing the game, you get absorbed into shooting everything that moves, and barely have time to notice the improved visuals or smoother frame rate that seems to have resulted with the additional processing power the Xbox 360 has compared to it's predecessor.Therefore, a \"well done\" congratulation must go to Microsoft's Xbox team - they've done a superb job. The only concern is that in meeting that price, sub-standard components have not been foisted upon them, or in their rush with 2 factories working all day, everyday, QC is not being scrimped on.For now, the Xbox 360 is simply superb, and as time goes by, it'll still prove to be the case, rather than initial infatuation. Does it live up to the hype that has thus far surrounded it? Well, I'd be lying if I said, \"unequivocally yes\" - the hype is greater than the actuality if truth be told, but that in no way implies that it's dull or suchlike. Far from it, it does give you a definite buzz, but it's not life changing - just a refreshingly renewed enjoyment of gaming solo, online, or with a few friends round for the evening.Lastly, if you were hoping your cables from the original Xbox would work on the new 360 - you're out of luck, they are smaller and have a slightly different profile. Had hoped the same with the RGB SCART I used with the original unit, but alas, it wasn't to be. More money to fork out now for a better image on a conventional TV - at least it's more affordable than a 37\" HD Ready LCD, a projector, or a Plasma TV!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2006"}

Low mountains, hills and plains are just colored patches as in no way do they affect the movements of the units! So what is the use of a big map in a \"Strategy\" game if the landscape plays no role in the gameplay?I have a fairly good PC system (3.2MHz P4, 2GB RAM, 256MB 7600GT GX-Card on an ASUS P800 MB) and as long as the number of units were below a couple of hundred I experienced no syncopated sound, stuttering or freezing. As the game progressed though, and the number of units increased, all of the above made their gradual appearance. And the quality of the graphics in NO way can it justify such system drainage!Zooming in is an empty treat: sure, one can zoom in almost as much as with C&C3;, and they did pay attention in the detailed design of the units and explosions. However, with such huge maps, no actual maneuvering is possible unless one zooms OUT enough to have an overview of the battlefield - and this only happens when, instead of units, the only thing visible are their info-tags. This is what we are left moving around: rectangular, pixelated info-tags...Balanced? Are you kidding? Pokemon is more balanced than SupCom! Hell, good old Rock-Paper-Scissors is more balanced than SupCom!Frustrating? Try ordering a group of tanks to attack an enemy unit about to destroy a structure of yours: they 'll take their sweet time about it! I guess they are in a union and no one can do anything about it...I cannot even begin to imagine what they packaged into the 9GB(!!!) it takes up on the HD. The three campaigns differ in name only. Replayability? Only by someone else. If bored to death. And then, only for less than an hour.My advice: Pass.Instead, replay LOTR-BATTLE FOR MIDDLE EARTH or even EMPEROR: BATTLE FOR DUNE.

I got the game yesterday and have been playing since.  Its very addicting.  I havent noticed any bugs but i'll keep my eye on them.  I'm doing normal mode right now and so far no problems.  The missions are pretty fun.  I customized my own squad with names and gear and sent them on missions.  The ones that i customized are doing great together on ranking up.  So i tried to be brave and sent out 3 rookies(not my custom ones) to a mission to see if they can handle it. Nope but came close.  One died very fast.  Another one got a few kills and eventually got taken out.  Then my last rookie was doing great and was almost done with the mission but kept getting wounded and died.  The mission type was difficult but only 1 bar.  Unfortunately, you can only have 6 members to your squad after unlocking.  I hope they change that in a expansion or something.  Its a great game and lot of games that first come out are going to have bugs regardless.  I havent really noticed any but i'll watch out for it.  Steam doesnt bother me one bit.  Although, after i installed from discs, it still had to download another 6 gb.  Didn't really like that but i'm not going to give the game itself a bad review.  I will update again if i have any serious issues but i doubt i will.  The game is definetaly worth getting and a lot of fun.Update: After playing for a whole week, i've seen some bugs in the game. One with the camera messing up sometimes when you shoot an alien and flies across the screen and doesnt keep the camera on the alien. Another one, is in the base and i'm pulling up soldiers information and then the custom menu gets stuck on the screen and i have to reload a saved game to make it go away.  Also, sometimes i cant pull up the save menu forcing me to alt ctrl delete and end task game.  Luckily the game autosaves a lot.  It seems to happen when i have the game on for a long time.

These 2 things are great for people like me that don't have a lot of time to play games or have a short attention span. You have 10 saves so you can save a lot and just reload them if you missed something. If you are a completest or achievement hunter (like myself), there is only bad thing... the game only tracks the collectables and side quests (side quests that continue through the campaign) on your 1st and main playthough.

{"product_name":"B0050SYK44","description":"","reviewerName":"Scott","summary":"A fun game, but the bugs are ruining it for me","reviewText":"Overall the game is like an amplified version of the first one, this is good and bad.  Depending on how recently you played the first one, it can be a bit repetitive and uninspiring at times.  BUT, if you're a huge fan of the first one (as I was) this is a welcome extension of the game.  The skill trees are set up slightly differently, you can no longer skip ahead to the next level of the tree so quickly forcing you to really dedicate your character to a certain \"role\".  In my opinion this make the re-playability factor of the game pretty strong.  There are a lot more guns available and the bad ass ranks are pretty cool.  You earn bad ass ranks as you complete certain tasks (killing X amount of enemies, collecting X amount of certain types of guns, etc.) and with each rank you earn a little bonus on a character trait.  It's something like a .5% more effective reload or shield capacity and so on.  They do add up and you can't load all these bad ass points into one trait, you're forced to spread them around.The enemies have a much better AI now and can be infuriating at times, but that's in a good way.  They dance around causing you to miss and waste ammo or take cover to regain shields.  Some enemies are so nuts they will attack their fellow hoodlums as long as you can trigger their rage, which isn't so difficult to do.I would have normally given this 4 stars, one knocked off because of the repetitiveness of the missions and the game as a whole (after some time I find myself not really interested in putting it back in the Xbox) but the bugs in the game are going to take another star off for me with this one.  Many have talked about the bad ass rank reverting, I haven't experienced that one yet.  The bugs I'm running into are ones that make finishing missions impossible.  The first I encountered was to kill a monster that never appeared, I didn't think much of this because it was a little side mission and I could live without finishing it.  The last two, however, have been story missions that have required me to shut off the game and reboot the area.  I don't know when the game ends, but I'm assuming I'm near the end based on the context and the difficulty of these fights.  One glitch had my nemesis shaking in thin air and not moving.  I took the health all the way down and nothing changed, just mid air shaking.  It took me 4 times to get through that without making that happen (as far as I could tell, if you got a critical hit the bug would begin) and I ran into a similar bug in the fight directly after that one.  It's caused me to put the game down and wonder if I even want to bother with continuing.So, I regret giving this game 3 stars, but at this point it's really disappointing me and making it difficult to want to play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2012"}

E Jackson","summary":"it's okay but...","reviewText":"Super Mario Galaxy 2 is, unfortunately, unforgivably bland. Simply put- it does not live up to the hype. It does not make the original SMG pointless in comparison (which is the ridiculous suggestion I've been reading on message boards by posters who are apparently still wrapped up in the hype machine to see things how they *really* are). The game basically copies every single aspect that made the original so great without adding much of anything innovative. Many of the enemies and obstacles are exactly the same, but placed in different environments and situations as a way to assure that any comparisons be kept to a minimum. The only problem there is that I can see through the disguise and take the game for what it really is: a decent continuation -but ultimately a shameless copycat- of a fantastic and highly original platformer in Super Mario Galaxy. This means not only does SMG2 hardly stand apart but it barely even warrants a purchase. This may be the first time in the Mario series I can recall where the follow-up (sequel) is almost exactly the same. Oh wait, there is one other example- the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2 (NES game). It's almost exactly the same as the first one, but most people either haven't played or simply don't care about the Japanese version of that old, overbearingly challenging game.It should be mentioned right away that the boss fights are much worse this time around. The strategies with bosses such as Bouldergeist and Bowser from Super Mario Galaxy encouraged me to sort through a fairly elaborate set of patterns concerning several different attacks until I finally figured out what it is I'm supposed to do. I mean while playing Super Mario Galaxy, I was standing there in my living room eagerly and excitedly trying to figure out their weak points all the while totally amazed that Nintendo actually went the extra mile in making them so varied. These are two VERY creative bosses that I happen to believe smear everything that SMG2 has to offer, that's for sure. What made them so extraordinary is that I was completely dumbfounded at the complexity of their attacks. \"This is coming from a Mario game???\" I'd frequently say to myself (since I grew up in the early 90's with Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World when boss fights were made extremely simplistic by only having to dodge a few moves and stomping on their head 3 times- the polar opposite of THESE fights). Everytime I made a mistake with Bouldergeist or Bowser (which was plenty of times I'm embarrassed to admit) it was the result of me being careless, not the game being cheap. Bowser in particular completely blows me away. His pattern consists of dodging SEVERAL fireballs, dodging his spiked-ball form, spin attacking his exposed weak point while he's rolling around in a temporary boulder formation, and carefully jumping over his many (up to 5 sometimes) layers of rings. If you mess up once and take a hit, Bowser seems to backtrack to his previous pattern and you have to successfully dodge these moves all over again. A far cry from say, luring him overtop a few layers of bricks so he can fall through the floor, or running underneath King Koopa on a bridge and reaching the end. Let's be honest, Bowser was bland in the early days with only fireballs and hammers doing any kind of damage. Yeah, this SMG fight is what I call extremely elaborate in comparison.Which brings us to Bowser's SMG2 battle. Well at least Nintendo had the good intention of making the boss fights strategic and enjoyable, but... it feels watered down and \"Been there, done that\" now. Bowser in particular is basically the same fight with only one or two new flashy moves (including launching high in the air and soaring down like a meteorite pounding the planet which is admittedly cool and encourages the player to ground pound these floating golden balls that temporarily hang in the air and smack Bowser's body) and it's impossible for me to believe anyone in their right mind would suggest this is in any way shape or form superior to his original incarnation from Galaxy 1 where the true innovation of boss fights and level design was in full swing. There's a gigantic floating snake boss that seems intimidating at first, but since he floats around the planet with a simple to take down strategy (all you really have to do is spin attack the rings on his body up to 6 times after hearing a familiar \"choo choo\" train sound effect as he shoots through the ground) he's not much of a threat and certainly not an appealing example of creativity. The fire snake fight is pretty hard, admittedly. Same battle, but he's on fire this time. I suppose the boss in Flipsville Galaxy is sort of unique- you have to walk under the floor (or over, depending on the situation) so you're standing directly underneath of the boss and ground pound his stomach. The bosses in Freezy Flake and Boulder Bowl Galaxy are WAY too easy and unnecessary inclusions.The darn piranha plant boss that screams like a baby comes back for another helping (you know, the first boss you fight in SMG) and this time he has no tail- you just repeatedly and mindlessly spin attack the cracked egg around his backside until it breaks and he dies. Why Nintendo felt the need to dumb down an already pathetically easy boss is beyond me. Just bringing it back is an even bigger question mark. A couple other bosses (and levels) come back for another round as well (such as an even easier to defeat Bugaboom, and that one thwomp area from Beach Bowl Galaxy but sped up considerably faster this time) and these are all totally pointless returns since we've already completed them in the previous game. Lazy programming decisions. I must say however, that the Megahammer is a really cool boss fight. You have to frantically run around platforms using Yoshi's tongue to gather torpedoes, and then launch them back at the glass sections of the Megahammer itself while dodging torpedoes and rings. Running around makes the battle quite the exercise too. Unquestionably a high point in the game. Bowser Jr's Boom Bunker is pretty cool as well, even though it's clearly just a gigantic screen-sized version of the Undergrunt Gunner from the first games Toy Time Galaxy with the same fireball-homing attacks and glass protection above his head. It only stands apart because you need a cloud flower this time given his enormous size.The music is a LOT worse too. Make that inconsistent- for every awesome theme we have to persevere a bad one. In the first Galaxy you had dreamy and effectively atmospheric outer space music of the Space Junk Galaxy, subtle touches of jazz in the grassy lands of the Honeyhive Galaxy (that's been remixed with unnecessary flutes here, though granted the flutes DO give it a peppy 70's feel similar to the Brady Bunch), the detective-like mysterious theme of the Bubble Breeze levels, and cool early 80's-resembling synths (particularly sounding like the rock band Genesis) in a couple of the water stages (such as Buoy Base). Actually the Buoy Base music plays in a stage here that strongly resembles the design of the Buoy Base itself, but dumbed down considerably with switch-hitting slow motion effects and less rotating platforms making for an easier climb in comparison. I do really admire a particular subtle touch when the music sounds like it's being played through headphones. This occurs briefly whenever you hit a switch. Not a fan of the cliched Middle Eastern music found in Clockwork Ruins Galaxy either.The music in this game just does not live up to the same incredible standard. There's a distinct style of jazz being played in several of the stages such as Yoshi's Star, Boulder Bowl and Throwback Galaxy. For my personal tastes, jazz music is completely inappropriate and distracting for video game music, especially in a challenging adventure game when concentration is mandatory for completion. Not the proper setting at all. At least the beach music this time is somewhat listenable. However let's give credit where it's due- one of the water themes is REALLY awesome (from Cosmic Cove). Dare I even say the best water theme ever? Probably influenced by the theme from the first Donkey Kong Country's water stage, it's amazingly effective in both mood and melody. Oh and Bulb Berry's Mysterious Glow (or rather Sweet Mystery Galaxy) contains another excellent theme that captures the feeling of dreaminess. I really DESPISE the theme from Throwback Galaxy. Perhaps you'd have to either be a huge fan of Super Mario 64 or simply have strong childhood memories of the Nintendo 64 days in order to appreciate this theme, who knows. Then again I can name an equally crappy song from Yoshi's Island and no special memories in the WORLD can make *that* piece of music any more enjoyable. The other water theme from Slimy Spring Galaxy sounds like some partial Radiohead-influenced ambient piece that doesn't work for me. I admit I absolutely LOVE the Upside Dizzy Galaxy theme. The main melody is based around one or two techno notes with a colorful dash of other rich and rewarding arrangements in the background. A well-performed song, as is the familiar underground Super Mario Bros. theme turned really eerie and haunting in the Flip-Out Galaxy.Only a few levels are superior to the ones from the first Galaxy in the fun department. It should be said that the ghost galaxy in this game (called Haunty Halls) is better than the ghost sections of the previous Galaxy only because these ones actually feel like *levels* where you have to avoid disappearing/chasing boos along with the obstacle of having to jump across several tricky designed platforms that come out of the dreaded dark matter. You better polish your shoes if you want to quickly make it across these moving platforms! Lots of dangerous and exciting situations this time around that really plays on the ghost theme- unquestionably influenced by Super Mario World's ghost houses. It actually FEELS like I'm going through a haunted house in SMG2. This was sorely needed in the original SMG's ghostly stages. The one section where you're surrounded by dark matter and urgently need to run through moving platforms is atmospherically creepy and it's quite intense making your way through. The ghostly portions in SMG are mainly occupied with ghost races which are really cool, don't get me wrong, but not as entertaining as the actual ghost stages featured here. I could probably do without the obvious Super Mario World moving platform imitation, however. I think the planet with these type of platforms is called Boo Moon Galaxy. Riding on them wasn't particularly fun in Super Mario World (because I remember how many times I'd miss and fall into the lava, ugh) and it's not any better here. I guess seeing the same set-up upgraded to a 3D environment is sort of cool, though.Several levels are flat out boring. The honey (bee) levels are back and the one called Honeyhop Galaxy is shorter and somewhat sloppy and rushed in its design with less emphasis on exploration. Honeybloom Galaxy is worse since it's based around a really easy 2D level design with hardly any dangers whatsoever. A level for babies or newbies. At first my impression of this stage is that it works magnificently as a fast-paced chase to the finish involving swinging over vines and avoiding pockets of water while in the bee form. Now however, I realize it severely lacks challenge. I feel the same way about the 2D swimming portions from the Cosmic Cove stage. Beautiful, but easy easy easy. The lava levels have segments that are really intense and nerve racking such as the one with the mad dash upwards across several fast-moving platforms while trying to hold onto a cloud flower, and the exceptionally frightening stage where a neverending parade of those lava monsters (that first appeared in Super Mario World) march down the screen and munch at the platforms, requiring the player to be really careful moving across- can you say pink elephants! However these levels ultimately fail to live up to the consistency and plentiful variety that the original presented with the Melty Molten stages and feel more like rehashes, and my goodness, who in their right mind thought it was a good idea to overload this game with so many darn gigantic CHOMP HEADS and OCTOOMBAS? They were implemented just enough in the first Galaxy to get your fill, but here? It's overkill, seriously. Chomps are rolling all OVER the darn place and octoobmas are located in every single place where they can get in a cheap hit (now occasionally shooting TWO rocks at a time, ugh!) The entire galaxy devoted to the numerous chomps is a nightmare too, especially the one where you have to spring bounce (or backflip) over an endless amount of chomps rolling across the floor. The level that is puzzle-like with the gold rolling chomps unfortunately isn't backed up by being any fun on numerous playthroughs. It's more like \"Oh that was clever\" when you figure out you're supposed to roll the chomps across platforms a certain way while *standing* and pushing down on the blue buttons, but definitely annoying to repeat this level again. Oh and you'll sometimes see MINI chomps as well (or kid chomps as I like to call them).The water stages are worse in SMG2. I admire the way the Cosmic Cove Galaxy alternates between 3D and 2D camera angles and swimming movements, and creatively uses a freezing technique near the beginning that makes the water and the scenery very beautiful. The part near the end where you're swimming through water cubes is unbelievably cool and a rare example of amazing design creativity. Still, none of this is the least bit challenging. I could definitely do without yet another bunny grabbing mini game though. I've had my fill of those from the first game. This rabbit mission is way more dangerous than all the ones from the first game combined due to the many holes that serve as endless pits, and the fast-moving ice skating skills needed to catch up to the bunny. However the first SMG game has so many unique and better utilized racing levels in the water with penguins, cosmic Luigi, whales, and an enormous bony fish boss fight with torpedoes that it comes as no surprise that the water stages in the sequel simply can't compete.There's a snow level here. It's not as enticing as SMG's Freezeframe Galaxy and it doesn't really do anything noteworthy that stands apart from the snow levels in several other 3D games, but I do admire the beautiful snowy environments. It's really short and generic with giants snowballs and snowgoombas everywhere. I admire the brief blizzard segment for the way it makes you feel secluded and lost somewhere in Russia. The sand levels -at least as far as collecting green stars- are MUCH harder this time around with more emphasis on overflowing rivers of sand and several rows of fast-moving fireballs. It's extremely easy to lose a life by making a bad jumping (or sliding) decision. Literally sliding off the entire river and directly into the bottom of the screen is a strong possibility. The sand often flows backwards, making the trip across even longer. I like a certain platform ride near the end of one mission, however. It involves magikoopas and yes, chomp heads. Magikoopa uses his magic wand and the chomp head uses his rolling ability to destroy portions of the moving platform that Mario is riding on, making navigation to the gold star tricky and fun. Bowser's final castle is rather disappointing since it's relatively bland in comparison to the fast-moving, obstacle driven intensity found in the first Mario game. The navigation through this one is slower, and the obstacles are less creative and threatening. It's inconsistent too. The part with the drill/pockets of sand/dodging giant bullet bills is boring with no replay value, and the segment with Yoshi near the end is downright tedious since controlling Yoshi whenever he grabs a dash pepper makes for plenty of jerky, awkward movements and plenty of deaths as a result of a rapidly closing wall made of fire that you'll discover. We've already seen rotating fireball rods mixed in with tricky camera angles for dramatic effect in the first game so nothing new in that regard here.Oh and the most insulting level imaginable is definitely the Throwback Galaxy. I don't mind the updated and prettier graphics of the Super Mario 64 levels (even though Nintendo is repeating what's already been done which just SCREAMS a lack of creativity) but what I DO certainly mind is the stage where you have to fight 5 bosses in a row from the first Galaxy. It's not only pointless to make us repeat the same bosses and strategies of the previous game, but it's also flat out boring and irritating since these bosses are the weak, easy versions and not the daredevil or speedy comet versions so there's no real urgency to try your hardest or even feel satisfied after you've conquered them. What a terrible idea to repeat what's already been implemented previously and a COMPLETE waste of time. Still, this is at least better than the levels that focus on red and blue platforms that open and close whenever Mario spins. Absolutely boring and a chore to go through these particular stages (the chore being, when you're not sure you'll make it across a long gap so you instinctively spin Mario at the end of a long jump and yet, spinning in this stage could result in a quicker death than you originally planned).The Supermassive Galaxy is obviously trying to recapture some of the magic that World 4 of Super Mario Bros. 3 used by scattering the levels with overgrown, super-sized enemies, however it's underutilized and way too short here. We've already seen giant goombas in the first Super Mario Galaxy, and giant green koopas and piranha plants were first presented to us, again, back in SMB3. This idea is nothing new or innovative. Oh and another major disappointment- another terribly bland beach level that reminds me of Super Mario Sunshine. Sorry Nintendo, but beach levels haven't been interesting in Mario games since Yoshi's Island. It's been THAT long! At least this one has Yoshi and spiny-throwing lakitus. The lack of interest is because these particular type of beach stages play on the \"beaches are relaxing\" theme (or in the case of a video game, \"beaches are less threatening\") which means these portions of the game are really empty with only a few enemies and dangerous platforms in sight, and honestly there's barely a reason why these particular stages should even exist other than tossing in a bit of variety. I mean if I wanted to take a breather I'd just put the game down for a few minutes. Beaches don't fit Mario games in my opinion. Oh and whether you're going through the stage normally or with the drill, it doesn't change the fact that Flipsville Galaxy is downright *boring*. I truly despise this stage. Drilling and/or flipping upside down over and over again just to progress forward... VERY tedious. The drill may be a cool item, but this is proof that basing an entire stage around it was a disastrous idea. The purple coin mission in this stage was initially horrendous due to the limited movements of using the drill, but better now that I found a reliable formula.I don't really like the cloud levels either (Fluffy Bluff and Cloudy Court Galaxy respectively) for a couple reasons. Again, the design of these stages is sickening and unbearably cutesy in a Super Mario Sunshine kind of way (the resemblance is immediately noticeable) and the cloud flower is overused in both stages (I'll share my feelings with this item below). Both stages share the same unbearably overdone orchestration. The Puzzle Plank Galaxy is fun the first time around, but never again. Catchy hoedown theme song at least. The Space Storm Galaxy was great until all potential was lost the moment I had to guide one of those darn red spinning topmen around several open holes and do this while avoiding these VERY annoying, tiny ricocheting type enemies that insist on pushing Mario over the side and to his death. The topmen were more tolerable in the first SMG game. The Battle Belt Galaxy feels more like a practice or beginners course stage for those unfamiliar with the game mechanics and the way Mario travels (star blasts) from one miniature planet to another fighting enemies that are basically generic and overused by this point. Even worse- this stage appears in World 6 near the end of the game! The worst spot to put a level like this. This stage is unnecessary in my opinion and feels incomplete. The Flash Black Galaxy is a total ripoff of an old Donkey Kong Country level where the lights frequently flicker on and off. Same idea here, but at least in the case of the SMG2 level it's saved by unique floating movements by Yoshi. However I found out that sticking to the left the whole time guarantees an easy trip to the launch star- turn right when you reach the top ceiling. Oh well. Some of Bowser's stages are boring. I already mentioned Bowser's Galaxy Generator (the last one) but Bowser's Fiery Flotilla is dreadfully dull and short (as is Bowser Jr's Boom Bunker which isn't even a stage really).Much to the displeasure of thousands (if not millions) the rolling starball levels are back and more complex than ever! Oh and get this- while riding and maneuvering the ball you actually have to push chomp heads off platforms. No kidding. You can probably sit there and imagine how difficult this is, however nothing and I mean NOTHING is harder than the purple coin mission where you're rolling down a steep rainbow-colored hill at lightning speed and forced to collect (if memory serves) 100 out of 110 coins. This means you can only miss 10 coins while riding that horrendous starball and trust me, it's VERY difficult. You better believe you're in for a rude awakening with this stage, haha. I wish the bubbles and stingray race levels from the first Galaxy made a return. They were awesome, however in Galaxy 2 you get gliding levels with tedious and jerky movements. The backgrounds may be beautiful (especially the dark green trees and peaceful flowing rivers in Wild Glide Galaxy) but the frustratingly SUPER slow control movements of the actual gliding makes it hard for me to enjoy these stages. I REALLY wish you could pick up speed by simply holding down the A button. Instead, speed increase occurs by pointing the Wii remote down but... depending on the mission, sometimes this isn't reliable enough to gain enough speed. If you remember stingray racing was fairly simple since the object was to just make it to the goal in under 3 minutes. I wonder if the generous 3-minute expectation is because Nintendo thought people would struggle to just keep the stingray on the slippery and narrow water track? We'll never know the reason for such a generosity. Anyway, back to the rolling starball level with the chomp head. Get this- you actually have to re-do this stage if you want the extra star, and this time you're TIMED! As if maneuvering the starball wherever you want it to go isn't difficult enough. It's a nightmare, trust me! Still, the requirement in memorizing the ramps in Rolling Coaster Galaxy is necessary in order to collect 100 purple coins which easily makes it the second hardest level in the game.Yoshi is a decent addition but he's not as frequently available as you'd probably expect given all the hype he's received from the numerous online reviews you've probably read. He's in a few levels though, and while he's there he's certainly fun. An extremely easy and effective way to get rid of enemies maybe, but fun. Mindlessly and constantly tapping the B button makes using Yoshi WAY too easy. You'll find out what I mean when you play the game. Otherwise I can take or leave him. The powerups are somewhat cool, such as the boulder that can charge into (and break) heavy objects. I like this one the most because crashing into objects feels impactful and adrenaline-rushing. There's a boulder level where you have to jump over a series of platforms and it's probably going to result in over 100 deaths until you complete it. This is all because of one tricky part at the very end where you have to roll into a bouncy thing that makes you go in a completely different direction, and then forward up the path to the star. You have to accomplish this without rolling off the side. It's incredibly hard believe me. Some people complain about the stiff controls, but to me it's understandable that controlling a boulder would be difficult. The drill is alright I guess. You can dig through the soil and land on the other side of the planet. This is used in a fairly clever way on a few occasions- you can take out enemies and bosses by popping out of the soil underneath their bodies for a nifty attack. However it's a severely limited powerup used mainly for just these two purposes. The honey bee makes a return as well, and it's exactly the same. With all this said, I REALLY don't understand what makes the cloud flower so appealing to the masses. It's really not that fun skipping through several portions of a level by creating/floating on clouds; just convenient. It's used WAY too many times throughout the game as well. Yes I realize the main purpose of the cloud flower is to be able to reach the really high or far out areas needed to collect certain important items, but come on, it's definitely not very exciting to actually *use* and fans are clearly overrating it. Perhaps the ice flower not being included this time around is a minor disappointment because it was pretty fun bouncing off walls and waterfalls with it, but at least the classic fire flower has remained. I enjoy the return of the hammer brothers even if they only appear in a few spots. They're much easier to handle in a 3D environment since the main challenge you faced in the older games was making sure you were able to successfully jump over (or run under) them without eating a hammer for your troubles. Now you can simply counter their moves by walking to their side (thank you 3D world!) and spin attacking them into pieces, easily avoiding the tossed hammers.Like I mention above, those dreaded purple coin missions are back and you may have already guessed- some of them are really a chore and time-consuming to play. One mission (Flip-Swap Galaxy) has Mario flipping through platforms while trying to avoid electric beams and rolling chomp heads which is a REALLY high challenge that requires accuracy of the highest extent. You can't make a single mistake either. In another level (Clockwork Ruins Galaxy) Mario collects coins while riding a few clockwise-rotating wooden or stone structure, and what makes it annoying is the way the rotation plays tricks with your mind- you WILL mess up, slide off and fall to your death. Guaranteed. Oh and what's now considered one of the hardest levels of all-time from the first Galaxy (Luigi's Purple Coins) returns, however now it's been dumbed down- the golden platforms no longer flip over. It still has the \"step onto once and they disappear for good\" green platforms, however. More or less the same idea returns, but now it's tame in comparison. The purple coins are easily within reach now. They threw in Mario clones (enemies that follow Mario's every movement- don't touch them) but they hardly ever interfere with your focus to collect the coins. I guess Nintendo received some hate mail from fans voicing their displeasure with the trickiness of Luigi's Purple Coins so they toned it down for the sequel, haha. The Yoshi mad dash purple coin mission in Starshine Beach Galaxy is fun but it's over before you can even blink your eyes, and the one purple coin mission where you're underground and encouraged to move quickly in order to avoid the Mario clones and grab the bunches of coins grouped together sitting on the small steps is another *extremely* short one. We're talking less than 30 seconds here for *both* missions. Not sure why the latter even exists- it's practically the definition of bland.Let's not kid ourselves however- the hardest stage by FAR (called Grandmaster Galaxy) is 100% guaranteed to have gamers pulling the precious hair out of their head. You have to go through six EXTREMELY difficult portions of the stage without taking a SINGLE hit. Let's break down how challenging this really is. First you have to carefully twirl your way around several floating rocks, paragoombas and torpedoes with Yoshi's tongue while being in the air the whole time, then you must step on several extra large blue platforms and make them turn yellow in order to open the launch star without eating two homing electric beams for your troubles, then you must make several cloud flowers and float over a series of electric beams that occupy the top and bottom of the screen with a few tricky spots in between, then you must properly figure your way through a series of red/blue flipping platforms while avoiding homing fireballs, laser rings and more electric beams (INCREDIBLY hard)... then you find yourself surrounded by even MORE trickily placed electric beams and paragoombas using the pull stars, and the hardest part of all comes last- dealing with quite a few insistently vicious hammer and boomerang brothers. Luck is pretty much the only way you'll make your way through a neverending swarm of spinning boomerangs and hammers in the final segment. In fact these obstacles are so difficult I just pretend the daredevil portion of this stage doesn't exist and settle with 241 stars. If you know what's good for your sanity, you'll take my advice and avoid this stage like the plague. It makes the Japanese version of Super Mario Bros. 2/Lost Levels a cakewalk in comparison. The good news is that you're given the option to play through this stage the normal way (without the \"one hit you're dead\" way) which is STILL really hard regardless.The good news is that the very best level in the game hands down smears ALL the levels from the first Super Mario Galaxy- Tall Trunk's Purple Coin mission. This is easily the most exciting and coolest level ever for a Mario game. It's a fast-paced race... on feet! Is it sort of challenging properly landing your jumps, avoiding crawling wigglers and collecting enough coins? Absolutely. Is it fun? Absolutely! I'm also rather fond of a few mini games. The 5,000-point boulder/bowling mini game is a highlight, and especially the ones where you have to jump on enemies heads and produce enough points to reach 10,000. These ones in particular are *awesome* and a very useful way of temporarily bringing back the point system. I never cared for gaining enough points in the older Mario games since the only reward was achieving a really high score and bragging rights for beating your friends record highs, but now -with this challenge- there's a clear and exciting purpose in getting enough points. There's a 10,000 point mini game in the water where you can ride a koopa shell and destroy ghosts and weeds that's equally as much fun. The ice skating point games involving a monkey are pretty cool (but the second one that requires 600 points is WAY too hard). I also really love the missions where you only have less than a minute to take out a pack of octoombas in Shiverburn and Flash Black Galaxy. On the negative, I really miss the cosmic Luigi races from the first SMG game. They sort of remind me of Super Mario Kart but on feet. Also, the robot mini games this time around are honestly rather simple- you have to destroy a bunch of crates using a fire flower in under 30 seconds. A shallow game compared to the demanding bomb-tossing accuracy and short time limit that the robot requires out of the player in the first Super Mario Galaxy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2011"}

This tends to make gameplay focus more on moving armies around and attacking, as opposed to defending.More options in terms of age advancement (all the way to the information age), which is more akin to Empire Earth than AOE.More emphasis placed on cities, the number of which directly impact your resource gathering.There is a ramp-up cost for units, so they get more expensive as you purchase them (and thus, it's harder to build a big army). Same goes for buildings, so you can't spam the map with forts and towers.Different nations actually have different capabilities aside from special units. For example, some get resource gathering bonuses for certain raw materials. Certain nations favor specific tactical situations, such as the Spanish or English for naval combat and the Germans for land combat.In single player, the strategic map mode. The presence of a turn-based map and real time battles makes this game somewhat similar to the Total War series. However, the strategic mode is significantly simpler than that of any Total War game, and of course there's no such thing as building cities during combat in Total War.Upgrades are based on research done at the library, which can be purchased (if you have the resources) regardless of your age. This allows for significant flexibility, though of course you'd be well advised to advance ages in order to get more powerful military units. Age advancement is quite important, and can't be ignored. As in Empire Earth, it's entirely possible to end up strafing your opponent's hapless horse cavalry with jet fighter/bombers. Being on the opposite end of such an arrangement is rather embarrassing.There are a host of units available to every nation, though some are more effective for certain nations than others. These are usually unique units that replace the standard ones, and come with their own distinct look. The normal units also have different looks depending on your nation, though some share the same graphics. This makes the battlefield look somewhat segregated by nationality, though in fact most of the units are statistically identical.The computer has a good range of difficulty levels and acts very similar to the AI in Age of Empires. They'll still swarm you with scouts and try to attack with a handful of bowmen at the beginning. Sometimes they charge stupidly at an incredibly fortified position and get cut down by the score. However, they do often remember to bring artillery, which is at least an improvement. At higher difficulty (with handicaps) it can get pretty rough. This is especially the case if you allow the game to go up to the modern age, since they can and will use nukes on you (in fact, they seem to save up just for that).You can own multiple wonders, and each adds resource or other bonuses to your side. These can really come in handy, especially later in the game.The game has great graphics, good music and sound, and is very stable. Internet games, though lacking the strategic mode, are quite fun and also stable. There are many different multiplay modes and a host of rules to play around with. The random map generator is also great, as it was in AOE. Multiplay also has a lot of fun diplomacy options. This is more than can be said for many other RTS games.There are downsides to the game, though. I found the time limits in single player campaign mode to be irritating, unrealistic, and often unnecessary. There should be a way to disable them. The unit cap is set at 200 (270 or so with rare resources and wonders) and that is a bit too low. With the amount of citizens you'll have running around getting resources, it doesn't make for a very big army. Although the paper-rock-scissors nature of the units is very pronounced, it does seem that hording one kind of unit works just as well as making a balanced army. The only difficulty is figuring out which unit that is. For example, light infantry in the gunpowder age is quite sufficient for taking on anything else. The ramp-up tries to dissuade such tactics, but only partly succeeds. There are clearly some balance issues during specific ages for the various nations, though if one looks at things from an overall perspective, it seems to work out. Last of all, the game is remarkably devoid of voice. In fact, I don't think there's any voice effects save for the taunts. It is a somewhat minor thing, but after playing the likes of Command & Conquer and Warcraft, I had to wonder whether all my soldiers were mutes. The historical aspect of this game is also significantly watered down from Age of Empires- many of the unique national units don't even exist in reality.All in all, I must say that there was remarkably little to complain about in this game. It has several innovative RTS features (e.g. national borders, attrition damage, and Armageddon) and has some actual strategy in it (the `real time strategy' genre is largely misnamed- most games in it are tactical, not strategic). The appeal of being able to roll over your opponent's spear-chucking ancient warriors with main battle tanks is quite a motivation to keep playing multiplayer, and the conquer-the-world mode has awesome replay value. Though Rise of Nations may not be the thing for a hardcore turn based strategy gamer, it's definitely great RTS material and is worth checking out either way.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2004"}

You briefly control Samus, fighting him off and then escaping the space station before it explodes. You fly to a mysterious planet and here is where the game officially begins.Super Metroid expanded on everything that made the series so revered by introducing brand new elements that appeared in future Metroid games (save portals, map system, new weapons and missiles.) This game is huge so it will keep you busy for hours. The graphics and sounds are excellent and showed what the SNES was capable of. The controls took advantage of the SNES controller since it used every button but after a few minutes, you can control Samus without any problems.'Til this day, I still kick myself for not buying it when I had the chance to. The only thing I was able to do was to download this great game to my Wii from the Virtual Console service. All Nintendo fans, especially Metroid fans should check it out. The SNES had a great, great library of games and this one ranks up near the top.If you didn't play this game before, you should do what I did and it will only cost you $8. That's a bargain considering you will pay plenty more for the original cartridge. It is worth it either way so experience what other Metroid fans have already and see why this title was and is still remembered as an excellent SNES game. ********HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2011"}

The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck.

That's all I can say. Having played through almost everything good for the PS2, and briefly owning an Xbox and selling it because of lack of good games, I recently purchased a gamecube and started playing all the A+ titles that have recieved stunning recommendations by every review. Metroid Prime, Metroid Prime 2, Eternal Darkness, Wind Waker, Super Mario Sunshine, Paper Mario 2, Double Dash and others. I was extremely disappointed. All of them were IMO completely over rated, except for the excellent Metroid Prime. I began to agree with others that the Cube was more of a kiddy system than anything else. Then I picked up RE4, and wow was I amazed.Graphically, RE4 is unsuprassed on the GC. It's one of the best looking titles on any console, nuff said. 10/10Sound wise, there isn't a complaint. The sounds, music and voice acting are all excellent and add to the fear factor. 10/10Gameplay is for the most part excellent. Large, fully explorable environments, a great map, a variety of weapons, excellent bosses, memorable characters and a thrilling experience make RE4 top notch. My only complaint would be that the lack of strafing in the gameplay makes it really difficult during battle. Also, the camera can hamper alot during intense and close battle scenes. They're minor complaints really, and don't spoil the game. 9.5/10For the story, you'd be hard pressed to find something better or more well written. It is compelling and addictive, and the characters are excellent from the charismatic Leon to the very desperado like Luis Sera. My only complaint would be with Ashley. She's very whiny, and there are certain parts where taking care of her and protecting her kill the flow of gameplay. There have been many a time when I've cleared an entire area and had her wait to go take out some enemies up ahead when suddenly she starts screaming because somebody magically appeared and started carrying her away. Also she just crouches down in fear whenever the bad guys get close. No offense, but you've seen a million of these guys and have dealt with them. Shouldn't you get over yourself and grab a gun and start shooting? It adds an interesting element, but the whole \"Damsel in Distress\" deal should've died out with the original Mario game. 9/10Overall, RE4 is simply a masterpiece. From its gripping story and gameplay to its breathtaking graphics, it's a game that's unsurpassed among horror survival games, and renders all other ones including the other RE entries obsolete. It's also one of the best action games I've played along with greats like Devil May Cry, MGS3 and God of War. It can't beat MGS3's story at all in my book, but it's not trying to in the first place. Highly recommended. If you think you might get scared, I personally have never played any horror games besides Eternal Darkness (which I quit after the first 1 hr or so because it was so boring and not scary) and RE4 really isn't scary. It's simply intense and thrilling. If you don't have a GC, I wouldn't buy one for it. It's coming to PS2 this fall, so I would say just get a PS2 and play it then. It's not enough to justify the system purchase, but it's damn good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2005"}

Of course this one gives you an over-the-shoulder point of view of Leon as you struggle to kill the infected folks and the monsters, the action in this game is well paced and quite gory including some exploding heads here. There's Camera moving, hit zone aiming static where you can easily hit the target on the enemy with laser, imaginative creatures that defy nature, a cute blonde girl heroine, and even great cinematic sequences. The Storyline is very good as it gives us something different in the franchise unlike any of the previous games had especially instead of Zombies this time, the music score is just creepy and there's even a few familar faces in this game like Ada Wong. In this game you even get to push buttons during some parts where they command you to and whenever an enemy dies they will give you prizes like money and stuff where you can buy stuff from merchants.The gameplay is quite addictive and it's a hell of alot of fun, this is one of the best games ever made and one of the best i've ever played.

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"must buy for 3DS!","reviewText":"The Nintendo 64 had lots of good games but the hardware didn't hold up over time. The big problem with it was the lack of memory, which led to very blurry graphics. This was a noted problem with the hardware back when the system was out, and it hasn't aged well. You can't escape that smear-o-vision no matter what.That's why we need remakes like Ocarina of Time. This is a great remake. The developers touched up the graphics nicely, keeping them faithful to the old game while not making it look modern. The characters received a nice touch up here as did all the environments. It doesn't look like a modern game but it doesn't look dated the way the original does. I've read that it looks the way you remember it, and I think that is accurate. The 3D effects are nice. It gives the game a cool layer of depth. It's not hugely noticeable for the most part, but it's worth keeping on. The cinemas in particular make excellent use of the 3D, so keep it on for those.The second screen is mainly used to manage the inventory and it keeps everything flowing nicely. I am in the middle of Dragon Age, and it can be tiring to constantly pause the game to juggle the inventory. It'd be great to have a second screen for that game! Well, at least we have one here. Everything else is the same. The thumbpad is up to the task of controlling Link. L-lock is not as intuitive as the Z-lock in the original game, but the Z-lock was used because of the unique N64 controller. The 3DS, like other handhelds (and controllers in general), doesn't have a Z-button. The game still plays fine.I can see why some people would criticize this remake for the lack of extras, but my opinion is that Ocarina of Time does not need extras. Put in movie release terms, this release is like a Blu-Ray remastering of a classic film, not a director's cut. This is fine. Everybody who enjoys games should play this, whether you're an old fan of Zelda (like me, dating back to the NES original) or a newcomer. Ocarina of Time absolutely holds up, it's a great game with excellent mechanics, devious dungeon design, memorable characters, and lots of heart.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2011"}

This has an extra boss fight and other Keyblades that was not in the original US edition.  I have only played the first hour of the first game, and i already have enjoyed it.

Although the PlayStation is no longer the fastest machine on the market, it does boast the broadest selection of software. Some of the hottest console games available today are created exclusively for the PlayStation, including several modern-day video gaming classics (Metal Gear SolidandCrash Bandicootto name a few).The Sony PlayStation truly shines with 3D-rendered action games, such asTomb RaiderandSyphon Filter. These and other 3D-based titles place players in the middle of elaborate gaming environments that take full advantage of the system's ability to render up to 360,000 polygons per second. The PlayStation also has the capability to display 16.8 million colors simultaneously and can support full-frame video playback at 30 frames per second. In addition to impressive graphics, the PlayStation also offers CD-quality sound. Each PlayStation disc has the capacity to store up to 650 MB of data--significantly more information than can be stored on cartridge-based games. As an added bonus, the PlayStation will even play your favorite music CDs (accompanied by a selection of cool graphics).Additionally, the PlayStation now comes packed with Sony's impressive dual shock controller, which allows players to feel every punch, kick, and rumble during gameplay. The controller features dual-analog thumb joysticks and round rubber grips for improved game control and comfort. Separate accessories that could enhance the PlayStation experience include an additional controller--allowing two-player action--and a memory card so players can save their progress in a game.--Brett Atwood","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great gameplay for racing and sports fans","reviewText":"The Sony Playstation was the first main console game to come out with CD games, and the ability to play audio CDs. This gave it the ability to hold more information than a normal cartridge game ... and many games came in multiple CD packs. This equalled longer gameplay and more complexity than the N64 or Sega systems.The Playstation One is a smaller version of the same unit - portable and soon to come out with a portable LCD screen. Both play any game from the Playstation One library. While CDs do hold more data than cartridges, they load a bit more slowly, so often there is a second lag between scenes as the new scene loads into memory.While Nintendo games tend to be pixel based, most Playstation games are polygon based, taking advantage of the Playstation's 360,000 polygons/sec speed. This tends to make images sharper and scaleable. When something moves towards you it's easy to calculate polygons, compared to expanding pixels.There is a good sized library of games for the Playstation - quite a few racing games, plus the Tomb Raider series, the Final Fantasy series, Abe, Spyro the Dragon, and more. The games for the Playstation tend to be for teenagers and adults.We've had a Playstation since it first came out, and for racing and sports games it is incredible. We find we use the N64 far more often when kids are around wanting to play something.Specifications: CPU: 32-bit RISC Clock Speed: 34 Mhz Sound: CD quality, 24-channel stereo Connector: standard 3-plug video/audio connector 640 x 480 (256 x 224 TV units) resolution","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2000"}

Yet with all the hype over CD-ROM game systems like Playstation 2, and Xbox, they all seem to miss something that Nintendo developed years ago, a long lifetime. That has happened since 1989, with Nintendo's Game Boy. It remains as the most successful game system of all time, with well over 1,000 different video games to choose from, if you have the Game Boy Advance. For Nintendo, they made this system into one of the most popular references of Pop culture. Back in 1992, Nintendo developed a way to put the Game Boy games on the big screen, with the Super Game Boy, a device that allowed you to play Game Boy games on the Super Nintendo System. Over a decade later, it seemed to be Deja Vu all over again.The Game Boy Player, a add-on device that allows you to play all different Game Boy Games on television, for the Nintendo Gamecube. This device allows you to play games from all 3 different versions of the Game Boy: the original, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance. The notion makes it all worth while. This is arguably one of the best add-ons ever for any video game system. Although it is expensive as a add-on, it is well worth it, if you want a Game Boy. Althoug many still prefer the portable, if you have a Gamecube, you won't be sorry. You can change all differnt colors and background to make a design for for the system.This has to be one of the best add-on devices ever that Nintendo conjured.

When Panzer Dragoon Orta was announced for the Xbox, I remember a massive cheer of joy coming from both the hardcore gamers and mainstream fans alike. When it was finally released, I was shocked and a little dismayed to read reviews that were more along the lines of \"Mmm, it's pretty good\" than the unchecked gushing that had accompanied previous coverage of the game. What confused me even more was that, when I picked it up, it turned out to be even better than I had hoped for, both as a massive fan of the Panzer series and just as a fan of action games in general. What gives?My guess is people had already projected all their own personal expectations on the game, so much so that there was no way it was going to make everyone happy. Had people been given a more clear-cut picture of just what to expect, I think opinions may have untangled themselves a bit more. At the least, there'd be a lot less used copies of the game for sale a week after its release.So, when the extremely-hyped Ninja Gaiden was released, I was all set to view the game in an unadulterated light. I'd set aside a Sunday and gone back to play the original NES title through to completion (not easy!) and bone up on my Ninja Gaiden history. In short, I wanted to know what I'd be getting into with this game. Would it be the modern-day equivalent of the innovative original, as Team Ninja's head Tomonobu Itagaki was loudly promising? Would it turn out to be a pretty-but-shallow cash-in on a beloved franchise? Somewhere in between, maybe? I felt prepared to make an accurate judgment on what was supposedly going to be a landmark title, so I headed out on its release date and picked it up.After finishing the game a week later, I've come to the conclusion that this is one of the best action games I've ever played in my life. Period.I'm going to basically eschew any discussion on game mechanics or basics regarding the game itself, because those are readily available all over the place for this title. A good summary; the graphics will knock you flat, the music isn't irritating, the voice acting is fine, the game controls like a dream, and yeah, the camera can be a pain until you get used to it. A zoom-out feature would have been nice. It's also not going to win any plot awards, so don't expect to become particularly attached to the characters.When all is said and done, unless you're a fan of honest-to-God, straight up Action titles, then this game isn't going to do it for you. It doesn't matter if you were a fan of the original - I've already read one review on a high profile website sniffing about how the game style was too different the NES version, which the reviewer claimed to have been very good at - you've got to be a willing fan of action games right now, in the modern day, playing by modern day rules. More importantly, you've got to be willing to prove it if you want any enjoyment from this game beyond the menu screen. If you can't get over the fact that there's a third dimension in your Ninja Gaiden, however well implemented, then save yourself the cash and just play the original. There's nothing wrong with that.This game isn't geared towards the mass market any more than Panzer Dragoon was, and if anything it makes far fewer concessions in terms of the commitment it requires from the player in order to enjoy it. Ninja Gaiden is difficult, make no mistake, but not in the \"I have to memorize this level to get through it easily\" sense (a la Contra on the PS2). Had that been the case, then perseverance is a simple matter of trial-and-error, and eventually, anyone could finish the game if they were patient enough.Not here. Simply stated, you can't get through the levels easily, regardless of foreknowledge of enemy placement or anything like that. This is a game that expects the player to be able to keep up with the solid but rapid learning curve, and if they can't, the game will gleefully slap them around - usually really hard - until they either \"get it\" or toss the controller through the screen. In Ninja Gaiden, there isn't what is usually referred to as a \"suck factor\", that is, the game doesn't get any easier depending on how many times the player has died attempting a certain stage.Provided you see all of this as a good thing, then welcome to the best action title in many years. Ninja Gaiden is one of the few games that can genuinely challenge a player without seeming frustrating. If you're stuck somewhere, it's almost always a matter of either taking a different approach, or learning to become better in order to get past. The game is hardly ever \"cheap\", and the few times that it is, it's a purposeful swipe at the player, as if to say \"Yeah, we'll throw three boss battles in a row at you with no save point. If you want to save, start trekking back to the beginning of the level. We'll wait here. Wuss.\" You can't help but grin at that.In addition, the entire Ninja Gaiden NES trilogy is on the disk as a bonus...But expect to work for them. Like everything else here, it's something to strive for, not something they give you.Isn't it better that way?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2004"}

Your teeth are clenched.  \"It's just a little further\" you convince yourself, \"I can make it\".  By the skin of your teeth you've completed your final objective for the current mission.  Now you're headed back to the tram station-and to safety.  But there are still more corridors to traverse, more treacherous rooms to cross before you can get there.  Will your current, depleted stock of ammo hold out?  Will the last blip of health registering on the back your rig be enough to save you just one more time?  What sort of foul abomination lurks around the next corner?  How about the one after?  Welcome to the USG Ishimura.  Welcome, to \"Dead Space\".If you've ever wanted to experience first-hand the sheer terror that Ellen Ripley must've felt as she raced through the darkly lit corridors of the Nostromo-steam erupting all around her and klaxon sirens wailing in her ears, this is the game for you.  Ridley Scott himself couldn't have constructed a better immersive experience-one absolutely brimming with atmosphere, tension, suspense and horror.  This game really puts you there-mind, body and soul, right into the heart of things better than any other game that has come before it.Dead Space is a game of epic scale.  The USG Ishimura is simply a huge ship.  It's not just the Ishimura you'll be traversing either.  In order to complete many of the numerous objectives the game has to offer, you'll be going outside of the ship as well into zero gravity areas.  There are vacuums too, and like everywhere else in the game-these areas are filled with taut suspense.  A meager supply of air is all you have at your disposal and the counter on your back ticks it away by the second.  If you don't move-your death is imminent.Outside of the tension filled game play, Dead Space's most striking quality is its graphics.  Even taking BioShock and Gears of War into consideration, I have never seen a more drop dead gorgeous game on the Xbox 360.  This one is a stunner even on a 19\" analog television.  The production values are simply off the charts.  Every room, every corridor, every creature and human character alike-is rendered in stunning detail.  Keen attention was obviously paid to lighting and atmosphere and a complete sense of environment.  And unlike many other games, there's not one inconsistent section during its 12+ hour duration.  Everything in the game looks like it belongs to the universe that was created for it.  It sounds amazing too with footsteps that clang on metal, creatures that wail and scratch off in the distance, and tense mood music to boot.The only gripes I had with Dead Space were very minor.  For instance-the game can be insanely frustrating at times when you find yourself suddenly locked in a room with precious little ammo and are simply bombarded with a horde of creatures and creature types all at once.  There's another frustrating section where your avatar Isaac is required to hop into a gunner's seat and shoot down a series of asteroids.  This bit in particular was hair-pullingly difficult and aggravating and really brought the pace of the game to a crashing halt.  There's a bit of poorly designed aiming control to consider too during the occasional fights with wall tentacles and during your final face off with a giant beastie.  Completing these segments in particular seemed to be more about luck than skill-and that's just poor game design.  These quips are not enough to really ding the game for too much though-since everything else is about Dead Space is stellar.  Plus its an absolute blast to play.  Dead Space is a top tier game all around and definitely game of the year material.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2008"}

Bradford \"scottfbradford\"","summary":"A fun and well polished game.","reviewText":"I really liked this game.  There is nothing particularly innovative-it feels like a mix of Doom 3, FEAR, Half Life 2, and Bioshock.  But since I liked all those games, this is a good thing.  First off, the game looks really good, about as good as Bioshock.  Second, the controls are smooth and logical.  Third, the game is fun and thrilling.  There are a lot of jump out of your seat moments.  Finally, the story is interesting.The only drawbacks are that the game is pretty linear and there is no multiplayer component.  You get instructions, complete the task, and move to the next job.  I personally prefer this to the more open ended games like Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed, and Far Cry 2.  There's not much replayability-just 3 difficulty levels and a fourth is unlocked after completing the game.  I played on medium, which was just about right.  I never got frustrated, but the boss battles were a tad too easy.  I put in about 14 hours total-not bad.  This is one of the best games I've played on the 360.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2008"}

At its core it is two types of game, a driving and an action game. The driving is simple, easy and a lot of fun. One button to go forward, one to go backward, directional pad left and right to steer, a button to get out and so on. The action part is simple as well, directional pad to run, hold one button to take aim with a gun and another to shoot. There is a jump, run and a button to get into vehicles.Grand Theft Auto 3 is a mission based game yet it is very open world / sandbox. You take on one mission at a time, anything from driving someone from point A to B to slaying a gang or killing someone. Needless to say this is a violent game (guns, blood, car slaughter) with harsh language, drinking and so on. The missions in this game are relatively simple compared to future Grand Theft Auto games like Vice City and San Andreas. Missions are given by characters that are easy to find. The voice acting is good and your character has no voice, so the missions are mostly being ordered around. When you're not in a mission, you can take side missions like driving a taxi, vigilante in a cop car and driving an ambulance.The random fun comes from the sandbox like world. When you commit crimes your wanted level raises, when you have a higher wanted level different forces chase after you. Police, swat, FBI, and the army. Traffic patterns, pedestrials and gangs all contribute to the random chaos that can add to the excitement and enjoyment of your missions or even walking around.There are a few types of weapons, pistols, shotguns, explosives and rifles. But you can only hold one weapon of each type at a time. The vehicles are nice and you can only drive four wheeled vehicles, which is fine, but if you played Vice City before this... it is a step backward.In all, this game is a good game and at the time it was fantastic, but then Vice City and San Andreas came out that surpass this game by leaps and bounds. GTA 3 doesn't have the personality, charm, liscensed music and fun as Vice City or San Andreas. The challenge seems to be more difficult and less fun than those two games as well especially once you get the gangs angry at you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2012"}

Infamous 2 I think addressed and fixed the boring aspects of the first game and has a much more interesting level design as you are playing in a New Orleans inspired town as opposed to the very Urban like Empire city in Infamous. Some of the music is pretty good, reminds me of the very southern style music from True Blood, and with the Infamous 2: Festival of blood DLC game, I can only imagine they had some inspiration to emulate this in Infamous 2. This game is fun. Everything you liked about Infamous has been brought to Infamous 2, and everything you didn't like has been fixed. The graphics are improved and the game has a cool look to it.

Flaws such as the abysmal combat system. You can't aim at anything! The tank controls don't help either so you always end up dying CONSTANTLY, and with a lack of health and ammo you'll toss your PS1/PS2/PS3/PSP out the window. The other flaw is the level design. Everything is so confusing and it's so easy to get lost. The map doesn't help one bit because all it does is highlight the hallway that you are in red and you have to decipher what doors go where.Another thing that doesn't help is the game's pace...it's sooooooo slow! When you open a door or walk up stairs the animations talk forever to finish, menu are slow, text is not skippable. Another flaw is the laughable and hideous voice acting. They actors sound like they're fresh out of remedial drama, while the live action cut scenes are just as bad. The only good part about RE is the story, enemies, and the amount of gore there is. While DC offers vibration, uncensorship, and a few game play tweaks it's not worth it. RE4 was my first RE and going back to this is just awful.

What I mean by that is each game has differences. Resistance 3 is my personal choice middle game of the three on the PS3. Meaning its better than Resistance 2, but not as good as the first. It is fantastically stunning with its visuals and weapon system while containing amazing environments that prove the PS3s processing power. Sadly this game fell short in major category: the story. This game is so short that if I play it from beginning to end, starting from when I wake up at around 8, I'll most likely be done in the middle of the afternoon. There is only 6 locations and each one is very linear. This game felt like it was just a game to be put out without much effort behind it and that is extremely disappointing because this comes from Insomniac, a company that has not ONCE made no worse than a good game. Sadly, this is that game. It just feels like someone said 'okay the way Resistance 2 ended there MUST be a third but lets not be enthusiastic about it.'Pros:+ This game is just gorgeous, no matter how you slice it.+ The weapons are just awesome and the weapon wheel is really convenient.+ Love the 'this is it' feel.Cons:- Not for the faint of heart- Really REALLY short- Can be very difficult at timesIn summary, this is a good game but its not the first Resistance (7/10)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYXSW","description":"","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"Frustrating Boring Game","reviewText":"The idea and presentation of this game is very interesting, but it's ultimately brought down by the inaccuracy of the Kinect. I constantly found myself just waving my left hand around until all of the enemies were highlighted and I could wave my right hand to kill them. Then for the on-rails portion holding your hand out and trying to direct the puppet was annoying and difficult. I was surprised that the game was pretty difficult at times, but that was only because of the crappy controls. If you could instead play the game with a controller, the gameplay would be so easy boring and simplistic that it would barely be a game. Ultimately, what any developer should remember when making a Kinect game is that you have to make sure the actions the player perform are actually fun to do. Here, they simply aren't fun, especially when the Kinect can't accurately pick up your hand motions. I couldn't play the entire game, as it was incredibly repetitive, but I just really didn't like it.

The only other mario game since then (of big title) has been Super Mario Sunshine, which held similar appeal but didn't deliver as well.Mario Galaxy comes in with the classic Mario scenerio: Bowser in the opening scene as he captures Princess Toadstool.  Mario must collect Stars to unlock various parts of the game in order to get closer to the final goal, similar as with Mario 64 and Sunshine.  In the same styles as well, Mario will re-enter the same area multiple times (Painting in mario 64, Galaxies in this one).  Each time there is a different objective and another path used to obtain various stars.  This structure hasn't changed since Mario 64, and Nintendo shows how it still works great.  Also tossed into the game are various new mechanics (or rather unique) that some might find similar to various Mario Party games.  In some way, each level has a particular mechanic which gets observed.  Mario rides a manta ray like a snow board down a watery shoot without edges, and this scenerio uses a completely different control.  Similarly, when mario jumps ontop of a rolling ball and has to move around holes and precarious edges over bottomless pits, again using completely different controls.  These new mechanics are not overly used but add challenge and a fun break in the gameplay to enjoy something different.Mario Galaxy's unique mechanic that differs from other mario games is its use of gravity, as done in variou games used today.  Basically, sometimes you'll have Mario running around on the surface of a ball floating in space that isn't much bigger than a house, often times larger.  The game uses this in every level in some way.  It can be quite trippy if you long jump over the edge of a small platform and find yourself being slung around to the other side.This also means that the game has a lot of moments when you are controlling mario upside down or as he is walking on a wall.  The camera usually remains still in these moments to leave you with a single orientation, but it can get disorienting when the camera freely moves with you.  The controls during this game are based on the camera.  Whichever moves mario further down screen is Down (except with swimming).The controls are similar to Mario 64 and Sunshine.  The only things that are missing are the belly flop, sort of like a dive head first, and the punch.  The Wii remote also controls a cursor on the screen which is used to collect \"star bits\" and to throw said star bits at enemies and allies.  The Luma allies cutely respond to being hit with a star bit as if it is a tasty treat.  Goombas don't react that way.  The new movement added to the game which plays a big role is the spin, which is used.  You'll also see a return of the Fire Flower, the power up mushroom (which doubles your life from 3 to 6).The game itself isn't overly challenging, especially to the experienced Mario player.  Anyone that has played Mario 64 or Sunshine will adapt to the controls like riding a bike.  I personally adapted to the gravity mechanic very easily.  I can see that this game was made with nintendo's mind on younger gamers as they usually do.  However, it does contain optional challenges and \"hidden\" goals within each level that would require a patient player at least.I really enjoyed this game and would recommend it to any casual gamer as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2008"}

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A frustrating experience","reviewText":"The Good: Beautiful art style, engaging and gripping story, replying to text messages is actually fun!, decent voice acting, interesting choice systemThe Bad: Infuriating puzzle levels, not much gameplay outside of that, a little on the short side, control issuesI usually regret playing Atlus games because they are frustrating and difficult experiences. The games are usually excellent, but the difficulty always leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. I have only been able to complete a couple of Atlus games due to this. Catherine is no different, but shouldn't be taken lightly. RPG fans stay away. If you just want to experience the story go on YouTube. This is for hardcore puzzle fans only. I mean the hardest of core puzzle gamers. This game will leave you infuriated, angry, full of rage, and probably with a few smashed controllers. The game is plagued with issues, but for some reason there's the story that makes you want to see the end. Thankfully the game isn't very long. Just prepare the video walkthroughs because you will need them.This experience is coming from someone who hates these kind of puzzles. This game is completely to taste. I hate block pushing puzzles, but here we are with a very deep game that includes these. The first three stages aren't that bad. Starting at stage 4 things get frustrating and forget about progressive difficulty. First off, the story is very engaging and it's a love story. A man named Vincent Brooks is in love with a girl named Katherine and she wants him to marry her. Suddenly a sultry seductress named Catherine comes along and somehow Vincent wakes up with her naked next to him. The rest of the game is him trying to hide each Katherine from each other.The story gets tense in spots like any well written drama. When you are in the Stray Sheep bar you will receive text messages on your phone that you can reply to. Be careful because this will affect your morality meter which will impact the way Vincent handles inner conflict. I had a lot of fun replying to these texts because it's almost like you are actually doing it and in this relationship yourself. Atlus did a great job bringing you into this problem. Of course every night when Vincent dreams you are brought to an area where you climb an endless tower of blocks with other sheep, and that's where you start to hate or love the game.I can't really explain the methods of all the block pushing because there are over a dozen that you learn throughout the game. You can push blocks horizontally, but it's not so simple. There are other types of blocks like heavy ones, ice, traps, randomly changing, and other blocks that will make your life hell. It was nigh impossible to figure most of these out without a video walkthrough because otherwise you will be restarting dozens of times due to trial and error. To make things harder the stage is crumbling underneath you. To make things even tougher you are awarded medals at the end. The only way to get gold is to keep your step multiplier up throughout the whole level and never mess up. Sure, there are checkpoints every so often, but I had such a tough time that even the video walkthroughs didn't help some times.There are items you can pick up that help that create one extra block, allow you to jump 2 blocks, kill enemies, and turn all blocks to normal. You can pick up coins along the way to increase your score as well. At the end of each stage there is a boss that you must run from and tries to kill you. These changed up the pace, but just made things even more frustrating. You just can't catch a break during these puzzle levels. Even the controls are terrible with reversed control when crawling around behind the blocks, delays, and strange quirks that will make you die just because of control problems.I really felt like this was a puzzle game with a love story wrapped around it. The game is tough, and I highly suggest a rental first because most people won't even finish this game. Don't think this is something like Pushmo with a reset button. Some levels take over ten minutes to complete. There is a co-op mode you can unlock, but all you will do is lose friendships. The best parts are the story in between and questions that you answer that even make you question the way you view romanticism and maybe even your own relationship. I even liked how you could see how other people answered. Besides these puzzles and answering text messages, there is no other gameplay apart from talking to people.Overall, Catherine is a love/hate thing. Puzzle fans will fall in love with this, but RPG and other genre fans will hate it. I only hated the puzzle stages, but loved the story. With the puzzle levels being 90% of the game I can't really give this a higher score even if I wanted to. It is gripping, exciting, steamy, and can go any way. The anime cut scenes are beautifully done, and even the English voice acting is tolerable, but I would have preferred the Japanese voices with English subtitles. If you insist on wanting to know the story and characters, rent this and keep a video walkthrough handy, and maybe a spare","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2012"}

Ok finally took me a week to beat this mess. i want spoil anything. one thing that never changed regardless of how many upgrades you do is the freaking slowness of reloading and health refilling. Yeah they tried to make it real as possible I guess but it's not fun. you in a middle of a gun fight with some big gunner then a guy snipping you that takes 4 bars of life from you you quickly run for cover and boom someone on the side throws something like a rock at you and you're dead because it takes 10 seconds to heal yourself unless you train yourself to have meds on you at all time otherwise if using the self-free heal it takes 10 seconds to heal yourself. Then reloading/switching weapons in a middle of a all out war is so slow. lets say you running with a rocket launcher then all a sudden enemies come from the side of you you have to just freaking switch to a weapon that fits that situation omg just forget it it's annoying!! I died so many times because I ran into a fight upclose with the wrong weapons or a freaking bug landing on my shoulders before i can reheal myself(not actually just saying you are so sensitive to things in this game)....Now the story? meh i would give it a 4, matter fact everything gets a 4 except the stupid weapon system/healing system thingy.. Yeah they only had like 7 different animals you can catch on here(ouch) maybe 7 different unique enemies(ouch) the A.I. feels outdated as when you walk beside someone they always say the same phrase every 1 minute.....(Not Spoiling) the ending was meh, i went to go get some chocoalte milk and the credits was starting so don't expect a long cry me a river like ending, because after all that hollywood blowing up crap and jumping this and that to get to the end before time runs out all they give you is a 2 minute ending. Welp! i'm likely heading back to Call of duty this game wasn't good as i thought as i thought it would have more exploring to do that effects gameplay, skyrim still is the king of exploring and leveling your character with hours of hours of gameplay. The endOld review below----------ok i'm on like day 5 of playing this hillbilly game(lol joking) its fun i'll give it that. it looks like there is only like 3 types of enemies you encounter all enemies are wearing red shirts, what is this a ps2 game? now another thing is if you are coming from skyrim than this may feel a bit of a downgrade(ouch) far as the leveling system but gameplay is up to par with Skyrim. You have to go around collecting random stuff to upgrade say your weapon carry limits, your health bar, your item carry limits. so the adventuring part of the game consist of running around finding goats and pigs and plants,etc to upgrade most of your items. You will encounter about 3 distinctqish*(if that's the word)animals. so far i've seen fat bears, tigers and birds other than that that looks like that's it unless later on in the game they appear more because this is off 5 days i've gotten pretty far in the game but i'm just speaking on the roaming part of the game I haven't put my full attention on the story yet.. But yeah you will likely spend most of your time fetching parts to upgrade your carrying load as i'm sure if all this was giving in the beggining than this would of been just a regular FPS game with a open world. The opening of the game do set the mood for you to want to play so yeah I will say this game is up there with fallout and borderlands but it's not a Skyrim or Uncharted game that makes you feel like you're playing a high priced luxury game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B008AU4YEA","description":"","reviewerName":"Alexander Lucard","summary":"An Excellent Platformer...Even For Those of Us Who Normally Hate the Genre.","reviewText":"If you're a long time reader of me over at Diehard GameFAN, then you know platformers and driving games are my two least favorite genres. Now that doesn't mean there aren't games in each genre I enjoy. Take platformers for existence, since that's what this review is on. I love the first two Sonic games, Super Mario Bros. 3, The Haunted Mansion, Psychonauts, NiGHTS, The Legendary Starfy, A Boy and His Blob, The Kore Gang and several others. However the only platforming franchise I can honestly say I've enjoyed every game of is the Rayman series. Whether it was playing the original on my Atari Jaguar (I'm old) to getting Rayman Origins as a freebie for my Vita by being a member of Playstation Plus, I've always enjoyed the franchise, even if I've never purchased a game for full retail price. So when I was sent a review copy of Rayman Legends for the Wii U, I was more than happy to review it. I'm happy to say I had a lot of fun with the game and that it's one of the best platformers I've played in years. So let's overlook that Ubisoft says the game failed horribly in terms of meeting sales expectations and the big dramarama that occurred when it was announced the game would no longer be a Wii U exclusive. Instead, let's look at why the game is so good and why you should pick it if you haven't already.We should start with the plot. Of course, this being an old school style platformer, there isn't much of one. I mean, how many times does a Mario game involve stopping King Koopa and/or saving the princess, right? In that same vein, Rayman Legends is very shallow in regards to story. Like many Rayman games, you're just jumping around through levels collecting lums saving a race of creatures called the Teensies from various perils. You'll also save a few princesses here and there. Eventually you fight the big bad and then after the credits roll, you get a lot of postgame content. Don't be fooled by the filminess of the plot though. After all, you don't play a Rayman game for the story.No, where Rayman Legends makes up for story is with the sheer bulk of content it through at you. There are roughly 120 levels to the game, most of which are unlocked as you collect lums and Teensies. There are regular platforming levels, auto side-scrolling levels, character assist levels (where you play as Murfy and you use the GamePad to help the player character get through the stage), levels where you unlock princesses, boss fights and even remixed levels from Rayman Origins. There's still more content. You can early lottery tickets to unlock more levels, paintings, collectible creatures and there are even rhythm based levels. Crazy! Besides all of this, there are daily and weekly challenges in which you try to set a high score while competing against other gamers from around the world. Get a high enough score and you get a prize. That's a great way to ensure the replay value of a game. Of course, the challenges only work if you have a constant online connection going. There's even a local multiplayer player of soccer called Kung Foot. The end result is arguably the biggest and most expansive platformer I've ever encountered. Sure most of the levels reuse the same themes, enemies and motifs, but each \"world\" is noticeably different from the last and the sheer amount of content means you will easily get your money's worth out of this game if you're even remotely a platforming fan.Visually, Rayman Legends is pretty, but nothing mind blowing or graphics intensive. The colours and bright and crisp, and the backgrounds are highly detailed, but the same enemies and obstacles are reused regularly and the character models are much the same as they have always been - just not in HD. Character model animations are limited as well, but you're moving constantly and the focus on getting through the level, so you won't be tied down to nitpicking the graphics. Sure the game isn't a graphical masterpiece, but what's on the screen is sure to delight Rayman fans. That's what matters.Aurally, the game is similar. There is little to no voice acting which much of the sound coming from sound effects, audio tracks or noises characters make when they are hit. So for gamers who like games that hire name actors to play characters in their games - sorry, Rayman Legends is not for you. What you will find here though are some entertaining background tracks that won't get stuck in your head, but do compliment the levels of the game nicely. The sound effects are varied and well done, ensuring that your auditory experience with Rayman Legends will be an entertaining one.Gameplay wise, Raymanis very simple, sticking to the basics. You have a button to jump with that can also be used to fly if you hold it down. You have an attack button. You have a run button. There you go. That's it. It's a side scroller too so no worries about horrible camera angles or weird depth perception issues. So anyone can learnt he controls with just a few seconds of the game. However exploring the many levels of Rayman Legends, finding all the hidden areas, collecting all the Teensies and earning gold cups will require mastering the controls and that will take you some time. I was really happy to see. I could make it through the first few levels earning a gold cup for them, but then as the game went on, I noticed the difficulty just ramped up big time. Towards the end with the highest difficulty levels I stopped trying to get everything on my first run through and just concentrated on getting through the level alive. Now you do have unlimited lives and there are a lot of checkpoints in levels, so you should be able to get through this game fairly easy, but beating Rayman Legends and 100%ing Rayman Legends are two VERY different things. To 100%, you're going to be to be a truly top tier platform gamer and you will have to replay levels multiple times to make sure you get all the lums and Teensies. The end result is a simple to learn game that will still constantly test your mettle while allowing you to decide if you just want to plow through the game or if you want to see just how close to getting all 700 Teensies you can get.You also have the Murfy levels which are played via the GamePad. Here you will try and move obstacles out of the main character's way. You'll tap on enemies to stun them, swipe through ropes to cut down obstacles, lift and lower platforms along with various other activities. The Murfy levels are my favorite part of the game as it makes wonderful use of the Wii U's GamePad and showcases just why you should get this game for the Wii U over other systems.In terms of replay, I can't think of a platformer that offers this much. You have 120 levels, daily amnd weekly challenges, 700 teensies to collect, a ton of playable characters to unlock (my favorites are Barbara and plumper Rayman) and you can easily spend hours upon hours with this game without repeating any content. I know that when the Daily Challenge is a Murfy level, I end up spending an hour straight just ensuring I get a silver or gold cup on those. The game is massive time sink not just because of the sheer amount of content, but the quality of it as well.So we should probably discuss the appeal factor of the game as it's an odd duck. I mean, I generally hate most platformers but I loved Rayman Legends and had a hard time putting it down. Yet the game didn't sell very well at all. Part of it is because the game plays best on the Wii U and Ubisoft made the core Nintendo and Rayman fan based more than a little annoyed by trying to cover their bases and make the game a multisystem release. As such, PS3 and 360 owners could get the game, but they knew it wasn't optimized for their system, so why bother? Meanwhile a noticeably vocal contingent of message board visiting, Wii U owning Rayman fans made it clear they wouldn't be buying the game for various reasons and the Vita version was released incomplete. So Ubisoft kind of shot itself in the foot and might have driven gamers away in their attempt to raise sales figures. Oops. In the end, a good portion of gamers who would have loved Rayman Legends didn't pick it up, which is a shame and hopefully something that will be rectified as the price drops and word of mouth grown. Again, this is my least favorite genre in gaming and I loved this thing. However it could be that Rayman Legends is more a game for people who don't like platformers and thus hardcore fans of the genre might not enjoy it as much. I can't honestly speak to that; all I can say is that I had a blast with it and it's probably my favorite Wii U game so far. Of course I've only kept five games for my Wii U so far - Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper, Batman Arkham City Armored Edition, Fist of the North Star 2, Tekken Tag Tournament II and this.In the end, Rayman Legends did everything I wanted from a platformer - tight gameplay while keeping the mechanics down to a managed minimum, a ton of content with a lot of replay value and some decent graphics and audio. Is there room for improvement? Sure, there is in any game, but it's sad to see such a nicely done platformer sell as poorly as it did. Who knows? Maybe this review will create some second hand buzz and help convince you to pick it up. I nearly missed it myself and had I not received the game as a review copy through the Amazon Prime program. I probably wouldn't have touched it until it was in the bargain - and even that that is a big maybe. I'm glad I didn't miss out on Rayman Legends though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2013"}

Denick","summary":"Wonder, whimsy, and oodles of smiles- Rayman continues his reign as the King of Color","reviewText":"Holy macaroni... what a vivid, imaginative, and colorful universe this limbless fellow lives in!I was a huge fan of Rayman Origins, which was released two years ago. At that time, I considered it to be the best 2D platformer in the history of gaming, and I believe that has remained true - until now. Ubisoft has done gamers everywhere a huge service by improving upon their remarkable formula in every possible way, and delivering a game that's even BETTER than the awesome platformer that is Origins.Foremost, the visuals of Legends need to be addressed. One of the best things about Origins was that it looked like you were controlling a cartoon, which resulted in terrific animations, slapstick comedy, bizarre spectacles, and OODLES of SMILES. I would have been perfectly happy if this sequel looked exactly like Origins, but somehow the developers have made it look even better. The graphics in this game POP like nothing I've ever seen before, and it looks even more like an animated movie than ever. Graphics generally have little to do with actual gameplay, but in the case of the Rayman games, their whimsical presentation has a direct correlation with the end result (that being fun, laughter, and wonder), so they do have a big impact here. This game is a visual treat, and I predict that it will be impervious to the \"aging\" that most games suffer from, because the art direction is so marvelously realized.Though Legends' graphics may make this game look a tad childish, do not be deceived - this is a meticulously designed platformer that offers tremendous challenges. Furthermore, if you study the layout of the levels and practice, you will discover that there is an incredible amount of sophistication here. As far as I can tell, EVERY level can be played in one swift movement, with no hesitation whatsoever - if you have the skill to memorize the patterns and the reflexes to guide you (which comes in handy when attempting to complete time challenges). I am blown away by the amount of care that the designers put into this game. I don't see any \"shortcuts\" or evidence of \"going through the motions\" to fill out content.And on the subject of content, there is a staggering amount here. The campaign alone is very long, particularly for a 2D platformer, but what makes the game infinitely larger is the amount of additional challenges and collectibles. Multiplayer is also a blast, and I can have fun playing Legends with less experienced gamers. Though it is far harder to complete challenges when I have other gamers along for the ride, that's not what it's about - it's about having fun and watching Rayman and Globox slap each other silly.It bears mentioning that you can have anybody play this game with you, from a five-year-old to your granny. There is no violence other than the \"cartoon\" variety, and it's a huge departure from the glut of ultra-violent titles that have saturated the market in recent years. To me, this is a wonderful, beautiful break from the norm. No longer do you have to worry about \"headshots\" and the other staples of the shooter genre, but you can focus on the types of things that made us enjoy games when we were younger: a sense of wonder, whimsy, and the relentless pursuit of fun.Please note that I play this game on PS3 and Vita, but I am posting my review (of Legends' content) for all consoles, because I feel this game deserves major credit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2013"}

Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons).

{"product_name":"B002B1TDV8","reviewerName":"Scott","summary":"not necessarily the best but certainly the most original DS game on the market today","reviewText":"I've had about two weeks to thoroughly delve into Scribblenauts now, and I can honestly say it is the most original game for the Nintendo DS I have ever played, and possibly one of the best console games in the last five years.  The reason for that is because it is a radical departure from every single game ever made, in that it doesn't challenge your dexterity or button-pushing skill like FPS and action games, and doesn't rely at all on random number generators or luck, like a lot of strategy games; but instead, challenges your imagination and creativity.  This is a great game for any age that enjoys puzzle games, and if I had to recommend just one game for a new DS owner to show off the abilities of their console, this would be it.  Having fully \"completed\" the levels long ago, I am still enjoying it just as much as when I first got it.GAMEPLAYThe premise to this puzzle game is to complete puzzles to collect a \"starite.\"  You do this by using the stylus to write nouns to help you complete your objective.  A simple example would be a level where the starite is separate from you by a moat.  You could write \"bridge\" and a bridge would appear.  Place it over the moat, walk over to the starite, and you've just completed the level.  While that sounds very simplistic and like a boring example, that is because the solution you chose is simplistic and boring, and you will be scored accordingly.  The game's tagline: \"Write Anything, Solve Everything,\" refers to the ability to almost literally write ANYTHING.  One of the first things that will amaze you upon starting this game, is how virtually unlimited the Scribblenauts dictionary is.  The dictionary contains an amazing 22,802 words.  While some of these are duplicates that spawn the same item (such as \"computer\" and \"Internet\"), that means that the Scribblenauts team created animations and graphics for almost 22,802 objects.  With the exception of a lot of proper nouns, copyrighted objects, and graphic/adult nouns, almost ANY object you can think of can be summoned.  I played for 2 days before finding a noun it didn't recognize.  Need a plate of spaghetti to complete a puzzle?  It's in there.  What about a stapler, carpet, a zebra, a tightrope, and a button?  All in there.  I was amazed when I decided to try the word \"harness\" and it came up, since it's such a generic and specific object.  Who would even think to include that?  The Scribblenauts team is who.  You will find yourself becoming giddy at discovering some of the objects available to you.  One of the more well known is that you can summon the Necronomicon (a fictional book appearing in horror stories by H.P. Lovecraft).  Not sure what to do with it?  Summon a necromancer and watch him interact with the Necronomicon and start chanting.  This can be particularly useful if you summoned a zombie earlier, and need to get rid of it because it is running around and turning everyone else on the screen into zombies!  During one puzzle, I used a shark to get rid of a smaller fish.  I the needed to get rid of the shark, but I couldn't think of anything in the ocean tougher than a shark. Out of chance, I typed in \"megalodon,\" and was amazed when a huge prehistoric megalodon shark dropped into the water and promptly devoured it!  A well-known example of creativity is a player who was on a level with zombie robots that he had to dispatch. Traditional methods were ineffective, so the player summoned a time machine, traveled back to pre-historic times and found a dinosaur, rode the dinosaur back through the time machine, and then stomped all over the zombies.  I won't give away anymore examples, because I really believe your experience will be much better if you discover these objects on your own; and I strongly encourage people to avoid reading too many reviews of Scribblenauts until they've played a lot of the game, so they don't run into any more spoilers.There are two modes to gameplay.  Puzzle Mode requires you to complete some type of puzzle to make the starite appear. An example is to collect flowers for a botanist.  But one of the flowers is on a cliff, one is underwater (which contains a piranha), and one is right beside an angry bee.  You must now come up with object(s) to help you accomplish this. Each puzzle has an average number of objects it expects you to use to complete it. The fewer objects you use, the more points you get.  Maybe there's an object you can use to take care of the bee and the piranha together.  Creative thinking like that will earn you Style Points.  Additionally, the less time it takes you to complete the puzzle, earns you points as well.  Once completed, your points are added up and converted to \"ollars,\" which can be used to purchase new levels, songs, and avatars.  You can complete each level as many times as you want, but completing it three times with completely different items will earn you \"prodigy\" status and a gold star.  The first time going through a level, I highly suggest completing it as quickly as possible, since this seems to give you the most points. Next, go for style, which is where you can have the most fun.  The game takes everything into consideration. It knows you can summon a gun every single time to get rid of a troublesome animal that is blocking your path, but if you come up with a more creative method, such as using an item to dig a ditch, putting some kind of bait on the other side, and trapping the animal, will not only earn you style points, but points for \"no weapons\" as well.There are ten \"worlds.\"  Each has two modes of play (that are completely different and don't recycle screens), and elevel levels per mode.  That's 220 different levels.  If you play through by trying to complete each level 3-4 different ways, that's 880 levels!  They get progressively harder and require much more skill.  Although I completed all of them in two weeks, that was rushed for review purposes and had I taken my time, it would have taken me much much longer.  This is not a traditional DS game that has a shelf life of 30 hours. There are many more options to play this game that I will discuss below.  The game's title screen is also built as a \"sandbox\" environment, where you can play around and spawn objects to see how they interact.ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCEThe AI of the game is really impressive.  Every one of the objects you can spawn has properties associated with it for interacting with its environment and with other objects.  Beavers and termites eat wood.  Consequently, if you spawn these animals near wood, they will proceed to consuming it. The same association exists with a lumberjack (provided you give him a tool to work with). Predatory animals also interact with each other.  A piranha will eat a minnow.  A shark will eat a piranha.  A megalodon will eat a shark.  And yes, there are creatures in the game that will even take on a megalodon.  It is amazing to me how the developers were able to come up with all of these associations for so many different objects.  Your character can interact with them as well, and even create new items.  I found that interacting with a honeycomb yielded a jar of honey, but interacting with a bomb was not as sweet.  The artificial intelligence provides for endless possibilities with the level editor.WIRELESS + LEVEL EDITORScribblenauts has wireless features built in so you can play levels with friends.  Simply exchange friend codes with people and you can share custom-designed levels. While the level editor has been overlooked in many reviews, I think this is one of the biggest features of the game.  Using the custom world environments provided by the game and the numerous objects, you can spend the rest of your life coming up with completely individual and unique levels to exchange.  The great part of this is you can customize the AI of the objects, and their relationships with other objects.  For instance, the natural AI for a dog is to attack a cat, but you can change this so the dog is scared of the cat, or even protective of the cat.  It's great to send a friend a level with a box of mice in his way, and have him remove the box and suddenly be attacked by the mice.  Or have a dragon that is deathly afraid of grilled cheese sandwiches.  Create a level with dozens of pirates on one side and dozens of ninjas on the other, separated by a brick wall.  Remove the wall and sit back and watch as they battle to the death.  As I said, the combinations and possibilities are virtually endless.  You can't completely modify the physical landscapes and are forced to use the templates from the game, but you can summon thousands of landscape items (trees, mountains, sun, city hall, etc) to get around this and make your level as unique as possible.COMPLAINTSIt would be nice if the wireless capabilities allowed for downloadable new content and levels, without having to exchange friend codes. Given the customization of the level editor, I find this to be a huge drawback.  If someone creates an awesome level online, there is no easy way to distribute it to thousands of people.  I also would have liked it if the game was a little more restrictive on what kind of items you could create during the puzzle phase.  Maybe if it had a skill level associated with it.  You could feasibly breeze through the first few worlds just pulling out a gun and a pair of wings to take care of 70% of the problems.  Of course you won't have much fun doing this, but it would be neat if there was a \"hard\" level where you couldn't use the same object more than once in any level for an entire world.  Another complaint, is that it's too easy to get rid of items you create.  Anything you create can also be destroyed.  While this is very useful (you can't summon infinite items, and the screen gets cluttered with more than a dozen or so), it would be more challenging to have to not be able to dismiss certain items, which would cause you to think more carefully about what you summon.  If I summon a shark to get rid of a piranha, I can always then just drag the shark to the trash can when I'm done.  But if that wasn't possible and I was forced to deal with the shark as well, it would make me think more carefully.  Scribblenauts also features a very good (better than Brain Age) handwriting recognition program so you can just write in words, but this is fairly useless, as it is much faster to just tap on the letters in the QWERTY keyboard it displays.Again, I strongly encourage new players not to read too many reviews, lest you have a lot of the puzzles spoiled for you.  And definitely DO NOT read the list of available nouns that is floating around out there.  I imagine there will be thousands of Scribblenauts videos appearing on the Internet in the months to come, and I suggest you stay away from those and all message boards until you're well into the game if you want to have the best Scribblenauts experience you can.  Overall, Scribblenauts is simply the most original and best-designed game for the Nintendo DS out today.  It is great for all ages (I am 35) and I think it is especially good for younger students as it brings the best of education and puzzle games together.  It not only encourages an increased vocabulary and better spelling, but more importantly, develops and fosters critical and creative thinking.  The player is not just running around a level collecting coins, but actively using the creative centers of their brain to come up with the most unique and efficient way to solve a puzzle.  This would be a terrific tool for bringing into early childhood education classrooms.  If you own a DS and have not purchased this game yet, you NEED it in your collection.  If you don't own a DS, I would even say that the enjoyment of Scribblenauts is possibly justification alone to purchase one.EDIT 10.25.09 - After spending several months on this game, I do agree with the reviewer who mentioned that a major fault with the game is that a huge amount of the items available do not \"do anything\" and do not interact with other items like they should.  It's great that there are 22,000 items, but if 10,000 of them can't be used for practical gameplay, then what is the point? As such, I am changing my star rating from 5 to 4 stars. I still recommend the game to people, but there is a lot of lost potential here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2009"}

Over the last month, I played several great games and was looking forward to Bioshock Infinite.  But I've spent more time trying to de-bug that game than I have actually playing it.The story appears intriguing and the graphics are very good when they work.  The unique setting is what sets this game apart from many others.  The characterization is good as is the story so far.  But the problems started within the first hour.  There is a \"stutter\" that occurs whenever a new map is loaded.  This appears to be a caching problem, but I was unable to remedy it.  The larger problem is the framerate drop.  I can go from 70+ frames per second down to 3-5 fps instantly without any warning.  It has often stayed at that unplayable rate until I exit the game and restart it.  Then is will play fine with good framerate right past the part where it previously dropped.  Strange.About five hours into the game I started getting freezes that required a complete restart.  About ten hours into the game, it wouldn't launch at all - totally black screen.  After hours of searching online and trying various debugging recommendations in vain, I was forced to completely uninstall the game and re-download it.  I was hoping a fresh reinstall would work.  It didn't.  I got the black screen right from the beginning.I currently finished Deus Ex: Human Revolution without any issues at all.  I'm currently playing Metro Last Light without a problem.  I'm still completely locked out of Bioshock Infinite.  No fixes have been successful.Although Bioshock Infinite appears to be a fine game, the bugs, crashes, freezes, and black screens have made this game the most frustrating gaming experience so far within the last year.UPDATE 1:  The bugs and black screen on start-up are still there.  However, I have found a work-around for the black-screen start-up.  In the Steam setting on Bioshock Infinite, there are advanced settings for launching the game.  If you enter -windowed into the box,the game will launch in windowed mode.  Then you can change the windowed mode to fullscreen within the game.  This is the only way it will let me enter the game, but it DOES work.  I still get the stutters and unplayable framerate drops on occasion.Because I am now able to actually play the game to some degree and the times I can play without problems is enjoyable, I have upped my rating from 2 stars to 3 stars.  I am still very disappointed that the gaming experience isn't better because there is the potential of an excellent game here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2014"}

But lets get real , i have not played it alot so my review is a little tainted.I enjoy the graphics and the game play and everything..HOWEVER the add feature where you make a player and you set on the bench most of the game and play a few minutes to gain abilities etc etc etc...its sort of nuts to assume you are going to do things right when YOU do not get to play ??!!! When i come in he wont shoot the ball, he wont rebound and he won't steal the ball and he won't block shots..SO tell me how can you meet your objectives when YOU can do nothing its asks you to do ? That part is real disappointing.have not tried the legend players yet, one reason i purchased the game...was sort of saving it for when i got better at play...but at the rate it allows you to play..not so good so far.When i play a quick game no matter who i use or what team...they lose and will not make shots, steal balls or get many rebounds, no matter who you are or what team you use...SO..back to the make a player game..even the Pro's you use and even the best ones miss 8 out of 10 shots , won't rebound and won't steal the ball...and dunking, it may let you once and then never allow it again..makes no sense..but thats how its been.I will continue playing in hopes things get better, but if not I can not give this game 5 stars..I gave it 4 just because it has Legend players....otherwise a 2 star may have been in order..well maybe 3 because the graphics are still Great !!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}

I had never heard of the game until the demo came out on XBOX Live and just became addicted to that demo. The full game just expands on the demo in so many ways that it was a must buy. I can only decribe this game as being a rollercoaster ride of a game with simple controls allowing for very precise and complex maneuvers. You use one of the analog sticks to steer and it is so finely tuned that you do not even have to use the break button to get into a drift. This makes the controls wonderfully intuitive. The fun factor is off the wall with great single player and multi-player modes making for a very deep game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2008"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"546598","summary":"com bat","reviewText":"I haven't reviewed a game in a while, but Singularity really made me feel like I had to. Especially considering there are only two other reviews here as I write.First, the most important thing. Singularity gets the basics absolutely right. Character movement is fluid, the controls are easy to learn, and there are no lurching mini-loads.The environments and graphics are top-notch. From the moment you \"arrive\" on the island, you know it's going to look good, and it does throughout.Gameplay is also great fun. I've heard a lot of comparisons to Bioshock, which I didn't play but watched my roommate play. I suppose there are similarities, but Singularity offers it's own take on survivor horror FPS.The storyline is excellent. Playing with time often causes a muddled story, but here we have a great altered past/present that must be fixed, and the history of the island's downfall is well detailed in notes and recordings you find. Get all of them. Also, the climax is a big moment for your character.Your time-altering abilities are great fun to use. Power them up as soon as you can, especially the one that creates a sphere of frozen time. This is extremely useful in taking out multiple enemies. It's fun to age a soldier to dust, turn \"tics\" against each other, and age/renew countless items. See a crushed, rusted crate? Renew it and inside could be E-99 (your upgrade juice), med packs and ammo. Sometimes this is imperative to continue, sometimes you just find more juice under a big branch you just \"de-aged.\"Happily, Singularity lacks any glaring flaws. If you find something you don't like, it's often down to personal preference. Health, for example, is (yes!) a good old-fashioned bar. You have to use health packs to regenerate. The encroaching red haze, once a good thing but abused to the point of annoying overkill in some games (the latest COD) stays away until you're nearly dead.It's not quite as OMG-THIS-IS-AWESOME as the first time through Dead Space, an astoundingly good game, but has it's share of pleasant surprises. For example, I shot a soldier in the leg with my shotgun, which blew it off below the knee. He hopped a few times, clutching his thigh and yelling, then fell and squirmed in agony until I finished him off. That's a nice touch in enemy construction.I apologize if this sounds too positive. There's always a risk of coming off as fake or easily impressed. But sitting here I can't really think of anything they did \"wrong.\" It's a fully developed, greatly conceived and polished horror FPS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2013"}

The story takes place several years after the original Neverwinter Nights, and reintroduces popular characters and NPCs in a new storyline with new challenges.","reviewerName":"Z. A. Recht","summary":"Has to function before it can be good.","reviewText":"I hope this works. Amazon ate my last attempt at a review for this title.I had very high hopes for this game. Neverwinter Nights was and remains one of my favorite PC RPGs. It was incredibly rich, detailed, and deep. The editor provided days' worth of fun customizing.This title, however, feels like a regression rather than a progression. And I can't for the life of me understand how they can release a title that demands so much more out of your hardware for a game that looks like it was released three years earlier than the original.But that's not the part that bothered me; graphics have never been a big selling point with me. They're nice, don't get me wrong, but I'll take a game with great play value and ugly visuals over a pretty trainwreck.Unfortunately, this game has neither, mainly because someone back at Atari or Bioware royally messed up.Here's the short version: Despite having more than double (that's 200% of) the system requirements for this game, my machine was unable to produce more than 1 frame per second.Let me repeat that. 1 frame per second. For those of you who don't play enough to make the connection between playability and frames-per-second, 1FPS is completely unplayable. Imagine loading a game that's way too advanced for your machine, and the graphics that would result when your computer tried to run it. That's the kind of performance I got out of NWN 2--using a machine built in 2007, attempting to display graphics that were out of date in 2000. Frankly, that's jaw-dropping. How could they not realize they were putting out such a flawed product when the original was so great? Maybe they got overconfident and stopped trying, thinking they could just ride on NWN's lapels for the rest of their careers.And now I just know there are some folks out there dying to tear me down to size by commenting that there are a number of fixes for this terrible framerate (since I'm far from the only person to experience it, it seems an entire small community has sprung up around attempting to fix NWN2.)Let me just head y'all off at the pass, there. I've tried them. All of them. Every single possible fix I could find, from modifying my graphics card settings, to game settings, to custom-written mods. The best I could achieve, after setting every possible graphical option to minimum and increasing the performance of my card, was 1.5FPS.Skip this title. Get something that will run on your machine. Given the resources this aged-looking RAM monster seems to want, you're better off waiting to play this title until sometime in 2020, when 20GHz processors, 10 gig video cards and 30 gigs of RAM are standard PC options.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Great story and great characters (of course)Missions that require problem-solving as well as combatGorgeous mapsGetting to play as GandalfCons:Painfully long cutaway scenesCheesy endingOften-tedious fights","reviewerName":"\"tspcr\"","summary":"Thank God for Tom","reviewText":"Jackson's movie was great, but he had to take liberties to squeeze it in under 3 hours. The game publisher for Fellowship had to do a little of the same, but this game follows the book much closer.This game is superb on all levels. The graphics are great (on all the consels), the music is top notch and the game play is very easy. The only knock I have is the voice acting was little dry, if not funny at some moments.If you read the book, then you know what happens. But in the game, you can die, thus ending the quest. You get to play as three characters (Frodo, Aragorn and Gandalf) at different times during the game. Each character has their own abilities which can be used to your advantage during the game. Frodo is good at rock throwing and stealth, Aragorn with the sword and Gandalf, obviously with magic.The best part about this game is what some complained about. That it was light on the action. But if you like games that are well balanced with action, tasks (quests) and puzzle solving then Fellowship is perfect. There isn't too much or too little of any.What I really liked was when fighting you had to think. You can't just rush in and start killing your foes. You have think about your approach, use cover to avoid arrows and in some cases you can even make your enemys work for you. Mixing it up with Trolls and Orcs was great, because lurring the Orcs near a Troll would cause some of the Orcs to get in the way of Trolls club and die. There is a real combat strategy to killing Trolls too. rushing in and fighting one means certain death.The game is well balanced, very enjoyable and a great break from some of the other games out there right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2003"}

High speed fun in the fastest, most visually stunning racing game ever.","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Beyond Racing of 2000","reviewText":"I often seem to look at racing games and what they really seem to be in the future. They really can be quite amazing, and head-spinning at times. Yet, there just happen to be two video game franchises that have captured the essence of futuristic racing. One of them is Extreme-G, and the other is F-Zero. Nintendo really has been able to make their F-Zero games quite amazing in not just detail, but the actual feel of racing in the future. Yet, for this game, it really took some teamwork to really get this game going, as their former video game console rivals Sega, teamed up with Nintendo to make a race that is anything but extreme. It is beyond that.F-Zero GX, is the sequel to the Nintendo 64 game F-Zero X. The game really goes beyond the previous games in not just the detail and the graphics, but the actual gameplay itself, where anything goes. There are over 20 different courses that can be unlocked here, s well as a exciting story mode, where you can really unlock different characters and vehicle parts to help customize your hovercraft. The game also features classic modes like the Grand Prix mode, which has so many twists and turns available on locations like Mute City, the deep Phantom Road, which actually looks as if you're inside a computer, as well as other tight-twisting and groundbreaking courses. The music also feels extreme to the bone as well. The courses include different music that can range from hard-hitting rock, to dance, techno and futuristic Hip Hop, which goes very well with each alndscape and course that is available.Yet, with so many good things, there are some disadvantages as well. The courses can be very difficult to manuever at times, and you'd have to re-race them all over. Another problem is the control of the game. Another is the very speed of the courses, which as you get into the tougher courses and harder levels, the more frustrating it can be to get first place.All in all, with so many different racing games out there, F-Zero GX is a well put, exciting and extreme one of a kind racing game. Out of all the games for the Nintendo Gamecube, this one really should be one in every gamers home. This is one very remarkable racer.Graphics: A-Sound: A-Control: BFun & enjoyment: BOverall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2004"}

I have looked foward to the new edition to the series Ascension.Ascension begins with the protagonist Kratos, chained atop a stone column, tortured by one of the Furies. No subtility here. The game starts in your face like all the GOW games. You can collect artifacts in the game and you can obtain infinite rage or triple the time on your combo meter. The combat manages to maintain a certain slickness despite the huge array of offensive options. The animations are fantastic and dazzzling and come together nicely. Enemies give you clues to help you when they are about to attack. This gives you the chance to roll away with just a movement of the joystick.Part of Ascension's fun is in the puzzles with vast architectural conundrums that must be solved before you are allowed to move on. In the beginning these are routine crate-moving exercises , changing the game's tempo without offering much challenge or interest. But later, you can obtain the Amulet of Urobotus, which allows you to highlight pieces of scenery and either restore them to their former usefulness or reduce them to useful rubble. To me this is some of the best and most challenging in the game.Gorgon eyes and Phoenix feathers make a return as collectible items. Find five of each and you'll increase your health or magic points similiar to the past games. Enemies and objects release red orbs when destroyed, which you can collect and spend on upgrading your weapons or abilities - increasing the damage of your Blade of Chaos or the range of the Amulet of Urobotus, for example, or unlocking new special moves.Ascension contains multiplayer features and various modes of play. Ascension's multiplayer component is weighty and distinguished, and the battle system's range and flexibility shine in this competitive context. So it has something for the multiplayer as well as the single adventurer. As well as the full assortment of abilities from the single-player game, a number of additional items and rules enrich competitive play. For example, characters flash red when executing an unblockable attack, white when they're momentarily invulnerable to attack and blue when they're recovering from a special attack and are open to a counter. Temporary halos appear over opponents' heads when they're open to a grapple, while special 'god items' help players escape combo attacks and provide a shot-term battle advantage. Maps contain traps, which can be triggered against the opposing team, as well as temporary torrents that restore magic and vitality.I have to say I do like Ascension but I do feel that individual campaign is a bit uneven and sometimes fails to match its predecessors. The multiplayer does add something though and broadens the game's aspirations and its appeal. With the extra goodies this collector's edition contains overall it is a worthwhile purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

J Lewis \"Miss Amii\"","summary":"An Inverse Relationship Between Fun and Blood Pressure","reviewText":"Trauma Center: Under the Knife is a novel idea for the Nintendo DS. It's creative and it can be fun at times, but its got major issues bogging it down. The most previously mentioned of which are its sometimes doggy controlls and extreme difficulty. First of all, the difficulty curve is all over the place. This game bounces between having operations that are simple enough to get on the first time and then will switch to missions that are on the \"this is impossible\" difficulty level. Some of these super hard operations almost seem like they want you to fail. I base this on the fact that on operations I struggled many times to get through I would get a high grade at the end of the mission. I didn't perform it skillfully at all, but it seem like the game knows that keeping the patient alive is a monumental task in and of itself. Adding to this is the dogy controls for some of the tools. The Magnifying Glass is a pain to use. Not only must you draw the circle precisely, but quickly too. Sewing closed wounds is also hard. Sometimes the game will register it and sometimes it won't. As the patients life meter drops quickly when you have a bleeding wound, this can be the difference between success and failure on some missions.Despite the off the charts difficulty on the most the of missions, some of the easier ones are very fun. It's quite fun to go back and perform them again in challenge mode to get a higher grade.Even if you find the super-hard parts of Trauma Center to be a blast, I doubt any but the most dedicated of virtual surgeons are going to play through the entire game a second time. For one thing, this is a very talky game. It's fourty or so missions are spliced between a liberal amount of story. It's not a particularly interesting story, but there is more of it than most handheld RPGs have. Secondly, it is so annoying when the nurses stop you in the middle of the operation to yammer on about something. As most of this mission will require multiple tries, you'll soon feel like telling them to shut up because you already know what do.In the end, for all its novelty value, Trauma Center is just an average game. It can be really fun, but at others it almost feels like it wants to drive your blood pressure to point that you'll have to visit the real life trauma center.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2006"}
{"product_name":"B003GSZAOY","description":"","reviewerName":"M. MacMahon","summary":"Many Unique Aspects Brighten This Standard Shooter, Though it's Not For Those Who FEAR Change","reviewText":"Let's get this out of the way right off the bat: FEAR is one of my favorite games of all time.  It's insanely fun and fast-paced shooting, it's marvelous AI, it's extremely impressive graphics and combat effects (many of which are still unrivaled) and it being one of the last true PC singleplayer shooters all put it on a pedestal in my mind.  If you disagree with that we are coming into this review from different directions, yet I still think you should listen to what I am going to say.  Why?  Because FEAR 3 is absolutely NOTHING like FEAR, yet I still love it.FEAR 3's singleplayer campaign puts you in the shoes of Pointman from the original game, tasked with finding Alma and stopping her pregnancy that we learned about in FEAR 2.  The story is rather bland and typical, but FEAR was never about a strong story really.  It was more about strong moments, interactive scares and revelations that happened dynamically as you played the game.  FEAR 3 is not as good at this, a clear example of how the change in developer (from Monolith to Day 1 Studios) has effected the game.  Atmosphere has changed as well, and maybe for the better depending on your priorities.  While FEAR and for the most part FEAR 2 were about dark and moody environments FEAR 3 has a little of that but mostly takes place in brightly lit outside environments with a standard military shooter feel.  There is a South American village during the day, a suburb at dusk, a sunny daytime city level (the longest in the game) and more like this.  Only a creepy department store level and some parts at the end really felt like traditional FEAR environments to me.FEAR's main focus is on gameplay though, and the changes keep on coming.  FEAR 3 feels much more like a standard military shooter when you play as Pointman.  They have added a cover system that actually works really well and reminds me of Medal of Honor Airborne of all games.  You remain in first-person when in cover, it basically just adds a traditional lean functionality when you are near a wall.  It works well.  Everything is more flat and enemies are slower than in FEAR, a sign of console development.  It's alright though, it's different from FEAR but still fun.  The weapons still pack a punch and slo-mo is still a blast to mess with.Thing is, FEAR 3 is not just about this traditional Pointman experience.  FEAR 3 is a co-op game as well.  One thing I want to really praise with FEAR 3 before I get further into multiplayer is that singleplayer still feels like a real singleplayer game.  Unlike Borderlands or Resident Evil 5 or whatever other co-op focused game you can think if, FEAR 3 does not feel like an offline bot match when playing solo.  The character player two uses in co-op, Paxton Fettel from the original game, is not even there in person when playing solo, he just speaks to you using telepathy and exists as a ghost outside the game world.  It works very well.  You know what also works well?  Paxton Fettel as a gameplay character.Playing as Fettel is an entirely different game almost.  Fettel can levitate enemies, buff Pointman, possess enemies and shoot energy.  The entire FEAR 3 shooter experience changes from well-executed yet standard military fare to a unique shooter experience not seen anywhere else.  You will posses bodies and run around like crazy causing chaos, then return to ghost form and take cover.  You will levitate enemies and shoot them with energy blasts, giving you a more wild gameplay feel than the reserved and often in cover Pointman.  In short it changes the game up considerably and almost makes FEAR 3 two games in one.  The best part is: if you're not into online co-op like me you can still play as Fettel in any level you complete as Pointman.  This basically doubles the 6 or so hour campaign and adds a ton of replay value.  There are several multiplayer modes as well if you're into that, many of them focusing on co-op.  Typical hoarde modes, a mode where you have to run from never-ending walls of death and others.  There is a lot of value here for single and multiplayer gamers, it's not just a fire and forget 6 hours.The PC port is... typical, I guess.  Textures and effects look about normal for an Xbox 360 game and though the game can look quite good at high resolutions with AA and AF applied it doesn't really stand out from the crowd.  Annoyingly it does not have a toggle for motion blur, which is an effect I hate, but hopefully they patch that in like Monolith patched a grain toggle into FEAR 2.  Standard controls and mouse precision are here without any issues.  The game actually detected my 5-button mouse by default, which is nice.  DRM is Steamworks, which is arguably a good thing because of all the co-op stuff you can do (though it should have the option for an offline singleplayer-only install).All in all FEAR 3 is a lot different from FEAR and FEAR 2, but how much this is a bad thing depends on your perspective.  It has good environments and fun yet typical combat, but then it twists everything up with a really crazy second character who's fun to play and a co-op mode that doubles or even triples the gameplay.  If, like me, you are mostly an offline gamer you will still get a solid modern shooter campaign and then a crazy fun and unique second-go.  If you're going to play this online you get tons of co-op fun an solid online modes.  It's a surprise hit if you ask me, and at the very least much more interesting than FEAR 2, which was basically just FEAR again only not as good.  You might be surprised by this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}

It places you on D-Day and then it's killing galore.  There's no blood or gore in this game, so it's okay for teens.  The Xbox version features improved graphics over the PS2 and GC versions, and it also has the exclusive Dolby 5.1 surround sound effects.  Plus multiplayer mode (but not Xbox Live).  VERY COOL!Unlike a typical FPS with no storyline, in MHF you are a marine determined to take out the enemy, and this takes place in a real historical setting.  The opening of the game reminds you of the movie Saving Private Ryan, including the deaths of some soldiers who didn't even reach the shore.  From there on, it's one engaging game, and one good thing is, you have plenty of time to play.  You do die easily, so if you find it a bit too hard for your taste, you can use the cheat code \"NOHITSFORU\", entered at the password screen, so you become invincible to enemy fire.  (However, you can still get killed by friendly bombs.)The sound in the Xbox version is just incredibly realistic.  You gotta play this version to immense yourself in it.  From shouts to machinegun fire to explosions, the well-placed sound effects creates a true atmosphere.  You immediately forget you are a gamer; it suddenly feels like you are actually in the middle of a battle.  Yes, that's how real it gets.  Of course, you should have a decent surround sound system to take advantage of this offering.  Even an inexpensive 5.1 system would go a long way in bringing out the full experience of this game.The controls are pretty easy to master, although I wish the game offered an autoaim, since sometimes the action gets so fierce manual aim is such a pain in the neck.Another complaint is the graphics is still a bit bland and PS2-like, and not totally worthy of the Xbox.  On the plus side, the framerate is excellent.In short, this is one good game to own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2002"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Johnny","summary":"great real time FPS!","reviewText":"Okay, where do I begin?  Lets start with multiplayerMultiplayer:  I picked this game up at midnight last night because I am really busy today and wouldnt have time to go pick it up.  First off, the multiplayer is amazing!!  I own the xbox 360 version where you are allowed 24 players in on a single match..unlike the pc where it is 64.  there are a few things I like about BF3 multiplayer..first off, this is a REAL TIME FPS shooter, as in you cant go lone wolf and rack all these kills up to unlock killstreaks and what not (COD  no, in order to get stuff done around here you gotta work as a team, saying that, each match has 24 players, 12 on 12, so in essence you have 3 squads of 4 with your choice of being 4 difference class with their own perks.  so you work within your squads to capture flags (conquest) or defend objectives or blow them up (rush)..note: I have only played those two game types thus far..If you lone wolf it you will die..and there is no reason for it, it is much more fun if you work as a team.  secondly, like Ive noted before, there are 24 players on the console, so you may ask, why is it that other MP games on console only have a max of either 12 or 18?  halo, cod, etc) well thats because those other games use a host to client online connection.  For example, you are playing black ops and your game pauses, as 'host is lost' well that person has left the game making that particular game youre playing having to find a new host and booting it back up (half the time everyone just loses connection) so your chopper gunner youre in..GONE..your dogs..GONE.. because your MP game just crashed. now BF3 on the other hand has dedicated servers, so everyone logs on to the same server and is on the same playing field..no more are the days where the host is a split second ahead of everyone else and racks up all the kills, everyone is a client and the host is the server..now if you ask me, that should be the STANDARD..I mean, Im paying 60$ a year on XBL for what exactly?  dedicated servers is a very nice and I feel like I deserve that in a game if Im paying for MP usage. and I feel cheated on with a 6 on 6 match or client to host..just doesnt feel right making us (gamers) host games..we should be considered guests when we are the ones forking out the $$.. 12 on 12 is nice the maps are huge and gorgeous!!!  You do have the option of downloading a texture pack (1.5g) to your harddrive and I extremely recommend it, it makes the game pop with visuals, of course it isnt a high scale computer that I am playing this on, no, no its my 5 year old technology xbox 360, but thats ok, because its my friends that make the experience and I have made the decision to stay with consoles and not use computers.  Multiplayer maps are about 3 times the size of any cod maps and they run seamlessly!!  It really is impressive if I could only show you that.  now BF3 runs at 720p (I run an HDMI cable so my tv/console says its 1080 but dice claims 720 p on consoles and 30 fps..this has got a lot of hate lately with COD fanboys, I personally dont care which you prefer, COD or BF but let me educate you on this one thing...dice claims they had to scale it down to 720p and 30 fps to be able to fit the specifications of consoles, which is ENTIRELY true..sure cod can run at 1080 p and 60 fps but look at the size of the maps and details, can you blow up buildings in COD? Do you feel like you run in circles on every map on cod?  See people, something has got to give and if you want huge maps, destructible environments on a 5 year old console tech then you will have to scale down the HD and fps..but your eyes cant tell the difference between 30 fps and 60 fps..its been proven, the only nice thing about higher frames per second is if alot is going on you wont see the chop in the game, ie, explosions happening, youre in a tank blowing up another tank, it wont be chopped, but I am very critical about this and havent see **any chop** thus far in the MP of BF3, so before you go purchasing anything that claims one is better than the other..just look at the facts. (yes I will prob be getting MW3 christmas or early next year..Im not a fanboy of either side, Im just educating you on things you should know  Also there is battlelog which is an equivilant to Elite for Cod other than its included in the price of the retail game where elite is umm...50$ a year (ouch)..which I can tell you right now I WONT be getting..unless any of you would like to make a contribution ;)**please note, if you plan on buying this used, and playing MP make sure you get a good deal on it.. EA makes  you put in a serial # to play online which you can purchase separately on the market place for 800 points..which is 10 bucks..so dont fall prey to someone who is trying to resale it for 50 bucks, or more, you might as well buy it new unless you can snag it for 40 or less..just FYI..Campaign:  Im sorry Ive only completed a few campaign missions thus far but what I can see it is kinda like a COD campaign experience.  where youre in an action sequence and it is flashing \"PRESS A\" repeatedly on the screen until you do so and bring that person down, etc,etc I do think the graphics are a tad bit better in the campaign then in the MP, but it isnt much.Im more of a MP person anyhow, yes I will play through the campaign but it will probably take me a few months of casual play.I hope this helps you make an educated decision on what game to buy this fall/holiday..especially if you only have $$ to buy a couple or less (like me) and hopefully I'll be seeing you on the battlefield!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

The only thing I found wrong with the game is that it seemed too short and it left me wanting more at the end.  The story?  You take on the role of Parker, a minor on Mars for Ultor Corporation.  People looking to make some money go to Mars to work in the mines and are supposedly treated very well.  Parker arrives there to find that everything he has been told is untrue.  The Food is horrible, the barracks is horrible, and the gaurds regularly beat on the miners just for kicks.  A rebel group knows as Red Faction stars posting flyers promoting their cause.  One day, Parker witnesses the beating of another miner.  A riot breaks out as members of Red Faction begin assulting the gaurds and attempting to break from Ultor's control.  Parker, caught up in the chaos, has one choice.  Kill or be killed.Throughout the game, you are contacted by Red Faction with objectives of sorts.  Few of these objectives require stealth, however, so the game is mostly just run in and blow everything up.  Weapons range from control batons to rocket launchers.  You also have the opportunities to control vehicles during the game such as a ATV, a Aesir Fighter (jet), and a submarine, all of which have their own unique weapons.  The Geo mod technology (this and Red Faction 2 are the only games that use Geo mod) allows you to blow up almost everything, and by doing so you may uncover special items.  There is almost non-stop action and the frame rate never falters.  The only downside to all this greatness is the game loads often (quick little loads rather than huge waits).  The graphics are amazazing considering geo mod is fairly new, and the sound and music goes well with the game.There is a multiplayer mode that allows 1-2 human players and 0-4 bots.  If you've ever played Half-Life online with other people, this is practically the same.  It's a fast paced kill fest and the only way out it to win.  The only mode is deathmatch.  The multiplayer isn't that great on the ps2, and if you want a real multiplayer experience I would buy the PC version which allows several players simultaneously.If you like games where your objective is to kill kill kill, then this is the game for you.  The game is fairly short and will leave you wanting more at the end, but it is definately a jump in the right direction for PS2 First Person Shooter games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2002"}

FF VI is most definitely the best in the series up to this point.  I did not start playing the FF series until 2008, so it definitely has stood the test of time.  These are true classics.FF VI has a great story, great characters, and very good music (even though it's only on the GBA).  Of course, the graphics are outdated since it was originally made for the SNES, but it goes well on the GBA/DS.  I thought I might not enjoy this one as much as everyone else has since it doesn't utilize the wonderful job system that was in FF V that I loved.  The esper system replaces the custom job system very well.  The game took around 40 hours to play.  Lastly, I found the difficulty to be near perfect.  I was able to complete the game without getting any hints.  I completed it with only beating 79% of the enemy types, so I may find a walkthrough and try to see what enemies I missed and any side quests I might have missed.

Guitar Hero has been one of the most surprising games that really has worked very well in that success. The previous editions have made gamers want to kick their licks, and jam to their favorite smashes like Heart-Shaped Box by Nirvana. While gamers are anxiously awaiting a new version for the upcoming Playstation 3, those who own the PS2 get their chance to hit the stream of the 80's in this band.Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks The 80's for the Playstation 2, is a spinoff from Activision popular music game that tries to tide over fans awaiting what will be in store on Guitar Hero III. The gameplay is very simple as you jam along with your favorite songs from the 80's, from guilty pleasures and one-hit wonders, to acts that were just hard core. The variety is already mixed with legends like The Police on Synchroncity II and Electric Eye from Judas Priest, to some acts that only feel like it is the 80's like The Vapors smash Turning Japanese and The Warrior from Patty Smyth and Scandal. The graphics and control deliver nicely, but I just wish that there could've been a lot more in the way of rock that should've been included. I was honestly hoping for acts like Bon Jovi, Van Halen, Pat Benetar and R.E.M. who really wrote and performed great Rock songs to be highlighted on this game.All in all, Guitar Hero Encore: Rock's The 80's isn't a bad game but isn't quite enough to tide fans over who really want to party on down for a really good time. It still isn't a bad purchase for anyone who hasn't played Guitar Hero on the PS2 before, but you're better off awaiting for Guitar Hero III later this year, or just keep rocking on with Guitar Hero I & II in the meantime.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: BFun & Enjoyment: C+ for solo players, B- for multiplayer funMusic Variety: C 1/2+Overall: C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Joshua Glowzinski \"Gman\"","summary":"If I have to choose a favorite new system.  The new Xbox is far from the One.","reviewText":"I would actually give this a 3.8 if I had the choice.I got my One yesterday.  I am going to review it.  I also have a Playstation 4.  After I review, I will compare the two.  I am not one who likes one specific thing more than the other.  I enjoy playing games.  So keep that in mind.The Xbox One.  Something I first noticed about the system is how heavy it was.  I took everything out of the box and held just the system itself.  It was and is heavy.  It looks and feels well made.  Everything is strong and well put together.  It has a lot of ports.  One for the power, HDMI IN, HDMI out, two USB ports, ethernet port, kinect port, s/pdif connector and an IR port.  It looks like a cable box on the back.  The power button is on the far right side.  Disc space on the left.  After I got everything set up, I turned it on.  It stays quiet.  It did not seem to get that hot.  It was a bit warm.  But not as warm as my 360 gets.  That thing burns my hand when I touch it.  Everything seems to run smoothly with the system.  It is a large system.  I think it is larger than my new model 360.  But it does take up a lot of room.  Especially if you have all the cables in it.  That will be tough for some who have a lack of space.The Kinect.  Well, like the One, the new kinect is big.  Much larger than the one for the 360.  The cable is plenty long.  I can not see anyone having a problem reaching the top of their TV or their TV stand.  The kinect is not really that heavy.  When I was setting it up, after it ran all the tests, like the sound and light, I looked and was surprised at how well everything looked.  I have yet to try the Mic.  But everything was very easy to set up and the Kinect seemed to work very well.  I was playing Fighter Within.  A game that uses the Kinect throughout the entire game.  I had heard some bad things abotu the game lagging.  But everything worked very well, as far as the sensing my movements goes.The controller.  The controller looks just like the 360 controller.  But, I assure you that it is different.  It feels smaller.  Not as think as the 360 controller.  I will get more into some of the things I did not like later on.  Something that I really like about it is the control sticks have a texture on the outside.  It is not just flat.  It has like a bumpy feel to it.  I like it very much.  Makes me feel like I have more control over what is happening.  I got two batteries with it.  Felt odd, but there they were.  The controller feels light.  I never had a problem with it working.  It all went very well.The basic program.  This felt like Windows 8.  Everything is bright, bold and easy to see.  There are a lot of different things that you can do.  I have yet to really get into anything.  But everything looks very well done.  Everything is easy to navigate.  The system is easy to set up.  Once you set the region, date, time, WEP or whatever key and the gamertag, you are done.  It went by fast.  That is after the update downloaded.  It did kind of just sit there on a green Xbox One screen, not doing anything.  I thought there was something wrong, but after a bit, it went on.  I started playing a game.  First, you have to install the thing.  That brought me some problems.  But again, I will get to the problems later on.  After it installed, I started playing.  The game looked good.  Easy to control and play.  I really want to play a normal game to really get a feel for it.  Later one, I am going to try Dead Rising 3.  If you enjoy the 360, you will more than likely love this.  It is like a 360 on steroids.  I look forward to playing games on it through out the life span of the system.  Games are not the only thing you can do.  You can download things like Net-Flix, Hulu Plus and a few others.  Plus, you can get movies right from Xbox Live.  The fact that you will eventually be able to hook an external drive to this is a very good thing.  Downloading movies and music, on top of installing games and downloading those from live will take up a lot of room.  So an external hard drive will more than likely be a requirement for those of us who like getting the full use of out systems.  You can also set this thing to record and watch TV on.  I easily sat my cable up through it.  Though I choose digital, which I always do.  I should have chosen the other choice.  Digital does not give me all my channels.  It seems like an interesting few hours, when I re do it and try to watch TV through the system.Now, for some things I did not like.  I will compare this to the Playstation 4.  I like both systems.  So don't bother me about being a fan boy or whatever it is that people say some are.First, the system is large.  It reminds me of one of those computers you see in a doctors office.  The ones that sit on their side.  My Playstation 4 looks sleek and smooth.  It almost disappears on the place that it is setting.  It is because of the design of the case.  I much more like the Playstation 4 case.The fact the with the One, you have to hook up so many damn wires gets a bit annoying.  It you have a lack of space, than you are in for some trouble.  I looked over at the place this was and it was like a crime scene.  There were wires every way you can imagine.  It just makes me feel frantic.  With the Playstation 4, everything is simple.That gets me to the software.  While the Ones looks very nice and clean, there is just to much going on.  The Playstation 4 seems more minimalist, while the One reminded me of Windows 8.  There just seems to be so many things that I have to look at that I will never really use or care about.  It is very busy.  I almost wanted to run my hands on my TV and dust some of the stuff away.  I guess that all depends on your style.  Some will love the way the program looks.  Again, I think it looks beautiful.  I just wish I could get rid of some of the stuff.I was installing a game on the system.  It took so long.  Honestly, I sat there for like 10 or 15 minutes and it was 7% done.  I went upstairs to eat dinner and when I came down, it was finished.  With the Playstation 4, I swear it took maybe 10 minutes.  I think it took more like 3 - 5, but I rounded it WAY up to 10.  That is something I noticed that happened a lot on the One.  Things seem to move very slowly.  After waiting to install the game, I began playing.  At first, the graphics looks rougher than those on the Playstation 4.  They did not look as smooth and refined.  The videos looked very good, but seemed almost last gen.  I was kind of set back a bit.  I know the One is a system capable of playing things beautifully, but it just seemed very underwhelming.  It may have been the game.  Speaking of game, holy man, can you say load times?  If not, wait until a load screen starts, go to the store and get a book on how to say load times, read it, study it, learn to say it and by the time you are done, you will only have a few more minutes of load screen.  I mean seriously.  I sat here for like 60 seconds, watching a little spinning thing.  I was so shocked that it took so long that I didn't even know what to do when the game started.  The wait times are some of the longest that I have ever seen.  I have been playing games since N64 and Playstation.  The load times were just shameful.While the Kinect is nice, it sure the hell does not work a lot of the times.  I was sitting here saying something to get my game to continue and it said say slower.  I felt like the guy on Taxi telling the guy what the sign meant in the drivers ed class.  It just did not work.  None of the times that I said something worked.  I am a patient person.  But it was getting me irritated.  I just said screw it and stopped trying.  I am sure and or I hope they fix it.  But they have to in time.  That is the great thing about stuff like this.  Most of the problems I am listing will be fixed.The controller.  Come on, the 360 controller is amazing.  It feels great in my hands, has the buttons all out in the perfect places and is a good weight.  It is by far my favorite controller.  The One controller looks the same, but it is not.  It is to small.  I almost have to over lap my fingers to hold the thing.  Like it fits in my palms.  It got a bit uncomfortable after a while.  Plus, why not just make the things with rechargeable batteries?  I mean, getting two batteries seems like such a waste.  Now I am going to have to buy rechargeable batteries and a charger.  There is $50 I should not have to spend.The TV thing.  Ok, this does seem cool and I am excited about setting it up.  But why?  It requires a cable box.  That seems to kind of be an oxymoron.  Why would I need to record stuff and or watch TV on my One, when I have a digital HD DVR right here in my room?  One top of me being able to record and watch stuff on there, my entire family gets to watch and record stuff on it.  So I just can not see a purpose for having to go through the One.  One top of that, I mean, as far as energy saving goes, which do you think will help you with that?  I can assure you that having a box as well as the One on wont.  It was confusing the first time, setting the cable up through the one.  Stuff just kept failing.  I WILL try it.  But I am about 95% sure I will never use it.I can say this.The Playstation 4 is a game system that give you many extra features and is easy to use and set up.The Xbox One is an entertainment system that allows you to play games and is frustrating to set up.Take that for what you will, but that is the best way I can describe it.  I actually would have returned my One.  It would have given me money to put towards Christmas stuff and more Playstation 4 games.  But I can not return it.  I already had the points added to my live account and set everything up on it.  I am not saying I would never buy one.  I know there will be fun exclusive games for it.  But I realize now that I should have just waited a few years.  To me, the Playstation 4 far out does the One.  It is a simpler, better looking GAME system that is not trying to be 20 things wrapped into one.  On top of all that, on the Playstation 4, so far, the games look amazing.  Everything looks and feels smooth.  It looks like I would imagine a new gen game would look like.  The Ones games just seem to be lacking something.  I can not say for 100% what that is.  But there is something off.I look forward to playing games on both of the systems.  I just wanted to write everything that I thought and felt after playing.  Also, I have not used the system that much yet.  All of these things are first impressions and thoughts.  I wanted to write them while they were fresh.Update:  Well, a few days ago, I was playing a game on the One.  I unplugged it from the wall when I was done and went and did some stuff.  Later, when I went to play, I plugged the system in and went to play.  But, it would not come on.  The same thing happened today.  Well, it was on.  Fighter Within showed up on the TV and everything went black.  My brother told me to try something.  He was just guessing, but it worked.  I had to the first time and this time unplug the system.  Take the part of the chord that goes into the wall out of the power brick.  Then, I plugged it back in and it worked.  I can not figure out why.  It is as if the brick has energy in it and you have to unplug it in order to make it work.  If you asking why I did not already know, if it happened one already, it is because the first time, the system would not even come on.  I posted something on Amazon about it a few days ago.  I take it people do not think it is necessary to unplug the system.  Someone said that it takes a very small amount of energy on standby.  To them I say thank you for the information.  But I choose to unplug the systems when I am not using them.  So, if there are any of you out there who choose to do the same, if the system does not turn on when you plug it back in, or if it comes on but does not show up on the screen, unplug it from the wall, then hook the cable from the power brick and the One and plug everything back in.  This does not happen if you play hours after you unplug it.  I am sure there is someone out there that knows why this happens.  If you want to leave some information in a response, I and anyone who reads this review would be thankful","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

The reviewer lives in an era where XBox 360, PS3, Wii, Kinect, motion and 3d gaming all exist.  And he is saying that this game stands up to and surpasses anything shown at E3 this year or any year to come.  It is the height of game design, the be all and end all of flawless crafstmanship.  It is pixellated proof that you can make art from an interactive medium.What makes it art is it's attention to detail, it's syncronization of light and sound and texture, it's ability to use a specific medium (Playstation 2 technology) with all its strengths and weaknesses and shape something seemless out of it.  What makes it a game is how freaking fun it is to climb up a giant ass monster and stab him in the head.  Yes, at it's core it's a platforming and puzzle game.  Yes there were parts so tricky that I needed to look up the solutions on the internet.  Yes the ending is a little weird (but satisfying and well worth the price of admition).  It is still a video game and these things are what make it a video game.  But it's as close to actually living in a beautiful fantasy story as we'll ever come.  For me, it captured the feeling being frail and small and overcoming the worst the world had to offer better than any movie I've ever seen and falling short of only a handful of novels.I got my copy of this game for $14 on Amazon and I'm not about to give it up: once I'm done playing it, it's going on my small shelf of things I collect, right between my tattered copy Don Quixote and my overplayed DVD of Citizen Kane.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2011"}

Final Fantasy Origins collects the original 8 bit NES Final Fantasy game, and Final Fantasy 2, both of which are brought to the PS1 as Wonderswan (an obscure handheld Japanese system) remakes of the original games.  Older RPG players who loved the challenging gameplay of these games will instantly play for a nostalgia trip, but younger RPG players who are more used to Final Fantasy VII or easier and flashier RPG's won't find much to like here.  The first game is a basic by the numbers RPG that is quite challenging and long on gameplay, but the second game is much much better and features great character development and storyline depth.  The graphics are nicely drawn and colorful, reminiscent of early Super Nintendo-esque graphic quality, but the sound and audio really aren't anything special.  As with any RPG the controls take getting used to, but are easy to handle after a while.  Origins also plays more smoothly than the earlier released Final Fantasy Anthology and Final Fantasy Chronicles; it has much faster loading times and no slowdown whatsoever like the aforementioned games.  All in all, I strongly suggest picking up Final Fantasy Origins, especially if your an older RPG player.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2003"}

I know people who bought this game and were really dissapointed, basically because they had been lead to believe it was going to be the best thing ever.  I however was completely amazed by this game, it was a big surprise and it is definetely one of my favourite games of all time.I owned MGS1 for the PS1, and to be honest thought it was a little over-rated, it was a great game, but people claiming it to be the best game ever, made me anticipate too much from it.  I went into MGS2 not expecting too much, but I was completely blown away by the game.  Great additions were the aiming in first person, which meant much greater accuracy when shooting, and generally the gameplay is superb.  Collecting the Dog Tags was also a great addition, and adds longevity to the game (I have completed it about 10 times), the boss battles are also amazing, though there are fewer than the other games in the series.  In particular the battles with the harrier, Vamp and the final bosses are great.  So far so good, in fact there is very little wrong with the game, I only have two minor problems.  Firstly you don't get to play as Snake enough, only a slight problem but Raiden is a bit of an a**hole, and most people agree Snake should have been the main playable character.  The biggest problem though is the plot.Up until about an hour from the end of the game the plot maves along nicely, with a couple of nice twists along the way, then it all goes to pieces.  There is a ridiculously long cut scene (about an hour), near the end where you lose all idea of what is going on.  I wont explain it here, mainly because I cant, I have completed the game loads of times and still can barely comprehend it now.  The good thing is, when you have completed the game once you can skip the cut scenes, and you will want to at the end.  While I did eventually grasp the plot at the end, it was just stupid, and were I reviewing this game out of 10, it would only get 9, just because of the plot.Luckily for Hideo Kojima, the daft plot doesn't ruin this as a gaming experience, it is a fantastic game and highly recommended to any gaming fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2005"}

Remember back when they were having major red-ring-of-death issues and Microsoft was replacing them for free?  Yah, older than that.  Anyhow, mine survived throughout the years, and I was a pretty heavy user.  I always made sure it never overheated, but one day it just up and died.  Red Ring Of Death.  I was sad.  BUT, life goes on. We must forge our way through lifes' travesties and find some way to cope.  Dramatic enough for you?-For the same price here, you can pick this up in a store.  I went in to buy my new baby, hoping to get one with a 250 Gig hard drive, to no avail.  They don't really sell them anymore: well, they DO but it costs +$200 MORE and comes with Kinect.  But you can't just buy the box + Drive, which is what I want.  I don't even need a new controller.  Anyhow, since I'm a hard core gamer, but don't do a lot of the online playing or downloading, I decided to go for this unit, which is the cheapest.****PROS:- Quieter than the old one.  Much quieter.- Cool touch-buttons on the front.  Neat.- Setup was very easy - it was quicker than my old one to load up stuff and updates, etc.  I had recovered my gamertag in a few minutes.- Looks good - both the unit itself and the fact that this thing has an HDMI output.  My old one was a component video thing.CONS:- for this price, no big hard drive?  Space is CHEAP, and gets cheaper every day.  If you ask me, a whopping 4 gigs is a ripoff.- Still gotta pay to go online.  Kind of weak, compared to PS3's free online service.- STILL we have the \"power brick\".  This is the power source-thing that's a seperate brick thing between the box and outlet.  That's extremely lame.  Do you have a power brick for your TV or Blu Ray player?  Yeah, I didn't think so.  It's just another thing you have to find space for.- My old hard drive doesn't fit on this.  There's no place to plug it in.  There's no description if this is the \"Slim\" version or what - I literally have no idea - but that's lame that I can't just plug in my old stupid drive they made me pay through the nose for.  250 gigs.

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way.

I mean, it was from Rockstar Games (the people who brought us the almighty GTA series), and it was about RIOTING. I figured, it would be like GTA3 (Vice City wasn't out at the time, remember?), and I could riot and cause all kinds of damage to a town! SWEET!Well, I bought the game, and for the first ten minutes, I loved it. Then, it got a little boring. The next day, I started actually doing missions in Revolution Mode. Boy, talk about repetitive. No spoken dialogue, no real variety, etc. Hell, some of them weren't even that fun. And some were just plain flat-out IMPOSSIBLE. Take one mission (please note that this one happens pretty early in the game): it is your duty to protect some guy while he goes into a jewelry store (something about a bomb, I don't remember). Sounds easy, right? Heh heh. WRONG!!!!!!! About 30 different guys start swarming the entrance, and if even ONE gets in, MISSION FAILED. :-( My Dualshock 2 controller is now slightly dinged thanks to that mission.The Chaos Mode was a little better, though, and keeps me from giving this game the dreaded lone-star review. In this one, you could just go completely crazy and destroy stuff. But even this mode has its faults. For instance, 3/4 of the time, you get a significant amount of points taken off if you kill ANY civilian. HUH?!? And even without it, the game gets quite boring.I ended up selling this game to [a video game store] for a lousy $2 store credit card that got ruined because I left it in my pants pocket and it went through the wash and I had to throw it away. (No big loss.) I really wanted to like this game, but it's just not that good.

Glad I did, because I didn't like it.  I loved BFBadCompany 1 & 2 and thought that this was gonna be like those.  Not at all.  Maybe it's like BF1 & 2, don't know, never played those.  I guess it wouldn't be fare of me to compare it to Bad Company since it isn't \"really\" Bad Company 3, but I gotta say this:The campaign was way too short.  Finished it in about 6 hours.You'll die in every mission.  It is insanely stupid with dark shadows.  You keep getting shot from AI in shadows that you can't see, no matter how high you set video.The graphics otherwise are pretty awesome and the movement is life-like.The sound is nowhere near as awesome as Bad Company 1 & 2.  Ah, darn, there I go comparing them.  Okay, let's just say that the audio is not very impressive.  I've heard much better in several other titles that are much older.  There, that'll do it.There were quite a few freezes.  Annoying.You only get to play gunner in the jet mission, not pilot.It's pretty obvious that the campaign is nothing more than a teaser for the on-line multiplayer.  For that, I gotta call foul.  I find that a bit underhanded to ignore those of us that don't take the time to play games on-line.  I mean, if you're only making half the game then you should charge half the price...or something less than the typical.  Right?I know alot of people are gonna give me crap for knocking this apparently awesome multiplayer game.  But truth be told, MW2 was both awesome as a campaign and multiplayer.  And more importantly, it IS both.  BF3 is half a game.  I honestly shouldn't even give it 2 stars, but figure if I don't give it better than one then I'm completely ignoring the awesome (apparently) multiplayer part.  But wait, ignoring?  Hmm, isn't that what EA did to us off-line players.  Shame shame.  I hope this isn't gonna be the trend with developers...like making a code to play on-line.Battlefield 3:  A game of firsts.  First to make it mandatory to use a code to play on-line and first to totally ignore campaign players.  Well, not totally, they do still want our greenbacks.  lol  Glad I rented it!(note that i'm not taking this too seriously.  i suggest neither do you.  just rent it....and pay 10 more dollars if ya wanna play on-line ;-)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2012"}

So, I expected this sequel to be evenbetter than the first...NOT!!!  Sure, you can justabout blow everything up, but that's where thesweetness ends.My best piece of advice when playing this game:RELOAD OFTEN.  The enemies take a rediculousamount of punishment before they croak.  I basicallyused the one weapon which fires three short bursts,one to knock off the helmet (if he's wearing one),and two more for a facial.  Unless it's an explosiveweapon, the others are useless unless you want toreceive major damage in the process.  There's verylittle time to take a breather, so be ready to do alot of fighting.I liked being able to fight along with team members,except that my actions didn't quite determine theirlongevity.  I could sit there and do nothing while they're getting shot at and it wouldn't matter.  Somuch for teamwork.  The vehicles and battle suits youget to use are ok, but infrequent.Size does matter.  I finished this game way too quickly,partly because it's very short and partly because Iwanted to move on to 007 Nightfire.  I had to use acheat code to beat the final boss because the fightis unfair and the health doesn't seem to span when it'ssupposed to.By my title, I suggested this game should've been calledRed &quot;Fraction&quot; because it's partially fun compared to thefirst edition.

{"product_name":"B001TOMQOY","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"Better than the first","reviewText":"I was not a fan of the first in the series, but a buddy of mine bought the sequel and we did have a lot of fun playing through it. This game has very little depth in the story department as the story never makes a lot of sense. Your just two mercenaries that are caught up in a warzone. Nolan North does his best to bring Salem to life but his partner Rios sounds like a monotone grunt.The customization is pretty extensive, but I found little reason to change from one gun to the other because they all basically do the same damage in their class. All the sniper rifles are about the same etc etc. The controls are pretty solid, but there are a few issues like the overuse of the x button. X is the button to heal your partner, jump over cover, and run. Sometimes you try and heal your dying partner and jump over your cover into the line of fire and die yourself. Other than that they are a typical 3rd person controls. I do wish that you didn't have to open a gate with your partner every ten minutes, but other than a few annoyances the game plays pretty smoothly. The level design is also varied enough to keep the campaign interesting and the graphics look good enough so that they don't distract from the experience. I do wish there was a harder final level to finish the campaign off with but I guess they ran out of time for the final boss. The biggest positive to this game is the co op. Without a buddy to play through with I don't think I would recommend this as highly. If you are looking for a solid perhaps not dazzling third person shooter than I recommend Army of Two the 40 Day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVV9","reviewerName":"Joe Sherry","summary":"one of the best on the NES","reviewText":"Super Mario Bros 2 is my favorite game of the series and the original SMB is a legend.  So where does this leave Super Mario Bros 3?  This was the last Super Mario game on the old NES and while I might like some of the other games more, this might be the class of the series on the NES.  With the strange direction that SMB2 went, this was a trip back to the roots of Mario.  This is a true side scrolling game and features many of the same enemies from the original.  You still jump, stomp and throw fire to make your way through the game.  But there are new features now.  First, there is now a world map and you can select which level you want to enter next.  Some levels are avoidable, some are not, but you can also do special areas (several mini-games and an area where you get bonus items).  You are able to get items throughout the game, and you can use them before levels to be stronger.  There are also several different suits that augment your abilities.  The most common is the Racoon suit which allows you to kill the enemies by flicking your tail at them, and also giving you the ability to fly for short periods of time. There is also a frog suit (allowing swimming to be easier), a Tanooki suit (much like the raccoon suit, but you can briefly turn to stone to avoid enemies...rare), and I believe there is a Hammer Brothers Suit (but I could be wrong about this one....my memory is a little hazy).

If you like LBP you will lie this game. While it is made by the developers behind Mod Nation Racers, it is a LBP game through and through. Great story mode with lots of variety (not just typical kart races), tons of charm and personality like with an LBP game. You can completely customize your Sackboy like you would expect along with your Kart. They are promising compatibility with LBP 1/2 Sackboy costumes, but it was not out yet. There is a full track/game editor like with all LBP games, but I have not tried it yet.While it does not have the polish of a full LBP game (smaller team, less time, less money), it is not bug ridden and the loads times are fast (PSN version) and the frame rate never dips with the story levels (of course a user level could ruin that). The graphics could be better (hence 4/5 stars)-the image quality is a little off. They probably used the LBP engine which is made for flexibility and not fast complicated ones. But I'd rather have a smooth 30fps without stuttering or tearing than better graphics.The tracks are fun, lots of LBP 1&2 flashbacks since you revisit some of those world and they reuse some of the music and art. The LBP mechanics are in place with bounce pads, grapple gun, respawn circles, etc. As wit any good kart racer, there is local two-way and four-way split screen which works great (I have three kids who love the game). There is online play, I played one match with a full eight player, about half were using voice. No lag, I came in 2nd.What can I say, the review surprised me so I bought the PSN version for instant gratification and the game has surprised me. I have finished the story already with about 35% of the trophies and plan on trying my luck with the editor next. If you are on the  fence, don't be ignore IGN. This game is great.

While the game presented itself as a large open map, you were limited to individual races one at a time. The career focused far too much on dull time trials and not enough on the exciting car chases. NFS Rivals is EA's second crack at this formula and has resolved both of these issues, delivering what I think is an excellent game.The split between cop and racer is back, but it's a little more open this game. Each level gives you a series of goals to pursue, such as getting N gold medal or taking down X racers. You can choose the goals for each level which opens it up a bit. There are the same time trials as before (complete with the annoying time penalties, although they're not as annoying as before) but a lot more pursuits and races and takedowns.Rivals integrates multiplayer much more deeply than before, but take it or leave it - I was never a fan on Hot Pursuit. They threw in the speed zones from Most Wanted. You can now play the game with people, similar to Test Drive Unlimited back in the day, but I've had limited success connecting to games.This game makes a great and underrated demo to show off your new XO (or PS4). It's running in EA's new Frostbite engine and has that deep, saturated, detailed look of Battlefield. It really looks great. It is, also, to my eyes, running at a full 1080p with a stable framerate. It sounds great too.Overall - if you like Hot Pursuit you really should get this game.

In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

I don't even know where to start.  Demon's Souls is a masterpiece, plain and simple.  And what's funny is that it lacks many of the elements that make RPG's epic to begin with.  A story?  Yeah, it's there, but only barely.  Cutscenes?  Maybe for around 3 minutes.  Voice acting?  Only minimally.  So what does this game offer, you ask?  Only the most engaging, atmospheric and challenging gameplay you've seen in years!Demon's Souls is, without a doubt, the most difficult game to come out this gaming generation.  Yes, it's even more difficult than the legendary Ninja Gaiden games.  Consider yourself warned.  Now you know what you're getting into before you buy.  You will die several times in this game.  Some enemies can kill you in one or two hits.  And when you die, you lose all your souls (in-game currency and only way to level up) and must retrace your steps back to where you died to recover them...provided you don't die again.  This kind of difficulty will keep some gamers away, but should you stick with it, I can promise that this is also the most rewarding game you'll ever play.  Never have I felt more accomplished upon beating a boss, and the spoils of victory are well worth it.Yet with all this crushing difficulty, not one time do I feel this game is unfair, and never does this game take cheap shots at you.  It's so perfectly balanced, and thus you can't help but come back for more.  Each time you die, you learn from your mistake/oversight/rashness and feel motivated to try again.  Someone made the analogy that it's like a drill sargeant.  They yell at you and make you feel like crap, but in the end you're a stronger person.  That is such a perfect analogy for this game.So about the game, you play a character that you create and are charged with defeating the demon bosses of the world.  Your goal is to leave the Nexus, which is the game's hub world where you buy equipment, level up, and have access to all the game worlds.  Pretty simple.  Throughout, you'll meet several NPC's that help you or hurt you.  You collect souls from the enemies you've defeated to increase your stats (and thus, your \"soul level\") or buy/repair/enhance weapons and armor.  If you're connected to the PSN, you'll see messages written on the ground from other players that'll warn of what's ahead (ambushes, traps, etc.).  You'll also see bloodstains that when touched, will show another player's untimely demise.  Occasionally, you can enter another player's game and help them, or try to kill them (and other players can also do this to you).  It's a brilliant use of online functionality.Graphically, this game is beautiful.  There's an occasional framerate drop, but not enough for you to notice.  The sound effects are atmospheric, and totally envelop you in the game world.  Surround sound is incredible, as you can hear when something is sneaking up behind you, etc.Any PlayStation 3 owners who love RPG's would be foolish not to give this a try.  If the warnings of the difficulty make you hesitant, rent it first.  More than likely you will end up purchasing it!  This is one of the finest PlayStation 3 games available, and a truly fresh and original sleeper hit that will be referred to for years to come.  You simply cannot miss this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2009"}

Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Christopher Manna","summary":"Super Smash Bros Melee","reviewText":"If you think the first Super Smash Bros was good, check out this one!

All together this 'game' or collection is perhaps the best game for current generation consoles IMO. Go ahead and laugh! This is because most modern games are not fun and lack gameplay. The only awesome game I've played from current generation consoles is Ninja Gaiden.These are REAL games from the GOLDEN ERA of ARCADE. IMO some of these old games should be made modern! Imagine Forgotten Worlds in full intense 3-D spectular mayhem fashion on Xbox 360 and PS3. However 3-D can really kill games, this is evident in many remakes such as Castlevania LOI. IMO current generation consoles are not all that and playing 3-D games on a single TV screen just isn't all that. Im waiting for hologram consoles.Looking at the preview screen shots gave me the impression that some games are console version from NES, SNES, etc... However Im glad to report that the games are arcade versions. Each game looks wonderful and comes with history info, unlockable art, tips, cast, and music. You can adjust the screen, difficulty, etc.... These games really test your reflexes.Here are the arcade machines:1942, 1943, and 1943 Kai. A vertical shooter. You shoot up Japanese WW2 planes, ships, etc... Great game(s).Bionic Commando: A horizontal platformer. You swing across trees and kill enemies. So so game.Commando: A popular vertical shooter. You are a charging marine. Great game.Exed Exes: One of many excess shooters found in this collection. Okay game.Final Fight: A super popular horizontal brawler. Great game. Similar to Streets of Rage.Forgotten Worlds: A horizontal shooter. Futuristic, ancient and zany. Awesome background theme and graphic. You can buy weapons from a pretty blonde chick too. Superb game.Ghosts 'n Goblins: A horizontal platformer. Cool medieval theme and monster design. Great game. BTW Recently I checked out an original Ghosts 'n Goblins arcade machine at an old pier amusement place, its made by Taito, lol and the graphic is hideous compare to the Capcom version on this disc.Ghouls 'n Ghosts: A later version of the former. Great game.Gun.Smoke: A vertical shooter. You are a cowboy in the old wild wild west. Great game. Excellent new button system.Legendary Wings: A mythological vertical shooter. You have flying wings, cool Greek setting. Great game.Mercs: Similar to Commando. Okay game.Pirate Ship Higemaru: I never seen this at arcades. Horrible game.Section Z: A futuristic horizontal shooter with 'metroidish' levels. Good game.Son Son: A horizontal half platform half shooter. Simple but decent game.Street Fighter II, SFII Champion Edition, and SFII Hyper Fighting: Biggest game ever from Capcom. Great fighter game. There is a two to three seconds of loading time between matches, its rather annoying.Super Ghouls 'n Ghosts: Third game of the series. Insane difficulty just like last two. Great game.Trojan: Horizontal brawler. Metro ghetto setting. Great game.Vulgus: Another vertical futuristic shooter. So so game.Overall this is a MUST BUY for all REAL gamers.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Pohle","summary":"The adventures of Marlboro man and Juno","reviewText":"tl;dr: Buy it.TLoU is quite a gem. It tells the story of this gruffy stud Joel, a good 'ol boy from Texas who's survived the unenviable position of surviving the apocalypse and having to watch the world's populace slowly turn into fungus.  Long story short, he meets Ellen (Ellie) Page and they go on grand adventures romping across the nation in the attempt to get her to a certain place while avoiding becoming fungi themselves or falling prey to bandits.  I don't want to spoil too much so that's basically the gist of it.  Rest assured this game has one of the strongest narratives in the medium, perhaps not in originality but surely in execution, and it needs to be experienced fresh and with as little foreknowledge as possible.Firstly, to the good stuff:-The presentation is, quite frankly, stunning.  Everything is so insanely detailed it left me a bit awestruck.  The post apocalyptic setting drips with atmosphere.  Crumbling buildings tower. Overgrown vegetation is beginning to reclaim the landscape.  Remnants of a civilization long since abandoned linger on the streets and in deserted homes, hotels, farms, cities.  Every area feels truly lived in and realistic in the context in which it's presented, and the feel of activity long absent is tangible.  If there's one thing ND knows well, it's that the smallest of details can add great immersion, and they're present everywhere here.  From notes scrawled hastily in panic on the walls to loved ones, to blood spatter and bullet holes, burnt out vehicles, hanging corpses, to makeshift mattresses and shelters overrun, everything just feels real.  It's a world lived and lost.As impressive as they are, the graphics aren't anything compared to the audio. It's downright award worthy and (like Super Metroid did so many years ago) really makes the game.  Santaolalla's score subtly hits all the right notes and sets an appropriate tone at crucial times.  The effects, from the sound of the infected \"Clickers\", to Joel's footsteps on different materials, to a raging thunderstorm, to the voice acting and deafening gunshot reports, they all bring to life the world in amazing clarity and power.  It's possibly some of the best sound design I've ever heard.  Make sure to wear good headphones and crank it up.In terms of gameplay, there's three aspects: resource management, stealth, and combat.Joel will attain a variety of firearms and items that he's able to craft from materials scavenged from the environment.  Crafting is done in real-time, so caution must be taken in choosing when and where (and what) to create to best deal with the situation at hand.  Something for health or defense?  Or offense but at the cost of defense?  It's constantly a game of sacrifice catered to your approach and priorities.  There's also machine parts lying around as well that can be used to upgrade weapons (reduce sway, faster reloads, etc), and pills to enhance Joel's abilities (healing speed, crafting time, etc). The inventory and crafting system is intuitive, quick, and efficient.  It never interrupts the pacing of the action and makes quick decisions, crucial to survival, a snap.Stealth and combat are excellent in their own right (why has stealth never been this simple?), and I have to mention how much I love the gunfights.  They are visceral and capture the exchange of gunfire exceptionally well.  Reason being, the firefights here are not simply a battle of lifebars.  Getting hit takes away control from the player and incapacitates Joel for 2-3 seconds, which is more than long enough to get him killed on higher difficulties.  It's not just a red screen that gradually darkens until death without any detriment to being able to play.  Getting shot has actual consequence that extends beyond simple numbers; it impedes gameplay.  This necessitates a cat and mouse type approach and makes gunfights incredibly tense and dynamic.  Guns have weight and hits feel real, and for once it's just as vital to NOT get hit as it is to hit.  Some of the best gun modelling I've seen.  Melee fighting is equally as enjoyable.  Naughty Dog has done an excellent job of making fights feel truly like a struggle for survival.  Get a few guys on you on hard or survivor, and you're screwed.Alrighty....this is getting a bit long, so onto the bad.-the A.I. is inconsistent.  It can be on the ball one minute with enemies flanking you, flushing you out with Molotovs, sneaking up and grabbing you from behind, and then in the next minute they'll be sprinting face first into your shotgun or walking over the corpse of their pal they were chatting up a minute before without a care.  Most of the time it's decent, but God knows I've seen many actions Darwin himself would be willing to hand out his award to.  The friendly A.I. can also be moronic, running out or in clear view of enemies.  They are invisible to them thankfully, but nevertheless it breaks the immersion when they're running in circles near the clickers and nothing happens.  Not a HUGE deal, but whatever....-this game suffers consistent and very noticeable frame rate drops, most apparent when quickly turning, using the flashlight, or being in large fights with a lot going on.  In the sewers it's especially bad. I'm not one to notice this usually but here it can be jarring and unfortunately does detract from the experience somewhat.-this may be a small thing, but Joel automatically puts away his gun when there's no threat nearby...it does not allow me to decide whether to arm myself or not for any extended period.  This removes the tension and unpredictability of what lays around the next corner, because if he holsters his piece that tells me there's no threats around.  The game should NEVER indicate security in any way, as the unknown is the entire point of being in a survival situation.  I don't know why the developers did this.That's about my thoughts on it.  TLoU is worth every penny and then some.  A lengthy campaign (15-20 hours), great story, characters, combat and stealth, and a world realized and unparalleled in any other game I've played.  If you are in any way even the slightest fan of survival games, BUY IT.  And when you do, I'd advise that you play this on hard your first time.  It limits what you can gather which only reinforces what makes the game so great in the first place: survival and choice.  If it's too hard, you can just go into the options and change it to easy and continue.  You won't have to start over.***I didn't play too much multiplayer.  It's decent, but the campaign is really where this game shines.***","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2013"}

It is a blast to play and multiplayer is better than ever.There are a suspiciously large number of 1 star reviews of the game. The main argument being that it should be considered an expansion to MW2. I don't agree as I've found more than enough new content and features that far exceed what you would typically get in an expansion. It doesn't stray from the COD MW formula but that is what I expect and want. If I wanted a completely different game I would have bought something else.In my opinion anything less than a 3 star review indicates either anger at expecting something different or an attempt to mislead consumers so they will purchase and support Battlefield 4. The number of 5 star reviews are close to the amount of 1 star review - that doesn't add up. There has to be bias.I've played the game so now I know what it is and what it isn't. This is definitely a game that is more of the same and I'm fine with that. It is not without innovation as there are some key features such as Spec Ops that are just darn cool.There are those that are tired of COD, and who can blame them when the average player has put in more hours than any other game in history. If you don't like it anymore, don't play it and definitely don't rush out on day one just so you can post a scathing review the next day.

I am a huge Metal Gear fan as I have played the 4 main games.  I held off buying it because of the difficulty of the boss fights.  However, I see now that it was a huge mistake.For the people calling this Metal Gear solid 5, I wouldn't go that far.  I would say it's Metal Gear Solid 4.5.  The comic cutscenes make it feel like a spinoff more than a true sequel.  But the game mechanics work so well for the PSP that it makes it feel like a true Metal Gear experience.  I recommend going with the MGS4 control scheme, that is what worked best for me.  There is an insane amount of things to do like side quests, co-op (local only), and RPG building aspects to upgrades.For those thinking of buying this game, I highly recommend buying the official strategy guide to go along with it (which is extrememly cheap here on Amazon).

{"product_name":"B0050SX97I","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Immerse Yourself and Enjoy","reviewText":"I've logged close to 50 hours with this collection and have to admit that it's even better than I expected it to be. Even the smallest hindrances (such as the x button making you exit out of menus) have been addressed. And the games are simply stunning in HD.As with any MGS game, you can expect some lengthy cut scenes (all skipable I should add) and controlling may take a bit of trial and error. The reason this isn't a bad thing is due to some excellent script writing and the fact that controls are only complicated because your character has the freedom to do SO much more than you initially suspect. But these are stealth games, requiring some degree of patience. Run and gun fans may not enjoy this experience as a result.I'm playing these games for the third time now and they still feel fresh. I love the way the menu has them sorted, not by their release date, but by their actual timeline date with regard to the story itself. The trophies make these experiences worth revisiting more than once. The inclusion of the original 8-bit games is a nice touch as well. While it would have been nice to see MGS1 for the PS1 appear on this collection, in addition to VR Missions, at least MGS1 is still available for download through the Playstation network, and only $10. As soon as VR Missions sees a release and Trophy patches are released for those two games, as well as MGS4, the PS3 owner will have a complete Metal Gear experience worthy of taking on.Regardless of anything else, this collection is still one amazing step forward for the series. And any fan is going to appreciate it. It is also the best place for a newcomer to jump in. Simply put, this HD collection does not disappoint. It delivers, and is not even close to being overpriced. A win-win and then some! Buy now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

I was expecting a well rounded cardio workout but from start up you have to focus on boxing. Don't get me wrong, if they called it \"Cardio Boxing\" I would have understood, but I was hoping for something my wife and I can use.

I was able to work up quite a sweat from it and I'm in pretty good shape to begin iwth.They should have called it cardio boxing or something similar. In that case I would have judge it for what it is.If you like cardio boxing and are looking for a different and fun workout, give this title a shot, but don't be fooled into thinking you are getting something you are not.I have to admit when using two controllers, the boxing is challenging and fun.

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"It's All Been Said Before...","reviewText":"As stated over 1,000 times before mii, the Wii is a great system for hardcore gamers, those who've been playing games for a long time, or casual gamers, those who are either new to videogames or play \"everybody can play\" games. While Wii may not offer state of the art HD visuals, it more than makes up for that with its intuitive gameplay and artistic graphics. In Wii Sports, if you want to hit a baseball with a bat, you swing the Wiimote just as you'd  a real bat, etc... the list goes on. With casual games like Wii Fit, Wii Music, and Wii Sports, those who consider themselves casual will not be disappointed. Contrary to popular belief, between games like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Super Smash Bros: Brawl, and Guitar Hero: World Tour, Metroid Prime 3, Call of Duty: World at War, Mario Galaxy and countless VC and WiiWare titles such as Mega Man 9, Wii isn't lacking in hardcore titles, either.So in short, if you'e been a fan of videogames all your life or are new to the scene, the Wii will NOT disapoint.

Single player modes include Instant Action, Galactic Conquest, and the story-based Historical Campaigns mode that lets gamers experience all of the epic battles from Episodes I-VI, fighting from the perspective of each of the four factions within the game. First and third-person gameplay depending on player preference.Features:Three single player modes including Instant Action, Galactic Conquest, and the story-based Historical Campaigns mode.Multiplayer for up to 16 players (plus AI units) online.Split-screen mode for multiplayer offline play.Battle in more than 12 environments across 10 diverse planets from the classic Trilogy and Clone Wars eras including Hoth, Tatooine, Kamino, and Geonosis.20 different soldier types from 4 factions: Rebel Alliance, Galactic Empire, Republic Clone Army, and Separatist Battle Droids.

The main singleplayer campaign puts you through all of these battles in chronological order and you have to play on the side that is supposed to win according to Star Wars history.This isn't the highlight of the game, though. You have Instant Action where you can play any battle from any side and you can choose what era you want for just about every one of them(except 3 or 4...Hoth, Endor, and that cloning facility are the ones that I can think of immediately. They might be it, but I can't remember.)Galactic Conquest is fun when you want to play with an objective in mind. You go through attacking planets as you choose. If a planet is under your control, you can activate a planetary bonus, such as extra troops, troops whose wounds heal, a Jedi fighting with you, jam your enemies radar, etc, etc. The addition of these bonuses makes the Galactic Conquest mode worthwhile.So basically, you just go out as a soldier, sniper, demolitions trooper, pilot, w/e and do all the damage you can while taking control of \"command posts\" which are these little circular things in the ground that emit a light. Red for enemy, green for you. You stand on it, keep it clear of enemies, and it will go white, and eventually green. That's the whole point of the game. You don't HAVE to get them, though, as long as you keep the ones you have well defended and take down the enemies numbers. You start out w/ about 180-250 each. That's not the actual number of troops out there, though. It's how many respawns your side has left. So, you can just wear down your enemy and win. Some command posts are very useful to get, though, as certain ones are the spawn points for enemy vehicles, which can do a lot of damage.Before you buy this game, you should definitely borrow it or rent it. Play just one battle, really. If you like it, ask yourself if you think it's worth buying it for pretty much more of the same over and over. It is to me, because it's just so much fun and done so well, and all the maps are vastly different from each other, so it's not as repetative as it could have been if the maps were poor.The only real problems I have are that the battlefields are generally too tight to use provided starfighters with much effectiveness, and you can't fight as any of the special characters in the game--the Jedi, Sand People, Jawas, or Ewoks. You do get a Wookie, though. And the Droideka is always fun.Perfect game if you like nonstop action, and don't mind if there's nothing else to it. No storyline, very little need for strategy(it's pretty much all deciding what soldier type you want and where to deploy him), and no tedious objectives. Just grab a blaster and kill everyone and everything that's not on your side.My kind of game.There need to be more games like this done as nicely as Battlefront.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2004"}

The second thing is that you can now use Mario and flip into 3D for a certain amount of time to find new paths, solve puzzles, and find new items. The story here though is its strong point.Mario has to, once again, save the world from a new minion known as Count Bleck. Mario has to get 7 Pure Hearts to counter act all worlds being sucked in by The Void. Along with you are the 4 heroes Mario, Peach, Bowser, and Luigi. Each character has their special attributes to solve puzzles etc. The graphics are crisp, sharp, and refreshing yet they still feel old and they don't push the Wii's limits one bit. Also, since they RPG elements were cut the strategy has been taken out and may turn Paper Mario vets off. Also, the story is to predictable too early on.

With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization.

After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

It was fun for the first 25 or so levels but after that it just got boring, and for $60 dollars I'd like my games to hold my interest for longer than that. Basically what we have here is a shooter that can be played co up with 3 of your friends. IT IS NOT ANYTHING LIKE FALLOUT, and it is strange that people keep comparing the two. The loot is mediocre at best, yes there is a ton of it but it is pretty low quality, probably you will use 1 item out of every 50 that you pick up. Also there is no looting system, get online with a bad group and they'll be taking your guns.Killing bosses with your friends is fun, but if they aren't playing it isn't worth it. Rarely is there anyone on who is in the high enough levels where my characters are and the game is not the same when played by yourself. Split screen on this is horrible, it splits it vertical. If you do decide to get this game I would imagine there are more players on PC.The biggest let down is the characters, they really only get one ability that changes slightly depending on how you level them. The skill trees are extremely shallow, they need more substance, they do some nice things once you put points into them but nothing that really feels worth grinding a bunch of levels for.In short this game is fun for a short amount of time, but once you get beyond the surface there just is not enough. It is not a bad game, it is just ok, not worth $60 dollars. I do not recommend buying it until you see it in a bargain bin, and even then it probably won't be worth it because I don't think people will be playing this for very long.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2009"}

Sensing your distrust, Halaskar sends you off to quell an uprising in the barbaric borderlands. However, upon your return home, to your utter amazement, you find the land of Dureth a horribly changed place.Greater sources reveal to you that it is very possibly your own king who is responsible for brutally torturing and mindlessly killing many of the innocent people whom you were once sworn to protect. In order to save your Kingdom and restore peace and order to the lands, you and you comrades agree that the only solution is to assassinate the king.On your journey, get ready to explore mystical lands drenched with deceit and betrayal as you venture to save your people. Teleport to the first site of anguish, the Sunken Cathedral located in a flooded portion of the city where the king's sorcerers have animated the long-drowned people to keep them in eternal pain.

Encounter the following four characters as you attempt to put an end to Halaskar's madness:Warrior- The awesome might of his steel-clad fists leave a trail of shattered bodies in his path. His magical abilities mirror his physical strength. This includes rippling shockwaves, controlled blasts of force, and other earthshaking attacks.Scout- Using shadow magic, poisonous attacks, and vicious direct assaults, the Scout is a fierce close-quarters combatant. Her agility and skill with bladed weapons giver her an almost snake-like appearance as she weaves through throngs of enemies.Mage- The Mage wields a staff in addition to his mastery of arcane elements. The Mage's basic attacks are weaker than the other classes but he makes up for it with his commanding power over the elements of fire and ice.King- Halaskar is a man driven by the pursuit of power an security. When Halaskar assumed the throne, he vowed to secure the Kingdom of Dureth from al aggressors once and for all. Yet as the years passed, the kingdom descended deeper and deeper into an era of war and suffering. Today, rumors whisper of great atrocities against the people of Dureth...atrocities committed by monsters bearing the King's orders.Not only doesUntold Legends: Dark Kingdomfeature rich next-generation visuals and engaging combat, but it also offers players a unique multiplayer online co-op mode. Take on Halaskar yourself or ask a friend to join you on your quest. Either way, the Kingdom hangs in the balance, and a world looks your way for help.","reviewerName":"Tso Haven Hei Wan \"Havenough Dupont Randall-B...","summary":"So much you think they offered so little you get","reviewText":"Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom is another offer from Sony Online Entertainment along the same line as Champions of Norath. However, it proves itself to be falling short of what gamers expect the game to be.The story is cliche full of dark arts, possession, addiction to power and betrayal. So you can't really expect much as they were just excuses for you to go through dungeons after dungeons. There are only 3 character classes you can choose from. This is quite limiting as you would expect on a PS3 they will allow more character classes and micromanagement of your characters. That's not really the case. You only have Warrior, Mage and Scout and that's all because the class you can choose was \"tied\" to the story line. Also there is a maximum level that your character can go and after that nothing more. So there will be a substantial part of the game you will be wondering why are you fighting the enemies if you are not gaining any levels. Also the skill sets available for your characters are quite limited and some of them are not as useful for your adventure at all.  Character management can also be done through buying armours and crafting your weapons etc. However, the number of armours you can choose from are not that many and you need essence which are not really that handy to come by for certain classes if you are playing the offline multi-player mode. In my case most of the essence went to the Scout and leaving the Mage on a shoe string budget most of the time. If you are thinking of selling extra armours to cash in, you are not much better off either. Not only most only sold for minimal amount, you have very restricted space in your luggage to carry them around before you got slashed into oblivion by swamps of enemies. Also with the limited level up ability of your character, you would wonder why they even bother put in some runes that can help you level up quicker near the end of the game - because there is really no more level up after level 45.Dungeons are ok but some of them are so repetitive that you just really lose interest after half way or even a quarter way through. There are platformish kind of elements put into this dungeon crawler that you don't even know why they put them in except for the sake of extending the play time of this game. Some of the levels are so annoying that eventually you just don't care about whether your character die or not after some time. The environments are quite monotone most of the time so there aren't even anything pretty to look at.  Puzzles are not particularly ingenious although there are levels that important elements shown on the map are so obscure in the real environment that you could hardly see which polygon you should be interacting with. Also if you want to know what bad camera angles mean in a game, nobody can beat this game. A lot of time your views are blocked by trees, buildings, walls, bookshelves etc. etc. So you can hear your characters being attacked but can't see where to counter. So you could end up just using wide attack in a corner where you have no idea what your character is doing until you see all the enemy life bars disappeared on the screen (or your own character's cry of death).Enemies and bosses are equally monotonous although they managed to create some bosses that really put your patience to test. For a fair share of the game you will see the same skeletons and demons coming after you again and again as you hack and slash through them. Then suddenly after certain part of the game, the enemy curve went up so quickly that even if you maxed out your defense you will still think what wrong have you done to deserve such brutal and unfair treatment. Also they managed to put in puzzle solving inside some boss fights. So you will be busily dealing with demanding puzzles while trying to fight the bosses and their minions off. In some areas they even throw in a bit of environmental hazards that you will never be able to forget the importance of OH&S; in real life.The game also has zero replay value as you cannot save your final level up'd characters for the next round. So you will need to go through this hell again if you are one of the brave souls who dare to replay this game.On the whole Untold Legends: Dark Kingdom lived up to its name by making it should not be told to anyone to waste time on it as it will command some of the darkest hours of your life. The orchestral score managed to help you to remember how better you could spend your time with other more thoughtful games that you could have played instead.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2009"}

This game rocks!","reviewText":"Who cares about the one save feature?! You can play through any level you want over and over! It doesn't have a story mode. This game is pure arcade action to the core. One permanent save is all you need! It doesn't break the game at all. All of you whiners complaining about it are in the wrong. Like it or not the game business is still a business at heart and business' need to make a profit to stay afloat in todays economy. Would YOU wanna get ripped off from people if you lost money on your product?! If you planned on selling this game after playing it you would make what?... 20 bucks!? If you can afford to pay the 40 bucks for this great game then I dont think you are hurting for cash. The game is fast paced and fun and offers infinite replayability! To those who love the mercenaries part of resident evil, you are in for a treat. Do not listen to all the big effing whiners here on amazon. I am with capcom on this one. They are a business, they need to make money. They dont want you selling their product. Get over it!

Features Trigger Grips and satin grip finish for enhanced comfort designed for extended game play. Tested to ensure PlayStation Vita System won't come loose or get damaged when used with grips. Officially licensed by Sony.","reviewerName":"Strider Hiryu","summary":"Like it! Works fine. The only one on the market so far.","reviewText":"Pretty nice launch accessory. Since it's the only trigger add on that's on the market, it's hard to compare it. It's not a game changer like using good arcade fight stick on a fighting game. It does make life easier like using good Turtle Beach headset for an online FPS game. If Hori makes a better one, I may jump on it. Overall I'm happy with it and don't plan on returning it.Pros:- Works and does the job- Triggers was my only main draw of buying this and they work great. Playing Uncharted makes it easier and more fun but games like Hot Shots Golf won't make a difference (duh).- Placement of the triggers are further down than where the shoulder buttons are which is perfect.- Semi rubberish grips are fine and feel pretty nice. Glad it's not plastic.- It a nice tight fit so it doesn't move or get loose.- Snaps on and off easily. If you want to remove it to use a plastic case to take it on the go, it won't be a problem switching out.- If you're using the Sony brand protective film (screen protector) like I am, the Trigger Grips won't touch, ruin, or interfere with it.Cons:- The grips don't branch out that far down. That can be good or bad depending on preference. I don't mind that much but would rather have them a little longer.- It'll obviously makes the Vita a little bulkier so it's harder to fit it into your pocket or take it on the go.- I'm a little on fence on the price. Seems it should be $9.99 but most Vita accessories are $15 - $20 anyways. Amazon (as the seller) has it for $15 but it pretty much sold out right away during the launch of the Vita. Got mine at Gamestop for $18. Gamestop and Toys R Us are selling some of their Vita accessories a few more dollars for some reason.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0053BSNZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Dom","summary":"repetitive...","reviewText":"I've been buying the UFC games since 2009 when the first UFC Undisputed came out. With that said this is the best one yet, but to me it still has its flaws.Like the previous two games I just really don't like the controls and its NOT because im bad (im actually pretty good). I picked up EA MMA for $20 last year and after playing I thought the sticks for striking made a lot more sense. I was really hoping that THQ took some notes and switched to this or made it an option but they didn't.Every strike animation for a particular move looks exactly the same. It starts to look like a rock'em sock'em robots match. All your punches land perfectly every time. Its just not realistic. I think they need to scrap this system, and start from scratch. In a real fight when a fighter gets tired his punches become less accurate, and slower. This is why I think the sticks for striking is a better option. They could make the accuracy of your strikes depend on how straight you flick the sticks.I have mixed feelings about the submission system. I do think the mini-game is better than seeing how fast you can spin the sticks or mash the buttons. But I have the same complaint as everyone else. You take your eyes off the fight with this and you don't get to enjoy it. I honestly don't know how they could improve this so it doesn't bother me that much. Its an upgrade from the previous system.Pride mode is awesome... This was the big draw for me to buy this game. The pride roster is a little weak, but you can't blame the developers for that. UFC doesn't have the right to put all those guys in the game. They do allow you to take UFC fighters into pride, and pride fighters into UFC so its not that big of a deal. The one thing missing from pride mode is open weight. Pride had open weight grand prix tournament where it had middleweights to super heavyweights.Now my biggest complaint... The game announced a DLC schedule 2 weeks before the game was released. I just paid $60 for a video game and instantly have to put another $18 out for a \"season pass\" because I want the option to play with a complete roster. Its just not right... This company doesn't care about the consumer. The game also requires a pass to play online. If you buy it new you get it for free, if you buy used you have to pay.The game honestly isn't that big of an upgrade over the last two versions. They did make some additions but nothing huge. I don't know what the hell they've been doing for the last two years, but the game engine doesn't seem like it received two years worth of upgrades. After a week i feel like im playing the same old game. This is what happens when a video game company has no competition. It really is sad... I'm done with this series for now, when the next one comes out ill be sure to demo it first. The game lacks freshness. You'll be bored with it before you finish your career mode.If you wanna buy this I suggest waiting for the price to drop $20 first. It'll probably happen a lot sooner than later.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}

I liked how they gave Samus excellent melee & finishing moves.  The weapons were good as usual like they were in past Metroid games.  I really enjoyed the boss battles.  The graphics looked great to me, even in 2013.  The controls were done well for the most part.  I like the idea and feeling of switching between 3rd and 1st person.  In first person mode I had fun blasting enemies with missiles, charge shots, and locking the grappling hook before swinging back to 3rd person mode. My only issue was not being able to move in first person mode.  Scanning large areas was quite a chore.  A few of the enemies were tough to lock as well. If there is anyway the possible that they can allow you to move in 1st person mode while still keeping the 3rd person element, I would have given this game 5 plus stars!  I really enjoyed the level designs.  The sounds were really good.  They didn't have the eerie music that I like playing as much as past metroid games.  When the music is playing it's great! I personally didn't like how Samus had to get permission to use weapons she already had.  She is a bounty hunter that plays by her own rules.  I understand that she had to agree to follow her former superior officer's rules to participate in the mission, but she shouldn't have to consult with him when it was life or death or the only way you can advance in the game.  The power bomb was the only thing I can see her getting permission on. I can understand why the story irritated many.  I didn't mind the emotion of the story.  I didn't mind Samus narrating her past at the beginning to set the story line.  Samus is a loner bounty hunter and really has no one to interact with. I have to have interaction in my video game story lines.  I just got a little annoyed towards the end of the game because of the LONG break in all of the fun and furious action I was having.  It took awhile before the action to crank back up.  Once it did, It made up for the break in action.  I hope the same team works on the next game for the Wii U and really utilizes the game pad.  If they improve the story line and first person controls, they will have another hit on their hands!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2013"}

In actual gameplay it is kind of lame.Cow racing & billiards are lots of fun. Pose your Mii and fishing are a waste of space. Ping-pong is confusingly difficult to work. Tanks!, find you mii, laser hockey, and shooting gallery are ok.So the justification is a 40$ controller + game = worthwhile. I disagree. Even the games that I like are so very, very shallow that they only have multiplayer value. I loved the cow racing, but the one course, for the same length of time gets real old. Billiards is fun, so why is it only 9 ball and no other kinds of billiards? What about even a slightly different set of rules for any of these games, change the length of time for example? Nope - not possible.Wii Sports has 3 great minigames and one stinker. Play easily has more bad than good. A great minigame? Maybe, but at least a few times a week I'll be playing Wii Sports, not this. Unfortunately the lack of depth shows after a short while.This had a lot of potential, but the games are skeletons of what should have been. If they released a more fleshed out version of this it would be worthwhile. Now its value is in a \"free\" controller.Oh and also only two players? WTF? Only laser hockey & ping-pong need to be two players, the rest could easily be 4 players at once.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2007"}
