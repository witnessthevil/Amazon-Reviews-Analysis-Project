{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Bore da - it's a welsh Assassin!","reviewText":"I have played and reviewed every AC that's available for the 360 and some have been 5 stars, others not so much. This is mostly due to poor design choices the developers made, which resulted in frustration rather than fun and tedium instead of terrific play. Often an Assassin's Creed game, one that would be stunning up to a point, would be ruined by a complete change in gameplay often removing free roam and forcing you to play never-ending cut scenes.AC 3 was guilty of this from the outset with its five hour tutorial and ultimately dull protagonist. But it did have nice elements including the sea battles and someone at Ubisoft must have realized this... As AC Black Flag is amazing.From the outset you know it's a proper, seasoned game, not a rushed jumpy mess and being able to roam the seas engaging in battles whenever you want is a sight to see. Many of the once tedious elements of AC3 are here such as hunting and skinning but here the simple fact is it *works* in AC4' it has a purpose and adds to the game and therefore the fun rather than breaks momentum.Also fixed is the story and this protagonist ( a Welshman no less ) is radically more interesting and frankly totally swashbuckling.The usual stuff is here; earn outfits, weapons, locations, eagle eye spots, upgrade buildings and again here it works. For example, by upgrading your base island you can hire help such as pretty ladies or thugs completely for free so it's more than a cosmetic addition.Missions have also been upgraded, although do expect the occasional &#34;desync if detected&#34; ones which are the bane of all AC games. But gone are the out of sight countdowns on tail missions if you eagle eye your target beforehand... You can then see through walls.Also gone is the silly apple weapon and most of the alien nonsense, replaced instead by a meta Abstergo first-person real world area that's far more fun to roam around in and again makes sense.In all, I will admit I encountered just a few bugs and was annoyed by a couple of the missions, but this release has totally brought the franchise back to life and I enjoyed every single minute of it. If you were put off by AC3, and I don't blame you, then buy AC4 with confidence.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000TVT8PI","reviewerName":"M. Schnackenberg","summary":"Journalist's Review","reviewText":"The PlayStation 3 (PS3) is a great console and with every firmware update Sony adds new features and modifies others making the overall console better and better. There are many people questioning the console wondering why it costs so much and is it worth it. Each and every feature grants its users functionality, entertainment, and experiences that is beyond what is expected from PlayStation Branded product. There are many thing that make the PS3 a must have console and here are some of the reasons why.The online function for the PS3 is made using Sony's idea of keeping it a free user based network. Even though it is limited currently you can send messages to other users keep a buddy list, browse the internet using Sony's own internet browser, download music, movies, game demos, arcade games and more. Sony is currently working on a social networking game, if you will, called Home that will be accessible both on your PC though a standard webpage similar to MySpace and the PlayStation 3 to enter the virtual world of Home.There are a good amount of games available for purchase at retail or for download off the PlayStation Network Store. Prices for downloads range from 3.99 to 39.99. There are also PS1 games that can be played on both the PS3 and the PSP, if you own one, available for download. There are even specialized media available for download like custom Cross-media Bar themes, backgrounds, and game trailers. After major media events Sony will release mostly all content shown for their consoles.If you want to make yourself feel good you can use the Folding@Home feature that helps the medical branch of Stanford University study protein stains from diseases in hope of finding a cure from everything ranging from the common cold or AIDs, cancer, and herpes. Recently thanks to the PlayStation 3's contribution a new protein was discovered that folds at the speed of one nano-second.The price for the PS3 might seem to be a bit pricy but with the features and amount of games available it does justify spending 399 (40GB model) or 499 (80GB model/bundle) bucks but just to farther clarify the reasons to purchase this great piece of hardware here is some more features and explanations on the console's price point and functionality.The reason for the price currently being so high is because of the Blu-ray Disc drive installed in the console. You might be wondering why Sony would jam their format into a gaming console. It's for two reasons for this. They are making it so that you can watch movies High-Resolution all the way up to 1080p, and make it so that game developers have enough space to make a huge game without having to worry about discs changing or being limited by the amount of space.So what can Blu-ray Disc do that rival High-Definition (HD) format HD-DVD or standard DVD's can't? HD-DVD has mostly everything Blu-ray Disc does but doesn't offer nearly as much space which can cause movie studios to limit the amount of HD content or special features on the disc. Blu-ray Disc also has a new feature available called Blu-ray Java which will allow the menus to look even better and enable HD picture in picture if a studio feels imposed to include the feature. Another key detail is that 6/8 Hollywood studios and most hardware manufacturers support Blu-ray Disc.Some people might consider the 40GB a rip-off because it currently can't play PS2 games, has 2 USB ports, and has no card readers. If playing PS2 games is that important to you, either purchase a PS2 when it gets its price drop winter 2007 or buy the 80GB model. PS2 games aren't going to be made as much as current generation games now so truly there is no real worry and Sony should be working on remaking their software anyways so the ability to play PS2 games should be brought back.Another great feature is the internal Wi-Fi Adapter. This allows you to not have to either buy an external Wi-Fi adapter to make your gaming console have wireless internet and saves money on Ethernet Cables.The HDMI port built in to the console is rated to run HDMI 1.3. It supports 7.1 lossless-audio which is currently the best audio quality available, and it also supports up to a 1440p resolution so once TVs manage to obtain the Ultra-High-Definition levels the PS3 will be able to at least play some of its smaller PlayStation Network Store downloadable games at that resolution.Now finally the key advantage, the Cell Broadband Engine, the heart of the console. This processor is designed by Sony, Toshiba, and IBM. The Cell is currently the most powerful processor to date, and basic desktop processors are expected to take another 4 or 5 years to match its power. The Cell has been rated to be 12 - 15 times faster than Intel's Core 2 Quad-Extreme.There's a good amount of titles released and going to be released this Holiday season. Each of the titles bring something to each of their specific genre making it so that if you're a fan of the genre it's a must buy. Here's a list of some of the major titles out and coming out.

I was a backer on Kickstarter and received my OUYA.  The setup was fast and easy.  At first the some of the menus didn't make sense and accessing some things were hard.  There have been a few updates which has made this easier.Game selection: So far I have not purchased any games.  Most of the trials I've played are okay but I'd like to see some better games.  It has emulators for all of your retro gaming needs.  Another reason I haven't purchased any games is because I already own many of them through Steam.Apps: The twitch.tv app works really great.  Many other apps have been announced but not made yet.  Hopefully we will see more and more apps in the future.Controller: the controller has worked great for me so far.  I've really enjoyed it, it looks sharp and feels good.  Worst case scenario if you don't like the OUYA itself the controller is great for steam big picture mode.  You can use the touchpad to control your mouse if you accidentally get tabbed out.In the developer area you can access the browser and download apk's for other games and apps.  Please keep in mind these are not optimized for the OUYA and may not work well and some of the controller functionality might not work.  I recently downloaded the XBMC app and it seems to work fine.Right now you can still tell this console is very new.  I see it getting added support and games in the future.  OUYA has the potential to have a great future as long as things keep getting developed for it.  As of right now I don't think it's a must buy.

In my brief time with it, I could definitely agree that this game kicks the crap out of the Call of Duty franchise.  The single-player campaign was intense, varied, and made sure that the player never gets bored.  You pilot a variety of vehicles, the weapon variety is great and the ease with which you can manage weapons is phenomenal.  Also, the game looks incredible!  Detailed textures, smooth frame rate...this is how first-person shooters should all perform.So what's the problem?  The game is also hideously broken.  During the campaign, you can expect the game to crash on you repeatedly, forcing you to restart the level.  Then the last time this happened to me, I was forced to restart the entire campaign!  Therefore, I regret to say I'm done with the game.  I do not have the time nor desire to keep starting over every time something goes wrong.  It's really a shame, since the game was actually really good.This kind of bugginess in a game is unacceptable.  There is no way this game was ready for release, and it's astounding that after four months, not a single one of those 2 GB patches have fixed anything.  Don't waste your money on this product.

C. Orr","summary":"Worth getting, but flawed.","reviewText":"2007's Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare (better known as CoD4) easily surpassed the expectations of even the most ardent admirers of the Call Of Duty series. It successfully took the WW2-inspired storyline and dynamics of the CoD games and created a superbly paced FPS with memorable setpieces. It was one of the best games of this generation. Does its true successor, Modern Warfare 2 surpass it? The simple answer must be no; but it is still a fun, addictive and well-crafted shooter with the revered online component fully intact.In terms of improvements over CoD4, MW2 does not try to do the impossible by trumping its glorious predecessor. Graphically and sonically the game has not been overhauled, although the excellent character detail and animation helps disguise any stagnation with regards to presentation.The story, too, is a good deal less coherent than CoD4's, with sudden plot developments often dealt with haphazardly and half-heartedly, as if the writers had no belief that the events portrayed could take place. This is not to say that the story cannot be engaging. Key setpieces -such as a bombed and occupied White House appearing through the dust of the battlefield- are stunning; it is just that they are far less frequent than CoD4's key eye-popping moments.The story mode is of a similar length to CoD4. The story can be completed in about 6 to 7 hours. It is a shame that developers Infinity Ward have not aimed at lengthening the story mode, a fact not helped by the frequent placement of checkpoint. The game in single-player is just a little too short and easy. Of course, to the throngs of fans wanting to play online, this is not much of an issue. But for 45, I expect a decent challenge in single-player.While the online component of Modern warfare 2 is excellent, giving experienced and newbie players alike equal opportunity to enjoy the various modes, MW2 marks a rather unwelcome (in my opinion) move towards making high-quality videogames with a heavy emphasis on multiplayer rather than creating a challenging and lengthy single-player mode. MW2 is a tremendously good game: it just isn't a step forward over CoD4, or the brilliant PS3 Killzone 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2009"}

It's just that the game is bogged down by the weight of itself and it's derivation from other rpgs.  There are too many \"movies\" and too much loading which stops the game dead while you're trying to play it even when you play it there are too many \"stop and fetch\" missions.

I was absolutely absorbed by the lore Bioware created for it, and instantly fell in love with the characters with whom I eventually traveled Ferelden. On the whole, I almost liked it BETTER than even MASS EFFECT 2, because I felt like I was playing out MY story, not Shepard's story. That's a feeling I've not had since KotOR. But, similarly to KotOR, the production values of DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS felt last generation, which hindered the experience in many ways.So, I was surprised to hear about this expansion so soon after the main game's release. I mean...when I first heard about this at the beginning of the year: barely two months after DA:O came out. I was concerned that this was just going to be a moneygrab by Bioware/EA, since...who has ever made an expansion that quickly? (Maybe EVERQUEST). Additionally, though Bioware have proven that they are the best at creating absorbing story/character-driven video games, they absolutely suck at DLC. (Pinnacle Station RAGE!)Is this expansion worth buying? That's difficult for me to say. Hopefully my experience will help you make up your mind.Chances are very good that this expansion will not snugly sync up with your ending from the main game. In my case, I had made it pretty clear to everyone that I was going to leave with Zevran to track down Morrigan. Then, I begin DA:O - AWAKENING to discover that I had apparently changed my mind and decided to become a commander of the Crown's army. A small scene to show how my character was drawn back into the fray would have solved this, but this is just one of many instances where your decisions from the last game have almost no effect on this storyline. (And to the poor souls who began the game wearing nothing but their underwear: my condolences.)This was a major downer, and I am very disappointed that Bioware didn't put a little more time (god knows Bioware fans are used to the long development cycles by now) to make the transition much easier. Don't even get me started on the import system. It's not as fine-tuned as that of MASS EFFECT 2; it takes data from your last save point. I had started up an old save at some point on DA:O, so I began AWAKENING with my character at level 17. It was an hour before I had realized what had happened. EDIT: Just so there's no confusion, I was able to open up an \"advanced\" menu and select the right save file, but words cannot communicate the frustration involved with immediately replaying that bit again.But that's not to say I hated this game; I enjoyed the story in AWAKENING and I REALLY enjoyed the new characters. At times, it felt like the best parts of DA:O. In addition to this, some new talents and specializations, a higher level cap and, finally, someplace to store equipment: I was a happy camper for a while. I also enjoyed having the opportunity to rule Amaranthine, and I wish that Bioware had expanded upon this a bit more. Carrying out prisoner sentencing in a fantasy setting has to be one of the coolest features ever.On \"normal\" difficulty, getting all (but one) of the achievements, and completing almost every quest in the game, I enjoyed just over 13 hours of gameplay.Was it worth $40? No, probably not. I think anyone who has reservations about this expansion should trust their instincts and wait for the price to drop. Bioware really should have taken the price down to justify the content, rather than place it at $40 and keep people like myself wondering why there isn't more. I don't exactly feel cheated, since I really did enjoy the expansion, but I paid just as much for the first 4 expansions of FALLOUT 3 and those actually felt like EXPANSIONS. DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS - AWAKENING feels like an episode: almost completely isolated from the last game in terms of both content and story.There is much that can be loved in this \"expansion\" for fans of DRAGON AGE, but this should be a very clear example to Bioware of why some gamers insist on buying their video games used.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2010"}

It's impact was gargantuan, and continued the Halo series' status as a gaming phenomenon. Well today is the drop date for the new Halo title, ODST (or Orbital Drop Shock Trooper). But without the Cortana, the Flood, and most notably absent, the Master Chief, can this game be considered a true Halo title?The answer is quite simply: yes. Halo: ODST packs the same punch that the previous games in the series did while making enough changes to make it feel like a game worthy of being a standalone title.The story starts off with a crew of ODST's dropping into New Mombasa (a city widely featured throughout the Halo mythos) in order to take out a Covenant ship. Well, things go terribly wrong and you wake up six hours later in the dark of night. You'll spend most of your time as the Rookie, the newest member of the ODST squad, as you try to find out what exactly happened six hours earlier. Throughout the game, you'll find clues which then cue flashbacks in which you'll play as other members of your squad. The overarching sense of mystery that shrouds the events in ODST makes for quite an engaging experience that will make you want to keep on playing.Halo: ODST has a far more human story than the other games in the series because, after all, the story involves people instead of a ten-foot tall cyborg, his ten-foot tall alien buddy, and their A.I. sidekick. The story really stresses that, as awesome as these guys are, they aren't superhuman like the chief, and their tale is far more riveting, and personal than any other story we've seen in a Halo game.Another great example of ODST's more down to earth story is Sadie's Story, a series of audiologs the player can find throughout New Mombasa that recount the tale of a New Mombasa resident, and her struggle with the Covenant invasion.While the plot may not be as sprawling, or epic as what you saw in the previous Halo titles, it's comprehensible, clever, and more relatable.While it sticks close to the Halo 3 formula in terms of core gameplay, ODST does feature a number of changes, tweaks, and new content.First, and most importantly, the campaign is actually interesting. You won't play it simply because you feel obligated to as in Halo 3. This is thanks in large part to superb mission structure. The core game will feature you in the open world - yes, open world, as in go where you want - city of New Mombasa, then as you find clues (as mentioned earlier) you'll be transported to more linear levels.It's the combination of this open-endedness coupled with the more concise, more linear segments in which you enter the shoes of another ODST that makes for some excellent pacing. You'll want to play through the campaign, and thanks to the fact that new things are constantly thrown at you, you'll have a hell of a time exploring New Mombasa.In terms of general gameplay tweaks, there are a few worth mentioning. For one thing, your character is no Master Chief. That means you don't jump as high, you're not able to use all the same kind of ordinance, and you have no regenerating shield. But, fortunately the game is rather forgiving, there are health stations aplenty, and, although you'll have to be smarter about engaging large groups of enemies, fighting the Covenant isn't too difficult.ODST also feature some new (but not radically so) equipment. The most important is your new visor, which lacks a radar, but allows you access for a GPS display of New Mombasa, and most importantly, helps illuminate your surroundings as the majority of the game takes place at night. There are also two tweaked weapons. The first is your standard weapon, which is essentially a silenced SMG with a scope. The second is a pistol also outfitted with a silencer and a scope. Obviously, we've seen both of these weapons before across the Halo games, but they are much more powerful, and much more useful this time around.Halo: ODST's core gameplay is very, very close to that of Halo 3, and you can definitely tell that this is an expansion-pack style game, but the developers have done just enough to make it a little more than that.The new multiplayer feature in ODST is Firefight, and it's really awesome. The game mode features ten all new maps specifically designed for the new gametype, and they're all very well designed, although some are better than others. Firefight tasks you and up to three other teammates with simply holding out against waves of Covenant for as long as you can. But don't go thinking it'll be a walk in the park - gameplay changing Skulls (similar to the ones you can find in the other Halo titles)will be added as your team progresses through waves.Firefight ends up being just as well designed as all the other multiplayer game types Halo has to offer, but just like every other Halo game, some maps are better than others.The one part of the ODST package that I really don't like is that of the inclusion of Halo 3's multiplayer component (all DLC maps included), with the addition of three new maps. It's not that I don't like Halo 3 multiplayer, in fact, quite the contrary, I think it's amazing, and the three new maps are great, but for anyone who spent $30 total on the DLC maps as they came out will feel kind of ripped off. If you lived under a rock for the past two years, or never bought any of the DLC you'll be delighted with this multiplayer disc. If you did shell out the 30 bucks on the map packs, you'll feel pretty ripped off, and it makes me wish that there was a different version of the game available that had took out the second disk in return for a lower price point.Halo: ODST's new Firefight game mode is addicting, and the new campaign is easily the best Halo campaign since the original. On top of that, if you never played Halo 3, you'll absolutely love the second disk which features the game's full multiplayer component, plus three new maps. If you didn't spend $30 on Halo 3's various map packs, you'll enjoy this disk too because it features all 10 post-release maps. But if you did spend $30, expect to be disappointed, even if Halo 3's multiplayer is awesome as ever.ODST runs on the same Halo 3 engine, but graphical improvements have been made. For one, we see much better cut-scene animations, and also the urban art style has been greatly improved, which is fortunate because you'll spend all your time in the cityscape of New Mombasa. Halo 3's engine is beginning to show some age, but the game's graphics are still good even today.The sound department is just as awesome as ever, too. The soundtrack features many of the classic Halo tracks we know and love, but it's the new music that steals the show, these new tracks are very moody, and well delivered. Also, sound effects are still excellent, and the sound design as a whole is truly masterful. Also, in keeping with the more human plot, the voice-overs are all exceptionally well done, featuring the voice talents of sci-fi favorites Nathan Fillion, Adam Baldwin, Alan Tudyk, and Tricia Helfer.All of the Halo games had excellent production values, and ODST is no exception.Halo: ODST's campaign will run you about six to eight hours, but there is plenty of exploration to be done if you want to hunt down all the Sadie's Story audio files. Firefight might not be everyone's cup of tea but it's well worth checking out, not to mention there's a strong possibility of becoming addicted to it as I have. In terms of the general multiplayer component featured on the second disk, the value you'll get out of it will greatly vary. If you're new to Halo 3's multiplayer, you'll probably get really into it as most people did, but for everyone else, it depends on how sick you've gotten of Halo 3's online component. Some people might still happily play for many months to come, but others might have grown tired of it by now. The campaign and Firefight offer a decent enough value as is, but the amount of hours you'll get out of your ODST experience will greatly vary based on how much you'll play the second disk's multiplayer.Halo: ODST is the best Halo game since the original. It's campaign is awesome, and the new Firefight provides a fresh multiplayer gametype for your Halo experience. And aside from little thing here and there, the game only has one real flaw which is the second disk's multiplayer component. Some will feel ripped off, some will be tired of the Halo 3 multiplayer already, but some will be sinking in ridiculous amounts of time. That being said, Halo: ODST provides a terrific experience that fans of the Halo games need to check out, and those who haven't yet played Halo 3 really should not miss out on no matter what. Prepare to drop.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

What makes this game worth 60 dollars?This is by far the worst Halo in the series.  The storyline is terribly broken, which switches characters and missions constantly, leaving you without a hint of immersion.  I had no idea what I was doing until 3 hours in the campaign, only to be switched to another persons perspective.The big sell point of this game was also of course, the firefight mode.  I have yet to get more than one person in a game for this mode since xbox live friends are more for show than to actually play with.  I understand the novelty of getting your buddies to link up their xboxes to play halo, but that was 5 years ago.  It's time to open up coop gaming to random people.  I hate how Bungie is limiting my experience of Halo to how they think I should play it.  It's my friggin game, stop telling me I can't play campaigns with a random person online!  How do you think we make friends on xbox anyway?The multiplayer disc given in ODST is a combination of all the Halo 3 maps sold in downloadable content before.  There isn't one new map available.  Why am I being resold stuff I've already bought?  Many people have complained about this, so anyone who bought ODST gets to play Halo REACH beta now.  If the game is as bad as ODST I can expect my Halo enjoyment to drop significantly.ODST is terrible not because it gives you paper thin content, but because it was sold as a bonified 60 dollar game and it was just an upgrade.  No one cares about the Halo universe, how the spartans came around, or how the covenant came into play.  I'm not learning about Darth Vader, I'm playing a FPS.  I want to play Master Chief, not prequels like ODST with terrible story arcs.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2009"}

It was later ported to PS2 with the addition of the Wesker Report. The PS2 version was called Code Veronica X, I guess the X stands for Xtra content. The bottom line here is I played the game on Dreamcast and it is one of the best RE games out there right now.It is the first RE game to be featured in a fully 3D world, the camera follows you except in some areas where the camera is static for effect. It doesn't follow you like a chase cam, but instead the camera is situated somewhere in the room and follows you as you walk by and such.Another benefit of the 3D engine is that you can have real time lighting from gunfire and explosions. The walls will light up when you fire your shotgun, pistol, etc. No to mention the light affects your character. If the room is dark then so is your character. Light sourcing enables a new realm of reality.RE 4 coming to gamecube later this year is also featured in 3D. Since the Gamecube is much more powerful than the Dreamcast it looks like everything is prerendered.Code Veronica is an excellent game and the camera is a lot better than in some RE games. I found only a few spots where you were taken off guard by zombies in tight corridors.The environments are freaky and very well done. And of course the music is completely dark and forboding just like in the other games from the series. You will not be disappointed.

It's wasn't good. The 15th I got to play around one hour total because of all the server problems. Those issues have seem to gone away for the most part so people can stop freaking out. Should Blizzard had known better? Of course they should have, but I would be more angry if I had to pay a sub for this game and lost a day of playtime so now that's out of the way lets start the review.I'm assuming most of you played the beta, so you know the general feel of the game. After where the beta stopped, Diablo 3 really picks up. Some amazing dungeons fill the end of Act 1. A classic boss comes in and says his classic line.Act 2 is equally amazing. I really enjoy Diablo 3 so far. Putting equal time into single player and co-op. The game runs great now that the server problems have mostly been solved. Im running the game at max settings and it looks fantastic. I'm loving my Demon Hunter build. It's a great class to play. Tons of loot as expected. Hordes of enemies.

{"product_name":"B000TI836G","description":"","reviewerName":"A. D. Anderson \"Flying Gamer\"","summary":"Sloppy","reviewText":"The first thing that I noticed when I purchased this today was the \"Limited Edition\" pasted on the cover.  I scratched my head and looked for the regular edition.  There isn't one.  I know EA is as corporate as video games get, so I shrugged off this cheap move.  After all, the game still cost $59.99.  I brought it home with my hopes high since I've liked previous DICE games (Battlefield 1943, Bad Company 1 & 2).  I sat down, ready to dig into the multiplayer, and immediately ran into server issues.  The EA servers couldn't handle the workload.  There were only 15,000 players.  Granted, it's day one, but I've seen over 1 million players very early on in Halo games.  The error message told me to go to EA.com for more information, so I did.  \"We're trying to fix the servers\" was their revelation.  No kidding.  Thanks for wasting more of my time.  I decided to try the campaign.  It opens with a view from a satellite orbiting the earth and recordings of people's reaction to the 9/11 terrorist attacks.  I thought it was pretty bold and hoped EA had done a decent job of respecting the victims of the attack.  They fell a little short.  The campaign's first few levels are linear and derivative.  I quickly realized the game is trying to copy the Call of Duty series, only it isn't nearly as exciting.  The first mission has you trying to find an informant hidden in Afghanistan, and it lasted about twice as long as it needed to.  I don't even remember what I did on the second mission.  I know it was at the Kandahar airport and featured a \"bone-yard\" of derelict aircraft parts.  A blatant rip-off of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2.  The gameplay was alright, but there were too many errors to keep me into the game.  Enemies would literally appear in front of me as I aimed down my iron sights.  I'm not sure if this was some sort of glitch, but they would just appear behind cover.  So I would shoot them.  A.I. seemed to be lacking as well, enemies would ignore me killing all of their buddies as they stood there doing nothing.  They wouldn't react until I shot them.  I spent the normal amount of time going through the menus and setting up display, sound, and controller settings.  I took a break for dinner, then decided to try multiplayer again.  The servers were doing better (up to 30,000 players now) and I was happy to get into a game.  I made my way through the archaic menu system and finally spawned on the battlefield.  I ran straight ahead and hid behind a rock.  None of my controller/screen/audio settings had transferred from single player.  I tried to fix the controls and was blown away to find that you can't have the same configuration as the single player game.  The controls are different from Battlefield (what I'm used to), and of the four controller options, two are set up for leftys.  That leaves two \"useable\" configurations, depending on which hand you use, and they literally only change one button.  I CANNOT believe you aren't allowed to have the same controller configuration in multiplayer that you have in single player.  Idiotic.  Once I got into the games I was faced with more CoD garbage.  Sniping and spawn-camping are extremely prevalent even on day one.  Plan to start sprinting the moment you spawn, because if you don't you'll be dead.  Even then, you're lucky to make it to cover.  It's a high-intensity online game, somewhere between Halo and the CoD series.  I opted for the shotgun or the sniper rifle, since they seemed like my best chances for survival.  With countless camping spots, sniping is easy, and if you want to run-and-gun, the shotgun does the most damage.  Medium range rifles seemed pretty worthless, as you would have to stop to shoot for more than half a second.  Which means death.  The play was very laggy, especially when bullets started flying.  I'd run around a corner, shotgun ready, only to have the game glitch out on me as soon as I pointed it at an enemy.  I died A LOT because shots didn't register when I pulled the trigger.  I don't think I need to tell you how frustrating this was.Overall, I'm quite disappointed.  I'll continue playing the game in the hopes that it gets better with updates, but as of right now I'd encourage others to stay away from it.  It's quite a mess, and unacceptable in it's current state.  It seriously feels like it's not complete.  I don't know if EA deliberately released it this way, expecting to fix it with updates, but it would be pretty lame if they did.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

Chance \"World's Oldest Gamer\"","summary":"Bum Rap for EA","reviewText":"This was one of the most highly rated games prior to release and now it is one of the most demeaned.  Neither was fair.  After playing MOH, I give it an above average rating: 8.5 or perhaps a 9.0 on the single player levels.  There are problems to be sure.  Players will spend a lot of time trying to figure out where they are, where they've been, and where they are going.  That is referred to as the \"Fog of War\".)  It's annoying at times but the game keeps pace with the player so gnash your teeth and be a little more patient.  The story line is a bit confusing but so is combat (been there, done that, Vietnam 1967-68). The comaraderie of the characters is good, particularly Dusty and Rabbit.  I really cared about them and I think other players will too.  Gameplay that really ticked me off was the poor instructions provided to air combat.  Trial and error got me through those parts but I don't really know how I did it.  The ending third of the game is what really shines.  One-on-one combat and as a team member sparkles.  The objectives are realistic and challenging without being impossible (read \"annoying\") missions.  The cut scenes are great except everyone looks like their genetically related.  The actual ending cutscene is very moving (at least for me) since I've sat in the middle of nowhere with body bags full of my friends.So if you like combat games such as Call of Duty, you should enjoy this on the single player level.

Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"Blowing Off Steam","reviewText":"New Hyrule's railroad system is vanishing, baddies wrench Princess Zelda's soul from her body, and it's up to Link to save the day.  A pseudo-sequel to Zelda: Phantom Hourglass, this is basically the same game but with trains (or so I've read).To think I play these games to pass the time during train rides.  As a certified engineer, you must use the Spirit Train to get anywhere in New Hyrule; catching rabbits, blasting boulders and enemies, solvng puzzles and even fighting bosses while on board (which is more intense than any subway fight I've ever seen).  And much like on an actual train, the ride eventually gets monotonous after a while.  On the plus side, new tracks and locales appear with every quest that you complete.  And along the way, you hoard exotic treasures that go toward cash or new train cars from Linebeck's Trading Post (which don't do a thing for you except add heart containers).The monotony doesn't stop there, though.  For every dungeon you clear, you have to also clear a floor within the Tower of Spirits, teeming with the soulless armored Phantoms from PH.  In her most active role since Ocarina of Time, Zelda can possess a Phantom and use it to overcome obstacles Link can't take on alone, adding a fresh take to an otherwise dated formula.Speaking of fresh takes, ST uses the exclusive touch screen controls of its predecessor (back when touching was becoming a thing), requiring the use of the stylus for pretty much everything.  Whether or not the mechanic here has improved from PH, it's a huge departure from the norm, and you'll do more rolling than sword swinging at first.  But once you get it, you'll get it.  That and I like how Link's Spin Attack is done.  Two items in particular both require that the player blow into the built-in microphone of the DS.  The Whirlwind blows away baddies, clears poison clouds and moves keys and stuff from hard-to-reach spots.  The Spirit Flute is a musical instrument played in duets with the mysterious Lokomo tribe to access more tracks.  While complicated at first, you're allowed enough practice time and you don't even have to carry a tune most of the time.  Fake it to make it!Beyond all that, ST plays like your typical Zelda game, right down to the downtime between sidequests, minigames (some of which are rigged) and the final round of boss battles.  The graphics are a bit blocky but the best the DS could muster, and the plot just pulls your heartstrings.  Far be it for me to raise my expectations, but I can't wait to see PH stacks up.This review will be revised in the near future.The game is E10+: Violence.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSO1","description":"James Bond... Solid Snake... Ethan Hunt... Based on their recent games, all these so-called superspies could stand to take a few lessons from newcomer Sam Fisher. His name isn't important; the important thing is that his game,Splinter Cell, comes from Tom Clancy's game studio and offers up the kind of sophistication and control you'd expect from the studio that brought gamersRainbow Six. It's all about the details. When Sam enters a dark area, he's got two options, thermal and night vision. Thermal lets him see the body heat of an enemy soldier, even through walls and doors. Shoot through cover with a high-powered weapon, and you can watch as the heat fades from the body. Not dark yet? Shoot out the lights. Need a distraction? Pick up and toss a tin can. Come up to a door too thick to pass thermal readings? Sneak up to it, slip a fiber-optic lead under the door frame, and peek at what's beyond. When you're ready, open the door--just a little bit at a time. WhileSplinter Celllacks a famous hero in the lead role, it does sport the famous technical military thriller author Tom Clancy in the title. And you can see the evidence of his expertise in every facet of the game.

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Hildely Rodriguez","summary":"It is just AWESOME !!!!!!","reviewText":"I love the type of the games with Puzzles and Action, and Tomb Raider Underworld really takes you there, it have a lot of beautiful landscapes, the puzzles are really challenging, I do recommend this game, it is one of the best games from the PS3, RECOMMENDED !!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads.Battle Systems and gameplayThis game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform.","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A delightful version of one of the most perfect masterpieces in video game history","reviewText":"What an easy video game to write a review for! Honestly, what can be said about Chrono Trigger that hasn't already been said countless times before? When Squaresoft recruited Hironobu Sakaguchi (creator of theFinal Fantasyseries), Yuji Horii (creator of theDragon Questseries), and Akira Toriyama (creator ofDragon Ball), internally dubbed \"The Dream Team,\" to work on this title, I doubt they understood at the time the immeasurable level of majesty and perfection this game would attain. I have been playing games for the majority of the 22 years I have lived on this earth, and I consider it my favorite past time. Having just played this game for the first time a few months ago on virtual console, and now this version, I feel like my life wasn't complete before I undertook the amazing journey Chrono Trigger has to offer.Name any aspect you can think of about RPGs or just games in general, any at all. Chrono Trigger executes it perfectly. Incredibly unique, wonderfully well-written (and beautifully localized) story involving time travel that develops at an immaculate pace, with exceptionally developed and lovable characters, as well as over a dozen different possible endings? Check. An Akira Toriyama inspired graphical style that is delightfully colorful and full of life, that still looks fantastic today? Check. One of the greatest soundtracks for the SNES, and indeed of all video games in its entire history? Check. This game has single-handedly madeYasunori Mitsudaone of my biggest musical inspirations, and to think this was just the first of a long-line of jaw-dropping game soundtracks from him. An awesome battle system that feels dynamic, action-packed, and organic? Check. How about RPG mechanics so tight you could bounce a quarter off of them and get loose change? Check. A genuine sense of growth and progression as you play? Check. Plenty of genuinely unique, memorable side-quests that actually feel like meaningful additions that enrich the story and your experience? Check. Several mini-games that are super fun to break-up the epicness the game has to offer? Check. I could go on all day. In every regard possible, Chrono Trigger just screams top-of-the-line quality. Whether it's the big picture stuff, like story, characters, gameplay mechanics, graphics, all the way down to the tiniest details that add atmosphere or new depths to your experience, this game really nails it in every way. The game has a delightful balance between levity and gravity that makes the whole experience feel so fresh, even 17 years after it first released. This is a timeless masterpiece and one of the greatest gems in the entire history of the medium, full stop.I could go on, obviously, for hours about what makes Chrono Trigger so fantastic, but there are some new additions to this DS version that makes it the most complete one available. For one thing, this version contains some full motion video cutscenes that Akira Toriyama did for thePlaystation rerelease of this game from way back when, which is really cool. They may not expand the story to newer heights, but they do depict some of the most exciting moments in the story in exciting and dynamic ways, which is awesome. In fact, this has all of the additions the Playstation rerelease had, which is great. Unique to this DS version is a new secret final boss and a new ending that helps connect Chrono Trigger to its direct(ish) sequelChrono Cross, which is neat. There are also new control schemes and even new screen options that take advantage of the DS dual-screen capabilities.The biggest difference, however, is an all-new translation to the game. It has been said that this translation is much closer to the original Japanese script than the original SNES release, with its incredibly famous Ted Woosley rendition. Frog no longer speaks in a Shakespearean accent and more closely resembles the Japanese version. Chrono's power is no longer \"lightning,\" but \"Light\" instead (it's actually \"Heaven\" in Japanese). These sorts of changes abound and they may offend some people who are die-hard devotees to unwavering preservation with games they have nostalgia for, but I find the this translation gives new life to a classic gem. New nuances and details emerge about the characters that weren't there before, and if you've played the SNES original many times, hopefully you'll find the new script to be a refreshing aspect. Tom Slattery did the translation on this version, and as one who found his work onthe DS remake of Final Fantasy IVto be, hands-down, the best Final Fantasy IV translation available of any version, I really enjoyed his work here. He did a great job.It's hard to really define what this release is. It's not a remake. Chrono Trigger's perfection needs no touch-ups or \"enhancements,\" it's already so good. The new additions to the game itself, new features tailored to the Dual Screens of the DS that can (if you so choose to use them) streamline the experience, the lovely new translation that adds new dimensions to old friends and their amazing tales, and the fact that this is the most complete, comprehensive version of one of gaming's highest pinnacles, makes buying this an absolute no-brainer. I actually didn't play this gem until later in life, and even today, it is a game that can leave a lasting impact on your life and further define your tastes and values for the rest of your days. For those who didn't have the fortune of playing this back when it first came out, or for younguns who weren't around when this game first released, now is a wonderful time to experience it. Personally, I recommend playing the virtual console version of the SNES original at least once in your life (that's how I first experienced this game, a few month ago), because the Ted Woosley translation is worth playing it alone for, but this version is definitely the most comprehensive, faithful version of Chrono Trigger. When you get a chance to experience the most complete version of a masterpiece like Chrono Trigger, one that is the most faithful to the creator's original vision, you take it. So buy this game, forge unbreakable bonds of friendship with unlikely heroes across time, and travel across the ages to save the world, in one of the greatest epochs of all time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2013"}

Dante, a Templar knight with a proud bearing and a seedy past, returns home after slaying Death to find his father and wife murdered, and he descends into Hell to save her from Lucifer.Dantes Inferno makes the majority of its bank in its graphics and its audio, which is part in parcel designed to make your hair stand on end. The various levels of Hell are rather richly detailed and thought out, though some of the enemies do push the boundaries a touch far even for more jaded tastes. Also, the dialogue and script flow well, peeling back like an onion, and help to bring the story to life. The quotes of Virgil, some of which are taken almost verbatim from the poem, even manage to work well.The game however, falls flat on its face in the gameplay department. Calling it a God of War clone is like saying identical twins look alike. Apart from having a pair of primary weapons rather than one primary and a few secondary, if you've played one, you've played the other. That of itself is a rather glaring failure that no unique game mechanic could be attempted, apart from a rather tacked on set of equipment buffs. Add in several blind camera points, invisible walls that seem strategically placed to drop you into molten gold, and blind jumps and advancement points, you start to get the feel that you;re playing an incomplete product.Also, GoW managed to keep the pace fast and clipped, whereas DI has several portions that are grinding in the extreme, making the middle of the game almost a war of attrition. Add to that several boss fights that are scaled way up in difficulty and require large amounts of rinse and repeat to complete, indicating that the bosses were no tested to the proper degree. What comes out in the end is a poor imitation that was given an almost Ninja Gaiden difficulty level to cover up that it was a song you've heard sung before. That is until you set the game to easy, at which point it becomes you with a sledgehammer versus a three day old kitten.So can awful gameplay get carried through by a great script and awesome, if creepy art? Just barely. While the developers of GoW 3 probably laughed themselves to tears with this, its at least a decent enough time passer to get us closer to GoW 3's release date.

This game takes an alternative approach and virtually allows the player to experience the story in a streamlined and fast way. Unlike other RPG's, the player wont find themself straying off on the path to fulfill sidequest orders or needing to level grind (sit in an area and earn experience points (ie in this game crystarium points to unlock skills and status boosts) that would otherwise get in the way of the story telling.  FFXIII is an streamlined experience in sound and drama and the gorgeous cinematic never gets old or lenghty this time around.  The ending cutscene is really only 15 minutes as well.  The story is particularly interesting and the characters are simple to enjoy and embrace.  There are bound to be some that the player would care more than others, though no one character is lacking at the end of the game.  The antagonists are also interesting to see and they do in fact grow over time.Gameplay wise its a brilliant experience that could be considered cinematic on its own. The camera pans out and in dramatic fashion (it can also be controlled manually) during the midst of attacks.  It looks amazing once higher level skills are used as the Thunderbolt will be brilliant (camera zooms out and even pauses briefly to enhance the dramatic powerful attack), the fire skills will scare the ground, and the powerful water skills will leave water vapor and droplets suspended in the air after the fact.  The particle effects are just brilliant.  The enemies designs are interesting though by endgame most of them are just rehashes of old ones (new names, though with different color skins :(  ).  The boss fights are ingenious and most can be beat in under 15 minutes (if the player takes too long, the boss will cast Doom, a skill that will kill the player in a few minutes).The difficulty of the game should be relatively easy to embrace for newcomers, veterans may find it starts off relatively easy though at the end of the day the game is generally of medium difficulty.  A guide isnt necessary though strongly advised for both parties if the sidequests (available in Chapter 11 of 13 of the game and during the post-game) are something that one wants to pursue, the item forging, as well as the trophy enthusiasts.There are no Japanese voices, currently no DLC, and there is not a cutscene/sound theater.  The criticism faced with the Leona Lewis song (which only plays for about 1 minute 45 seconds just about and shows up in the credits/ending cutscene) is unwarranted the end of the day.  Really if an RPG isnt your thing then you could pursue this one though its 40-60 hour time commitment may not be something a non RPG enthusiast would want to experience, to everyone else, this is a great game that should be played at least.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2010"}

There is clearly an issue with a number of the first batch of Ps4 consoles sold. From what i can see it primarily has to do with the hdmi port not connecting properly. Now don't get me wrong, i would be equally upset if my console was doa as well. But this inevitable hiccup that happens to pretty much every console at launch (need i remind everyone about  the horrid failure rate of the xbox 360 at launch?) could possibly sway people against buying what is actually an amazing system. The graphics are phenomenal, the new controller is amazing, the dashboard is built very well, then with the line up of games already out along with the huge number of them coming on the horizon this console is a must have. Something else to keep in mind is that those who had working consoles most likely have no time to post their review as they are too occupied playing it. Again.... I sympathize with those who received part of the bad batch, but please do yourself a favor and don't sink to the level of the xbone trolls taking advantage of this situation and clearly posting phony reviews.

Rhodes","summary":"Just Super","reviewText":"It's been fifteen years since Mario had a completely original 2D side-scroller with him as the star.  There were ports of his 2D adventures brought to the Gameboy Advance, but that was about it.  There was also Yoshi's Island on the Super Nintendo (and later released on the Gameboy Advance), but really, that was more of a \"Yoshi\" game.  Anyway, New Super Mario Bros. is without a doubt one of the finest Nintendo DS games out there.  Fans of the classic Mario games will absolutely love this.As usual, Princess Toadstool has been kidnapped.  By Bowser Jr. who is just like his father.  Now the brothers have to go and save her and defeat the King Koopa, along with his son.  For those expecting a storyline... there is none!  This is where the classic feel begins to come in.  Mario, you've got to understand, isn't about story.  It's about gameplay, and that's where New Super Mario Bros. hits high.The game spans eight worlds, and a lot of classic gameplay comes back along with new additions that make the game interesting to play.  Mario still has basics such as the flower, but he also has some new moves he can do as well.  For one, he can grab a Mega-Mushroom and become the size of the DS screen and trample through all his enemies and the environment.  Mario can also hop inside a blue koopa troopa shell.  The shell allows him to traverse across the landscape just like a shell would if he were to kick it.  There is also a Mini-Mushroom that once Mario grabs a hold of, he'll shrink to be able to fit into places that otherwise can't be accessed.  Mario also has some moves from Super Mario 64.  The ground pound, for stomping blocks from atop and the wall jump.  These moves aren't just there, either.  There will be times in the game when you'll have to use them.  Also from Super Mario 64 is the triple jump.  The only downside the vast amount of moves and items Mario can hold is simple: There's no item that allows him to fly.The touchscreen isn't really needed to play the game at all.  Mario can store an item on the bottom screen.  Touching it with your stylus simply makes it fall from the sky for him to grab.  Very similar to Super Mario World.  That's all the touch screen is used for in this game.  It's not really a bad thing unless you happen to be someone who thrives on the touch screen.The eight worlds are huge as well.  There's an overworld map very similar to Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World.  Select a stage and jump right in.  For those only going to the goal, the game isn't all that hard at all.  If you just want to go for the goal, the game is rather simple.  However, just going for the goal will cause you to miss out on half the fun of the game.  Two worlds, for example, aren't accessed by traditional means.  In other words, if you want to see all of the game, you can't just go to the flagpole in every level.  You'll have to actually work to see all the game has to offer.  There's a lot of work to be done to master New Super Mario Bros.  For starters, some levels, much like Super Mario World, have more than one exit.  There are also special coins scattered throughout levels that you'll have to collect in order to reach secret pathways along the world map.  This is where most of the games challenge comes from.  Most of these special coins aren't easy to grab and involve you taking a few risks.  The game manages to keep you busy for a while, provided you're not just heading for the goal. All together, this game presents you with 80 levels, all of them full of secrets.Each level also has it's own natural disasters.  There are some of your normal enemies.  Also along the way are natural disasters such as rolling hills and whirlpools in the underwater levels.  Enemies also come in various sizes.  So just because you've seen one goomba one size, doesn't mean he can't be bigger.  Most boss fights, however, are a little on the predictable side, but they're still a lot of fun to play.The only other thing that keeps New Super Mario Bros. down is how save management is done.  You can save after a castle, warp, tower or after you've spent five star coins to bypass a sign.  But you can only save from each spot once.  So if you find yourself having to save and you've already cleared a castle, you can't clear that same castle again to save.  This doesn't really cause problems, but if you find yourself in a tight situation you'll wish it was just like the Mario Advance games when you could save just about anywhere.Aside from the games spectacular levels, there is also a multiplayer feature that allows one person to be Mario and the other to be Luigi in a competition.  Competing against your friend is a lot of fun.  You'll both go into an arena and try to collect five stars.  There are five arenas in all, and collecting stars from your friend can be a fun task.  It can be addicting as well. Also thrown in are those mini-games from Super Mario 64 DS.  However, even these mini-games have been tweaked, and trust me, it's for the better.  The mini-games from Super Mario 64 DS can also be used in wireless play now for you to compete against your friends.  If you already found these mini-games addictive before, you might want to try them in multiplayer mode.  They get better.  Even better, to play multiplayer only requires that one person have the game.  The rest is done through the DS's download play.Graphic wise, New Super Mario Bros. looks great.  One of the best-looking side scrolling games out there.  It's a perfect bland of 2D side scrolling with 3D effects.  The enemies are all 3D, and so are most of the landscapes.  But you'll tackle them in classic side-scrolling feel.  Most of the background effects are 2D, and they look fantastic as well.  Everything is colorful and vibrant.  It's also thanks to this 3D engine that Mario can do half the things he can do.And then there's the music.  Mario fans can bask in nostalgia.  Most of the music is remixed, and it's remixed quite well, I must say.  Some enemies will also change their behavior based on the background music (they might jump to the beat).  The soundtrack is just a blast to listen to, and might fill old school gamers with a lot of fond memories. Mario also has a voice, as usual.  And like some of his games on the Gameboy Advance, they get old after a while.  Most gamers probably won't mind, though.Overall, this is by far one of the best title to reach the Nintendo DS.  Mario is back to his side-scrolling roots and it's more impressive than any of us could've dreamed.  New antics and level designs keep it from being a repeat of what Mario could do in his 16-bit and 8-bit days.  Put simple, there's a new adventure here for everyone, those new to the series as well as those who are long time fans.  New Super Mario Bros. is a treat.  This is a DS title everyone should own.The Good+Nostalgia+Superb Graphics+Fantastic Gameplay+Great Multiplayer elements+There's a lot of stuff to do+The mini-games of Super Mario 64 DS are now multiplayer+A long lasting adventure with 80 levels+A great remixed soundtrack+Mario has a lot of new moves+More than just a repeat of the classic Mario formulaThe Bad-There's no item that allows Mario to fly-Mario's voice gets old and tiresome to hear after a while-No Save Anywhere FeatureThis is an experience every DS owner should partake in.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2006"}

Both play it quite often.  While my younger daughter mainly likes the free-draw (and a few of the lessons), my older daughter really loves the lessons and learning the different techniques that it teaches (like shading, perspective, etc). The lessons range from very simple to complex.  You can choose between pencils and paints and different pencil grades and brush types to apply various strokes and shading techniques.  The DS even makes a swishing sound as you draw, like you're working with real paper.  Although the DS canvas is small (you draw in the bottom window while a copy of your in progress drawing is displayed in the top window), you can zoom in on any part of the drawing for more precise drawing.  Your drawings are only limited by your imagination and a truly talented artist can create a masterpiece.  This program is also offered as a download through DSWare.  Although the retail version contains all the lessons, it also has one glaring flaw compared to the DSware versions, you can't export or share your art.  I feel they should have at least included the ability to  save to internal or removable memory on a DSi.  My children have created some really nice drawings that I'd like to share with family.  To create a masterpiece and then only have it viewable on a DS or DSi screen is a little disappointing.  If you're really serious about art and wish to learn different pressure shading techniques using many different brushes and pencils and export or print your finished product, you should probably go in a different direction, likely a PC art program and Wacom tablet or even an iPad art program.  If you just want to draw and have fun while learning some art techniques along the way, this will be very entertaining.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Mr. Wright","summary":"Halo!!","reviewText":"Got this game after i played Halo the 10th Anniversary edition, had to know how the story continued for Master Chief, great game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2014"}

This is different than the Final Fantasy RPG series where in essence your team stands in a line, the enemy stands in a line, and you simply fire at each other.There are of course chocobos, your yellow friends that can carry you around. In this version, they can even lay eggs! You never know what will hatch out of one, and it's a neat way to add new monsters to your group.I will comment that the translations are pretty awful, the letters appear S - L - O - W - L - Y on the screen and the plot is rather complex with names and alliances to keep track of. But that's a minor flaw given how fun the game is.Highly recommended to any Final Fantasy fan, even though it's a bit old. You can usually get it inexpensively, and it's well worth it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00002SVWG","description":"In Final Fantasy Tactics you must guide your nation through a revolution while defending it from otherworldy forces!","reviewerName":"Robert Jenkins \"video geek #1\"","summary":"Very good game","reviewText":"This is most definitely a much, much different game than the other entries in the Final Fantasy series.  You control the young hero, Ramza Beoulve, and a party of adventurers as they become involved in what starts out as a relatively simple case of kidnapping and politics that eventually turns into a crisis that involves a trip into the underworld to save the world from the forces of darkness.  Your party starts out as Ramza and a bunch of generic characters, but as you progress through the game you will meet up with a number of friends that will join your party, all of which have their own unique abilities, ranging from forgettable, to helpful, to awesomely-overpowering.There are a lot of good things about this game.  There are a total of 20 &quot;jobs&quot; in the game, ranging from the usual things like Wizards, Healer-types, and sword-wielding Knights to exotic classes such as the Ninja, the Calculator, and those ever-popular Summoners.  Each character starts out as one of two &quot;generic&quot; classes, and as they level up and learn new abilities, more and more of the other classes are unlocked and become available.  Most of the battles you participate in allow you to take a party of five characters into action, although there are a few exceptions.  So, the possible combinations of battle parties one can create is almost endless.  The customization part of this game is probably its strongest point, because it allows for hours of fun experimentation as you learn the different jobs' strengths and weaknesses.  The battles themselves are somewhat like a giant chess match, where you and the computer manuever your men around a 3-D battlefield, trying to take and hold the most advantageous positions to use to your advantage.  One of the best things about all this is that you have to be careful how you use magic.  The high-level magic spells in this game can be quite powerful, but the player must learn how to use it properly, or else you will kill off your own group members in addition to the enemies.  There are many different types of battlefields, ranging from open prairies, to castles and dungeons, to swampland, and everything in between.  The story battles are filled with drama and danger, and the random battles you get into as you move from town to town will keep your skills maxed out, since the monsters in random battles level up along with you, so you will always be challenged, even when revisiting areas near the beginning of the game.  The in-game music and graphics are excellent, given that this game is several years old.  The shops in the game are where you will go to purchase the vast majority of your weapons, armor, and items, and there is a very well-done &quot;fitting room&quot; system to ensure that you know ahead of time what you are buying and what it will do for you before you spend money on it.  Once you have been through a few battles, money worries will rapidly fade.  It's also easy to keep plenty of items in stock so you never run out during battle.  There are also a number of sidequests, as we have come to expect from all Final Fantasy games, and they are rewarding, fun, and generally worthwhile.There are a few flaws, though.  The plot of the game is rather... convoluted.  It's tough, very tough, to keep track of the dozens of cast members and who is on what side, who is betraying who, and so on.  There is a feature in the game allowing you to replay key scenes in the story, and also read biographies of all characters, and I found myself going back here often.  If you can keep up with everything, the plot is compelling, but it is tough.  The ending of the game is very sad and haunting, and won't soon be forgotten.  Another flaw is the rather poor Japanese-to-English translations that this game contains.  It doesn't really detract from the enjoyment of the game, but it is very jarring.Despite these flaws, I really think that this game takes many of the well-known traditions of the Final Fantasy series to the next level.  Anyone who has played and enjoyed the other games in the series will enjoy this one.  I know I did.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"The game that took the game world by storm","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing visuals, believable characters, decent story, solid gun play, fun platformingThe Bad: A tad short, unbalanced difficultyThe action/adventure genre seems to be the only genre right now trying to push games forward in terms of game play, graphics, and story. Uncharted is one of these, and while it is two years old now and as developed way before the PS3 was announced it was ahead of its time, and still is. On the surface Uncharted may look like a male version of Tomb Raider, but you are completely wrong. Not only are the visuals some of the best in the industry, but the voice acting and characters are what's so believable. The people of Uncharted are every day people who are trying to do heroic deeds and in turn shows their imperfections which makes the game much more believable. Searching around for El Dorado and Sir Francis Drake's footsteps has never been so fun.There are two main elements to Uncharted and these are first the shooting, and the platforming. There isn't much in the way of puzzle solving (the ones that are there are too easy). The shooting mechanics are great since they give you a great sense of desperation thanks to the wonderful animation of Nathan Drake and the way he interacts with the environment. You can see him breathing heavy in panic, ducking with different animations while running, and actually vocally expressing how he is feeling. Third person shooter mechanics do not need explaining, but you do get a good variety of weapons which you are allowed to carry one pistol and one heavy weapon. Grenades can be thrown by changing the arc of the throw with SixAxis, but as far as this SixAxis is used very lightly and not very often. The only flaw in the shooting are the number of enemies you are given which can be way to many during certain situations so the difficulty is unbalanced.In terms of platforming this is the best part of the game. Jumping around is pretty easy, but you can pretty jump on anything you want, and part of Nathan's imperfections show in this since he'll slip off edges or just barely make jumps. Swinging on vines, and walking through a U-Boat submarine could never have felt better. A lot of the game play is broken up nicely with vehicle sections. These include a jeep and a jet ski from which you are shooting from. The Jeep sections are heart pounding, and the beautiful jungle scenery flying by adds to the cinematic experience. When you aren't monkeying around you can look for up to 60 relics to unlock Trophies.One thing that I can't express enough is how beautiful the game is. Which such high-resolution graphics, beautiful HDR lighting, highly detailed textures and realistic water, Naughty Dog really created their second best franchise with this masterpiece. There isn't much to complain about in Uncharted except maybe it's length. With 22 chapters the game can be beaten in 8-10 hours depending on your play style. The replay value is good since you will want to go back and collect more relics to unlock trophies.If I had to really nitpick the game all I can say is that I wish there would have been more SixAxis integration, a more balanced difficulty, more challenging puzzles, and the game could have been a good 5 hours longer, but other than this it is pretty much flawless. If you are getting a PS3 this holiday start with Uncharted because it will make you love your PS3 that much more.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I was hooked from the beginning. The story seems very realistic following Drake, a supposed descendant of Sir Francis Drake, chasing down the lost treasure of El Dorado. NPCs really add to the story such as Sully (your older friend and fellow treasure hunter), and Elena, a journalist after a story (and Drake's heart).Gameplay: Mixture of action/adventure 3rd person shooter. You shoot guns and toss grenades and interact with the environment. The game plays out like a movie and covers several locations. There are many vehicles involved including jeeps, planes, boats, etc. The gameplay is similar to Tomb Raider, but much more improved and more freedom. You take on hoards of bad guys that are after the treasure as well.Great game, lots of fun, and good story. Lots of game play and if you like this, pick up Uncharted 2 and 3.

It supports Dolby Digital sound.","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Reminds Me Why I Play Video Games","reviewText":"Quality video game psychological thrillers have historically been pretty rare in the medium; either games are dependent on sudden jolts of terror or gross amounts of blood to get across a tone of fear to players. However, Remedy Entertainment, the geniuses behind the classic \"Max Payne\" (one of my all-time favorite games), have finally managed to strike a chilling chord similar to this year's earlier PS3-exclusive \"Heavy Rain.\" \"Alan Wake\" is one of the finest 360 games I've played in ages, and certainly one of the best overall games in recent memory.Story: A+Broken into TV show-styled \"episodes\" (complete with recaps at the beginning of each), the plot of \"Alan Wake\" follows the titular protagonist, a successful author who has struggled with writer's block for the past two years, as he takes a vacation to a secluded mountain town with his wife to clear his head. However, within the course of five to six hours, everything goes to heck with his trip: his wife goes missing, he becomes accosted by groups of possessed townspeople hellbent on killing him in the most brutal fashion possible, he discovers pages of a manuscript that he \"wrote\" but doesn't remember writing, and the cabin he was staying in mysteriously disappears. These events make up only the preliminary chapter, and it gets even more odd in the proceeding episodes. The plot is definitely the main attraction of this game, and will keep you guessing at every turn.Gameplay: A+Being attacked by axe-wielding psychopaths has never been so horrifyingly convincing in a video game. As you guide Alan through the eerie forests of Bright Falls with only a flashlight as his companion, trees seem to change shapes, enemies seem to appear out of thin air, and even the smallest, most insignificant sound will send you into a terrified state. Players need not worry about controlling Alan through these scenarios and locales, though; Remedy has taken great care to avoid the typical controlling pitfalls of other, lesser horror games. Everything you do feels perfectly fluid, and there's never a moment where you don't feel like you're in complete and total control. With strategy and resource conservation, you can easily survive the horrid situations you're thrown into.Sound: A+As I mentioned above, the atmosphere of this game is such that even the smallest sounds are capable of sending shockwaves through your system. The sound effects are tersely-woven, the music is haunting and always fits the situation, and the voice acting is some of the very best you'll ever hear from a video game.Graphics: A+The forest comes alive with dense shadow effects, and you're never able to detect where and when enemies will attack you. These two things work in unison to deliver an environment which is tense and keeps you constantly aware. You will quickly realize that your flashlight is key to being aware of your surroundings, as it reveals key messages scrawled in invisible ink and potentially deadly obstacles such as beartraps. The textures on every piece of flora and fauna are very vivid, and the character models look and move like actual humans (much like \"Heavy Rain\".) These are some of the best graphics you'e ever going to get from your 360.Overall: A+All of the aforementioned elements of this game combine to make one of the most breathtaking, heartpumping, and mind-boggling games you will play this year. With the promise of downloadable episodes at periodic intervals (the first of which is free with a code included in new copies of the game), and the fact that everything within thispackage ALREADY stands on it's own, this one of the best deals in terms of future replays and enjoyment. If you own an Xbox 360, and you want a good game, then you have no excuse to not buy this. Pick it up without any delay whatsoever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}

Sadly it throws subtly out the window far too many times and just ends up just being another \"shoot this to move forward\" game albeit one with fantastic atmosphere and setting. Bright falls sounds and  feels like a breathing world and all the inhabitants truly feel alive when they interact with you they show  varied emotions to the point you'll care for some of them.The narration by Alan wake really ties and makes the game feel like your in his shoes. His voice sounds like one that you can relate to if you yourself were experiencing a waking nightmare. A lot of what makes the game and the character of Alan wake special is his determination to find his wife and all the hardship he goes through as he feels the conflict is his own doing. The game will keep you interested storywise but I feel the gameplay is very lacking.Although Alan is a ordinary man he quickly finds himself using firearms with precise aim and dodging like he's a action hero. Maybe he wrote himself having these physical feats? That's my interpretation at least.I really wanted Alan wake to be true horror title but it stumbles in its own genre. I really like Bright falls its a superb setting and atmosphere. Also wouldn't it be cool if it was the mirror town to Silent Hill. A horror in the daylight kind of town.I hope remedy brings and realizes the full potential of the setting next time.As it is Alan wake is a great game for the story but its a rental at best.

Yet for the past few years THQ and Yuke's have been putting out WWE titles for the PS2 that have been getting better and better and it wasn't until SmackDown! vs. Raw that we have seen a game wrestling fans could really sink their teeth into and enjoy. Well, that was last year because SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 is here and believe me when I tell you that this is, by far, the best thing to happen to wrestling since The Rock stepped foot in the ring.Not just a new roster change (although unforeseen changes, like the tragic loss of Eddie Guerrero, have not been rectified at the time of release), this 2006 edition just adds more features and a better grappling system while bringing back many of the things we loved the first time around. You'll still find a stable filled with favorite Superstars from the long list of top male grapplers (The Undertaker, Cena, Sean Michaels) as well as the lovely WWE Divas (Trish Stratus, Torrie Wilson, Stacey Keibler) and also some legendary grapplers like the '80s Hulk Hogan, Stone Cold Steve Austin and even The Rock among a few others.Aside from the usual assortment of match types like Ladder, Table, Cage and Tag Team matches (with Manager or without), there's the new Buried-Alive match where you'll slam your opponent into an actual casket and slam the lid closed. There's even backstage brawls where you'll be able to Irish whip your opponent into environmental objects. The Bra and Panties matches are back but it comes back in the form of Fulfill Your Fantasy Mode where your favorite Diva can dress up as a school girl, nurse or French maid as they rip clothes off each another. There's even a Divas pillow fight!The best game mode by far, though, turns out to be the game's Season Mode. It is here that you're encouraged to create your male grappler (complete with a choice of different voices) and take him through a full WWE season. At the start of your career, WWE Diva Torrie Wilson's friend and General Manager, Teddy, is hit by a car in the parking lot of one of the arenas. Suddenly the accusations begin to fly and there's finger pointing between your grappler and the oh-so dreamy Cena. During these accusations that you'll find a number of choices and depending on what you pick you'll be challenging different opponents. It is here that you enter matches and participate in WWE events to earn points that unlock some really juicy extras in the game`s new Locker Room. It's a lengthy affair and one of the most enjoyable Season Mode the series has produced thus far.If you're interested in the wheeling and dealings of a WWE GM, there's General Manager Mode that has you coming up with your own roster of Superstars, taking charge of your stable's finances as well as deciding on matches and who will turn on who the following week. This is really a great peek at what goes on in the WWE. The game's Creation mode also has a nice number of options and with the new Create-An-Entrance, your created wrestlers will truly feel a part of the WWE lineup.The game's grappling system has been tweaked and it borrows its best elements from the GameCube's WWE Day of Reckoning series. Pulling off some complex moves - even turnbuckle moves that were a bit difficult to pull off smoothly - are handled with ease and thus make the matches even more exciting. You'll counter and reverse moves a bit more easily but there's a price to pay. Much like Day of Reckoning 2 there's a Stamina Meter that, realistically enough, wears out your grappler. It makes sense, really, since you can't dish out punch after punch without showing signs of fatigue in real life. When your stamina runs low, you'll have to tap the Select button to regain strength. It slows the action down but not to a frustrating degree.On the visual front, SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 is a gorgeous PS2 game. This year's game sees some sharp graphics with characters that look amazingly like their actual counterpart. Aside from Hulk Hogan looking a lot like Hulk Hogan, the game makes use of motion capture to make each grappler walk, bust moves and receive punishment realistically enough. The arenas look alive with fans and each type of venue is decorated accordingly ... even the game's overall presentation feels like a televised event. Sure there's still a few clipping problems that see hands going right through your opponent's flesh, but it never gets too out of control.The game's sound offers a surprising new addition: voice acting. You'll actually get to hear your created character during Season Mode's various cutscenes. You'll even hear a number of your favorite WWE Superstars like Cena and Torrie just to name a few of the colorful characters you'll meet and challenge. There's also match coverage from the same two-man commentary duo that handle real matches. The commentary they make really doesn't offer much of an insight nor will they offer true play-by-play but instead begin to bicker and playfully insult each another much like they do in real life. The Superstar introductions are true to the televised events and that's a great thing. You'll hear every Superstar's theme music playing loudly and there's some tunes from artists like Ministry that play throughout the game.There's no doubt about it, SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006 is truly this year's must-have wrestling game. Period. It not only looks gorgeous but also it plays just as good as it looks and with new features and a brilliant Season Mode, you'll find it hard not to give into a game that's worth your hard-earned money even if you bought last year's great game. Buy it right away if you're a fan of WWE wrestling or have been looking for a nearly perfect wrestling game for your PS2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2006"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

I love the free-range environment throughout the game, and the physics of the game are wonderful. You don't have to time very many jumps perfectly or anything, as the game will let you stick to wires, towers, or even ledges if you're just going in that direction. That means you can concentrate more on fun than on worrying about nailing that perfect jump.Also absent is a health bar. Instead, the edges of the screen will turn blood red as you are injured, and then everything goes black and white if you become critical. Healing time is minimal, so these are minor annoyances that will rarely stop your gameplay.Unfortunately, sometimes your inevitably will undo dozens of good actions (like healing people) with a single misstep. There are puddles of water on the ground, and if you cross one at the same time a pedestrian is walking by, you fry them. Many times you don't even notice there is water around until it's too late. That one action turns you into a villain again to the folks around you, and it seems like a never-ending uphill battle to stay good. Likewise, there are a few times taking the \"good\" route will cost you dearly. You can lose battery power when black gunk in the water gets on you, but the only way to avoid it is to terrorize a pedestrian into doing it, which turns you evil.The only major problem I have with the game is the language. Even though this is rated \"T\", every manner of profanity is used like this was a \"M\". It means when certain characters are talking you'll be better off to mute it, but beyond that it's pretty fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004EW7LSY","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Robots Die Good!","reviewText":"Shooting Robots has never been so much fun in this exciting but sometimes flawed game.Concept: 9/10Take the cover and shoot mechanics from Gears of War and use your microphone to issue squad commands.  Then wrap it all up in a thought provoking story about artificial life.  The concept is good, but at times the execution is iffy.Story: 8/10The story behind Binary Domain is a very good one.  It examines the future of robotic technology and examines how advanced artificial life can evolve.  The characters and dialogue need an awful lot of work, though.  The two main characters are Dan and Bo.  They're less like super soldiers and more like the two weird guys you avoid at your buddy's BBQ.  Dan and Bo are later joined by elite soldiers from other countries:  A sniper from China, an explosives expert and a commando from England, a gangster from Japan, and a suave scene stealing classy French Robot.  The characters argue and bicker at times and you need to make decisions on who you support by speaking into your microphone (or selecting responses from a list).  The ending you get depends on your relationship with each of the characters.  If they all like you, it sure helps out with the final battle.  Some of the dialogue is awkwardly written or delivered and that hurts what would be a very intriguing story.Gameplay:  8/10There are two main types of gameplay:  Shooting and Commanding your squad.ShootingThe Shooting is Great!  The enemy AI takes cover, tries to flank you, and charges at times.  Where you shoot the robots determines their reaction.  If you blow off their legs, they come crawling after you.  At one point, I was firing at enemies and I heard an eerie robotic laugh.  The camera panned down and a robot grabbed my legs and pulled out a grenade.  I had to blow his head off before he blew us both up.  If you blow off their primary gun arm, they pull a sidearm.  If you do severe damage to their heads, they get confused and attack other robots.  This is a great way to streamline gameplay.  Instead of pausing the action and casting a slow spell on enemies or a \"confuse\" spell, you just do it with your aim.There's a pretty good arsenal of weapons and grenades at your disposal and you'll need them all.  There are powerful melee enemies, sniping enemies, commando enemies, flying enemies, acrobatic enemies, and a huge variety of large bosses.TalkingCommanding your allies works pretty good about half the time.  Bo saved me once and I absent mindedly said, \"Thanks,\" into my headset.  Bo replied, \"You're welcome.\"  At this point, I felt very connected to my allies!  There is a fairly extensive vocabulary that you can say to your squad.  You can issue commands, encourage them, scold them, argue with them, etc.  However, your microphone often picks up random noise and thinks you said things that you didn't say.  Your buddies start acting confused.  There are also some very awkward moments where an enemy or ally asks you a story driven question, \"How do you feel about artificial life surpassing humanity?\"  Your options are something like:  Dammit, OK, Pop Tarts, and No.  It gets really confusing at times.  It would have been great if this was planned out better.  After a while, I turned the microphone off.Levels:  9/10The levels have a good variety of mission objectives and scenes.  At times you fight in corridors, arenas, on top of vehicles, etc...  Almost all of the levels are really fun.Leveling Up: 9/10You earn credits by killing enemies.  The more damage you do to one, the more credits you get.  If you kill them with a single shot, a melee attack, a head shot, or a multi-kill, you get bonus credits.  Throughout the game, there are kiosks, where you can exchange your credits for consumables like ammo, grenades, health packs, and temporary stat boosts.  You can also purchase permanent upgrades to your squad's weapons.  Each attribute is upgraded independently:  Accuracy,  Firepower, Clip Size, Range, etc...  This works great!Graphics: 8.5/10The levels and enemies look great and the animations for the characters are incredibly smooth.  The robots are intelligently designed as well.  One problem is that many of the main characters are very plain and they really don't have any distinguishing characteristics.Sound: 8/10Overall, the voice acting is OK.  The sound effects really highlight the action and the soundtracks create an exciting or interesting atmosphere.Multiplayer:  n/aThere is multiplayer with a bunch of different modes, but nobody is playing any of them.  I tried a few times and there were no games available for any of the modes.Replay Value: 5/10There are different difficulty levels and a mission select.  Without Multiplayer Mode, I'm not sure why you would play the game over again.  The Campaign is about 10 hours long.Maturity:  Older TeenThere isn't any graphic violence and the bad guys are machines, so there is no gore.  There is the type of swearing you'd hear in an action movie, though.Overall: 8This was a great idea for a game, but the execution was a bit off.  If you're looking for a fun 3rd Person Shooter for cheap, pick this game up.  The combat is the best part of the game.Buy it if you enjoy combat like Mass Effect or Gears of War.Rent it if you have 10 hours to finish it, although you can just buy the game for around $10 now.Avoid it if awkward dialogue bothers you or you really need multiplayer modes.If you like this game, definitely check out Gears of War, Vanquish, and Mass Effect.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004XIQMS4","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Brutal, Solid Scares Prove Kinect's Worth","reviewText":"Motion gaming has been a subject of hot debate in the gaming industry as of late. Traditional gamers prefer a more hands-on approach with controllers, while more casual gamers shout praise for the advent of easy-to-play experiences utilizing motion controls. Game studios have attempted to gear more motion-based games to traditional gamers in order to not lose their money, which has produced varying results. Leave it to the original development team behind the main \"House of the Dead\" entries, a series that defined arcade shooters, to show how to do hands-free gaming right. \"Rise of Nightmares\" is brutal, tense, but most importantly, it's fun.The game kicks off with alcoholic protagonist Josh in a train while vacationing with his wife. When a flask falls from his jacket, she gets disgusted and storms out of the train car. But when he pursues her to the dining car, he sees her following a strange man to another part of the train. Next thing he knows, the train is crashing, and sent plummeting into a lake. He desperately runs to escape the sinking vessel, finding dry land and regrouping with survivors of the wreck. But just when he thinks it's safe, his party wanders through a corpse-filled forest into a bizarre castle filled with disgusting torture devices and violent undead hoards. With everybody around him dying in the most horrendous of ways, he must keep his wits about him and find his wife by any means necessary. Even if those means involve digging through the guts of a human corpse or decapitating a murderous maid by prying her neck with forceps. Which they totally do.While the story does take some interesting turns, adding in three very wicked antagonists and a deepening mystery surrounding the castle, the real joys of this game are the scares that wait around every corner. As a longtime survival horror game enthusiast, I more than most would've scoffed at the idea of the genre working so well without a controller. Those scoffs would have been mistaken impressions, however, because this is one of the most downright enjoyable and scary games in that genre that I have experienced in a very long time. Newer \"survival horror\" games such as \"Dead Space\" feel like shooters with scares piled on them, and old favorites like \"Resident Evil\" and \"Silent Hill\" have often picked action over terror entirely. With \"Rise of Nightmares\", I felt truly intimidated and panicked as my weapons broke and I was forced to pound away at the faces of zombies with my bare hands, until I could pick up whatever was available to kill them.And killing is something that this game doesn't take lightly. And by \"doesn't take lightly\", I mean it makes every weapon you use more fun than they should be. You mimic the motions of every weapon, stabbing with knives, hurling scalpels, closing hedge trimmers, hacking with axes and pushing into foes with a chainsaw. These deaths are actually more brutal than they sound, believe it or not. Sega AM1 knows a little something about gore, and they've truly topped themselves this time. Unrealistic amounts of plasma gush from every enemy, their limbs coming across as nothing more than detachable sacks of red goo. This, coupled with the multitude of death traps that they can be lured (or forced) into, makes for an sickeningly entertaining good time.While on the topic of sickening violence, it should be pointed out that not only the enemies are subject to these types of gruesome deathes. You will get offed several times by varying traps, and you will watch other captives of the antagonists be slaughtered in increasingly horrendous ways. It's not uncustomary for this game to get you acquainted with a character, only to force you into watching as they get brutally dismembered or disemboweled only moments later. But it's not only the physical violence that's grotesque; the environment succeeds at balancing the perfect air of suspenseful and disgusting. Strategically-placed hanging corpses, loose limbs and sliced-open torsos keep you looking around on high alert, lest what did those victims in comes for you as well. It's a bloody terrifying experience, one that wouldn't be out of place back in the good old days of DreamCast and PS2 J-Horror games.Those are the types of games that \"Rise of Nightmares\" is like both in terms of content and plot. The story slowly evolves, or devolves depending on how you look at it, into a bizarre series of nonsensical imagery and concepts. Dialogue takes a turn for the unintentionally funny, and sometimes is simply a concoction of unabashed strangeness. Around the game's halfway point is where AM1's love of convoluted plots, shown in the later HOTD entries, comes out full force. Running through people's dreams, robotic transformations and shooting energy blasts from your bare hands all end up passing as normal occurrences in this game, whether or not it ever makes a lot of sense. It's these types of bizarre, confusing yet intriguing stories that some of my personal favorite survival horror games, like \"Rule of Rose\" or \"D2\", consist of, and thus I respect the gung-ho relentlessness that the writers scripted this game with.An equal amount of respect goes towards crafting the solid controls that the experience is built around. Surviving through what the castle throws at you without a controller is a unique experience, and one that may  be the most divisive in the game. The player places one foot forward to walk, using their shoulders to turn and using a single hand to interact with any object in the environment. When the time comes to fight, the player puts up their dukes and assumes a sort of modified boxer's stance. Depending on what weapon a player has, their experience will differ. That experience will shift quite often, because as mentioned above, each weapon has a breaking or depletion point. Typically, an escape route or alternative combat solution isn't too far, though. And with the huge arsenal of weapons (I lost count at how many I picked up during my playthrough), you'll never get bored tearing through enemies.While all of this works perfectly fine, it could have definitely used some fine-tuning. There were more instances than I care to admit that Josh had a slight turn to his walk that I was not displaying, and picking up the wrong item and having to wait through a sequence of him picking it up only to drop it again happens way too often. The irritating process of cancelling an item pick-up is troubling in a survival horror game, especially one where enemies surround the player frequently. I would've liked to see AM1 give more effort in smoothing over some of the finickiness the Kinect-exclusive controls display.I would've also liked to see some more zest put into Josh's traversing of the castle. This may just be me, but it's not believable that he would be moving so slowly in such a dangerous situation. Moving slightly faster in the game requires a larger step forward, which ultimately ends up feeling awkward and not worth the pain of standing in a wide stance for so long. So, for the most part, you're stuck going through occasionally expansive corridors with absolutely no way to speed up your movements. It doesn't help that some portions of the castle are incredibly dull to look at and in no way build up any type of suspense. While this may be a bit of a turn-off to some, I found it to be a mild annoyance at best.The only thing that genuinely annoyed me about this game was the aforementioned inaccuracy of the controls, and the sometimes sloppy lock-on system. Generally, in combat, the player automatically locks onto their enemy and begins whaling at them with their current weapon. But there were times when the lock-on did, in fact, not work at all, and as a result, I was desperately flailing in an attempt to kill my assailant and be done with that particular portion. The lock-on itself is problematic at times, though, because it prevents you from even slightly. While it's understandable that AM1 did this, due to the fact your shoulders shift quite often in combat, it doesn't help when you're being attack by three enemies at once and you can't beat them off. It displays all the control pitfalls of an older survival horror game, really, just updated for a new method of play.Despite these issues, \"Rise of Nightmares\" comes off with a serious recommendation from me. While finicky controls hinder it from true greatness, this is nonetheless a very unique and entertaining title from the guys who know hands-on zombie combat better than most. AM1 has crafted a viable reason for traditional gamers to pay attention to the Kinect, and paved a path which more developers are sure to soon tread. It's one of my favorite games this year, in the face of it's questionable control scheme, and will certainly provide many memories for a while to come.Story: B+Gameplay: B-Graphics: BSound: B-Overall: B- (Flawed But Fun)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

Basically this is what video games should be, a lot of fun and an enjoyable escape from reality. I also must add, there is a lot of cursing, however after you get into the game it really just becomes background noise and you really don't notice it much. The violence aspect is over the top, but in a very animated sense, kind of like a grownups version of Looney Tunes.Surprisingly, the story isn't that bad. I'm not sure if it's because I wasn't really expecting much because of the type of game it is or if it was actually a good story on its own merits, but either way the bottom line is it was pretty good. There was just as much action as there was character development, you actually felt as if you were fighting for something and someone at the same time.The AI is as dumb as a box of rocks, not really much of a challenge. This game really wasn't meant to blow you away with incredible AI, they were meant to be used as target practice and nothing more. When you hear them speak, this is made pretty evident; you're not dealing with Einstein here, more like Frankenstein.The environments are beautifully rendered, lots of detail and variety. The character models are a little stiff but not bad, let's just say you won't be mistaking them for real people.Believe it or not, with all that is happening on the screen during a typical gun fight, the aiming system is pretty accurate. Most of the time, you are able to pull off the desired skill shots with little to no hassle at all. The game's controls are tight, not too difficult to learn nor too complicated during the long run, ultimately pretty fluid and user friendly.The online aspect of this game is different than most, you won't find your typical team deathmatch here. I will tell you though; the multiplayer portion is a lot more fun with friends than it is with random people. You will be entertained, but I don't know if you'll spend Call of Duty hours playing online here in the Bulletstorm world.If I could compare this game to anything else currently on the market, it would be a mash up of MadWorld, Gears of War and Borderlands, and if you ask me borrowing elements from those titles isn't a bad thing at all. If you're looking for a good time, nothing too serious, pick this game up, you won't be disappointed.By the way, in case you were wondering, the title is an inside joke for Xbox 360 players.Michael","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"MORTAL KOMBAT! A moderately successful reboot","reviewText":"I hate reboots. Generally speaking reboots attempt to and fail to revive a series that has been lagging resulting in remakes that they don't want to call remakes. On occasion, however, you run into one that went well. Castlevania Lords of Shadows certainly exceeds the original title upon which the premise is based containing a deeper story and encouraging you to care about the whip wielding Belmont at your control. In movies Batman Begins was done after a huge amount of time had passed and audiences had all but forgotten the abysmal Batman and Robin, but also went above and beyond the previous versions of the film series, improving greatly upon the formula.Sometimes there are reboots that work, but really aren't any better than the original version of the franchise like Star Trek which was entertaining, and even worked within the established rules to reboot the series without giving it a complete overhaul. It was okay, but not the epic improvement a reboot should offer. Most reboots fail utterly.Mortal Kombat is actually the ninth installment of this ridiculously over the top and gory franchise. It is a reboot, and not a reboot, kind of like Star Trek. The story goes that Shao Khan won at the end of Mortal Kombat Armageddon and achieved immortality and invincibility which he then used to annihilate all of the Kombatants including long time rival Raiden, however before Raiden is killed he sends a message to his past self, a cryptic finally thought \"he must win.\" Raiden, who had previously been a competent leader and mentor to Lui Kang and co becomes a bungling idiot as he tries desperately to figure out what the message meant. His visions unfortunately lead to the death of practically everyone, but at least this time Shao Khan is defeated before he can become invincible... also Quan Chi and Shinnok may have been trying to alter time for their benefit too... Leading up to an inevitable sequel I'm sure... That will have everyone who dies alive and well again. Honestly I don't know why the developers keep killing anyone off at all in this game, its like killing off the X-Men... Death has no permanent meaning in Mortal Kombat, but still this is a pretty decent story by MK standards, though it pales in comparison to the riveting \"Deception.\"As with any new installment of MK the graphics are far and above anything its predecessors offered, the animation is (for the first time ever) smooth, and combos can be chained together with greater ease than ever before. This installment has modified the controls so that the game is accessible to button crunchers which will make a lot of folks happy I am sure. This game also looks better, perhaps, than any competing fighting title out there, but its design philosophy has changed little since the 1990s and it's the costumes and over all character designs that warrant some criticism.Women in this series have never been treated with the respect they deserve, at least not since MKII. The costumes of the women in the game are far too revealing. In an era when video game women, including Laura Croft, are moving toward greater realism MK does a great disservice to the gaming community by adhering stricty to a design philosophy only appreciated by 15 year old boys who have no girlfriend and no prospects of obtaining one. As a married 31 year old I find the unrealistically proportioned women in skimpy outfits at this stage outright misogynistic. As a martial artist myself, albeit a fat one, I know many female martial artists and none of them would enter a fight with so little clothing. You can't fight dressed like that.The other primary problem with the characters is that they seem to be a fusion of Greek statues and porn stars, too perfect to reflect any sort of reality, and too chiseled to look attractive. Again, it shows a great disrespect to women and it is really sad that this series hasn't evolved beyond the 15 year old boys that played these games when we were young. We're 30 now, we mostly have wives, some of us even have kids (who will not be playing these games) so why hasn't this series matured along with us?Of course the gore is more detailed than ever before, but still ridiculously over the top and unrealistic. Despite its cartoonish means of dispatching a vanquished foe the game does actually have a few fatalities that are admittedly unrealistic, but are actually quite disturbing on a level past games have failed to capture. The new X-Ray power moves are simply amazing but are so detailed you almost feel your own bones break in sympathy for your poor digital avatar... of course after having their necks broken and their spines shattered in a feat only Wolverine could be expected to pull off your characters kip up and they are back in the fight. The X-Ray moves should have had greater consequences, as while they are wicked cool the over the top cartoonishness of this game is wearing thin for this grumpy 31 year old \"extremist shrill voice on the right.\" Resident Evil, and Silent Hill and numerous other games I used to play as a kid have all matured and moved toward trying harder to more accurately represent something believable. Mortal Kombat has better character models than ever before, graphics that are jaw dropping and awe inspiring, yet immature and impish at the same time.That said if you have been a fan of the game in the past you will still likely enjoy this entry. Its sad the game's concept stopped growing and developing after Armageddon, the last trilogy introduced several welcome new ideas, all of which were drop kicked for this \"back to basics\" reboot. I hope that the next one will indeed take the series forward in more ways than just better graphics and more detailed gore.3 out of 5 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2011"}

I dance really stiff, I hope after playing this game some more my dancing improves.  I have always wanted to dance, but always felt weird doing it in public.

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Revolutionary, but Lacking the Charm of the Old Games","reviewText":"It's been three and a half years since FFXII and the world has finally been given the newest FF game and not just on one system either. Let me just begin by saying that I am a pretty serious FF fan. I've played the following: 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 and a little of Tactics. I played probably a few hundred hours of 7 in fact, including the defeat of the Ruby Weapon. For those who don't know, the Ruby Weapon is a super (maybe higher) boss fight which isn't part of the main storyline. So I'm not an Americanized first person shooter gamer, quite the opposite in fact. So, here's an overview of the game for the less patient. This review is riddled with SPOILERS!Graphics - 9.5 of 10Unbelievably crisp textures, brilliant colors and lifelike movement compose FFXIII. FMVs are easily the best I've ever seen, literally photorealistic.Battle System - 8 of 10Very different from the norm, action is super quick, paradigm system allows people to play roles as opposed to magic only being had by certain characters, but you're not given full control until well into the game and the learning curve is pretty steepGameplay - 5 of 10Huge disappointment, many cutscenes were unnecessary (figure about one every 10 minutes), you get railroaded from one part to the next for most of the game, no freeroam, no real towns and in fact no interaction with NPCs (so far).Story - 7 of 10Very, very slow in development; The crux of the story is that all the characters have been cursed by a magical creature called a Fal'Cie. And they all have the ability to do magic, but the catch is they need to complete a main task or focus so they don't turn into a monster. There's been better stories though.Characters - 8 of 10People seem pretty interesting, each has their own tale; you have a soldier, a dad, the cocky guy, the girlfriend, the ditzy girl and the kid. The only real problem here is the same as the story - slow in development.Music / Voice Acting 7 of 10The music is definitely fantastical in feeling, but not very memorable and kind of seems like an afterthought. Voice acting is excellent, seems very natural and makes the story seem that much more believable.Main Differences from Older FF gamesFirst off, you don't get to control all four people making the game considerably harder than older games. There are no towns, no NPCs to talk to, no real stores; there are only floating computers where the weapons and accessories are, I suppose \"faxed\" to you. You can't roam about the planet. For that matter you can't even backtrack in some areas. Leveling characters means upping their roles. So your health and other stats go up, but you don't get the satisfaction of saying I'm level 60 or level 73. There are SO many cutscenes, more than I've ever seen in a game and that includes Lost Odyssey.Graphics / AnimationThis could be the best visuals that I've ever seen in a game. The only close contender for me is Mass Effect. The faces look so human; you can see the complexion of the skin and and blemishes or freckles. The movement is so lifelike just while running. Extensive 3-D character mapping must have been done. And this is all in game rendering. It looks this good all the time. The FMVs are astonishing, but there are far fewer FMVs than I can remember in older games. This is most likely because they eat up valuable disc space.The FMVs are bar none the best, most photorealistic visuals I've ever seen.You really do have to see the game to believe the graphics. One might note that an FMV is a full motion video which means it is CGI like a regular movie, whereas a cutscene uses the animation of the in - game animation to produce a video. Cutscenes occur very often in the game. FMVs on the other hand are so dense with graphic content that there are very few in a game. My only qualm with the graphics is that some of the non-essential background items don't look quite as good as the people and the landscapes. But these are few and far between.Battle System / LevelingFirst, I must express how important it is for people who are new to the FF series to read the tutorials. I'm a FF veteran and this game was not easy for me, the difficulty rates probably in the top 20% of the games I've played. This battle system is not like anything I've ever seen in a JRPG. Mind you, I haven't played a FF game since FF10. So most of this stuff is new to meThe key part is the paradigm system. This is the backbone of the character development. Instead of the traditional leveling where you get more HP for each level and more magic points automatically, you get to choose where you want your character to specialize. For example, Lightning (main character) is a soldier so she is best suited to commando. Commando's are leaders and attack with weapons and some magic. Purely magic characters are ravagers. There are also medics, sentinel, synergists and saboteurs. Sentinels are your tank, they take all the damage. Synergists \"buff\" your party up with stuff like shell, protect, bravery etc. Saboteurs are \"debuffers\" of the enemies, making them good to be in parallel with the synergists. What differs from older game is that your  people are much less multi-faceted than they used to be.So you'll have a character development chart which is a 3-D diagram called the crystarium. This is where it gets complicated. The crystarium will have circles and at the circumference of the circle will be unlit crystals named like hp + 10 or magic + 5 or protect as some examples. Each is a skill, magic or character enhancement. You gain these by using crystarium points that are earned from the battles. These points are mainly based on the difficulty of the battle and the number of combatants. And each character can have three types of roles (this changes later on), normally better suited to that type of person.Then there is role level. This is basically what you could call leveling up. Once you've reach the maximum number of crystarium crystals in a group and the game tells you that your role level has increased then you can go to the next group of crystarium circles. To give you an idea of how long this takes, I was just able to get all characters to role level three within the past few hours in the game and I recently started the third disc.The actual fighting is a little different. It is considerably faster than any RPG I've played and therefore takes some skill and intelligence to stay alive. Remember there are no difficulty settings. When you get into the battle you have the ability to do auto commands, pick from a list of attacks/magic or use a technique. Auto command is just what the computer thinks will give the best attack based on the monster. Attacks and magic vary depending on your role.And there is a technique which includes Libra - scans enemy and stores the info permanently in your data and can be brought up in battle with the touch of a button. Another technique is your Eidolon (summon). You have to earn these from battling them and then you can bring them in and have them fight with you. This removes all but your controlled character. When you can bring an Eidolon in is based on your technical points - gained from the rating of your battle. I know; it's a lot to take in.In FFXIII, you're unable to control all but the lead character which is necessary because of the speed of the battle but just one more part of the game you don't have control over. That and the fact that you will be controlling only two characters for probably the first half of the game are what I see as downsides to the battle system. Other than that, it is quite revolutionary, action packed and lightning quick.GameplayThe gameplay is more linear than any RPG I've ever played. Heck, even in Super Mario Bros. you could get in the warp pipes and go to a different part of the game. You will literally spend the whole first disc just running. You won't know why you're there or how you got there, but this is the scheme. Cutscene, battle, battle, cutscene, run, battle, cutscene, run, FMV, run and battle some more. Battles break up the running, but early on these can get monotonous as well because there are not very many different types of monsters in the beginning of the game. You're given very little freedom to make the game your own.Weapon customization and upgrades are about the only way to do so. Shops essentially don't exist in a tangible sense. There are just little floating computers that have all the shops built in. I understand why this was done, but it's just another little thing that's taken away from the RPG part of the game. One of the larger qualms I have with the gameplay is I am pretty deep into the game and it looks like I won't have the ability to just walk up and have a conversation with anyone. There's dialog, but you have no determination of the outcome. I hate to say it, but I think Square Enix has actually been left behind in a lot of areas where other RPGs have advanced.Role playing means you're playing the role of the character and entails being able to determine where the character goes for one and who they talk to. These are like the most basic elements of an RPG and Square Enix seems to have omitted them. Then there are other things that you'd think they would have made innovations to such as the armor or even clothing. But you don't get armor in FFXIII. I guess I just thought that when you have almost four years to develop and complete a game, we'd be wowed not just by the FMVs but by the technical accomplishments of a game series which has been around for over two decades. The only super impressive parts of the game is the graphics (obviously) and the battle system. Aside from that, this is not of the caliber of other FF games. To me it seems like SqEx, imagines themselves so great of a developer that people will buy anything they make despite the clear lack of overall advancement. Maybe, they should have spent a little less money on the cutscenes and FMVs and a little more on new concepts.StorySumming up the story is quite simple for FFXIII. You have seven main characters who are cursed with magic. They become what are known as L'Cie. They need to complete something called a focus in a certain amount of time or they'll turn into a monster called a Cieth. But the catch is that when they do complete it, they turn into a crystal. I won't go into more detail about the crystal because that is a pretty massive spoiler. However, I really liked the explanation of being \"cursed\" with magic as opposed to just finding little balls on the ground that contained it. The story has some twists and turns and is considerably character driven. The developers took great pains to try and give you an idea of the character's plight and their personality from the beginning.Unfortunately, there is a ton of terminology that has little to no explanation even with the enormous amount of cutscenes. Here are some of the terms: Gran Pulse L'Cie, Cocoon L'Cie, Eden, Sanctum L'Cie, Fal'Cie, PsiCOM and the list goes on and on. But there is a datalog that explains most if not all of terms and each chapter. Mind you I've watched every single cutscene so far. The story isn't necessarily complicated as it is multi-faceted. There are a bunch of different storylines that come together. And there are a lot of things that need to be remembered just for the storyline, not to mention the fighting. I suppose I should have read that instruction manual or bought the game book.CharactersIn every good RPG there are bigger than life characters. In order to have a good story, these characters have to have a deep background story. There is Lightning, who is/was a soldier. She is the toughest of the group. Her sister - Serah was the first to become a L'Cie. However, she completed her focus so she turned into crystal. Snow is Serah's fianc&eacute;. He is a macho, save everyone type of guy and wants to be a hero. His wanting to be the hero however ends up getting people killed. Hope is a teenage guy who gets entangled in Snow's web. The story centers around these four.The other characters are Vanielle, Fang and Sazh. Their storyline develops later in the game. Vanielle is a supposedly a teenage girl or at least she looks like it. She acts like a carefree ditz, but she hides a dark past. Fang is her best friend or maybe something more and is also a female. She has taken it upon herself to protect Vanielle. Sazh is the eldest of the group, maybe in his 40s. He is the cynic, world weary character and is definitely fighting just to get back to his son - Dodge.Music and Voice ActingOne of the main things I always remembered FF games for was the music. Everyone remembers the battle music from FFVII. It's one of the most memorable things in my gaming history. The music is somewhat pushed aside in this game which kind of takes away from the polished feel that I've come to expect. I've played probably a couple hundred battles and I can't tell you how the music goes. The volume on the music is also low making it all the less memorable.The voice actors picked for this game were just excellent. They truly bring a human quality to the game and really fit the characters they play. You'd be hard pressed to find better voice acting for the sheer amount of dialogue that goes on in this game. As far as I'm concerned they couldn't have done better.ConclusionAs I went through the game I was allowed more freedom little by little. The battle system is great, very state of the art for JRPGs. What was really nice is the developers gave ample tutorials which eased you into the battle system and the game in general. The graphics are, as usual masterfully done. However, the huge deviation from any previous FF game I've played including: inability to talk with NPC characters, not being able to control all the people in a battle, linearity so pervasive it resembles an FPS and the inability to really decide where you're going prevents this from being a game to remember. The first two discs really appear more like a movie with interactivity. When you look at the game retrospectively, it's lacking so very many things that older games had. Some elements are better, while some were completely left out. And you get this eerie feeling that Final Fantasy may well be headed the way of the Dodo bird. Losing it's addictive or even borderline obsessive fans may mean that in the near future, the moniker of Final Fantasy could become the final Final Fantasy. Were I to give it a rating I'd say a 7 out of 10 is reasonable; but compared to older games maybe closer to a 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2010"}

Burns \"Slackjaw\"","summary":"A little from the old and a little from the new...","reviewText":"Writers admonition:I have played exactly 6 hours into this game but felt I could adequately describe it to those on the fence to give a good idea as to what to expect given the lack of reviews out currently. I will update as I can.I guess it's best to look at this from 2 different positions.  Either you are like me, and have played all iterations of this excellent franchise including the original Ps2 and Xbox games (Red Faction 1 and 2).  Or you are a newcomer as there was a several year gap between Guerrilla and it's predecessors. I'll start from my perspective as it makes the review more helpful.I loved the FPS elements in Red Faction 1 and 2.  Red Faction 2 was a great game and one that I place on the pedistal of my top 20 games of all time.  The Multiplayer in that game was exeptional and the campaign was the first game I can remember (though I'm sure I'm missing some) that allowed you to find your own way through, over or under an objective.  Don't like a wall?  Blow it up and forget about it- moving on to the next area.  Red Faction 2 took place below ground almost entirely...  Then Guerrilla came out.  I was happy with the game but I felt a bit betrayed by the developers because gone was the sense of being below ground on Mars and in its' place was a sandbox of destruction.  I'm not a GTA fan but I appreciate the genre.  I like my FPS to be more on the linear side with creativity to overcome the mission whatever way I see fit but within bounderies. Guerrilla was not that game. It reminded me a little of a Wii title you may know, Boom Blox.  Not the same I realize as one's a kids game and the other is an adult romp but you get the idea.  Blox was about shooting a ball and destroying an environment or building of some type.  And though this was not the entire idea it was a big part of it.Which brings me to Armageddon.  This title is like a mixture of the old linear FPS that I loved (which has been way overdone now in other franchise') and Red Faction Guerrilla where you free roam and basically sabotage everything not tied to the earth.  In this way, I truly liked the mixture plus the fact that they added co op. It added what I liked about the first games and combined some free roaming elements of the 3rd.  It is a much more linear game as to the standard play through and returns to it's roots much of the game deep below Mars' surface.  There are scripted events in the vein of Dead Space 2 and they are much as you would expect.  Graphics are good but not revolutionary.  It is however, a shout back to the older days of Xbox with updated event development (scripted events driving the story).  It's a good mix and I like that they came back a little closer to the series roots..I think I've stated the positives.. Now for my biggest negative...1/  lack of a meaningful multiplayer..  Where is the killfest that was Red Faction 2 multiplayer???  Non existent unless you count the survival throw in.  I did not cut my teeth on the multiplayer as it was not what I was looking for in the sense of a traditional arena-styled slugfest.  I liked the old multiplayer and that is why I deducted the point.  There is a multiplayer component but it was boring to me.For now, given that I have not yet completed the game I will stop there.  If you liked the old Red Faction on the original Xbox/ PS2 then this game is likely for you (unless you are looking for a multiplayer deal) I would approach this as a great one player title with a few bonuses.  I would raise the score a bit for the Campaign itself to maybe 4 1/2 stars but I can't ignore the multiplayer which felt a bit like \"We gotta do SOMETHING for multiplayer so here!\"I will update as I complete the game. I feel it is good to get an early look out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2011"}

The game does share some similarities to Dishonored, it's a stealth based game in a medieval/fantasy/Steampunkish setting. The world is suffering a plague, and you have a mechanical eye. That's where the similarities end. Thief is a darker, more gothic game, and focuses on a thief(As opposed to an assassin) as he hops around rooftops and pilfers all kinds of valuables!You have the ability to use Focus, which highlights interactive items, such as grates, pipes pictures. It's up to you though to figure out how you are going to interact with those objects. There is no particular &#34;Right or wrong&#34; way to finish a mission, and there are multiple ways you take.While your &#34;Focus&#34; ability is handy, you have other equipment to aid you in your burgling! You also have your blackjack for knocking guards out, as well as a bow and arrow with various gimmicky arrows that would make Green Arrow green with envy(No pun intended). After a brief tutorial mission you gain &#34;The Claw&#34;, which is fittingly stolen at the end of the tutorial.While I do quite enjoy this game, the load times is extremely annoying. After playing Infamous: Second Son, which has virtually NO load times, it's a huge disappointment waiting for a level to load, especially when many of those levels are so small! Yes, they are detailed, but they are very small!On top of the load times, the city maps can be downright confusing! For instance, to get to the area where the bank heist DLC takes place, requires you to make your way through a hidden path behind some boxes. This to me is very off putting! If you want hidden paths? Fine! However don't stick DLC missions or main missions down there! Leave those hidden paths to lead to side missions!So, the game's not perfect, it has a couple flaws, but despite those flaws, it is incredibly enjoyable! Would I recommend it to others? Sure! Especially if they are fans of the stealth genre! It's fun, and remains fun and enjoyable even when dealing with those two flaws.I want to rate  the game 5 stars, but since there are those 2 things, that I believe are flaws, I can't in good faith give it 5 stars, but can stress that I enjoyed the game despite those 2 things.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2014"}

As a non W40K fan, I was looking for more backstory or some kind of database in game to explore W40K universe. Certain parts of singleplayer feels boring, levels are too big, it requires a lot of running from point A to B, loses focus with flow of the story, but as long there hordes of enemies to slaughter, have fun revving the chainsword and get spectacular kills.Graphics & Sound:Very high end graphics and cutscenes are extremely well rendered. The character models and details are very high end render similarly like Unreal Engine like quality. The textures are smooth and no pop ups. In the end, it looks very polished, well done work by Relic Entertainment for making this game look GREAT. I am huge fan of pushing a system to its limits by taking advantage of everyting available to make a game look great. The soundtrack of game is indeed very epic for story and sound effects for weapons are hard and has kick when fired or used.Multiplayer:This game mode pretty much similar very other MP of other games except with gameplay of singleplayer is fully integrated. The game runs on Dedicated Servers so there is no issue of lag.

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

They usually have good stories, but the graphics are horrible, the combat is clumsy, and the quest system is yawn worthy. The Witcher 2 takes what was great from the first and makes it even better to form one of the greatest action RPGs of this generation.You play, once again, as Geralt of Rivia, a Witcher, who got framed for assassinating king Demavend and must prove his innocence. The story is heavy in politics, but is also very deep and feels just like the novels. Triss Merrigold also returns with her beautiful red hair and all. You will also see other familiar faces such as Zoltan Chivay and Dandelion. The new faces are strong, likeable, and memorable characters that you will grow to love or hate respectively throughout the course of this 20-30 hour game. Geralt himself is even stronger this time around with more problems than you can shake a stick at. You learn to respect him more and see just how much this poor man can take. CD Projekt really shows you the roots of both good and evil in humanity in such a realistic fashion, and that's what really drives the characters home.The combat in The Witcher 2 is better than the first game because gone are the timed sword swings and stances. You now just have light and heavy attacks, but can block, counter attack (when you unlock the skill), and you still use the steel/silver sword combo. Steel is for people and silver is for monsters. The combat was very hard to do when the game first launched, but patches as of late have fixed this for multiple blocking, and faster response. The combat isn't great and is clumsy especially early on when you aren't very strong and towards the end of the game. Combat will make you smash your monitor in frustration in the beginning because you have to learn to just hit once or twice, dodge, run around, hit another couple of times, rinse and repeat 50 times. Yeah, its one of those games in the beginning. After you level up enough you can cut down enemies in just a couple of swings and groups of 7-10 won't really bother you.Of course you can equip better armor, weapons, and so forth, but The Witcher lets you do other things like equip trophies that are found on bosses that increase stats, use sword enhancements such as oils, whetstones, runes, and armor enhancements (kind of like Monster Hunter?) This adds a lot of depth to the customization to your load out which has endless possibilities. I think the biggest improvement is the resource gathering and alchemy because its so simple and easy now. Just gather resources as you go and you can meditate and create potions that increase your vigor (for signs; more on that later), vitality (health), a potion that lets you see in the dark, damage increasing potions etc. The only problem is you can't drink them from the menu, but you have to use them before a fight. This is my biggest beef with the game because if you are low on health in a fight you're screwed unless you took a Swallow potion beforehand. The premeditated potion drinking is a big flaw in the game, I think, but some hardcore RPG players may like this.The Witcher is also famous for its Signs use because Witchers can't use magic like sorcerers or mages can. There are six different signs and they use chunks of vigor but recharge over time. These Signs are vital to winning in combat especially against bosses, so learn to use these in tandem with sword combos and you can win even the toughest fights. One last thing you can use in combat are Places of Power which you find with your wolf medallion. Activate it and you may find, out in woods or wild places, signs of power that give you temporary stat boosts. These come in handy early in the game (especially in Flotsam) when you are a low level.The story also has moral decisions thrown in there that really change the outcome of the story. Of course there are multiple playthroughs (but no new game+ sadly) so you can see what each decision will bring. There are a lot of plot holes in the story that aren't filled until the very end during dialog which I found odd, so if you get confused just hang in there until the final moments of the game. Overall my biggest issue is the potion use, combat, and the huge difficulty spikes. The graphics are groundbreaking with gorgeous lighting, highly detailed textures, and amazing landscapes, as well as varied environments with nice weather effects. The character models look superb, and the voice acting is top notch. This game just shows that indie developers can make games look great. You do need a monster rig to run the game on high settings (especially with Ubersampling enabled you need probably dual GPUs and a high end quad core CPU). Other than that The Witcher 2 is amazing in every way and should not be missed by anyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Powered by an all-new engine,Sonic Unleashedblends classicSonicgameplay with a variety of in-game perspectives to create an entirely new and unique gaming experience.

As a result not only has the Earth split into distinct sections, so has Sonic. Now he is two beings. During the day he is the usual speed-addicted hedgehog players will remember, but at night he becomes Sonic the Werehog. In either form it is the player's ultimate goal to find the missing chaos emeralds and return them to their proper place in order to set the world and Sonic himself, back the way he should be.Gameplay: The Two Sides of SonicLike nearly allSonicgames,Sonic Unleashedis platform-based. The game combines the feel of 2D side-scrolling that fans of theSonicseries love, with sharp 3D graphics, and throws in an over the back third-person perspective reminiscent of FPS gameplay for good measure. And just as in earlier games, as players race through and explore the expansive world before them, using auto lock to hone in on enemies and areas of interest, they will rely on the power they gain from the rings they collect for a variety of things, but with the new twist of Sonic's split personality, things are a little bit different.Playing during the day, as you race across the world in the form of Sonic, speed is the main goal. Collecting rings fills you with 'Ring Energy,' which not only provides extra life, but also the advantage of 'Sonic Boost.' With this players can travel at speeds that approximate 300 MPH. In addition,Sonic Unleashedintroduces two new features: the 'Speed Drift' and the 'Quick Step'. Speed Drifting is similar to drifting in racing games, allowing players to slide around corners at high speeds, while Quick Stepping is a sidestepping maneuver allowing Sonic to avoid enemies with quick steps to either side. Both keep you moving as fast as possible, so you can get as many rings as possible, which again keeps you moving as fast as possible.As night falls and Sonic assumes his Werehog form the rings provide a different kind of power more suited to his more menacing appearance. Much slower, but also much more powerful, the Werehog relies on the rings to provide life as well as strength to shield himself from the attacks of enemies. This is necessary because Werehog gameplay, although based in platforming, incorporates significant levels of combat as well. Red orbs gathered as enemies are defeated allow the player to unlock additional combo moves that will supplement the hack and slash and arm stretching abilities that the Werehog always possesses. Whether Hedgehog or Werehog, no matter which form players prefer they will get ample opportunity to explore the two sides of Sonic since each area in the game contains both night and day segments where each form must be played.Key Game Features:Sonic&rsquo;s World Transformed- Sonic maintains his high-speed abilities during the day, but at night he is transformed into a mysterious dark form with incredible never-before-seen abilities including 3D-action brawling and amazing agility.Tight Navigation and Speed Control- Players accelerate to super speed with &lsquo;Sonic Boost&rsquo; by collecting rings to increase Sonic&rsquo;s &lsquo;Ring Energy.&rsquo; Using &lsquo;Quick Step,&rsquo; players will quickly move left or right to avoid obstacles instantly. Additionally, &lsquo;Speed Drift&rsquo; allows players to rocket through turns without slowing down.Powerful New Engine and Cinematic Graphics- With its new modified game engine,Sonic Unleashedenhances the classic 2D perspective with mind-blowing 3D stages. Other technology capabilities include global illumination, grid computing, continuous data streaming and an intricate path finding system.Enhanced and Expanded Environments- Many unique and fascinating continents offer the player an opportunity to save the world in a dynamic, high-speed experience. In addition to exploring exciting unlockable areas, players dash through up to nine locations resembling real-life destinations including the Great Wall of China, Arctic Pole glaciers and many more.Whether it's the updated graphics that retain the side-scrolling feel of classic games in theSonicfranchise, an expansive world to race through and explore or the multiple and new ways to play,Sonic Unleashedoffers something for players of any age or level of ability.","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil.

So, they created some pretty awesome next-gen Sonic gameplay. But then they decided to throw in a mix of a new concept, as well. This time, the gimmick is Sonic turning into a \"Werehog\", a werewolf that is apparently fused with a hedgehog, and he can kill stuff by punching, as well as climb things and stretch his arms. Does it all come together? Keep reading to find out.Well, I must say. The Sonic gameplay is definitely amazing. It feels a bit weird to shake the Wii Remote to boost (I'm used to the gameplay in Sonic Colors, which is sorta derived from this game's mechanics), but other than that, I was having a blast playing the game. It was truly a thrill to run fast, kill enemies, etc. It's the kind of gameplay that you've always wanted to expect from the hedgehog since the Dreamcast era. Well, of course, not exactly like the Dreamcast games, but I hope you understand my point.Then, whenever there's a level taking place in the night, Sonic....turns into the Werehog. You know, if it wasn't for this Werehog concept, I would have given this game a straight-up 5 stars. It's not that it was a BAD idea. It just wasn't executed as well. While the normal Sonic levels take a few minutes to beat, Werehog's levels take.....twice or three times as long. That just doesn't seem necessary. Why? Well, there are often times where you have to beat things up. The combat just gets tired and repetitive. It also plays the same music over and over whenever encountering the enemies you're forced to fight to move on...As for some of the more minor aspects of the game, they are pretty darn well for the most part. The graphics are eye-popping, and the music is fun to listen to (Except for the said music when encountering enemies in Werehog levels). But when it comes to having to talk to villagers before actually playing levels, they just don't seem like they should be there. Why not just have the levels alone? Plus, few say the weirdest lines, such as that kid that is obsessed with eating, of all things.But overall, if you're on the fence looking for a good Sonic game to play, this can fit the bill. Just try to be able to tolerate the worst the Werehog levels have to offer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2012"}

The developers wouldn't know chaos if it hit them on the head, this game should have an engine like Red Faction: Guerrilla's and yes I'm comparing, in RFG you could destroy everything, literally, now that's chaos.

Black","summary":"Microtransactions... sigh","reviewText":"REVIEW UPDATE: 4/9/2014I have updated my review from 2 stars to 4 stars.  This is because Turn 10 has actively listened and responded to fan feedback, and has made changes.These changes include:- Adjusted career winnings.- Reduced car prices.- Increased \"Forza Rewards\" money.- Road America track download for FREE.- Long Beach Circuit track download for FREE.As a result of these changes, the game required much less grinding to build up your garage.  Buying tokens now feels like an optional shortcut instead of a necessity.  It feels less like the \"free-to-play\" business model that it did before.I'd like to give the game a 5 star rating, but the microtransaction monetization scheme is still present... even if it much less obnoxious now.ORIGINAL REVIEW:Turn 10 and Microsoft are charging $60 - $80 for Forza 5, depending on the version you get.  However, despite the full price tag, they are treating this like a \"free-to-play\" game.  As it aggressively pushes for microtransactions.You might hear a lot of players say \"Oh, you don't need to buy tokens!\"  And they're right, you don't NEED to, but the game has been designed from the ground up to milk extra cash out of you.Proof:-  The storefront is gone-  The auction house is gone-  Gifting cars to your friends is gone-  Sharing your cars in a Club is gone-  Earning cars as level rewards is gone-  Affinity bonuses don't get you free parts anymore-  You can't sell cars back for money anymore-  You can't sell parts back for money anymoreThe end result of these changes is this:Getting new cars is a LOT more time consuming.  Earning enough money to buy and upgrade multiple exotic cars requires excessive grinding... or buying tokens of course.Forza 5 throws out so many of the things that made previous Forza titles great so that they can milk their loyal customers as much as possible.  It's like a slap in the face to someone like me, who has been loyal to the franchise for eight whole years.Skip this entry.  With any luck Forza 6 will avoid these downfalls.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

Frye","summary":"Buy it for the multiplayer or don't buy it at all.","reviewText":"As a fan of Call of Duty games, I was pretty excited when Activision announced a Call of Duty game was coming out for the Vita. While the lack of pre-release coverage was concerning, I was still hoping for a solid CoD title that I could play on the go, and I was confident it would deliver.I have one simple question... what happened here?However, before I continue, let me state that it is far from the worst first-person shooter I've played on a portable system. However, for the first Call of Duty game on Sony's dual-sticked handheld, it should have been much better than this. We were all expecting a system-seller. What we got instead was a disappointing and shallow game with the content of a mere tech-demo.First off, let's talk about the \"campaign.\" I put that in parentheses, because calling this game's single-player a campaign is like calling Dark Souls too easy. The console CoD games are famous for their Hollywood blockbuster action, and their epic storylines. In Black Ops Declassified, we were promised a story that bridged the gap between the original Black Ops and its sequel, Black Ops 2. Considering that these two entries in the series had the best story in the series, I was expecting an interesting plot that expertly tied the events of the first game to the events of the sequel.What did we get? Ten completely unrelated missions that have you playing as either Mason or Woods. With the exception of brief references to events in the first game, and the characters you're playing as, there is no indication that this is part of the Black Ops cannon. Whenever I heard the names \"Mason,\" Woods,\" and \"Hudson,\" I'd suddenly remember \"Oh yeah, this is a Black Ops game.\"While the lack of a proper story is disappointing, even worse is the length of the campaign. Each mission takes about three to five minutes to complete. Three to five minutes. As there are only ten missions in the game, the \"campaign\" takes up to 50 minutes to complete. No, I am not insane. After each mission, the game ranks you on a global leaderboard, based on how many kills you had, how many headshots, and how fast you completed the mission. While I admire the attempt to lengthen the single player experience, there is little motivation to do so. While there is a single player ranking system in place, it is pretty much pointless, as it takes a laughably low amount of experience to reach the level cap.In terms of actual gameplay, things brighten up a bit. The traditional Call of Duty controls and feel are intact. Shooting enemies is satisfying, and weapons feel identical to their console counterparts. However, there are two glaring issues when it comes the gameplay. First of all is the AI. While they make pretty stupid decisions (chuck a grenade at a wall two inches from your face, genius!), they still manage to shoot you... at times. Sometimes they just stare at you, aiming at you, but not shooting. After you move a bit closer, then they begin shooting. My other big complaint is the lack of the epic, Hollywood action-movie feel that the Call of Duty games are famous for. There is no base-jumping from VTOLs 30,000 feet in the air, or EMPs going off over the White House. Every mission basically devolves into shooting your way from point A to point B. With the exception of a sniping mission, there is little variation in the campaign. It becomes extremely boring and unexciting at times.Other single-player content includes a time trial mode, where you shoot wooden targets in a glorified shooting gallery. Who decided to make the most forgetable level in any CoD game an actual mode is beyond me. There is also a Hostiles mode, which pits you against endless waves of enemies. While this may sound like Modern Warfare 3's survival mode, it is nowhere near as fun or engaging. The only special enemy type there is is the suicide bomber. There are no Juggernauts, claymore experts, or attack dogs. Between every round, you get a new weapon from an care package, and the dull process of shooting enemies over and over again becomes nearly unbearable.However, there is only one single reason why any CoD fan should consider picking this game up - the multiplayer. The single player and the multiplayer compare like night and day. While some things are scaled down from what they were in the console games, the game more than makes up for it with weapon customization, familiar CoD gameplay, and great map design.As I stated before, there are some things that have been scaled down from their console counterparts. There are only six maps, create-a-class is slightly barebones, and there is a limit of 8 players in every game. However, the traditional CoD multiplayer gameplay remains, and the map design is great. I didn't dislike a single map in Declassified. The maps in the game are much smaller than the maps included in the console versions, but, due to the small player count, it doesn't make a difference. As a matter of fact, the map size leads to some fairly intense battles. Nukehouse is my personal favorite, because the ridiculously small size of the map makes it easily the most tense and action-packed map of the six.The graphics are actually not bad for the Vita. While is doesn't look as good as Uncharted: Golden Abyss, the graphics are still fairly detailed. Audio, however, is a different story. Gun sound effects sound something like popcorn, and the voice acting is mostly forgetable. The music is basically copied note for note from the first game.Overall, the multiplayer is the only reason that you should consider getting this game for. If you buy this game expecting a memorable single player experience, you'd better think again. However, if you want the most tense and engaging multiplayer experience on the Vita, then Declassified is your game. Just make sure you don't buy this game for more than $30 dollars. Paying $50 for this game is downright insulting.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Story: 4/10Graphics: 8/10Audio: 6/10Gameplay: 7/10Lasting Appeal: 7.5/10Overall Score: 7 out of 10 (not an average)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXLQC","description":"","reviewerName":"Chance Briggs","summary":"Where's Jill?","reviewText":"What is the Resident Evil franchise anymore? Is it supposed to be a survival horror game or is it a fast-paced action shooter? Here, the RE6 makers seemingly said, hey, why not both?RE6 is basically three games in one. There are four campaigns, with the fourth unlocked only after completing the first three. Each campaign is told through a different protagonist, each plays differently from the other, and each have their own AI companion. First, there is Leon Kennedy's campaign, which is the closest campaign to earlier RE games. Second, there is Chris Redfield's campaign, which essentially feels like a generic 3rd person shooter. Third, there is Jake Muller's campaign, is something of a combination of the two. Finally, the Ada Wong campaign, is allegedly a stealth style campaign. Overall, I felt that the Jake Muller campaign was the most fun, if only for the missions in Chinatown. As for the worst, that would be Chris Redfield's campaign, which also has the worst of the endlessly repetitive boss battles. Seriously, we don't need each boss to \"die,\" come back, \"die,\" and then finally killed with a quicktime.The other problem that plagues the game are the the awkward camera & cover system. The camera is just too close to the characters, while the cover system often forces characters to snap against walls automatically whenever a firearm is drawn, regardless of the player's desire. Firing from cover isn't fun, since the camera once is unable to provide an adequate angle or distance to ensure accurate aiming.In terms of improvements, I enjoyed that the characters can now move while they shoot. Also, the game has a pretty good AI system. However, this game just has too many damn quick-time events, and the boss battles go on forever!Overall, the game looks great, and if you've been a fan of the series for awhile, then play this game. However, if you aren't a longtime fan, then I can't recommend it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}

Blanton","summary":"Great new BF game but bad preformance on most sytems and cards!","reviewText":"I have been playing the BF series for about a year now and I am not going to say anything new that the other reviewers haven't said about this game. If you like combat and single/multiplayer battles then you should like this game. As far as I know there is no other game out there right now that has the commander mode to the effect of accually commanding AI in a single player game to attack at specified locations on the map or scan the map for the ememy's location and call in artillery to hinder the ememy's advance. No other game right now has the squad based warfare in both sing/multi gameplay modes like Battlefield 2 has. This is an intovation in the new era of not only war gaming but multiplayer gaming period!Now I am not a big multiplayer fan simply because I find in multiplayer games there is hacking and cheating no matter if punk buster is enabled or not because there is always someone smart enough to speed hack into someones server just to many computer literate people out there not to break the rules so I tend to go solo a lot in single player. We'll here's the deal and I don't care what anyone say's. The single player server in this game can be just as challenging if not more dificult then playing online. Why? The AI is scripted depending on your level of dificulty to advance and defend they're territory as much as possible and if need be make the nesasary sacrifices to overcome their ememy. It's true that the map and amount of bots are to the mim. in single player but if you just look out there you can find mods that integrate 32 and even 64 sized maps into single player with the number of bot increased as we'll. This may sound great but I've been having problems with my game crashing on me when playing one of these mods so I tried setting my game spec's down a little. Same thing. Just keep in mind that even though you can get the bot and map sized increased in these mods, most likely your system won't be able to haddle it.Now for the system spec's..............this is where the game fails why? Because they could of used a different engine and required less memory or push on your system's processor and graphics card and still would of had decent graphics and better overall gameplay but EA took the route that most game developers do not dare. Why? They figure that even if you can't play it now you will eventually upgrade your computer in the future like most of us do and will eventually be able to play it in the years to come as technology advances at an alarming rate. Why does this matter you say? Because then they have created a much broader selling time frame than most game's that come out have. Due to it just being a Battlefield series type game and the popularity of these type's of games it is sure to sell years down the road. Look at Battlefield 42. it's still selling even though most of us have moved on to the BF Vietnam series pervious to this release and the Desert Combat and other mods for BF42. Now that's good marketing but bad for the customer because he will have to pay money and lots of it to play this game. I did! Just like most people here went out and bought the best I could afford graphics card (GF 6660 GT) and was literally let down by the games overall preformance. I wish I would have just kept my 5200 GF Nvidia because despite what they say on the box it does work on older graphics cards but you just can't set it much above the lowest settings. Who cares as long as it runs smooth right? So I am disapointed a little with the games preformace especially with a brand new GF 6600 card? Gee, maybe I should have bought the 6800? This is stupid. HL 2 and Doom 3 have 10 x better compatabilty than this game which I think they have lost a percentage of clientel at least temporarly due to the games requirements on your system until the general PC population catches up in a year or two. This is bad business to me but hey, they are just wanting to make a profit just like everyone else and not at your conveniance. So you can see I feel alittle jaded somewhat with the system requirements only because since I have been gaming I have never had any problem with any game's preformance until now even with an updated graphics card? This makes me think that the problem is within the game's coding and not my system itself so don't be fooled. Think about it. Let them come out with some patches before you get serious and buy this if you haven't already.So, if your looking for a good time on the BF like in 42 and NAM then give er' a try just be warned unless you have an AlienWare PC system, blazing processor and 2 GB's of RAM  not to mention an 7800 GF graphics card, then this review doesn't apply to you at all!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2005"}

The cover of the game didn't look that interesting, and as i was flipping through the instruction booklet, i was thinking the same thing. The reason i bought it was of course because i am a huge starwars fan, and it is a \"must\" for me to buy every starwars game that comes out. However, when i first turned on my xbox and started playing the game, i was seriousely doubting my first thought.Graphics: The graphics in Republic Commando are not that great, this aspect of the game being one of the couple flaws. The character models are extremely average, and the background design is extremely simplistic, with no real \"wow!\" to it. However, the cutscenes are pretty good as they deliver way better graphics then the actual gameplay does.Gameplay: The gameplay in Republic Commando is probobly the best aspect of the entire game. The A.I, as The Official Xbox Magazine puts it, is probobly the smartest/most intelligent A.I that you can find in a game now a days with the exception of Tom Clancey's Chaos Theory. Chaos Theory takes A.I intelligence to a whole new level...There are many guns that you can choose from, over a dozen, there are over thirty playable missions, you can do anything, from customizeing the difficulty, to inverting the controls, and to using high-tech gadgets which include lock pickers, state of the art grenades, and much, much more. The other good thing about this game is that their are checkpoints like halo 2 where it saves automatically for you. So by the designers enabling this feature, you do not have to wait to completing the mission in order for you to be allowed to save. All in all, the gameplay aspect of this wonderful game is great.Audio: The audio is another wonderful feature in the game. With music similar to the classic halo chant, you will just be sitting their without playing the game, but just listening to the fine music that Republic Commando provides for you.Online: Is there online capability? You bet there is! And its one of the best online games i've ever seen in my entire life. You can quickmatch or optimatch. The optimatch verifications include gameplay type, which includes Team deathmatch, deathmatch, assault and CTF. You can also specifie the amount of players in the room which ranges from 1-15. Overall, the Online aspect of the game is wonderful!In conclusion, i highly recomend the new Starwars game due to its great gameplay and graphics, plus online multiplay!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2005"}

I uploaded the 4-part instruction booklet that came with the microphone (you can see them under \"customer images\") and within no time at all I had the batteries in, the wrist strap attached, and was playing several different games on multiple systems.First, I tried outKaraoke Revolutionon my PlayStation 2 slim. It looks like I still have the stuff, since I scored Platinum on my first 2 songs.The next game I tried was an older game calledLife Line, a voice-command game. I thought this game only worked with a USB headset, but I was very pleased to find it worked with this microphone on both my PlayStation 2 slim and my PlayStation 3 systems. My voice commands came through loud and clear.The last two games I played wereGuitar Hero World Tourfor the PlayStation 3 and theWii, and Logitech's microphone worked for both games on both systems. I only played on the medium and hard difficulties, but that was enough for me to see it worked great. I even walked through another room while singing - you know you're using a powerful peripheral when it registers a voice through 6 feet of drywall, wiring and utility pipes.I personally didn't get to try this microphone on an Xbox, but from other reviewers it seems to work well - so that's 4 separate video game systems this microphone works on, as well as my PC. Not too shabby!The only cons I found were these:In the Guitar Hero World Tour games, Star Power for the microphone is activated by either clapping one's hand against the microphone or pressing a controller button. Sometimes my voice would activate Star Power prematurely, and other times when I clapped my hand on the microphone it wouldn't register my singing for a few seconds.The hand strap couldn't be adjusted - this isn't a huge issue unless you're planning to do stage dives or other acrobatics.I was baffled by the lack of support on SingStar games - there are more than 30 titles between the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox and the Wii, and it's surprising that such a versatile microphone won't play any of them. To their credit, Logitech did mention that these games are not supported on the back of the box. Hopefully the next Logitech microphone will support these games.Also, why would Logitech not mention that this microphone also works on the Wii? The box says \" For PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 \" - that's a very LARGE customer base to ignore.If you're looking for a microphone that can be used across multiple systems, this is the one to choose.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2009"}

VanPortfliet \"Matthew san\"","summary":"A very good game...but could have been so much more","reviewText":"Well, as many others are, I am a HUGE fan of Symphony of the Night as well as other Castlevania games going back to the first. I was ecstatic to hear that Konami was making a Castlevania for PS2, and hoped that they would (as with Contra-Shattered Soldier) stick to the classic 2d gameplay while displaying excellent new graphics,Sound,gameplay, etc. I was shocked and saddened to find out they were making it 3d, but I trusted Konami, as they are a company that rarely makes bad games, and, seeing as how the same team that made SOtN was making this one, I had high hopes that it would be an excellent game, despite being 3d. The screenshots I began seeing online looked great. I was very excited to get this game.I picked it up a few days ago, and it is a very good Castlevania game, with fun and addicting gameplay, beautiful graphics, and the castle has never looked better. But, the complexity and feeling of SOtN is no where to be found. I have put only about 4 hours into the game and have already beaten 3 of only 5 worlds and explored 65% of the map...that should tell you something of how small and in many ways too easy this game is. There are some nice armors, items, and the relics and orbs are cool, but item diversity is really very small. It feels similar to, say, Castlevania (the very first game for NES) but with modern 3D graphics. It is almost entirely hack and slash with only a little bit of puzzle solving and secret finding. Most of the reviews I read talk about how awesome the music is, but personally, I think that it is somewhat bland as well...all quiet and subdued with none of the catchy tunes I've come to expect from Castlevania games. I also think they should have included at least a couple of the classic tunes, like the vampire hunter theme. I mean, I'm all for new sounds, but I would also love to hear hints of the classics here and there.All in all, this is a decent action game, but doesn's quite live up to my expectations for Castlevania games. I am a big fan of the series, and I recommend to all other fans of SOtN and all Castlevania games...rent this one first. You may very well be greatful you did. I figure I'll finish this game in under 8 hours. However, there does seem to be some unlockable features, which may at least add some replay value.Konami...why fix whats not broken!? You could have made the hugest and most incredible 2d Castlevania game ever for the PS2, surpassing even SOtN. It would have been an instant classic, but instead we get a slightly above average hack and slash game. I CANNOT understand how the designers could have playtested this game without thinking \"gee, this really isn't ANYWHERE near as fun as Symphony of the Night\"...I just don't get it.Yet, even with all of my complaining about it, it really is a good game, if not as good as it could have been, and I do recommend it, fan of the series or not.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S.

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"R. McAdams","summary":"Decent Game, But Crazy Hard!","reviewText":"OK, right up front, I am not a rhythm music gamer.  I own all 3 current gen systems, and most of the AAA titles for all of them, except for the rhythm-based music ones. I don't find them particularly amusing, and I really don't like being forced to work through and master playing songs I *DON'T* like, in order to be able to play the songs I *DO* like.  I also rather resent that the core games for most rhythm games tend to come with a rather limited selection of songs, and then you have to nickel and dime for the rest you might want (usually sold in more expensive bundles with songs you DON'T want).  For the record, I have played: Guitar Hero (2 & 3), Rock Band, & DDR.  So, I am not unfamiliar with the game type ... I just have never really cared for itSo, I have a clear bias, keep that in mind.  I ordered DJ Hero from the Vine program, precisely because it was a non-standard music-rhythm game, and also because I love dance/house/techno music and mixes.  I thought that those two elements together would provide for a fun and different take on the genre.  I ended up being right on only one of those assumptions.Now, on to the review!The controller is well made, solid, and the turntable especially is nice.  It glides quite well under your fingers, and has a satisfying feel to it.  The buttons, sliders and knobs to the left do their job (although they are a tad less satisfying.).  The controller base is solid, and the cord length is excellent.However, even after you have played through the demo and tutorial (which doesn't cover all of the controls, incidentally), and the game starts up for real, even on the easiest settings, the learning curve is insane.  I was terrible at this game.  And I did decently at all of the other music-rhythm games I have tried.  Just to double check, I had my brother try the game out (also a video game player), and my sister-in-law try the game out (also a video game player), and they both agreed that the game SEEMED fun, but they couldn't really enjoy it because they were spending so much time frantically swinging sliders around, trying to hit the buttons correctly, etc.  The pacing and combination of controls you must interact with is just way too fast and varied for me (or them).  Just out of curiosity, I booted it up under the hardest difficulty I had access to, and I was astonished at how much harder it became.  I am not sure anyone other than a gaming genius, or a real DJ (who has their DJ equipment laid out like the controller) could play the game on that setting.  In contrast, I have been able to play games on the \"hard\" setting in all of the other music-rhythm games I have played, and at least get a \"passing\" score.Now, if you are not the one actually PLAYING the game, the visuals are fun to watch, and the music is EXCELLENT.  Really, really excellent.  However, if you are PLAYING the game, you are far too busy to enjoy any of that.  The game offers a co-op mode in a \"battle\" or \"jam together\" arrangement, if you have another turntable (which we didn't) or a music-rhythm game guitar (which we didn't), so I was not able to test those functions.  I am sure the dual turntable mode would be equally hard for both players, I have no idea what the turntable vs. guitar function would behave like.Bottom line, the game just isn't that fun to PLAY.  It is fun to watch and listen to.  But not to play.  The learning curve is insanely steep, the controls require a fairly high level of precision, and the number of controls you need to interact with during the span of time you have between notes and beats can get jaw droppingly high at times, even on the \"easy\" setting.I am rating this game a 2/5 on the \"fun\" scale, and a 4/5 on the overall scale.  It is clearly a well made game, polished, with a quality controller, licensed music, and game play.  However, if a game isn't fun to PLAY, then I don't see the point to all of that.  And even on the \"easy\" setting, for me, the game just wasn't that much fun to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

Everything about this game is perfect. Artwork - Gorgeous, Cut Scenes - Awesome, Game Play - Perfect, Movement and Control - 100% Flawless, Music and Sound Effects - Inspiring, Story Line - Intriguing.I was very pleased in how character control was without imperfection. I never once found myself yelling MOVE! or having to get un-hung from some nook I got myself into or invisible object I got hung up on. I never found a spot where a jump just would not take right and I kept dying, or some move needed to be repeated 200 times before you finally got it to execute properly. When I made a command it was followed and executed per my intentions. Battles were sometimes very tough, but beatable especially after you master the controls and the many weapons and abilities. Save points were well placed, and hidden check points were also well placed except in one instance. Some scenes or areas were a bit too dark, and you would miss a chest with a Gorgeon Eye or Phoenix Feather if you did not relentlessly explore those dark areas and find the nooks, dark passages, and hallways. The story line is excellent with an ending that has to make even the most hardened gamer well up.In the end, GOW Ghost of Sparta is just hands down perfect, and a MUST BUY for any serious gamer who is into the slash and mash style games. Although the designers closed up some of the loop holes in the Krato's story line, in the end they left it open for yet another installment of GOW, and I say do not change ANYTHING and bring it!For now, if your considering this game, do not waste any more time doing the considering, and go buy this game, it is worth every cent.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}

The graphics for the day were top notch (and still well above average), the music is both ambient and engaging, and the gameplay is top notch.  There's a wide world to explore, epic bosses, a host of puzzles, and plenty of spare Missile Expansions and Energy Tanks for the completionist in you.Metroid Prime 2 had increased textures and graphical detail, and a wider world to explore.  Unfortunately it suffered from some linearity and sometimes very long backtracking  sequences forced on by the Light-Dark world mechanics.  Its difficulty was knocked up a notch or three (Boost Guardian, arg!  You'll know what I mean...)  But that said, it had some unusual bosses, some great locales, and a more than passable action-adventure experience behind the visor of Miss Aran.Metroid Prime 3 used the Wii's controls to expand on the shooting elements of the first two games, giving a push in the action genre.  But the graphics were improved from Prime 2 and new additions included ship control and stackable beam weapons.  Still it kept with the tradition of Primes before it and excelled, even if it was more straightforward than the others.Each of these games alone were worth $50 upon release, and I believe they're still good enough to warrant that price.  But packaged together in a single disk with a fancy case and updated controls makes this an absolute must-buy for the action-adventure gamer.  Speaking of updated controls:The Wii controls worked well in Prime 3, and implemented into 1 and 2 were still fine.  It was a bit awkward for me at first, but you get used to them.  I don't like the manner of selecting beam weapons or visors (holding the + and - buttons respectively and aiming the pointer over an icon surrounding the center) but that's about my only complaint.  Let me mention that I'm extremely glad Nintendo didn't implement the Wii's motion sensing into the Morph Ball controls (tilt the remote to move the ball) as it would have been extremely annoying.  But to cap this off: all three games alone were excellent.  This package is near perfection.As a note: There's a place near the end of Metroid Prime 2 where you use a beam to activate sonic locks to open doors.  It's done very few times, but if you ever open one of the locks, make sure you open them all before leaving the room.  There's one particular room (I don't remember what it's called) where if you leave after opening one of the locks, but not all, you'll come back to find them inoperable and the door closed.  If you save, you'll be permanently stuck.  This isn't a big problem: just make sure if you ever open any sonic lock, open every one in the room.Edited as of 9/23/09 upon my completion of MP1.  I learned through playing that you can lock on an enemy and hide behind cover, then angle the arm cannon out and fire homing weapons (like missiles or the Wave Beam) and they'll go around the cover and curve back on target.  This is especially useful against stationary turrets and is a neat trick few other control schemes can pull off.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2009"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

Mario goes to Isle Delfino for a vacation. An imposter Mario paints the island with graffiti. When people recognize Mario as the criminal, he is sentenced to cleaning the island, and cannot leave until it is cleansed of the filth. Mario is only given the FLUDD, a water cannon that shoots out water. Mario learns that the source of energy on Isle Delfino are these Shine Sprites.This game is very difficult, and builds on what Super Mario 64 made 6 years ago. This is the most unique Super Mario game released in his 20 year life span. The game has difficult controls, but grow on you. A Button is used to jump, B button is the Action button, Y is used for first person shooting of the water cannon, and X button is used for switching for water shooter, to hovering.In Super Mario Sunshine, shines are the equivilant of Super Mario 64's stars. You need to collect 120 shines throughout Isle Delfino.To every great game, they're always some flaws. Super Mario Sunshine is one of those games. There are only 8 worlds. The one that gets me so mad that I stop playing sometimes is the damn camera. If you have played Sonic Adventure 2: Battle, you know what I'm talking about. The camera is made for you to use, and not for the game to control itself. You have to use the L Button and C stick to control the camera. There are some levels that it gets so out of control, I feel like calling Nintendo's number and complain to stop production of Super Mario Sunshine, and do not put out another copy until they fix the camera. They is one level called Gelato Beach. You have to collect 8 red coins to beat the level. You have to climb a fence that you can punch to get to the other side of it, a la Super Mario World from Super Nintendo and Gameboy Advance. The camera gets stuck behind the fence, and you see water running down the wall, and the camera is trying to get behind Mario, and when you try to jump, the camera keeps moving to get behind Mario, and it makes it impossible to complete your tasks. After attempting to jump off a wall 10 to 20 times, it gets very frustrating. Sometimes, the camera gets in the way, that when you are behind a wall, the camera tries to get behind Mario, and the camera goes through the wall, and you can't see.Super Mario Sunshine is what I said before, for some, not for all. ...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"newfound32","summary":"Great game and Killer graphics.","reviewText":"Any gamer with an open mind will simply enjoy Kingdom Hearts. Disney or Square fans will absolutely fall in love with it! The game oozes quality everywhere. Awesome artwork and animation abounds. If only they could change the music though. If they would put on some decent music like Nirvana or something. The sound effects are flawless and most of the voiceovers are extremely authentic. It was a real treat to hear beloved Final Fantasy characters speak for the first time.The battles were never repetitive for me. Unlike most players I didn't have a problem with the controls at all...once I got a turbo-fire controller, that is. The camera was the only thing that needed improvement, I thought. Like most Squaresoft games there was a significant amount of tedious item gathering, but it wasn't as frustrating as in Final Fantasies 7-12. This is only a problem for those gamers who are perfectionists and have to utilize EVERY SINGLE THING in the game...like me.My personal favorite moment in Kingdom Hearts was finding Sephiroth for the first time and hearing his One Winged Angel theme music, the songs sounds cool I admit. It was too cool for words. Kingdom Hearts is another Squaresoft masterpiece. It's also something for Disney to be happy about. Based on Disney movies, make look pretty stupid to other people, but to true gamers.......a masterpiece. This is a definite must play game, you won't regret.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2004"}

But it does have it's flaws.One Critic said that Combat is just a bunch of Hack & Slash Action.  In truth you could play tha game this way (and use a lot of Health Potions early on) but what is great is that each of the 3 attack areas serves a great purpose.  Mellee Attacks(Swords & Axes) if you want to blaze a trail but do weak to medium damage most of the time, Long Range attacks (Bows & Crossbows) which do medium to large damage, or magic which ranges from Weak (Forcespell) to powerful (Enflame).The freedom to customize your guy is awsome (although no matter what you name him in the beggining they never say the name, your just Hero).  However the greatest factor is the Good/Evil Scale.  If your pure Evil you can grow horns and have crimson mist around you, however the villagers will run scared and the guards will constantly watch you. However if you are good They love you, in many cases they instantly fall in love with you, and the guards leave you alone.In fact the only flaw in the game is the targeting system needed a little more tweaking, and the story is too short.  If you play straight through the story you will beat it in a weekend.  However past that this is a definitive title to own on the Xbox.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2004"}

It was a great add-on and probably would have sold millions if not for two little problems: The $300 price tag and the fact that you couldn't use it without the then $150 Sega Genesis, sold separately. The Game Boy Player sells for about a half-a-Benjamin Franklin, requires no additional AC power plug, and can be secured tightly to the Gamecube's bottom with two metal screws.Worried that the analog in the shoulder-buttons might make L&amp;R actions a little slippery? Not a problem. You can assign the GBA's L&amp;R fuctions to the Y and X buttons on the Gamecube controller.Unfortunately for LAN (Local Area Network Fans), the manual states that connecting multiple GBP's together with link cables won't work. I haven't tested that theory, but I haven't known Nintendo to lie about these sorts of things. Luckilly, you can still plug other GBAs into the GBP via cables for multi-player fun. Remember, it's the game-link cable, not the GBA-to-GC cable.Unfortunately, the GBP does not seem to work with PS2 controllers connected through third-party adapters from Nyko or Innovation.Also, some games, such as Super Mario Advance 4: Super Mario Bros. 3 (confused yet?), allow rumbling.

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Nintendo's greatness shines again.","reviewText":"There are those occasions when a product comes out that is so good that any attempts at a sequel or prequel have such a high level of expectation that it is impossible for any attempt at expanding the story cannot ever live up to the expectations set by the original. In this case, The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time is a game that in 1998 won numerous game of the year awards, and redefined the 3D Action RPG. In short, many critics declared the game perfect.I was grateful for OOT because the N64 was such a huge disappointment over all that it really needed a game like that to make me not regret purchasing it. I agree with the critics, OOT was perfect in every way shape and form, considering the technology of the time. It was also the first game to incorporate facial expressions into real time graphics, a title that was the very definition of revolutionary, a game I still give 5 stars to whole heartedly, and the only game I have ever given a 100% score to. The game was simply that good.The game was followed by Majora's Mask, a game I enjoyed greatly, especially since it was so difficult compared to other Zelda titles. It wasn't as perfect or polished as OOT was, but it still garnered a 5 star rating and a 97% score from me.Now the GameCube's most controversial title has arrived. Controversial solely because of the games art direction. While I will agree that I would love to see the return of adult Link in a more realistic looking adventure I must say that for what Nintendo was trying to do they did a brilliant job. The goal of this game's art style was to make it look and feel like a Saturday morning cartoon, a feat that they accomplished brilliantly. Whether or not you approve of the art style, one must confess that for what it is, it looks, and animates brilliantly.The music is also light years BETTER than the cheesy MIDIs of OOT and Majora's Mask, the environments more clear, and the over world more vast, but unlike OOT, which for its time made full use of the technology available to it to become perfect, The Wind Waker does have a few minor shortcomings, Though I feel that the art style is not one of them.The shortcoming I found in this game is the lack of danger. While the game is still very fun to play it's not very difficult at all, and even bosses can be plowed through rather quickly once you figure out the key to fighting them. This is off set by some clever puzzles however. I just would like to have more complex battles, this game is about as difficult as Star Fox Adventures... you may die on occasion, but not nearly as often as you should in a truly challenging game.There are some fetch quests that also seem very tedious, thankfully shortened from the Japanese version, but this is offset by a very clever story that makes the game worth playing. Granted, its nothing on Final Fantasy scale, but its still epic in its own right, and as a fan of Saturday Morning Cartoons, I have a lot of fun even just watching this very well done game. It is truly a title that every GameCube owner should pick up, but sadly it does not live up to the perfection of OOT, I doubt anything will.I would definitely encourage playing this game, especially if you're a cartoon fan. Its one of the best GameCube games out there, but does not usurp Metroid Prime's title as Best GameCube game ever.Graphics 10: For what they were trying to do they accomplished it perfectly. The first good-looking cell-shaded video game.Sound Effects 7: This game needs voice acting! It needs it badly! The voice effects in here are largely grunts and screams and other minor effects like that. I like the music cued combos during fights, and the rest of the sound effects do their job well, but nothing truly spectacular... good voice overs would have raised this score to a ten.Music 8: Well composed well presented in brilliant Dolby Pro Logic 2. Still MIDI music, not as bad as OOT, but not as good as the music of say... Castlevania, Symphony of the Night, or Final Fantast X, or Metal Gear Solid 2.Game play 10: Nearly perfect, but not quite. There are not as many dungeons in this game as there were in OOT, which is disappointing, and for a seasoned Zelda fanatic like myself its a bit too easy in parts, but this is coming from a guy who won't play Blood Rayne without cheat codes turned on because I don't like loosing. But the reason I like RPGs is because with a few exceptions the difficulty of the game is totally dependant on how much effort the player puts into developing the character. For an RPG this game was just a wee bit too easy for me. That does not mean that game isn't good though!Replay value 10: Like with any Zelda game, great replay value. I imagine this game will likely be just as much fun to play to play ten years from now as the original NES Legend of Zelda remains today. There's even a second quest!Over all 96.2%","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2003"}

Mediocre minigame collections and unpolished 'family-friendly games' make it to the top sales charts so frequently, while quality titles such as Zack & Wiki and Okami don't get the attention they deserve. Wii Sports Resort ought to gather that same sort of ridicule, but while Nintendo may be a little lazy and big on quick cash-ins this generation, Wii Sports Resort doesn't fall prey to what kills those other minigame collections by utilizing the remarkably accurate Wii MotionPlus accessory and providing more of the simple fun that made the original Wii Sports so special, only in a bigger, better form.Wii Sports Resort is essentially a collection of sports-themed minigames, much like its predecessor, however the offering is much more plentiful and diverse this time around. There are twelve sports offered and each has at least two types of games available to play, so even within each sport there's a bit of diversity. For example, within Swordplay (one of the game's fortes) there is a Duel mode where players try to knock each other off a platform, Showdown mode which pits gamers against a horde or other Miis, and a Speed Slice mode which is a competition to cut an object in a particular way as quick as possible as a test of reflexes. The numbers and diversity is refreshing and enhances the game's overall value significantly.Each and every game in Wii Sports Resort makes use of the new Wii MotionPlus accessory, which comes packed in with the game. This is Wii Sports Resort's main draw: without it, the game would have been pointless. MotionPlus is a remarkable little piece of hardware that attaches to the bottom of the Wii remote and significantly enhances the accuracy of the game's motion controls. MotionPlus brings motion controls one step closer to being 1:1 with real life, which is especially evident in games like table tennis, which almost perfectly mimics your hand's motions, and archery, in which the remote becomes a bow that is aimed not by pointing at the screen, but by actually holding the remote like a bow. Other games such as basketball and air sports would have been complete duds without the MotionPlus accessory, but with it they are strong, solid minigames.Resort has a number of highlights, and I think it's only fair to mention a few of them in detail. Archery features some of the best control design by making the player hold the remote and aim it just like a bow, then using the nunchuk to draw the arrow and fire. It is remarkably accurate and goes much deeper than any shooting game that merely involves pointing at the screen. Table tennis (my personal favorite) is remarkably accurate in its translation of players' movements by allowing the player to put topspin or back spin on the ball. Frisbee is also very accurate, though sometimes a little frustrating. Despite the more memorable moments there are also several forgettable games as well, namely the predictably bad games of Canoeing and Cycling.Despite all the simple fun Wii Sports Resort offers, it gets old pretty quickly if one tries to go it alone for a long time. Collecting some of the game's stamps (achievements) adds a lot of solid bonus objectives, and achieving pro status can also be rewarding, but other than that the game runs itself dry on single player. The game was designed for multiplayer, and it sure offers plenty of fun in that area. Resort is a great game to pull out and play with a friend or family member, and whether or not they are a gamer doesn't matter much seeing as it's easy to pick up and play right off the bat. The only disadvantage is that to play multiplayer, an extra MotionPlus accessory is required. Some minigames that involve taking turns, such as bowling and archery, do allow for trading off one remote between up to four players, which is great for those who don't want to lay down another $10-$20 on accessories for their Wii.Presentation-wise, Resort has little to show and little to complain about. The menus are laid out very nicely, and transitioning between games is a breeze. The graphics are pretty colorful, but they look far too simplistic to appear vibrant or to even stand out. The sound design is equally simplistic, but the effects do a satisfactory job in conveying the actions they represent. So despite the sheer simplicity and lack of anything remotely impressive, Resort's presentation isn't worth complaining about because for a game that's designed around such fun and accurate gameplay, it just doesn't matter unless you play games for graphics only. If that's the case then you bought the wrong console.In the end, Wii Sports Resort is really all about the remarkably accurate and entertaining experience with MotionPlus. Much like the original Wii Sports was basically a demo of the Wii, Resort is a demo for MotionPlus, but it goes much farther than its predecessor did by being bigger, better, and just a little deeper. If you are a casual gamer and you have a Wii or are just looking for a solid and fun multiplayer experience, then be sure to buy this game in the near future. If you're a hardcore gamer you should appreciate everything MotionPlus does for the game and still be entertained by the simple but highly entertaining gameplay.Positive:+ Ample and diverse set of games+ Simple, accessible, and entertaining all around+ MotionPlus greatly enhances the game as a whole+ Solid multiplayer for all gamesNegative:- Several forgettable minigames- Lasting appeal is minimal with only one player7.8/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

Launching just a month before Uncharted: Drake's Fortune, R&K;: ToD had a lot to live up to and boy did it.  This game is a total blast to play and keeps the gameplay fresh and rewarding.  Despite being geared for ages 10+, the game can be easily enjoyed by gamers of all ages due to how well the content was handled.  If you love a good platform game, but also love to blow stuff up!  this is the perfect game for you!GAMEPLAYR&C;: ToD  doesn't stray much from the initial mold you are given early on.  Gameplay comes across much like the Final Fantasy games of later, where you follow linear progression with little in the way of exploration.  Upon completing the game or nearly being able to complete it, you can return to areas and explore for hidden items and areas.  Same rule applies here for the most part; except you can return to previous areas at any time.  Gameplay consists of navigating Ratchet and Clank throughout a level using platforming skills, and some pretty awesome weapons to reach the goal and progress the storyline.  Puzzles and platform segments are very creative in their use of the PS3's hardware.  Playing this in 2011 it doesn't seem too impressive these days, but for back in 2007 some of these segments clearly were designed to showcase what a Next Gen console could do; including using the six-axis for some segments (which I promptly disabled since it was extremely annoying to control)The shooting element can be handled via an Auto-Lock on feature which keeps the camera in a wide angle third person view,  simply firing randomly which also is third person, or by switching to a first person view and manually aiming.  All three methods have usefulness and it was nice to have the option of changing things up depending on the enemies you are fighting (or the weapon you are using).  Speaking of weapons, there are a massive amount!  Tools of Destruction indeed.  Either through storyline progression, or the collection of bolts, you will get more weapons.  Each weapon is unique and as you kill enemies you will get experience for the weapon.  Every weapon starts at level 1 and can go to level 5, where at level 5 it gains a new ability.  BOLTS are used to buy ammo and weapons, shards of Ore that you find will be used to upgrade your weapons along an upgrade tree. To manage all of your weapons and devices the game has a quick menu (very similar to Resistance / Resistance 3 but no surprise as Insomniac also did those games) which you can use R1 and L1 to flip through.The platforming segments are handled mostly by Ratchet, but occasionally you will get to use Clank.  When this happens an entire new world of abilities opens up making the two sets of platforming elements feel very unique.  The only real flaw in the gameplay is the game feels very linear. There is no real means for exploration unless you have the right weapon/device for it. Which means backtracking.  This can be done at any time during the game so long as you remember which world needed what device or weapon to access the locked off area.  OVERALL the gameplay is enjoyable and once you start playing you will want to keep going.  It is very satisfying to destroy an enemy, or stack of crates only to see tons of bolts burst onto the screen and the game.GRAPHICSFor 2007, this game was pushing some pretty nice graphics.  Lots of background activity, bolts filling your screen, weapon effects are awesome!  Even today I am very impressed with how this game looks.  Many of the early generation PS3 games had trouble balancing Graphics and Gameplay mechanics but R&C;: ToD did a fine job at this.  While it isn't the prettiest 720p game out there, it definitely looks next gen (in 2007 terms) and being geared for ages 10+, the cut-scenes looked great and very kid-friendly on the eyes.  The graphics engine was given a nice polishing job and it shows.STORY/SOUNDThe story starts off with Ratchet & Clank having to deal with an invasion force... soon finding out that this force is out to find the last Lombax(Ratchet).  Knowing this Ratchet escapes, and attempts to find a way to put an end to the reign of this cragmite emperor who plans to conquer the galaxy.  To make things even more crazy, the mysterious race called the Zoni show up with a strange affliction for helping Clank.  Overall it is a simple storyline that directs you from A to B to make you explore the planets, but it is thoroughly entertaining.  The subtle humor the game throws in will appeal to all ages, including a few cut-scenes that have some funny moments hidden in the background (such as pirates making snow angels).  The sound quality is exceptional, with high quality voice acting and weaponry that sounds awesome!  Every weapon feels and sounds unique.REPLAY/LENGTHThe game ran me around 10 hours with only doing some basic side tracking.  I could see this game being accomplished in 8 - 11 hours depending on how quick you move through the storyline.  This of course is not including all the extra features available.  Finding schematics, gold bolts, leviathan souls, upgrading all weapons and leveling them up.  There is even an arena to compete for bolts and prizes.  The game lacks any real difficulty setting and trophies, but it makes up for the trophy part by including \"Skill points\" which are given to you for accomplishing certain hidden feats in the game.  Using skill points you can purchase cheats, artwork, videos  etc.  Gold Bolts can be used to change your character's skin.  So on your first play-through there is plenty to go around that should keep you occupied for at least a good 15-17 hours.OVERALL 91% (9.1 / A-)For an early PS3 title that launched in 2007 this game is awesome!  There is plenty to do here that will greatly entertain the young gamers, while still entertaining older gamers.  The game changes up the mechanics in spots to avoid feeling dull including throwing in spaceship combat.  The only real negatives I have are that A) some weapons are downright pointless B) Lack of any real difficulty setting and C) Subtitles were not working properly it seemed.  They would work fine in game, but during certain cut-scenes the subtitles would not activate even on multiple reloads of that cut-scene. However, OVERALL this game no real serious flaws and transitions platforming, with shooting elements exceptionally well.  There is plenty to do here and you won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2011"}

That being said BO2 is a good game and being ranked #4 IMO is a job well done.CAMPAIGN: I only got about 3/4 thru but is my favorite of the series.  It's different, it makes sense, it plays like a dark movie, it doesn't have those long bs intros into each level that you can't bypass that all the COD's have had.  Only negative was the same jarring cut scene they'd show over and over as your plane lands as you complete each mission so lame why didn't they cut that ? Other than that, a fantastic campaign.ZOMBIES:  They look great, but I'm just not a Zombie guy cuz I need three other buddies that rule at Zombies just never got into it, but I did have a crew I ran with for a couple of games and I finally understood what the fun was all about, but I'm a lone wolf at COD, so if you love Zombies I'm sure you'll love this mode.MULTIPLAYER:  I liked the maps there is a huge variety, the updated graphics make a huge difference if you are a graphics whore like me.  You don't have a lot of weapons initially at your disposal tokens and ranking up have to unlock them.  Where is my M16 :)?  I think the best thing about the game that really stood out to me was the targeting system it just looks fantastic and feels satisfying when you get the kill.  I only dominated as usual in the only game mode I'm good at Domination and it felt great and satisfying because when your doing damage it's a blast game, but I think for me and the majority we all stink at the game lets be honest there arent that many GREAT COD players we all kinda stink lol. For example I played 30 games last night and there was only one player that I considered a really good player.  The kill streaks lose me they are better and better with each COD release, great if you have them and annoying if you don't cuz they are nearly all deadly, that's why I think hurts the game and what made MW so great, it was balanced.  You have 10 items you can select, perks, add ons etc, that's a great add to the game, you don't have to have a secondary and can double up on other items.  I did freeze or DISC about 5 out of 30 games that stunk but that will only improve and I'm not going to kill a review like many do because of opening day issues; it's COD it will get fixed.OVERALL & CONCLUSION:  A well made game, a nice package, the graphics are a big upgrade, some of the maps look much better than the others, like the LA map looked fantastic I thought.  A familiar COD other than the much better campaign, the menus are excellent, and I love the IDEA of Trent Reznor doing the music score.  However, he should have given us some classic NIN songs we could pull from as well.  The same menu composition gets old fast.  Remember that simple but perfect MW menu title sound that was perfect?  It called to you, \"please play me.\"  I'd give this game an 7/10, but for the package it offers I'll give it a 8/10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2012"}

Mafia from Illusion Softworks brings us back to that by gone era with some good graphics and decent albeit uneven gameplay.Mafia, tells the story of Tommy Angelo. A mobster who really just wants to do &quot;the right thing&quot;. As a story, Mafia works. The cutscenes are surprisingly photorealistic and are well acted and presented. Unfortunatley it's the gameplay between the story segments that partially drags the game down.Mafia can almost be described as a 1930's Grand Theft Auto. Only it doesn't quite pull it off as well. Set in the fictional Chicago/New York hybrid city of &quot;Lost Heaven&quot;, the game renders the period extremely well. The streets have that very old time look to them. Imagine New York before the &quot;urban renewel&quot; of the late 40's and early 50's. The city is also enormous in size. The game however didn't run very smoothely in places on my 800mhz, 256 SDRAM, 64 mb Nvidia graphics card machine even though it's recomended for machines as slow as 500 mhz. Even with the graphical problems. This is a very nice looking game. The sound is also pretty good. Pedestrians scream, bullet casings clang on the ground. Even the car radio plays period music. There are quite a bit of sounds that give it a more authentic period feel. The game is installed over three discs and requires 1.8 gigs of hard drive space to install.The gameplay is however is a mixed bag. The driving portions of the game are tedious, due to the lack of an in game map. Making it easy to get lost. A compass in the left hand corner helps with navigations, so does the radar to some degree (the target appears as a red X on the radar only when you're within about half a mile from it). You can also travel the city in street cars and on elevated trains. And there's always the option of traveling on foot. There are also a varitey of period weapons to choose from Tommy Guns to a baseball bat reminiscent of the film the Untouchables. The controls are fairly easy to negotiate even for a PC game. The game is also pretty long and also has a &quot;Free Ride&quot; option so you can go on a rampage if you so desire.All in all this is a pretty good game for the money. I'm not sure if I would pay the full Playstation 2 price for it. But at the current price PC of $9.99 this is a good value.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2004"}

LucasArts releasing an excellent Star Wars game?  Why yes it is!  A great action-adventure game!Jedi Outcast takes place about 10ish years after Return of the Jedi.  Kyle is a ex-jedi, a mercinary who travels the universe trying to make a living doing jobs for the New Republic.  One day, he is sent, along with his partner Jan Ors to a moon where it is believed that leftover imperials are hiding out.  There he will discover a secret that will change his life forever.Jedi Outcast begins as a 1rst person shooter, with Kyle (your charachter, duh) running around imperial bases for the first 5 levels shooting countless imperial stormtroopers with his trusty blaster rifle.  This is the games only bad point.  For the first 5 levels you have no lightsaber, only a few weapons and no force powers.  Unlike most video games, the first few levels of Jedi Outcast do a fairly poor job of sucking you into the game.  There are almost no really exciting moments for the first 5 levels (With the exception of your first encounter with the games super cool bad guy at the end of level 5).  Just non stop shooting and a few really difficult puzzles.  After you get your lightsaber however, things really start to take off and they dont stop.The gameplay in Jedi outcast is virtually perfect, jumping is easily accomplished, shooting with weapons is easy to do, and most important, the lightsaber controls are flawless.  Its easy to pick up how to do complex moves with a bare minimum of practice.The highlight of Jedi outcast is of course the lightsaber combat.  After getting all the fighting styles (Fast, medium, strong) and mastering them, you will be a virtually unstopable fighting machine, redifining the term \"Jedi Master\"  with little effort and some skill, you can hack off arms, hands, heads, torsos, legs and feet.  If lightsaber combat isint your thing, you can always use the amazingly sweet force powers.  Hate a certian stormtrooper?  Activate force speed and zoom behind him, pick him up in force grip and toss him off a catwalk to his death.  All within a few seconds.  Later in the game, you get to fight alongside allies, such as, believe it or not, Lando Calrissian (cool, Billy De Williams nailed the voice acting)  and even Luke skywalker! (Sadly this part is only for about a minute).  You will need all the help you can get, taking on literally thousands of stormtroopers (One thing about the stormtroopers, for the first time ever, you actually feel sorry for them when you carve them up or toss them off a ledge to thier deaths), Rodians, weequays, frustratingly annoying Grans, Dark Jedi soldiers, and the games super cool main villian,(who sounds like James Earl Jones in a way).  Another cool feature of Jedi Outcast is the voice acting.  Along with the excellent sound effects, you might find yourself sneaking through an air vent and hear a stormtrooper talking about how hard it is to see out of this (Bad word) helmet.  Or another time, you might hear one telling a friend that he took on 2 jedi at once and how easy they are to beat, seconds before you come in and tear them to shreds.Replay value for Jedi Outcast is literally off the charts.  Since thier is very little scripting among the bad guys, they fight differently every time, making it super fun to go through a level dozens of times.  Although I dont have internet connection, multiplayer is a really fun time, even with the Bots.  One of my favorite parts of the game is the cheats.  You get your standard god mode, all weapons, all force powers, etc.  But a new addition is the ability to spawn NPCs(NonPlayerCharachters) into the game.  Want to see if you can take on 50 stormtroopers, 20 reborns, or 10 of the main villian?  Its possible.  Want to spawn 10 landos and 30 lukes to help you through a level?  How about spawning an army of jedi and watch them hack through enimies as they follow you through a level?Overall, Jedi outcast is a very well done game.  It starts off slow at first, but it almost never lets down.The good:Superb graphics and gameplayfun cheat codes (Especially the NPC spawn)Excelent level design (for the most part)good storywickidly cool main bad guyExtremly cool lightsaber combatMore fun than a barrel of Womp RatsThe bad:You actually feel sorry for the stormtroopers as you slice them to picessome frustrating puzzlesthe game is boring untill you get your lightsaberThe bad:The gransthe stuck point on level 2 (hint, shoot something explosive through something)Summary:  It starts off slow, but once it starts, it dosent let up.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Niedducciano","summary":"An overall enjoyable experience","reviewText":"I just finished playing Killzone: Shadow Fall (KZSF) last night, and I have mixed feelings. On one hand, I really enjoyed the experience overall. On the other hand, I'm not 100% sure this game was worthy of a next generation console. So, I'll just list out the pros and cons. I don't know why, but that format seems to be working for me with regard to organizing my thoughts. I know that there are a lot of other reviews out there and they are normally written in a standard paragraph form, but I feel like when I am trying to decide whether or not I want to buy a game based off of a review, I just want them to tell me what was good and what was bad without a whole lot of fluff. So, that's what I'm doing.Graphics/Visuals:- Pros: There is no doubt that this game is eye candy. It is clearly obvious that the developers put in a lot of effort in creating a visually appealing game. It is also of note that this game deviates from previous games, artistically, in that there are a lot brighter colors, as well as more variety of colors. The game included the standard palate you would expect from the previous games, which is one of the things that visually created continuity in this installment of the franchise, but they infused a lot of brighter, happier colors in there, too. With a few exceptions, you don't walk away from a game session feeling like there is no hope on Vekta. This right here is what sets this game apart from other FPS games: the color palate.- Cons: Game developers still struggle to perfect mouth movement and syncing when a character is speaking. This was one of only two things, visually, that bothered me about this game. Every time someone was talking, I had to look away from the TV. It was horrible. The mouth movements didn't even seem to be attempting to match the words being spoken. The other thing that bothers me is that in both multiplayer and in the story, the colors are such that the bad guys are impossible to see without using your OWL.Story:- Pros: I love how they evolved the story from Killzone 3 (which, by the way, is the only other Killzone game I've played). In KZ3, you were a Vektan on Helgan fighting in an all-out war zone. Everywhere you went was part of the battlefield. There were no civilians, that I can remember. It felt like every Helgan citizen was in the military. With KZSF, you definitely found yourself in a war zone environment for a lot of it, but you also found yourself conducting at least half, if not a majority of your missions in and about the regular population of Vekta/New Halgan. I thought the new direction for this game was genius. This plot isn't necessarily anything new for FPS games, but I think it really helps round out the entire story when you take the entire series into consideration. It gives the Killzone universe and mythos depth and intrigue.- Cons: The ending left a lot to be desired in my opinion. I will try not to spoil the end for you, but to me it felt like they were just trying to add in some sort of plot twist for the sake of adding in a plot twist. That just doesn't work. It needs to feel natural. Honestly, I think game developers need to hire published and proven authors and novelists to write their stories, and then they need to get their own creative writing folks to work hand-in-hand with those authors to cater that story to a video game. Better yet, because games are becoming more and more cinematic, they should get screen writers to write the stories. Get the same folks who write for movies to write out the main story and then branch out from there.Game mechanics:- Pros: Some things about the game mechanics are directly related to the new direction in plot. For instance, even though melee attacks and, in particular, the knife attack has been a part of the Killzone mechanics in the past, this game offers the potential to conduct missions using stealth tactics instead of an all-out gun battle. Even though you're not presented with a decision wheel to pick a &#34;stealth&#34; or &#34;overt&#34; attack option, you are given the creative freedom, in most situations to intermingle stealth tactics with the more blatant gun fights. I also almost forgot to talk about the OWL. I love this thing. The OWL is probably my favorite tool in this game. You use it to see your enemies when you can't otherwise see them (i.e. through walls or behind cover), it can create a shield for you to block incoming bullets, it is a zip line, and it can stun or attack enemies depending on what you tell it to do. The OWL is also customizable in the campaign with downloadable skins.- Cons: I will say that stealth tactics aren't completely ironed out for this game. Even though the option technically exists, it felt darn near impossible to actually clear a room using stealth. At no point in my play-through was I able to clear an entire area undetected. That could just be a result of my skill level - which, admittedly, isn't that great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2013"}

Of course, that doesn't say much since platform games aren't truly the greatest games.  The graphics are very good, though a little garish.  The frustration level is not truly a problem.  The most important aspect is the openness of such a game.  You could move from the level to level with ease.  If you're stuck at one place, just move onto a different place.  The constraints of a standard platform game are absent.Basically, Jak and Daxter travel through different areas (beaches, volcanoes, caves, villages) and try to pick up power cells.  You can gain power cells through accomplishing many different task, from finding certain crates, destroying certain creatures, to mini-games, and on and on.  You travel by foot, travel in a sort of hover bike, or in one instance ride a small bird like creature.The controls are pretty intuitive, and the camera angles are right on.  You can't save at any point in the game, but the saving takes place in very frequent spots. .  This saves the user from repeating many jumps and actions.  Sometimes jumping is a little cheap and frustrating, but no one is asking for perfectionThe bad part is that it just is a platform game.  Even though the exploration part is nice, it's basically a series of jumps for most of the game.

It is highly addictive, I have noticed that as I get older fewer and fewer games keep my interest enough to continue playing. I need for them to be fun, but not so complicated that I have to devote hours to learning the story (I just don't have time). \"Inside Story\" is perfect it walks you through the game controls while introducing the story line.\"Inside Story\" allows you to play as Bowser on the top screen and the Mario/Luigi combination on the bottom screen.

Since then I have played almost all the Resident Evil titles on Playstation platforms. And finally tried Umbrella and Darkside chronicles.To those who don't know anything about this series, it is a mix of horror and action adventure (mostly adventure). Resident Evil: Umbrella Chronicles takes few particular scenarios from Resident Evil 1-3 and lets you experience them in totally different way. This game is a rail shooter (First Person Shooter with Wii mote) unlike the first three games. Below are some pros and cons of the game.PROS.- Wii mote works: First and foremost Wii mote works well for most part making this experience fun. With dualstick controller this game can be difficult and making it on Wii with Wii mote is just the right thing to do. It is quite enjoyable to shoot enemies in all different corners of the screen. Choosing different weapons is easy to do and using them to destroy enemies in varieties of the ways is just PRICELESS.-Bosses: Other than zombie humans and animals, I LOVE BOSSES in Resident Evil games. This game reanimates some of my favorite bosses from first three games and I tell you it is fun as hell fighting with them once again but in different style.-Features bonus episodes: While most of the scenarios are from games, it also has bonus episodes that were not in original games. Some of these are pretty good. Don't want to spoil much, but there are some AWESOME NEW BOSSES.-Can play as Wesker: This to me was awesome. While the voice actor for him is not as good as in RE 5, hearing different dialogues from him can be quite fun. Wesker has his own separate episodes which are not in the original game.-Different episodes, different characters: Most episodes allow you to play as two different characters and these two characters can vary from Jill, Chris, Barry, Rebecca etc. etc. each with their own unique melee attack.-Multiple paths in same episodes: You can go different different paths in some episodes which will introduce you to different environment and at times different enemies.- Two player mode can be fun.CONS.-Movements can be restrictive: You can only control where you aim and look, you CANNOT CONTROL WHERE YOU GO (other than alternate paths). A big con.- Graphics not so good: It is on Wii so I don't blame the developers.-Voice Acting is not so good: Unlike recent resident evil games (RE code veronica, RE 4 and 5), it does not have great dialogues, but none the less unlike many games they are not stupid either.All and all for Resident Evil fans, I would say they would certainly enjoy it. For others this game can be fun on EASY mode as it is a decent rail shooter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2010"}

Fallout 3, however, is my favorite by far. In my review of the game I will list the pros and the cons. Hopefully this review will be of use.Fallout 3: RPG, open world, gory action, leveling system.--Fallout 3 takes place in a post-apocalyptic Washington D.C--Pros:Graphics - The graphics in this game are among the best that I have ever seen in a game. Very realistic facial expressions in the characters, precise voicework and beautiful attention to detail are abundant in the game. No player should have any trouble with the graphics.Open World - Some people prefer following certain missions and going into certain areas to complete objectives. Some players prefer to explore a vast world and engage in all the little side missions and discover the locations all over the game. Fallout 3 has one of the most vast landscapes to explore currently presented in games. Over a hundred different locations to discover, not to mention downloadable content that nearly double its size. I've played the game for about a year or so and I still haven't completed everything the game has to offerControls - Quick and responsive controls make for precise and satisfying gameplay for both fans of shooter-games and for those who want to try them. You can also alternate between 1st person perspective (through the eyes of your character) and 3rd person (over the shoulder camera), which is a very nice touch for those who don't prefer 1st person.Tons of missions - As is the name of this pro, this game has SO MANY missions for the player to willfully rifle through. The player can start one mission, abandon it, and back to it months later and pick up where you left off. If I were to give the number of missions, I would say an approximate 50+ missions, including the main story. You can go from killing giant fire-spewing ants to huge mutated lizards with claws the size of a 5 year old child. Don't worry about tense story missions that ask your constant participation, you can go halfway through the story and decide you want to go off and save a town from insane looters.Unique Control Feature - Bethesda had introduced the new feature, called VATS (I forget what it stands for, something like something-automatic targeting system). VATS allows you to press a button (for Xbox it's RB) to freeze time and zoom in on your enemy, and then target specific parts of their body. This comes in handy for disarming enemies by shooting them in the arm, or reducing their accuracy by shooting them in the head. The use of VATS requires Action Points, which regenerate automatically over time after using VATS.Cons:Maturity rating - This game has most certainly earned its M for mature rating. This is by far the bloodiest game I have ever played, and I've played several bloody games. Seriously, you can shoot someone in the head, and if your gun (or melee weapon) packs a serious punch, it can make their head explode, quite realistically. Many players would probably prefer this, and I'm sure there are many who would avoid this. Another maturity in the game is the abundant (but not monotonous) cursing. You'll find many enemies calling you ego-bruising things, such as a f-ing sh-farm (I've been carefull not to include any nasty words in the review). No notable amounts of sexuality in the game, just some minor suggestive themes, nothing major. This con may be considered a pro by some viewers, but I figured it might as well be named a con.Glitches - Like any game, this game does indeed come with glitches. This is, as I've mentioned, a HUGE game, thus coming with some glitches. Nothing major, surprisingly, maybe an enemy getting stuck in the wall at some point, or silent character dialogue (when it should not be silent). The glitches in the game happen fairly rarely, nothing notable. Every game has them, and Bethesda did a very good job on making sure it's practically glitch-clean.This next one can be considered either a pro or a con. The game has a leveling system, which means, for new-to players, killing a certain amount of enemies, completing missions in order to earn experience (XP) to level up, hence increasing the power and durability of your character. When you do level up you, of course, get stronger and earn more health. Fallout 3 also has a unique feature when it comes to leveling up: you get to choose a new feature (called perks) for your character. For example, when you level, you can choose to increase your damage with certain weapons, or increase your run speed, reduce your damage intake, etc. Of course, the better perks are saved for later levels. Another unique feature about leveling up is the spending of ability points. These points, which are very different from the VATS action points, are used to increase your damage with explosives, increase your skill with hacking computers, picking locks or melee damage, etc. Note that these points can not be saved throughout the levels, you must spend all of them in order to continue (no frustration here, there are ample amounts of usefull abilities to spend them on).Well that ends my review of Bethesda's  Fallout 3. I hope this review has been helpful to you. All in all, I give this game 4 and three quarter stars in rating (the Amazon rating system wouldn't let me give it the three quarters), and strongly suggest it as something to consider if you're looking for an open-world level up shooter game. Again, please note the maturity rating previously discussed in the review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2010"}

Dotzler \"Kasaru\"","summary":"One of the best Vita games at the moment","reviewText":"For the record, I really loved Assassins Creed: Bloodlines for PSP. I think the same can be said about this game: A console quality game, on a handheld. And now, it can also be said, console quality graphics. They're amazing, and its the first thing that stands out. This game uses the same engine as its console counterpart, and it looks quite as stunning.Now, the sound is a quite a bit off, its... not all too good sound design. There's not really ambient noise, and for an open world game, that's a bit odd. The other thing is, the over use of very old and almost cliche sound effects. Other than that, I have no complaints regarding technicalities.Now, as for the story, I absolutely love it so far. The beginning was more than a little rocky, but once you got into it, it moved along nicely, and made you feel immersed. This is truly Assassins Creed as we all know and love, right in the palm of your hand. So, no real complaints there.The multiplayer, however (Yes, it has multiplayer, which wasn't exactly announced), is quite... different. It uses the location data and pits Assassins against Abstergo agents, where there is a VAST overpopulation of Assassins, and Abstergo agents only seem to appear in the middle east and west Asia...  Too much to explain, as I haven't delved deep enough, just know that Assassins Creed multiplayer is there, with a twist.Now, for the new features. the Vita uses the touch screen, back touch panel, GPS, camera, and motion sensors. I have yet to use the latter two. The touch screen is used for various things, such as selecting weapons and enemies in a certain mode. The menus and such can be used with touch, and with the physical controls, which I much prefer. The back touch panel is for similar usage. The GPS is used for multiplayer, as well as the \"near\" functionality.Also, if you have Assassins Creed III for PS3, if you connect the Vita to the PS3, then you can unlock certain bonuses for each game. I have yet to do this, as I have spent all the money I could on this game and NFS: Most Wanted. I'm a bit disappointed thought, that there was no Cross-Buy deal, but I guess I can understand; this and ACIII are entirely different games.To wrap it up, with the nice addition of the muliplayer and \"near\" functionalities, Assassins Creed III: Liberation makes good use of the PS Vita and is to date, one of the best Vita games on the market.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"GC \"GRC\"","summary":"The Best Single-Player Campaign Shooter... Possibly Ever.","reviewText":"To begin with, I have to point out how dated this game is. But even a few years old, four to be exact, it still passes the test of time. You're probably asking yourself, what makes this game so great?It's certainly not the graphics, not at this point. They're perhaps respectable but certainly not impressive anymore. It's basically everything besides the graphics, specifically the gameplay, storyline, strategy and flow.Why is the gameplay so great? Everything seems natural and has ideal flow. The controls feel intuitive, the weapons are explained quickly and their use is easy. The health system is far more fun than the Call of Duty system where you never die and never need health packs. The game isn't particularly difficult if you're good at shooters, but you'll still die a few times, no matter what. The atmosphere of every level carries a creepy note and some can be downright frightening. It will literally fill you with a sense of dread. The enemies look great, scary but not too far-fetched. Their AI is about right. They'll sometimes fall back but other times, reckless attack is their method.The variety of gameplay is also great. There are massive, open field battles in addition to the normal one-man hero style shooter mission. You can also drive/pilot several very original vehicles in the process. Being at the helm of a stalker is a true experience. The weapons are really innovative, specifically the Auger and Hailstorm. The sniper rifle is also well done. I also enjoyed using the shotgun, a classic even against futuristic alien-hybrids. But I do have a complaint here. The Auger can be very annoying when used against you because it can penetrate several walls and seemingly bounce into you randomly.What about the story? It's nothing new to the science fiction arena. Humans get infected with a virus, though during WWII in this case, and become alien-like creatures. The explanations given throughout the course of the story explain everything, including how it happened, how/why there are different types etc. However, the very best thing about the story is the narration. It's given by a female character you meet early on, and will really get you involved in the game. It made me care in a way few games ever do.Despite being a FPS, there is a bit of strategy in this game. Because health isn't usually hard to come by, there are often other practical considerations, specifically ammo. If you waste ammo, especially of the more powerful type, against weaker opponents, it will come back to bite you later on. You're also often better off killing enemies in a certain sequence a certain way that is counter-intuitive, e.g. going the harder route and being forced to kill more enemies but gaining more ammo in the process.Last but not least, the game has superb flow. The way missions are interchanged is excellent. Some are non-stop shooting while others will require you to do a bit of searching before you can move on. You'll also rarely face super-powerful opponents who magically kill you with one hit. Instead, you'll face a myriad of weaker, but still strongly freakish enemies. Something I really liked about this game was how the missions seemed to get gradually more difficult until the very end. There are only a few missions that will be super challenging. They're very late in the game and this is by design.One legitimate gripe is that the multi-player and co-op modes in this game are very run of the mill. They're nothing impressive. The manufacturer really tried to spice this up in the sequel but ended up ignoring the single-player campaigns in the process.Overall, this game is one of the best ever in terms of the single-player campaign. I've beaten it once and will play it again, after I'm done with Resistance 2. For around $25, this is a PS3 must have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2010"}

It is often impossible to hear what some npcs you directly talking to are saying, but the ones that are having semi-random conversations as you walk by overpower everything in the soundtrack.The Conclusion:I have yet to finish Mass Effect 3 (just started the Cerberus Assault mission) and I can say that the only reason that I have pushed myself this far is that I want to see how this series ends, but from what I have heard / read even that sounds to be a huge disappointment.Even for those that want to see how it ends I would wait for this to hit the bargain bins or at the very least pick it up used.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2012"}

Much like other Nintendo consoles, they're meant for party games and family. The Wii U is the game I would recommend to a gamer that likes fun, innovative controls, and doesn't mind a lack of start-up game variety. This console is still fairly new, and since it's had a bad start-up campaign, it's been catching a lot of crap from the videogame world. I like the Wii U. I think the controls are a great, new way to play videogames, just as the Wii before it. It brings you a whole new gaming experience with the dual screens on the controller and television, and uses both to create an innovative gaming experience. It's important to keep in mind, like with most Nintendo products, that if you're a serious gamer that wants to play hot titles like COD or other similar titles, the WiiU is not the console that you want. The WiiU is for a casual gamer, or someone who wants a console that is great for kids or parties.Again, my only problem with the system is that there are very, VERY few games worth playing on this console. But the games that are worth playing are wonderful and can give you hundreds of hours of game time (not to forget that you can now get classic titles on the WiiU Store).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2014"}

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Elton Lee","summary":"The Scariest Of Them All...........!!!!!","reviewText":"This remake is the scariest RE game I've ever played.....

Overall, after a day of playing, I feel this is a decent torchbearer despite some shortcomings. Here's my breakdown:-STORY- (5/5)As usual, the storyline is a masterpiece. I won't spoil it for you but the game puts you right into the story immediately that continues from the last installment.-GRAPHICS- (5/5)Absolutely incredible. Cinematics have details that look very real. Just a beautiful game throughout. Cortana looks great too!-SOUNDS- (5/5)Music - perfect. Sound effects - perfect. I even like the muted effects when I'm in space.-CAMPAIGN- (4/5)Love it but it's too easy! I completed the first four missions on Legendary and only died a few times. I didn't struggle nearly as much as I did with Reach or any previous halo. I usually play each halo in Normal mode first to try to enjoy the game in a casual setting first and then jump to Legendary for the second pass but Normal mode is really Easy mode. Other than the difficulty level being downgraded, the campaign gameplay is respectable and a lot of fun.-MULTIPLAYER- (4/5)Spartan Ops is OK but I miss firefight too. New multiplayer maps are decent, about the same caliber as Reach.-GAMEPLAY- (4/5)The new HUD is awesome and makes me feel like I'm actually wearing a helmet. It works really well! However, I don't like the weapon changes; for instance, the battle rifle doesn't \"feel\" right and the magnum is missing the snap. Although the controls are generally very good, I don't like that I can't customize my controller. I have a set of configuration choices but can't remap a button independently.-REPLAYABILITY- (5/5)I don't get sick of halo games, I just don't. It's like watching a great movie over and over again, there's always something new that I pick up that I didn't catch the first time (or tenth time).-AMEX BONUS- (5/5)Sure, syncing a credit card might not be for everyone but if you sync halo 4 with amex, you can get many passive rewards. I got $10 for syncing, got $50 back on $100 voucher at Best Buy by doing a Spartan Ops mission, and will get $25 credit on my card for completing the game in a few days.-RECOMMENDATION-This is an instant classic and a must-have for any FPS fan. It's not perfect but the developers didn't just roll out a mediocre game just to keep the brand moving along (e.g. Duke Nukem, COD, Madden). This is a fun game that I will be enjoying until the next halo is released.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2012"}

Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Interesting Story and Gameplay","reviewText":"An unusual relationship story mixed with a classic block-stacking puzzle game, \"Catherine\" draws players in with its bizarre art and narrative.\"Catherine\" is the story of Vincent, a 32-year-old man who has two major problems in his life. The first is his girlfriend Katherine, who is pushing for marriage despite Vincent feeling \"not ready\". This is compounded by the appearance of Catherine, a younger woman who seduces Vincent while he's drunk. The second problem is that, every night, Vincent is forced into a strange dream world - and if he dies in the dream, he dies in real life. The player controls Vincent through both his \"day\" (relationship) and \"night\" (dream) problems.The \"day\" portions of the game are mostly cutscenes, detailing Vincent's life, his relationships with his friends and both Katherine and Catherine, and his various tribulations. The player's \"control\" during these segments is limited to wandering around Vincent's favorite hangout, the Stray Sheep bar, and making decisions that influence Vincent's preference towards either Katherine or Catherine (represented as a karma meter oriented towards \"order\" or \"chaos\").The \"night\" portions of the game are, basically, the actual game. In his dreams, Vincent is forced to climb a tower of blocks until he can reach a safe point. The blocks are continually dropping out from under him, so Vincent must essentially form staircases by moving blocks in order to progress upwards. The blocks will hold in place if they are touching at least one edge to another block, so mastering these strange physics is key to progressing in the game. Various techniques exist to ascend the tower, ranging from making pyramids out of blocks to making a sort of \"swirling tornado\" of edge-connected blocks. As more levels are unlocked, new block types are discovered - crumbling blocks, trap blocks, ice blocks, and so on.The puzzle action is pretty fun; it sounds simple, but finding ways to progress involves quick thinking and fast reflexes due to the crumbling floor below you. The use of art and sound design helps to keep these segments sort of connected to the main story despite being radically different, so it all feels pretty cohesive. The biggest problem with the game as a whole is that, really, about half of it (i.e. the interesting parts) are cutscenes. Yet the gameplay, such as it is, is well executed, and the game's style is certainly unique. It's hard to recommend as a normal \"game\" because it's so unusual - it's not something where you can just be like \"this is a pretty good puzzle game\" and leave it at that.Overall, Catherine is an interesting game both in terms of its story and its gameplay. While those things rarely intersect, fans of one aspect may find themselves being drawn in by the other.We purchased this game with our own funds.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"motion controls and Zelda- do they work together?","reviewText":"First of all, I have something important to share with y'all.  The last Zelda game I played from beginning to end was Link to the Past and this was back in June of 1995.  This means, despite briefly playing a few segments from Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask a few years later, I actually went 17 YEARS without owning or completing another Zelda game!  Is that insane?  Yes!  You're probably wondering... why the long wait?  Sometime in the late 90's I really felt it was time to take an extended break after going strong with a video game obsession (arguably TOO strong) for 10 straight years.  What a long wait, haha.  I just HAD to give in to my temptations and play another Zelda game.  Too many years, too many sequels.  I figure that owning a Wii is pointless unless I have a collection of quality games to play.  Then... I read a couple articles and found out when Skyward Sword was going to be releasd (in November of last year) and the rest is history.  Anyway, after Twilight Princess, it took 5 years for Skyward Sword to be released and the million dollar question is, was it worth the wait?  Simply put, yes.  Probably not a confident or resounding \"YES, it was worth it!\" but just... a yes.  Let's break down several crucial elements of the game.The motion controls.  This is the number one reason many gamers have been divided with mixed feelings.  Some people admire them, others... not so much.  My impression so far is this- the general longtime Zelda fan dislikes the motion controls because they'd rather have the traditional way they've grown accustomed to, wherea non-serious gamers (or those who haven't been following Zelda for 25 years, such as myself) admire the motion controls and believe they're innovative.  I admit, at first I wasn't sold on the controls.  My initial feelings were that the controls were designed to mess with players concerning every single obstacle in the game (which isn't true).  In fact you can say I was downright irritated with the controls.  However as I played through a couple dungeons, I began to realize that swinging the Wii remote around and pretending it's a sword *is* actually a pretty cool idea.  Not only a cool idea, but the right evolution for the Zelda series.  How many generic sword-fighting games have there been on the market over the years?  It's only appropriate that one of the original sword swingers in Link is responsible for such a radically different gameplay change.Not only are these motion controls a \"pretty cool\" idea, now it's going to be difficult for me to go back to *not* swinging the remote around.  The most astonishing thing is that Nintendo made several of the enemies and puzzles so that you HAVE to be precise with your aim and yet it's hardly ever irritating to execute... with a few exceptions that I'll mention below.  If for example, an enemy is holding a sword above their head, this means you can't swing up to down because they'll block it.  You CAN swing down to up however (or swing from the opposite direction, depending how the enemy protects itself).  Precision!  The skeleton mini bosses you encounter later on are notable here.  They frequently alternate the position of their sword used to block/protect their body parts, testing your sword-swinging skills in the process.  If they block one of your swings, simply move out of their way and they won't retaliate.  Alright if you're standing too close to them after they block... they'll probably retaliate THEN (a couple seconds later).  The good news is that moves are almost always blocked in a way that actually allows time on your part to react accordingly, so you never feel like the game is being cheap or overaggressive.  So even if you were to attack an area of an enemy that's protecting itself, they won't respond immediately with a cheapshot.  They'll wait a couple seconds like I mention above.  Nintendo definitely realized how frustrating it would have been if enemies and bosses did attack without delay.  What may SEEM cheap or unfair initially is usually a result of not knowing how to tackle an enemy.  Basically, there's a fairly strong learning curve present that never really lets up, and enemy movements stall to allow the player enough time to figure these movements out for themselves.  Later on however, when you're required to be at a certain skill level, enemies (especially bosses) DO become more violent and aggressive.  Still, nothing overbearing that you can't handle with practice.Some people -actually MOST people- dislike Link's swimming movements.  It's actually not that hard after 30 minutes of practice.  You have to tilt the remote up, down, left or right and Link will swim in that direction.  If you feel he moves too slow, well, luckily the game designers understood how slow underwater movements can be, which is why they added a spin move ability that can temporarily boost speed.  The spin has a few other advantages that you'll discover soon enough (such as being able to leap out of water completely and land on platforms unreachable by simply floating to the surface and trying to climb out).  Now that I'm going through the game again, I can swim WAY more accurately this time.  At first my problem was that I couldn't get out of the water and attach to the vines on the wall (that appear in quite a few spots) but now I can't believe I even HAD that problem since my skills have improved so much.  Also, another complaint is your Loftwing- a flying red bird that Link rides on top of and uses as transportation as he travels through the sky.  You'll need a bird ride the entire way through the game.  Just about everyone agrees that the bird moves WAY too slow and since you're riding the bird frequently (at least 100-150 times total) it takes forever just to get from point A to point B.  It's true.  I can't deny it!  However there's ways you can temporarily increase speed with two different types of speed boosts- one of them by hitting the A button and your bird will pick up speed even though the increase is honestly ineffective and barely noticeable, but a much BETTER way is to find these rock structures high in the air that you can fly through.  These REALLY make you fly faster.  You'll know when you see one because it has a clear circle in the middle of it.  Always try to fly through these.Oh and on another note, I initially had NO idea what I was supposed to do at the map screen with the beacons.  I didn't understand the entire concept.  You place beacons on the map to indicate where you want (or need) to go.  Beacons give off a faint blue funnel of light in the sky exactly where you set them on the map.  It's just amazing that you can actually set these beacons at specific points to indicate where your destination is.  To me this is a thing of genius and makes searching for crucial items a LOT easier!  The perfect solution to a HUGE and often times confusing 3D game!  The problem is that the blue light is SO faint, that many times you have to be close to the beacon just to see it.  Perhaps Nintendo was going for realism here with the clouds blowing by and blocking your vision for a a short time, who knows.  I'd say *most* of the time you can see the blue light.  Every once in a while though, the dust particles and clouds make it hard to see the beacon light.I STRONGLY disagree with the many complaints I've read that the characters occupying the land of Skyloft have little to no personality.  Really?  I think they completely smear the townspeople from Link to the Past and I LOVE that classic game so I'm by no means criticizing it.  Most everyone at the store in Skyloft (the main area where you'll be spending most of your time and where you buy your items and equipment) are memorable- the depressed/downbeat Item Check woman who totally reminds me of several women that I've met in real life who are bored to tears by their routine job, the \"boisterous when you're standing across his counter/easily disappointed the moment you walk away\" man who sells shields, bombs, arrows and slingshot bags (and who has a hidden angry side to his demeanor) the huge-eyed fortune teller that gives me the creeps the way his eyes can gaze into your soul, the woman and her husband stirring potion with a screaming baby riding the husbands back, the ADORABLE Kina (wouldn't you like her as a girlfriend?) the sarcastic/ignorant robot named Scrapper you meet later who LOVES to get under your skin and insult Link at every opportunity, and... here's the REALLY interesting part.  You can actually sleep in beds scattered around peoples homes and make it nighttime, which means you can go to the homes of these people, have conversations with them and find out what they're REALLY like.  More often than not, this results in many errands and side quests.I admit when I first explored the town at night, I was totally caught up in the atmosphere of evil cats and blue blobs coming out of the ground, and the scenery feels so much like a beach setting with the wind blowing everything around.  Other times, such as when you visit a place called Lumpy Pumpkin, you can stare into the night sky and feel complete peace like you're in outer space.  It reminds me of the loneliness associated with being alone somewhere far away in the galaxy, or a dream-like state.  It's wonderful.  All criticisms about the game having frequent graphical glitches (I played through the entire game and encountered none- then again I grew up from the NES generation so I've learned to ignore them) or lackluster townspeople, or the fact that you still have to read several chapters of dialogue as opposed to hearing characters actually speak are all greatly exaggerated.  These supposed complaints are not only tolerable, but forgiveable.  I think Zelda fans set their expectations too high concerning advancements that may or may not have been true, and were simply let down with the final product.  Since I haven't been following the Zelda series all these years, it's very easy for me to overlook these \"faults\".  Then again knowing Nintendo, they probably led people into thinking Skyward Sword *would* have all these features only to end up removing them at the last minute.  I wouldn't be surprised.Speaking of the bosses, I've heard many complaints that they all have a similar weak point- that being, an eye.  An eye that sometimes takes forever to open up and reveal itself by way of having to attack other areas of the body for an extended period of time, or an eye that is just cleverly hidden and you have to search for it.  Maybe I'd complain if it wasn't so much fun slashing at the eye giving the player a feeling of accomplishment when it finally opens up.  Not only that, but finding it and letting loose with sword combos produces an awesome jolt of electricity through my veins!  Now I admit I'm actually TERRIBLE at combos in this game (and most games for that matter).  I've seen the video walkthroughs of gamers and they can blaze through enemy-infested areas by simply swinging the remote a certain way and destroying everything with a few nifty sword combos and make Link appear to be a walking path of destruction, but unfortunately all my attempts at combos leave me swinging the remote like a madman and missing my targets, haha.Let's focus on the dungeons.  Most of them are very good.  As usual, they start off short and fairly easy and gradually get tougher.  At least in this game almost ALL the dungeons have identity and beautiful eye candy backgrounds to admire.  In the first dungeon for example (Skyview Temple) you eventually arrive to the middle part with a really high structure in the middle of the room, and the atmosphere here can best be described as peaceful and dreamy.  It's quite unusual and I absolutely love it.  It doesn't really give off a sense of danger with a boss fight coming up soon, however.  More like a temporary feeling of tranquility, or a brief moment of relaxation.  The dungeons continue with several distinctive designs (especially Ancient Cistern with a perfect blend of water, lily pads, vines and my favorite, the blue rocks in the underground section) until perhaps the final dungeon of the game (called Sky Keep) which is definitely NOT disappointing from a challenge or obstacle-driven point of view, but lacks atmosphere because it simply repeats what's already been done throughout the game.  Not a fan of the final dungeon as a result.  Plus the slide puzzle is... ugh!  You have to operate a slide puzzle that consists of panels and you have to move them a certain way to open the next section of the castle.  It's confusing and truthfully, I had to resort to a guide to figure it out.  There's several possibilities to the puzzle but I couldn't find any of the right ones.The reason I'm taking off one point from the overall final rating is... well, 3 reasons. The first reason is Fi.  Fi is a female spirit that FREQUENTLY pops up and tells Link what to do and where to go throughout the *entire* quest.  However her assistance is a little overbearing and unnecessary to say the least.  Now for people like me who struggle at games, I didn't mind Fi nearly as much as those who already know what to do given their quick thinking or video game-minded abilities to easily comprehend obstacles (or the fact they've been following the Zelda series all along and therefore understand exactly how the obstacles are normally presented).  I can totally see why hardcore Zelda followers would strongly dislike Fi.  The other reason I can't give Skyward Sword a 5-star rating is because the cutscenes are plentiful and sometimes last 10 minutes at a time.  People are not exaggerating when they say it takes at least 90 minutes for the actual gameplay to get underway in the beginning.  This stuff really only serves a purpose for storyline progression (very little of it impactful, in fact) but it's cliched, uninteresting and takes WAY too long to sit through (or stand through, hehe).  Other than a few segments here and there, most of the beginning focuses on your Loftwing (flying bird), how to control him (which is useful information I admit, though actually not descriptive enough so you might get confused with the instructions), competing in a little bird race in the skies, diving off buildings (or rather, being shoved!), LOUSY and cliched interaction between Link and Zelda (and her father) that you've probably heard in several other fairy tale stories, Fi introducting herself, several townspeople stopping to have a chat with Link, etc.  All this adds up to 90 minutes of unnecessary dialogue scrolling and it *is* overbearing.However the one complaint that people don't seem to have that I most certainly do lies in the dungeons and how they were designed.  They're memorable, don't get me wrong.  They have atmosphere, they have challenge, and they're even extremely fun most of the time.  It's the fact they're always ALWAYS so puzzle-oriented.  It really seems like *every single room* is a new puzzle.  Now my definition of \"puzzle\" is simply \"Something that stands in the way of progression\".  This means having to use your items (and your brain) to make your way forward.  However SO much attention was given to the layout that if you think you can just blow through the game bombing walls, shooting arrows and lighting candles like you did in the 2D games and that will easily solve your problems, you're in for a rude awakening!  Be alert- REALLY alert.  Look at your surroundings VERY carefully and several times over.  It's quite often difficult to figure out which item to use whenever it appears you've reached a dead end.  Not only a matter of which item, but trickiness in HOW to use them.  Tricky design that's both a blessing (because it's admirable and clever and makes you think \"Ah, THAT'S how you access the next room\") and a curse (because it takes away from the adventurous theme Zelda has been known for and sometimes leaves you stumped for hours, and being stuck in one spot quickly makes ANY game less fun).  In relation to the plethora of puzzles are the tasks throughout the game.  I'm not necessarily referring to the townspeople and the type of favors they ask out of the player (even though they're the source of most of the tasks) but just the fact the way the game is designed.  \"You do this, now go over there and do that... now come back and do this... now make your way to this island and do THAT!\" etc.  It can be anything from Fi asking you to go somewhere, to searching for and chatting with an important person anywhere across the lands, to... who knows.  Even the dungeons themselves are guilty of needless tasks.  A task-oriented game which ends up distracting the player from simply having *fun*.  You have to REALLY be into the storyline to not care or notice any of these needless distractions, and you have to be willing to forgive Nintendo for making exploration a thing of the past.  Plus you need to be a quick puzzle solver or frustration will kick in sooner rather than later.The items are pretty good though.  You already know about the bow & arrow and bombs- two trademark Zelda items.  Embarrassingly, there was a VERY lengthy learning curve for me in picking up, tossing, rolling and collecting the bombs.  Boy 3D movements can be tricky at times!  For several HOURS I kept hitting the wrong button and blowing myself up, LOL!  To be fair, sometimes the bombs don't toss the way they should.  You're supposed to flick the remote and sometimes the game doesn't know which command you're going for and therefore it gets stuck, which means Link holds onto the bomb and goes boom boom!  When the bomb doesn't flick and is ready to blow, your instinct is to hit a button in frustation... probably the same button that sets the bomb on the ground in front of you and yeah... boom boom, lol.  I look back and laugh now but it wasn't funny while learning!  The slingshot is good but you never need it again after the halfway point of the game so there's no point in upgrading it.  The mechanical beetle is a VERY useful item- you can launch it into the sky and discover new areas and items that are unreachable for Link by himself, or in my case, you can use the beetle to explore all around and get a sneak peek at what's ahead.  The clawshot is awesome- you can grip specific targets but unfortunately you can't use it as a weapon on enemies.  Darn!  Remember peahats?  They were floating enemies from the original Legend of Zelda that could be found in the overworld.  Sort of annoying and pesky in that game, but purposeful here.  Now you can actually use the clawshot to grip onto them to reach higher, distant platforms.  Some peahats even float directly upwards.  VERY creative and useful.Oh and the bug catching net is REALLY realistic given the motion controls.  You have to literally sneak up slowly with the net hanging out so the bugs (or birds) don't suspect that anything is odd with their surroundings, which could startle them and cause them to fly away.  Yeah it's pretty realistic.  You can't just swing the bug net wildly like I was and expect the bugs to willingly fly into your net, lol!  Patience and persistence is needed here.  Still, it's not hard after a while.  There's even an optional bug catching mini game later on that will test your skills.  You can upgrade a bigger net just like you can upgrade most weapons for better results.  Bugs are also used to make stronger potions.  You can actually upgrade potions so they have TWO servings, which means -with 5 bottles- you can fill your life meter a grand total of 10 times!  And hey, you just might NEED 10 servings against the final boss fight too!  Oh boy is he not only intimidating, but VERY tough!  His name is Demise.  How appropriate!The mini games are probably a weak point but it's easy for me to dismiss them.  The clown game at Fun Fun Island STINKS!  You have to use the motion controls to dive through 5 rings without missing a single one *and* land on a specific space below, and that's how you get a piece of heart for your heart container (in case you don't know, 4 heart pieces complete the heart so your life meter extends just like in the older games).  This particular mini game is, simply put, a *nightmare*.  And the clown has the nerve to insult you whenever you lose and sometimes even talks down to you like a crybaby.  UGH!  The mine cart mini game (which isn't a mini game at first- you have to come back later) is another difficult one because you're required to tilt the remote to either pick up speed or slow down at specific points.  You HAVE to do it the right way or you'll either fly off or lose considerable speed!  These are timed races so memorizing the track and being nearly perfect is VERY important.  These are the two most difficult challenges in the game, no doubt about it.  Neither one is a requirement though.  The only required challenging mini game that you HAVE to complete is when your Loftwing is in the process of learning an important attack spin for a boss fight, and you have to destroy 10 targets in 2 minutes in order to be granted the spin move.  Perfect accuracy is a requirement, but memorizing where the targets are makes things a lot easier.Also, you will occasionally come across these huge blocks called Goddess Cubes in the lands below.  Smacking one with a specific upward sword strike activates the treasure chests located on the tiny islands up in the sky that you reach with the Loftwing.  Luckily the map indicates which islands and treasure chests have been activated (with a purple chest symbol) otherwise you'd be flying around forever trying to find them!  It's probably a good idea to search for these islands/treasure chests after hitting a few Goddess Cubes so you aren't wandering from island to island *too* many times.  Not that there's consequences if you don't open them as soon as they're available- but the treasure chests up there contain some pretty useful things.  Plus these specific treasure chests seem to follow along with the game so waiting too long to open them might eventually make them irrelevant.  Also, you do NOT need to farm for rupees in this game!  Skyward Sword is very generous with rupees whether it be because you will often find chests and secrets that contain anywhere from 100-300 rupees, or because you can collect numerous items that can be traded at a certain store for up to 1,000 rupees... yeah, very generous.  It's not like the Skyloft store charges outrageous prices for items, potions and upgrades either.In fact, get this- I recommend just *ignoring* green rupees completely.  They're pointless.  Pretend they're not even there!  Go for the blue and red rupees (worth 5 and 20 respectively).  You can even sell some of the collectible items (either found inside chests or from enemy drops) such as the ever popular Amber Relics and the mightiest item of all (Goddess Plumes) to a man downtown who honestly gives you WAY more rupees than he should.  I realize you should be rewarded for collecting them, but each Amber Relic is worth 30 rupees and the Goddess Plume is worth 100.  That's a LOT, trust me!  It really feels like green rupees don't even have a purpose in the game.  Maybe they're becoming meaningless or outdated?  Speaking of pointless things, get THIS!  You don't even need your shield the entire time.  Alright maybe the first battle with the skeleton pirate that goes by the name Scervo requires a shield in order to block some of his sword swipes (in fact you *do* for round 3) but other than that?  You don't need a shield anywhere else in the game.  To me this is *very* shocking.  It just goes to show that the shield is apparently optional in Zelda games.  At least in the 3 games I've played from beginning to end.  Not even anytime during the final dungeon or the boss fights at the end of the game.  Update- it turns out in Hero Mode you DO need a shield for Demise because he takes away 4 hearts from a certain dangerous charge attack, and you will need to block that.  Also, since I brought up Hero Mode, it's supposed to be an additional challenge after you complete the regular game since no hearts are present anywhere (until you find the Heart Medal that is) so I recommend having a healthy collection of Blessed Butterflys, Woodland Beetles, Volcanic Ladybugs, Sand Cicadas, Eldin Rollers and Deku Hornets before taking on Demise at the end of the original (first) adventure so all challenges in the beginning of Hero Mode are easier to deal with.As you've probably read about, there's only 3 areas that you can explore.  The green grassy lands of Faron Woods, the lava-covered volcano world of Eldin Volcano, and the desert and secluded areas of Lanyru Desert.  However it's important to note that there's *several* areas to these 3 worlds.  They're most definitely not short.  You can't blaze through them.  Faron Woods, Eldin Volcano and Lanyru Desert open and reveal more as the game goes on.  Yes you will be repeating over the areas you already explored more often than not in order to GET to the new areas, but since there's always something new to discover, it's really not a chore.  Oh... the stamina meter.  That DARN thing!  Link can run for a certain (limited) period of time.  If you make Link run for too long, he'll run out of steam (as evident by an irritating beeping sound).  However it's important to stop running RIGHT before the meter runs out *completely* otherwise Link will tire out and stagger around for a few seconds until he returns to normal.  You do NOT want to find yourself out of breath when surrounded by enemies and with a few hearts remaining, so keep an eye on that meter.  Yes I hate it too.  It will *constantly* be annoying as you eagerly want to run nonstop across a lengthy hallway only to be forced to slow down and stop thanks to the stamina meter running low.  Also maybe it's just me, but the temporary stamina boosts you occasionally stumble across (especially in Skyloft) always seem to be sitting in inconvenient places where I'm required to veer to the side to grab them, and oh, if this happens to be your first 3D Zelda game, expect to miss items constantly.  Since it's 3D, there's a tendency to run circles around an item a few times before actually picking it up.  It's fairly annoying but you can't really help it- being off a bit and finding yourself in a situation where you're missing items is just the nature of 3D gaming.  Not a major problem of course, and you'll adjust with practice and time.As far as enemies, well truth be told several areas of the land are empty in that regard.  Even fairly large portions in a few cases.  Not really unacceptable since there's usually atmosphere and beautiful graphics serving as a replacement.  Both the overworld and dungeons feature significantly less enemies than say, the older 2D Zelda games.  The only enemy encountered frequently (besides bats and bokoblins which can be dismissed as being non-threatening) also happens to be the most irritating of the bunch- these blobs (called chuchus) that suddenly come out of the ground as you're walking or running by.  They always happen to pop out of the ground RIGHT when you're a few steps in front of them and catching you completely by surprise, which means you'll be shaking the nunchuk/remote constantly to shove them off (because they love to squeeze Link's body!).  The ones that give off an electrical charge are the worst- your immediate instinct after being attacked is to swing your sword and retaliate however... the game desigers were apparently aware of this which means the moment you shake one away, they will electrify RIGHT as you're swinging the sword which means you'll get shocked and lose another heart.  Yes, VERY annoying.  Another popular enemy is called deku baba which are the blue and yellow plants that are mostly found in the grassy parts or the hilltops.  They take full advantage of the motion controls.  In fact they're one of the very first enemies you run into.  It's actually sort of important to perfect your swings against these guys- when they open their mouths a certain way, you have to swing the remote in that direction and trust me, you have to be accurate or they'll quickly close their mouths and block the shot.  I recommend practicing on these guys for a while and getting comfortable with their movements because they indicate more demanding sword swinging precision up ahead.I could nag about a few minor things such as the fact you have to repeat a boss battle with an enemy that goes by the name the Imprisoned up to 3 times, but those battles are short and there's a trick in making them MUCH easier (hint, whirlwinds).  Oh, and the harp can be a pain to play in a few isolated places (such as the lady in Sealed Grounds who teaches Link how to play it- she's very demanding and expects perfection out of the player) but the good news is that nobody else in the game expects perfection when it's time to play the harp again.  Basically you play the harp like this- hold down the A button, and wave the remote back and forth with the rhythm of the music.  It's not quite as easy as it sounds, and for whatever reason the notes frequently get jumbled, but how the notes are organized doesn't seem to matter at all- simply waving the remote correctly is where it counts.  I also DESPISE walking across tightropes.  Even worse some tightropes have bombs attached to the side or underneath the rope itself, which means when you're cautiously walking across and one explodes, you'll fall and have to climb back up and attempt to walk across again.  The problem is that walking across tightropes is easier said than done- you have to *really* tilt the remote from left to right (or right to left depending which side Link is leaning) in order to stay balanced.  The good news is that when you fall, Link will hold onto the rope with his hands and you can climb across by hanging (with the exception of bomb explosions that immediately knock Link off) or just hit Up on the analog stick to continue walking across the rope.  And when you fall off a rope or platform, you don't actually lose any hearts (unless it's REALLY high).  Oh and whenever you fall into a bottomless pit, the game is normally generous enough to bring you back close to where you fell.  Sometimes they're *too* generous and take you to where you need to be, lol.Oh wait, I just remembered!  BIG complaint coming!  The boat rides.  They are flat out boring and undeveloped.  The boat is only there so you can reach your next destination island and in one example, used to locate a ghost ship and fire cannonballs at it.  The developers *definitely* should have added more here.  These boat rides are only a few minutes long and the surrounding enemies are never really a threat, if at all.  Why bother throwing in a boat segment to the game if it feels incomplete?  Oh well, the boat rides are only 3-5 minutes total and it's over and done with, but still, more excitement should have occurred because the way it is, it feels like it's missing something.  I don't know, maybe the ability to go fishing or collect items on top of the water as you drive by or better yet, compete in a mini game or speed race where you can perfect your skills dodging several of the tiny islands in the middle of the water.  *Something* more should have been added.  Simply picking up speed and slowing down your boat isn't interesting enough.Let's see, what else can I mention.  You start the game with 6 hearts instead of 3 and I imagine the reason is that Nintendo figured people would struggle with the motion controls so they chose to give the player 6 hearts right out of the gate.  Hey I'm not complaining- there were several times when I *needed* those extra hearts!  The heart container pieces are sometimes cleverly hidden but more often than not, it's obvious where they are.  Hey, Link to the Past was guilty of obvious to spot heart pieces as well but that game's still -and forever will be- awesome to the max.  You can collect these items called gratitute crystals for helping people around town with chores and errands.  Some of these crystals can even be found scattered around town (only at night though).  80 might seem like a lot, but there's several instances where you get 5 at a time, so 80 isn't really much.  The ones you find around town are worth 1, but the chores and errands are worth 5.  Gratitude crystals are simply a way to expand the story and further develop the characters, and nothing more.  Innocent fun basically.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2012"}

If you have never played any Metal Gear game, You WILL be confused by the story. Metal Gear solid is notoriously known for complex story lines. I highly recommend playing the previous games or researching the story before playing it.Otherwise, This game allows a broad spectrum of choices for the player. You can choose which route to take on a map, Stealth or no stealth, which weapon is most effective, etc. The re-playability lies heavily on the ability. When you think there's only one way to get through a level, you talk to your friends and find out they did something completely different.The boss fights are unique in this same way. Boss fights have never been so tense and exciting.The online beta is decent. Key word there: Beta. It's not COD 4. It's not supposed to be. Get over it.If you're looking for faults, I only wish you could play as Raiden. There's some crazy martial arts cutscenes with him and it would be great if the developers could have made a portion (no matter how small) playable.

{"product_name":"B004CD9X2C","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr.Chunky Monkey","summary":"A Competent Game Which Could Have Been Better With More Polish","reviewText":"Alice: Madness Returns is an unusual game that you will either love or hate. As is the case with many games, the first three or four levels are really well done and impressive. It kind of starts to become less interesting afterwards. Spicy Horse, the developer behind the game seems to have tried to make a variety of very different levels that would appear like visiting a different world every time. The good thing is some of them turned out really well. The \"happy\" part of not yet corrupted wonderland looked great, the Queen's Castle has a lot of meticulous detail, the under sea world with the sailor and the walrus they look great. In fact for the first half of the game, this game has a relatively humorous tone. The game cleverly goes back and forth to and from the real world and The Wonderland. The environment and the characters in the real world create some of the most depressing imagery of the 19th century industrializing England you can imagine. This is not a Dickens Fair or Baker St. From Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes Adventures. The humans resemble evil trolls, the brick walls are dirty, there are beggars, and beaten prostitutes on the street. It can be unsettling. Once the player sees the wonderland it shows a big contrast to the \"real\" world. But of course, without spoiling the game, not all is well in Wonderland.As I reached further levels deeper into the game I was disappointed to see rather poorly made areas. It was more and more trial and error platforming rather than puzzles and fighting. The Mad Hatter levels that represent a lot of mechanical work, gears, and insanity looked kind of big cubic shaped factories where everything was brownish and metallic in color. Closer to the end of the game the game changes the tone entirely and becomes a rather disturbing horror game, for which the M rating is well deserved, especially as the animated cut scenes uncover the plot.It was pretty interesting to collect different items that furthered the story, the teeth that let Alice upgrade her weapons, and different glass figurines, each associated with one of the adults that played a role in Alice's life.Unfortunately some aspects of the game were just really poorly done or were not paid attention to. The voice acting is very bad. Very often, as the character speaks, they lack inflection in the voice, which makes it difficult to understand what is meant. It is as if everyone was simply reading the lines. Monotone facial animations did not help with this issue either. The music playing in the background during gameplay is quite horrible as well. Sometimes it couldn't even be called music, but a bunch of sound effects that resembled a tune. One particular level with dolls just had kiddie toy sounds in the background.Besides the sounds many areas were blocked by invisible barriers. Maybe if the developer had a small budget they simply did not have time to create real obstacles everywhere, so they inserted invisibly walls into every nook and cranny.Pros:-good character design-creepy plot-good boss battlesCons:-Repetitive-Some levels were a chore to complete-bad music and voice acting-no replay value-invisible walls everywehre.Another important thing to remember is that the M rating is well deserved and no kid under 17 should be playing this game. If you are a parent, do not be fooled by the title \"Alice.\" This is not some mild horror game for young teens. There is some very disturbing mature content here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"Fulfills every desire for a GTA title and open-world game","reviewText":"Well, we all have heard about this game over the course of a couple of years. Many of us wondered if this game would EVER come out. Well, on the brink of the next-gen era coming upon us gamers, Grand Theft Auto V is finally here. However, is the game actually worth the long anticipation?CAMPAIGN/STORY: The game returns to the West Coast, which was in PS2's San Andreas. On GTA games, it centered on just one playable character. However, this game is centered by THREE and a HALF playable characters, known as the dog, Chop, Franklin, Michael and Trevor. The coolest part is each has their own personality, way of life, and missions. Of course, they will eventually work together in time. With that being said, it is interesting how they cross paths. In addition, playing as Chop is one of the most interesting experiences that I have ever experienced in a game. The devs of Rockstar pulled this off, VERY well.GAMEPLAY: The game-play is much improved, especially during gunfights. The shooting has such a Max Payne 3-like feel, now. The targeting system is smoother. Despite that, I prefer to go \"free aim\" for more accurate headshots. I especially love how players can now run and shoot. The previous GTA games had such stiff game-play during firefights. Enemies realistically react to being hit by bullets. For example, if an enemy is hit in the leg, he will fall. Be careful! Enemies that are only wounded will STILL let off rounds, until he is finished. With that being said, I like how they took a page fromMax Payne 3 - Playstation 3by showing an \"x\" on fallen enemies. In previous titles, players didn't know if an enemy was still alive or not, sometimes. It's a crazy world, when walking around. All kinds of actions are done and all kinds of stuff is heard. The craziest thing happened when Michael was walking around and bumped into a pedestrian. Michael stopped and eyeballed him. Then, the pedestrian said, \"I'm calling the cops!\" Sure enough, the man whipped out his phone and called. A \"one star\" popped up. It was time to go. LolPreviously, in GTAIV, character customization was the only thing that could be customized. Now, weapons and cars can be customized, as well. Of course, cars could be customized in San Andreas. The cars have a TON of modifications. Think of a game, such asMidnight Club: Los Angeles - Playstation 3, except with the addition on customization of armor. Weapon customization is not deep, as on many of the FPS. However, players can customize color, extended mags, flashlights, grips, suppressors, and scopes. Of course, your characters have additional customization and ability upgrades of their own, such as driving, flying, lung capacity, shooting, SPECIAL, and strength. Each character has a SPECIAL ability. When applied, the screen will discolor and go into slow-mo ala Max Payne 3.LikeRed Dead Redemption - Playstation 3, there IS interactive wildlife on this game. Not to mention, some animals will attack. The wildlife on the game is boars, bobcats, cougars, cows, coyotes, chickens, dogs, eels, fish, flies, monkeys, pigs, rats, and starfish. The wildlife that attacks will show up as a red dot on the map.HEIST/ROBBERIES: Amongst the various types of missions, which there is money to be gained, nothing will get a player richer than pulling off a major heist. Performing heist takes a lot of time and strategy. Their will be two options, when taking on an upcoming heist. There is the option to either go guns-a-blazing or go stealth. A crew has to be chosen. The crew members will have skill statistics, which shows how good or BAD they are. Keep in mind that a crew with good skills, they must be paid accordingly. Of course, the crew members will no so good skills will be paid less. Keep thing one in mind, when performing a heist. You get what you pay for!!!!!! Lastly, the right vehicles, weapons, and equipment has to be obtained to pull off a heist. Sometimes, it has to be done by force.ACTIVITIES:/SIDE MISSIONS There are some side mission called Strangers/Freaks. An icon with a \"?\" will be on the map. The majority of the time, the player will meet either a stranger or a freak and they will get one of the characters to perform a task. Once, this one freak asked Franklin had to get a tow truck to impound a hooptie. On another one, Franklin helped a paparazzo by riding a motorcycle along side a limo, occupied by a celebrity, so he could take some pictures. Shortly after, a rival paparazzo came along and snapped some pictures. Upon the instructions of his paparrazo, Franklin had to ride and take the rival paparazzo out.There are these other side missions, where actions are going on and the player can decide to take part in them. Once, Franklin saw two crooks, who were robbing someone. They said they needed a ride. Franklin picked them up. Of course, a high-speed chase ensued. After eluding the police, he dropped the crooks of at their hideout. Upon giving Franklin a measly $1,000 for his trouble, they were added as contacts, in case Franklin needed a crew for a desired heist. Helping people on either of these side missions can gain additional contacts or friends. Believe it or not, when Michael was riding in his vehicle, he heard about the paparazzo incident in a news bulletin. Now, THAT is cool.Just when players thought they've done it all in previous GTA titles, this one just raised the bar. There are just so many things to do on this game, such as attending counseling sessions, cable car riding, finding stolen property, flight school, getting tattoos, hunt animals, loot armored cars, invest in stocks, play golf, races, roller-coaster riding, rob banks, sky-diving, start businesses, target practice, tennis, treasure hunting, watching movies, etc. Keep in mind that some of these activities can help some of your character's abilities! For example, if a character takes target practice and succeeds, his shooting ability will be better during gunfights.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: Don't let the 720p output that is listed on the game fool you! The graphics of the game are VERY good. Not quite as good as Max Payne 3, but very, VERY close. They are the better than GTAIV for sure. In some parts, the color and the detail is just plain gorgeous, especially at the beach. The water looks SO....REAL. Just staring at the color, waves and the sun glistening on the water is a thing to see. Also, there was a mission, where Franklin used a flashlight on a shotgun. The flashlight beam was the most authentic I've ever seen in a game. That's just a few examples of how good the graphics are in this game. In third person, the character models are much bigger - not as in muscular- than in the previous GTA games. The game's GPS system is very realistic and interactive. It kind of reminds me of how the GPS is on Google's Maps phone app. On one high-speed chase, I not only see the indication of police presence on the road, but it also indicated the direction they were going. Also, the distance of the desired location will be shown at the bottom-left of the GPS screen. Character's faces on cutscenes look very good and detailed. The only bad thing about this game is the frames of the landscapes noticeably pop up, sometimes. Not a fatal flaw, but still.SOUND: The sound is Dolby Digital. The sounds of the game are just as authentic and amplified as they come. The gunfire from the weapons and the reloading sounds are very crisp. Hearing the actors/characters talk amongst each other makes me feel like I am actually watching a movie.VERDICT: For all of you diehard GTA fans, I believe this game can be truly rewarding for anyone, who has purchased it or is thinking about purchasing it. GTAV has EVERYTHING that was desired, but lacking in the other GTA titles. Not to mention, it has a lot more. You owe it to yourself to purchase this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2013"}

It is more akin to Call of Duty or Socom than Resident Evil or even Silent Hill. What we get is little more than a glorified mercenaries-mini game. A frustrating thing is that in many instances, the game wants you to run away from an enemy in order for the story to proceed, rather than engaging and defeating the enemy. The story of the Raccoon City Outbreak has been told and re-told several times already, so I believe the effort would have been better spent on making a port of Resident Evil 0 or the Resident Evil Remake for PS3, or downloadable ports of the Outbreak Series or Dead Aim, as they did with Resident Evil 2, 3, 4, and Code Veronica X. A PS3 or Wii port of Resident Evil Revelations also would have been more desirable, or remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2012"}

This adds a completely new dimension to sports, racing, fighting, and more games. Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience.

{"product_name":"B0000A0MDV","reviewerName":"A. Bush \"mechanical engineer\"","summary":"Very Solid Simulator","reviewText":"The Gran Turismo franchise was my first venture into simulation console racing and from the onset I was fascinated with its depth and challenge.  By the time 4 came out, I was desperate to acquire it, so when I received it as a Christmas gift I was elated.The first thing I did upon opening this game and popping it into the drive was to scroll through the car dealerships and ogle all the vehicles that had been added since the iconic GT3.  \"Karmann Ghia, say WHAT?\"...\"Jay Leno Tank Car...uh...cool?\"  But seriously, there are some amazing rides in here (and I really do like the Ghia, AKA VW Typ 14).  Amazingly awesome vehicles include, for a very short list, the road-going BMW M3 GTR, Mercedes CLK-GTR race car, and the Lancia Delta S4 rally car, which, when modified, has the most explosive acceleration you will ever see.Then...gameplay.  The license test thing has always been a love/hate situation.  On the one hand, it presents a linear challenge that familiarizes you with segments of tracks (and whole tracks, for the good ol' S license) and various cars.  Unfortunately, some of the \"sage racing advice\" given is simply rubbish if applied in real life, and having a game judge whether you are qualified to play it seems a bit ridiculous.  Regardless, I pushed through the license tests and felt increasingly successful each time I achieved a gold medal, then moved on to the racing.Ah, the racing.  Some of the races are simply atrocious.  Let's take an inside peek, for example, at the \"24 Hours of Nurburgring.\"  Oh, Friday night!  What to do, what to do...I know!  I'll sit on my duff and drive a single simulated car on a single simulated track for literally 24 hours straight!  Sounds like a blast!  Things like carpal tunnel, sleep deprivation, starvation, and console overheating will surely NOT be a problem!  Let's get to it!  Oh yeah, and the track is the most challenging not only in the game, but in the whole real world.  And if you don't place first on your first try, enjoy repeating it until you do.  Oh, and take a hint, Polyphony Digital.  In real life, 24 hour races are generally not completed by a single person.Fortunately, the folks at Polyphony Digital who received the game after the folks who decided putting in 24 hour races (yes, plural...more than one) would be bomb, forsaw the above mentioned problems (except console overheating...good thing the GT franchise has never been for XBox 360) and included a B-spec mode!  So.....ok so the term \"B-Spec\" means absolutely nothing to you?  Fair.  Basically, the affectionately named \"B-Spec Bob\" is a race slave...ha, ahem, I mean, driver, who really enjoys driving for you and would never ask for any money, who will dutifully complete races lasting 24 hours, and will EVEN let you speed things up by 3x so that the race only takes 8 hours!  Of course, B-Spec Bob is not you.  He will not use opponents as devices to aid in cornering.  He will not cut across the grass because it is clearly faster.  He will not pit if you told him to go fast, even if his tires have completely melted away and he is driving on bare, sparking rims with only fumes rising from the petrol tank.  But he will do races for you for free, and for that we must all thank B-Spec Bob.GT4 did not attempt to venture into any new territory as far as racing goes.  Yes, superbly realistic physics are still here (and who would want them removed?  It's a SIMULATOR).  We still have a variety of real and fake tracks, including all the \"GT Classics\" and several super slick new layouts such as the stunning Amalfi Coast, which you will want to drive around at 5 MPH to enjoy the scenery.  There are still rally stages, albeit with a SUPER ANNOYING \"5 second penalty\" of computer-controlled throttle cut if you biff a wall or opponent (OR if an opponent hits you like a complete jerk...there is no justice in this game).  You can even race along the Grand Canyon now.  Oh yes, and the clincher.  You can STILL plow violently into six opponent cars, a tunnel wall, a cliff, three barricades, and a flimsy orange nylon fence which behaves like a stone wall to protect the jeering fans behind it, all at 200 miles per hour in a single radical collision, and never lose a chip of paint or risk rollover.  It will slow you down a bit though, so try to avoid it.  However, your car can get dirty over time (although you'll never be able to see that), and washing it for a few quid can improve your lap times!  Okay, GT4, thanks for that.  AT least the new GT5 is reported to include damage, so we can all stop whining.There are some cool new additions, though.  New cars and tracks, nitrous oxide, a drag strip, a really slick photo mode (both in and out of races), and a clean, white background layout make this a great refresh on the successful old formula.Here are the cons of the game; the pros are that it is a super realistic racing simulator with tons of cars and neat extra features.-No damage (GT trademark, until the new one)-Irritating penalties for rally contact (even when it's not your fault)-Audaciously long races-Slightly obtuse B-Spec Bob is free to use, but what's the fun in that?-No Ferraris, Porsches, Maseratis, or Lamborghinis (EA had the license, or something like that)-Considerable amounts of trippy music not available elsewhere (but you can turn it off)-Upgrade system could be improved (who really wants to pay 50 grand for \"frame straightening\" when there IS NO DAMAGE?)All in all, although I'm now a Forza fan, I still hail GT4 as a wonderful and immersive game that certainly occupied hours of my time (including 8 hours directing B-Spec Bob around the \"Green Hell\" AKA Nurburgring Nordschliefe).[Oh. P.S.  We get it, Polyphony Digital.  You guys love Nissan cars.  They are pretty sporty, yes.  But including 100 of them in your game was not exactly necessary.  Seriously, you must have had like 92 and then came up with 8 new Skylines to round up to that nice even 100.]","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2010"}

Without going after all feats, capsules and challenges (yet), it took us about 8 hours for Incredibles, 6 for Pirates and so far we have 4 in Monsters and appear to be only halfway. However we've played over 8 hours of Cars and there still appears to be a lot left to do.For fans of the Cars 2 video game, the feel and controls will be instantly familiar to you. They are handled almost identically to their counterparts in Cars 2. You have the boost meter that you build by drifting and performing tricks, and all the old tricks are back here with the same controls. I wouldn't buy this set expecting it to be all about racing, however. It's very oriented around the story and helping people around town. Racing is maybe 25% of the whole play set as far as I can see. There are numerous race tracks, including ones through town, through the canyons outside of town and in a new race track built nearby for McQueen's new racing headquarters. Basically the story is about getting the little town ready for the influx of fans who will be coming to the new race track.My 8-year-old absolutely loves this set. It's easily his favorite, followed closely by Monsters. I love these play sets so much more than the Skylanders packs that give you one new level that will take you an hour at best to complete.

It's been a lot better since then, but instead of not working there just seems to be more lag lately.  Usually when this happens the room will have a lot of overseas players.-There isn't too much of a difference in playing the campaign on easy or hard.-There are lots of jet/heli whores who don't play the game at all except to play in these vehicles.-Co-op is ok.  It's not as good as Spec Ops.  And you shouldn't have to buy the online pass to play the co-op, that's inexcusably greedy.-The camping is pretty bad in some matches.  The sniping is pretty bad in some matches.  I know this isn't DICE's fault, but the big maps do encourage it.  Campers are bad players who never improve because they refuse to play and just are trying to improve their shoddy K/D ratios.  Sniping isn't bad until you play Rush against a team of 12 snipers then you might as well just back out.  In normal matches (12 enemy players) there are normally two out-and-out campers, and two-three snipers so normally the games aren't too bad but on the rare occasion the match is lame.  When everyone camps or snipes the game is extremely boring.-The spawns need improvement.  I have spawned in before not on a teammate but in a random spawn point and have got instantly killed.  Which leads to...-There should be some spawn protection.  Maybe not if you spawn on a teammate because then it would be too powerful.  But I know of one map once you take the first objectives in Rush the enemies can camp in front of your spawn and just nonstop kill you as soon as you spawn it's terrible.The positives:-Rage looked great, but then this came out and makes Rage look last-gen.  Seriously.  The graphics are that good, the best this generation.-It's the best FPS since CoD4, and the third best ever made behind Halo 2 and CoD4.  That's extremely high praise.-This is the real modern warfare according a buddy of mine.  CoD is a great shooter that's taken hundreds of hours of my time.  But this is CoD with tanks, planes, helicopters, boats, parachuting, etc.  It feels more epic than just running around shooting.-The class system is superior to the perk system in CoD.  There are no killstreak bonuses, which is a negative for good players but it's more fair for the casual players who don't want to join a game and get constantly crushed I guess.-The guns are great.  They have realistic recoil and unlike CoD they perform the same in multi as in the single player campaign.-The sounds of battle are awesome.  Little Birds sound like Little Birds and the guns sound like the real guns, just a lot less loud.I didn't like Bad Company 1 or 2 at all.  But this is a true AAA title.  It will be difficult for MW3 to equal BF3, and this is from a player who loves CoD.

By straight forward action I mean you have levels you go through and you kill things solve a few puzzles kill a few more things fight bosses advance storyline which not many people care about(all they care about is the action...which is basically wat this game is for) this is not your gta type of game or metal gear solid. This is your lord of the rings type of game or golden axe(from the sega genesis...wat? i couldnt think of any action games). If you like the genre and you dont mind the money you should definitly get this game. If you like more adventure/action games than just plain action games you should rent this....or buy it next year when its like 10 dollars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2005"}

It's kind of a pain that I'll have to pay $50 a year to have Gold access, but on the plus side, it's only $50 for an entire year.There's a wonderful catalog of games, including things like \"Call of Duty: World at War\", \"Fable II\" and the various Lego games.I know there's lots of issues involving heat with these machines. Well, currently it sits in a spot in my apartment where it isn't blocked on any sides, and where the AC hits it almost directly when it's blowing. That'll take care of that, I hope.The only real issue I have at present is the need for AA batteries to power the controllers. Microsoft should've just made them rechargable. This is a flaw with the Wii-motes, as well (though there I blame Nintendo, not Microsoft... anyhow...). I know they make charging cables, but it seems like something they should've included to start with. Thankfully, CVS had a buy-one/get-one deal on batteries this week...Overall I'm very happy so far, and highly recommend this system for all your hardcore gamer types out there!

Taking a cue from Marvel's smash Civil War mini-series, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 allows you to choose whose side you are on, and just who's on your team.  Most notable about the game is the huge roster of Marvel characters at your disposal, from the usuals like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Wolverine, and Deadpool; to the Green Goblin, Songbird, Venom, Iceman, and more besides.  The game looks good, plays great, and there's voice acting that ranges from good to hideously campy, but the biggest drawback remains the fact that not much has changed from the core gameplay of the original.  The only real difference is that the RPG elements have been stripped down a bit.  Other than that though, Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 still delivers the goods, as it warrants replayability with the branching storyline, and there's plenty of unlockables and side missions to keep you busy as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2009"}

I especially like that they brought back the inventory system that worked so well in the first game. But the tiny fonts are used for objectives, terminal and pda messages, etc.. are a MAJOR problem.

Soatthiamroong","summary":"4.5 stars - Not a Horror Fest, but a Great Action !!!","reviewText":"Horror fans beware !!! This one is not what you'd call a surviving horror.But for action fans, pack your arsenal and let's have fun hunting some biological weapons !!!Pros :- This installment is the most accessible to the casual players. You can stock up your arsenal by re-visiting the past levels for guns, ammo, and treasures as many times as you want. It's a good idea if you feel that your supplies are running too low to proceed to the next stage. It's also good for maxing out your guns.- Items and ammo found in the stages are just the right amount for each difficulty level. If you play on normal level and don't feel like re-visiting the area, you don't have to.- Parner AI is fairly smart. She might do stupid things and lagging behnd too far sometimes, but mostly she's there when you need her. Parner can be considered the fast way to heal. You can give all the healing items to her and she'll do the job while you're caugth up in shooting. And co-op mode is definitely a welcoming feature.- Unlockables are decent enough to add a reasonable replay value to the game.- Weapons are interesting.Cons:- The item farming option makes the game very easy compare to the previous installment that you could get stuck if you don't manage the items well enough. This remove the big chunk of challenge and tension out of the game.- Knife is, as always, only good for destroying crates and barrels. One-button swing would be great. Move-and-shoot ability would be welcoming also.- They give you infinite ammo cheat, but not for a grenade launcher. I don't see the reason why they wanted to leave this gun out. It'd be so nice for the trigger-happy players to blast their way through the game with its various selections of ammo.This is not a pro or con. RE5 is definitely NOT a surviving horror. Anybody expecting creepy atmosphere and heart-pounding moments would be dissappointed. Shooting biological weapons in broad daylight doesn't really do the trick. Enemies can jump you from the blind spot, but that's about it. If you're looking for intense horror elements that makes your stomach squeeze, I'd highly recommend Dead Space instead of this game.In conclusion, it's a stress-free, action-oriented RE.I never see RE as a horror franchise. For me, RE1-2 were half-way between action and surviving game with decent amount of creepiness. RE3 was a little more action. So, I'm unable to understand people who complain about this game not being scary anymore. However, I'm not going to be judgmental about that.As an action game, RE5 does a great job. I had a great fun and beat the game 3 rounds straight on easy to hard difficulty. I'm comfortable with this new and more accessible direction of the franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2009"}

I gave it a rating of 1 star to get your attention and to point out that this is only HALF a game. It offers both single player and online multiplay.If you love multiplayer games and have a broadband connection...this game is awesome. WARNING - Most of the Halo Multiplayer servers, groups and games I played were filled with immature 14 year olds that curse 4 letter words at you and accuse you of cheating all the time because they can't shoot straight. I prefer more mature surroundings!If you are looking for a great single player experience...forget it.First of all the graphics are pretty...but dated. Look at UT 2003 on a high end vid card and compare it to Halo. Halo is bland, the levels are redundant. The outside levels are pretty but nothing impressive.Even on the hardest settings this game is way too scripted, the enemy AI is pathetic and predictable. It is not intelligent AI. All the programmers did was setup scripted actions and triggers to generate hoardes and hoardes of enemies to come at you at set intervals as you proceed through a level.Want to beat them easily? Say your in a level exploring...just walk slowly until you trigger some enemies to appear, back track a bit for protection and keep your back to a wall. Kill the enemies as they approach, then step back to where you triggered the enemies, see if you can trigger more and repeat these instructions until you are clear. Proceed and investigate further until you trigger more enemies. Repeat this strategy throughout the level and the rest of the game.If you get into a heated, heavy battle, just use cover...pop out, shot some aliens and duck again. They almost never pursue you. Only the weird, mutants chase you. Just shotgun them. Nice and simple.There are some tiny little parasite style aliens that are more annoying than dangerous. Don't waste your ammo on them, just let them crash into your shield, let your shield recharge and proceed. PIECE OF CAKE. I walked through this game on the hardest settings, without breaking a sweat, the AI is disappointing. Not horrible, but very PREDICTABLE.Online Multiplay is where this game shines...the weapons are so-so...but having vehicles to drive around is a blast.If you are thinking of buying this title...I would wait.

The people of Haven City have grown to distrust Jak's dark powers, and as rumors boil of Jak's ties with Krew and Kor, the city blames Jak for its current woeful circumstances. When the palace is destroyed by a surprise Metal Head attack, even Ashelin cannot protect Jak as the High Council's power broker, Count Veger, forces Jak into banishment to the desolate Wasteland. Jak is flown to the harsh island and dumped. With Daxter and Pecker bravely by his side, the three begin their next adventure where the battle for the city has just begun.Five times the size of Haven City, the Wasteland is a desert environment with multiple areas including mines and a volcano. Given the enormity and variance in terrain, vehicles play a large role as off-road transportation is introduced, fueled by a true-to-life physics engine. With a rugged new look and suited with armor, Jak is also equipped with an arsenal of new weapons with upgradeable mods that enable players to increase their firepower and enjoy the freedom to strategize and activate their arsenal at any time.As Jak has been exposed to Light Eco, players can now experience Jak's magnificent transformation to Light Jak. With a glowing electric blue aura and a massive wing span, Light Jak introduces new move sets, including the ability to glide great distances, emit an energy to block enemy attack, and power up at anytime, all of which provide the player with a sense of being invincible. Dark Jak also returns with more capabilities, forcing Jak to find a balance between light and dark.Additionally, game developer Naughty Dog continues to push the genre forward with the introduction of new technology. For the first time in the franchise, enemies feature realistic ragdoll physics, which will allow gamers to witness a unique death for each enemy that is killed. Naughty Dog has also implemented independent cloth movement technology and enhanced the enemy artificial intelligence (AI) with wall climbing and smart formation capabilities.","reviewerName":"ps2 gamer \"star wars\"","summary":"greatest game iv'e ever seen","reviewText":"i must say , i think this game is the best one iv'e seen yet . it has everything you want in it, platforming , action , adventure, and a great storyline . you have a lot of weapons in this game and alot of different vehicles to drive. i cant list them all here , there are too much .also , about the adventure ,you have alot to explore. that includes the wasteland and haven city , which are both VERY huge environments with alot of different levels in them .it also has a big replay value . also fans of the previous games will like to know that in this game you find out who the precursors really are. it's really great when you find out , but i wont tell you who they are because i dont want to spoil the game. it also has alot of great characters , both old and new . and the graphics! they are WONDERFUL! i cannot describe how great they are ! such beauty and such detail! it's also great  how realistic everything is .i mean , in some of the vehicle missions ( which are really fun, by the way ) if you fall with a car off of a cliff , it's great to see how it falls around and rolls around down. and in one mission , where you have to fight some huge monsters(metal heads) with one of the cars , if one of them hits you really hard your car flies around really far really fast . this is very cool , and you have to see it for yourself to really see how nice this is. also one thing i liked is the ragdoll physics . when you hit an enemy , it falls down to the ground in a very realistic way. each enemy has a unique \"type\" of fall when you hit it or kill it .overall , i think this a the greatest game i know and my favorite one ,and the only problems with it are that it's a bit shorter and easier than jak 2 , but that really didn't bother me . so , if you want a very fun game , buy this. no ps2 game collection is complete without this .","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXEM8","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris Chapa","summary":"Did EA fire their entire Quality Assurance Department?","reviewText":"*Yeah that's a harsh header, but I think they earned it...CONCEPT:Set an unmentioned amount of years after the events of &#34;40th Day&#34;, you and your AI partner are two new recruits in T.W.O. -- a mercenary company run by Salem and Rios. After a task that has you protecting an important government official in Mexico goes awry, you and your partner must fight your way past the Cartel and out of Mexico alive.GRAPHICS:The look and the sound of the game are on point. The lighting effects really give the scenery a nice and realistic look. The only downside I see as far as graphics go is that regardless of your proximity to a grenade, when it explodes, it washes the screen out, similar to what you get with a flashbang in other games.GAMEPLAY:The &#34;team&#34; formula that stood out so well in the first two games seems to have taken a step back in this third installment. While you can still relay orders to cover FIRE, ADVANCE, or STAY PUT to your AI partner, it seems more like a suggestion more than an order--a suggestion that he will often ignore. Also, these commands no longer give you the option of choosing for him to go AGGRO or not. Some other aspects had the potential to be great but also don't perform as well, such as flanking maneuvers, and leap frog-like advancement techniques that sound cool in theory but come off as forced and obviously staged during gameplay. Throughout an area, there are checkpoints that allow you the opportunity to purchase weapon upgrades, outfits, and masks. Weapon upgrades are similar to the previous games, though I feel like there are less firearms to choose from. Enemy AI is decently challenging and not terribly predictable. The story however, is. Still, that in itself isn't that bad.What I DO find consistently annoying is that just like the last game, you have an option for making a custom mask for your character that is completely, 100% non-functional. Cannot make a mask in-game, nor can you make one on EA's website for the game (like you were supposed to be able to do for &#34;40th Day&#34;) and sync it up to your PSN account. The CUSTOM MASK option is there just to taunt you it seems.REPLAY VALUE:Due to some setbacks that I will mention below, I will keep this short and give this game a score of LOW/MODERATE replay value.OVERALL:This where I explain my two stars: the game is terribly glitchy:- 50/50 chance of complete freeze during cutscenes- Constant issues with partner AI glitch-ing out at key moments, causing gameplay to come to a complete standstill until you reload the checkpoint.- Repeatedly, SOMETHING will screw up with the software and the audio will completely disappear, which basically is a precursor to complete game-freeze within the next few minutes.- A Custom Mask feature that is utterly useless and non-functioning.-The game's constant insistence that you be connected to the PSN so you can access the leader boards, but when you do play, there are NO LEADER BOARDS. So again, the game pitches something that is non-functioning.These instances of freezing occurred 5+ times in a single hour of gameplay. The fact that this game was released MONTHS ago and EA still has not corrected it with a patch is, to me, inexcusable. I get very angry when I'm expected to pay full price for something that ends up being only partially complete.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2014"}

And why is the UAA back?-Not having to save money or drive around sped things up. I beat NMH in a week. I beat the sequel in afternoon.-Levels used to have wacky surprises like playing baseball in the middle of a match, not NMH2. Where's the funny?-I miss the Wiiphone calls saying with 1 million % certainty you were going to lose.-Travis whines about how assassins are people too.

Now, I'm not normally a fan of gorey shoot-em-ups, so I refused to play it.  When I finally DID get around to playing it, I was surprised.  I... LIKED it... I don't know what got me, the innovative controls, the creepy as hell Castlevania type settings, or just the fact that you could turn into a demon and fight bosses such as Phantom and Nelo Angelo.  What I particularly liked was the power up system.  Slash or shoot the crap out of enemies to gain red orbs, then buy some neat little abilities or items to help you through the game.  Here's a quick rundown of the game:GRAPHICS:  4/5  Come on, it's 2003!  This game's graphics looked very good back then, but in this day and age, they are merely \"decent\".  Special effects are rather simplistic, but they still look pretty cool.SOUND:  5/5  An enemy being hacked apart by the Alastor sword sounds like it's being hacked apart by a sword.  Realistic, in other words.  The music isn't spectacular, but it suits the creepy surroundings.  Dante's in-game voice could've used some work, and the voice actors are nothing short of awful.  That doesn't detract from the score, as the in game sound effects are just too good.GAMEPLAY:  5/5  This is DMC's best part.  Jump off walls, then bring your sword down onto an enemies, head.  Slice them up into the air, then fill 'em full of so much lead they need to be sharpened and called a pencil.  Turn into a winged demon and shoot bolts of lightning at your foes.  It just goes on.  Simply put, the game is a hell of a lot of fun to play.CONTROLS/CAMERA:  2.5/5  Ouch.  The controls can take some getting used to, but they aren't such a problem.  The camera is pure evil...  mostly in boss battles, when it's fixed at an angle so you can't see them getting ready to launch a powerful attack at you.  It's really not cool.  (It's not THAT bad, but it can stil be frustrating.)REPLAY:  4/5  The game's first few missions get pretty boring after a few playthroughs, but the sheer number of VERY expensive abilities (it's almost impossible to get them all on one trip through) and the number of modes and extras (DEVIL HUNTER MODE!!! YEAH!!!)  make it worth coming back for.OVERALL:  4.5/5  While nowhere near perfect, this game is HIGHLY enjoyable.  And with a [decent] price tag, it's more than worth it to purchase.  Although, tough luck to those of you under 17.  It's Rated M, and holy crap, does it ever deserve that rating.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2003"}
{"product_name":"B003O6HDHA","description":"","reviewerName":"RKOFANT","summary":"Has Good and Bad elements in equal amounts. Very uneven experience.","reviewText":"I loved most of the silent hill games. This one was only ok to me due to how uneven it was. It hit some decent high notes with a new approach to the other world and exploration(not everyone will like it though). Overall game suffered from a bad pacing problem due to the side quests reducing the tension. I could almost say that silent hill is too open in this game.  It might have worked out if the side quests were done better.  For example(non spoiler).  Having to do a side quest in one building and then having to run across town to find a single item to complete it. that's fine in rpgs but it kind of made this game drag. Also the side quests generally were not creepy. I can think of one that was well done. Others had good ideas but they were not executed to a level that would create any sort of fear. There were also levels in the game that did not feel like silent hill (caverns). I am happy the developers tried a bit of a reboot on the style, but I am not sure it succeeded. One main reason for this is the monster design. I'm all for never seeing another nurse or legs for arms monster.... however... create something compelling. Some dude with dreadlocks just does not scare me. It does not help that one or two of the monsters DO look like they could fit in SH. It is kind of jarring like going 2 directions at once. In fact every time it succeeds at feeling like silent hill it accentuates how un-silent hill other things are. As far as battle goes I don't know what to think, they made it so annoying to fight monsters that I basically ran the whole time. A big part of me thinks this is the right direction for survival horror at least. I would also like to say that fear of being killed is only one type of fear. sometimes an enemy that is easy to kill or is more ominous than dangerous can be creepier at times.  There is a line between fear of death and just throwing a bunch of annoying enemies at you too.Pros- interesting take on exploration of silent hill- new take on other world, with some very cool visuals- some very good psychological aspects that don't involve running from monsters.Cons-mostly weak side quests in terms of fear factor and reward.-Monster design-Having to play a cavern level in a silent hill game.-Lags in pacing due to side quests.-lack of dread - largely due to pacing, openness and approach to enemies mentioned above.-weak story.... actually decent set up...it just didn't go to the right places imo.-technical quirks - frame rate issues, bugsI do think people should play and enjoy this game, but maybe don't focus too much on side quests if you feel like you are losing momentum. Also don't be surprised with departures from the SH style at times.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001E8QA2E","description":"Batman: Arkham Asylum","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"Steroids ruin the spirit of competition","reviewText":"I'm a fairly big batman fan. No, I was no overly impressed with this game.It is competently put together. Production values are high. There are AAA voice actors and good motion capture. The story is decently well-done. No major bugs and the combat systems work like they should.Why didn't I like the game?It's hard to put a finger on it, but let's start with the physiques of the characters here. They are all bulging. You see batman's like sub-muscles ripping through his suit. Even Joker looks like he's been taking steroids, and Joker is supposed to be a wimpy joke, you know? The thugs and the guards all look like they're on Barry Bond's steroid plan. It's like a protein milkshake with creatine and HGH added as supplements.This matters to me because it just doesn't feel right with the batman franchise. I'm used to the cartoons, of course, but Batman is supposed to be like an olympian level athlete and one thing about him is that he's efficient and to the point. Polishing the little sub muscle between like your chest and your ribs, whatever that is called, is pointless, and doesn't fit with the character. In none of the cartoons I grew up on is Batman ever bulging. He's actually of slightly better than average physique. It's like how real life soldiers don't have muscle mag physiques because muscle mag physiques are heavy, impractical, and limit flexibility.Yes, that bothered me. Even the women are 'roided and have weird hip to shoulder ratios.The game has some light stealth elements and the levels allow you a certain amount of creativity in getting things done. Still, it didn't feel all that challenging. Not when batman always has a get out of trouble quick ability by his grapple hook. Yes, the grapple is part of the lore, but you can always hit it and find someplace to zip away to. You always have a get out of jail card, so there is less danger overall, and with less danger is less tension. He also performs the grapple perfectly every time. This takes control away and makes it less interesting.and the bosses. There are boss fights. It's typically batman vs some 'roided villains. The last battle is against a 'roided bad guy (can you guess who?). Actually, lots of video games do this, for example, the acclaimed Bioshock. But it still doesn't mean that it's a good thing to do. Since it basically amounts to batman finding some way to stun the enemy and then punch the guy before the guy unstuns and throws stuff at batman. Then batman dodges and finds an opportunity to stun the dude again and bash him before he unstuns.But THIS ISN'T HOW BATMAN OPERATES. Batman doesn't do drawn-out boss fights. Batman is a ninja/detective. Ninjas avoid confrontation. They find clever ways around obstacles. THey don't take them head-on.And bats can take on multiple guys at a time in a big gay testosterone bash, and with the last guy he always does some sadomasochistic male stripper talk-to-the-glove move that leaves the guy clutching his behind and writhing in ecstasy/agony (pain is pleasure).FYI, Harley Quinn is mo-capped by a short Asian guy and has doubtlessly been fantasized about by countless gamer nerds who have no idea that they're drooling over a short Asian guy.This game is basically a standard 3d action-platformer with a 'roided gay batman theme. It's competently done which is why it gets 3 stars, but oddly, doesn't feel inspired.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"evanjamesroskos \"ejr\"","summary":"3.5 stars - buggy but fun","reviewText":"I am new to the Dragon Age story, so my rating may be higher than fans of Origins on PC or people who were frustrated with Origins/Awakenings on consoles. From a standalone perspective, DA2 had a really interesting set of storylines. There is not a true arc from beginning to end -- there are 3 Acts that each have their own climax and lead to the next Act. Ultimately, your character's lot in life goes from refugee to Champion of Kirwall in the course of the game.PROS:I found some of the choices very difficult and thought long and hard about what to have my character do/say in key moments of the game. Sparing lives, condemning blood mages, and fighting/romancing party members all felt fun and important.The controls on Xbox are pretty intuitive. I never felt confused or burdened by the way the controller was setup. One limitation is that you can only have 8 abilities mapped to your buttons; this is a bit of a problem if you end up with an offensive mage, for example, who has more than 8 spells to use later in the game. But even that requires some deft leveling-up.CONS:Bugs -- there are, as of 4/7/2011, two quests that cannot actually be completed. One has a slight workaround, the other is just flat out broken. This is annoying for a completist like myself, but neither quest is part of the main storyline. There is a strange bug/issue in Act 3 where you do not get a warning to finish your side quests before you initiate the final battle sequence. In Acts 1 & 2 you have a warning to \"finish up other quests\" before moving forward. Not game-breaking, but annoying, especially since a couple of my unfinished quests were in an area that triggered the final battles. So, I would have had to restart act 3, or at least go back a bunch of saves, just to get these quests done.Act 3 -- there are a couple of things broken in act 3, including a companion quest where a character's cutscene from the conlcusion of the quest plays when you initiate the quest. Very odd and confuses the quest story. Also, I found that the eventual conclusion of the story was more scripted than teh rest of the game would lead me to believe was necessary. You essentially fight the same villains, only the order changes based on your prior choices. I had a similar issue in Act 2 where I ended up fighting someone that I absolutely did not want to fight; there was a path around it but it required a certain set of choices throughout the act that really had nothing to do with how I was playing my character.CONCLUSION:I really enjoy this game. I'm about to finish a second playthrough. The bugs stink. Even with the conclusion being a bit too narrow, I loved the story and thought some really surprising things happened along the way. I can't wait for some patches, DLC, and, of course, a full-blown sequel. I may hold off on buying the third one new, though, if it has the same kind of bugginess. I don't like encouraging developers to send out unfinished games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2011"}

It's always sounded like a cool idea and something I would dig, but I never really owned any gaming console that wasn't a Nintendo.  This isn't about console wars, this is about that I'm a 34 year old dude, I grew up on Nintendo and dig their games so that's what I get.  I can't afford to be a multi-console guy, unfortunately, so there are games I've missed out on through the years.  However, after getting a Wii U, I grabbed Mass Effect 3 and dug it so much, I had to go back to the beginning.  Thankfully, due to getting a new computer this past year, I was able to have a machine that can run the game.And first off, that's what's cool about a game like this.  I'm relatively knew to PC gaming, being used to controllers and whatnot, that I was worried about how I'd adapt to keyboard/mouse controlling.  Thankfully, for this game they are pretty intuitive and easy for a newcomer to the format like me to pick up on and have fun with.  My computer is by no means a powerhouse, but it runs the game great.The scope and epicness of this game and story boggles the mind.  You can either go straight story and blow through it in about 10 hours or so, or you can do the whole experience in about 40 hours.  This first foray into the world of Mass Effect plays more like an action game with more RPG elements than what would come later.  I enjoy both ways to play, so I had no problem with this.  The only thing I has issue with is the micro managing you had to do, changing weapons for each character, upgrading all the weapons, worrying about if your inventory would be too full and getting rid of excess before you could get the newer cooler stuff.  It's not a huge annoyance, but there were times I was too busy worrying about that instead of exploring the universe.  Also, you tend to never have enough money near the start of the game and are a legitimate millionaire by the end when it doesn't do you a whole lot of good.But this is not the appeal of the game.  It's the interactive nature of the thing.  You can take your personally modified Commander Shepard and all of your decisions effect the nature of your gameplay and certain outcomes.  The main game itself and story doesn't change much, but it's still cool and it's about as immersive as any game I've played.  It also effects how things might go down in the sequel if you play the next one on the same platform you finished this one on. The action is okay, if a little generic and not very challenging.  The game is very story-based, so it's not a big deal to me and once again, helps me being a newbie to pc gaming that the combat is simple.  You can still choose your class from gun firing soldier to a biotic with Jedi-like powers and this effects the action and how you fight.There is a lot to love about this game.  I love epic Sci-Fi and this puts you right into the middle of one as a character of destiny that effects a lot of outcomes with his decision.  It's a close to being in Star Wars as one can get as of now.That said, this is the first game in the series and as such is not quite as polished as the follow-ups. The graphics still hold up but aren't as next-gen looking as future games in the series. Exploring the worlds of the game is fun, but it can get pretty repetitive.  There feels as if there's only three base layouts for the kajillion of bases to explore.  The use of the Mako dune buggy you drive to get around the surface of the various planets can get annoying.The different classes you can choose, the decisions you can make, the romances you can pursue; this adds up to one of the most replayable experiences you can have.  Play again, see how being a little more evil can change your experience.  Maybe go for Ashley instead of Liara.  It's a well told story with a very cinematic climax that has you pumping your fist and ready for another go.  This is one of the best games I've ever played and I can't wait to sink my teeth into Mass Effect 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2013"}

It's got all the essentials of a good movie: strong storytelling, great directing, well-rounded character's,  a fantastic musical score, great dialogue, strong visuals for the scenery, better choreography than you'll see in most modern movies,  and well done graphics.  Game play wise the game allows players to choose their level of difficulty which makes this game accessible for hard-core gamers, casual gamers, and non gamers alike which is a plus in my book especially since majority of my friends are casual gamers/non gamers who think that all video games are about nothing more than mindless violence.  When I allowed them to play this game I was finally able to show them just how deep, creative, and thought provoking video games can be.Getting back to the game, this game doesn't play out like the average video game.  The player actually has to live with the consequences of the choices they make.  There are no \"game over screens\" or \"continue\" screens.  If you make a mistake or accidentally cause 1 or more of the main characters to die the game will continue and the final outcome of the game will reflect the choices you made or didn't make along the way.  All of this creates a unique experience for everyone especially since we all think differently about life and make choices that reflect our own morality, how we see the world, and our decisions reflect our personal fears, hopes, and desires.  With this in mind this game has high replay value since there are multiple ways to play the story, 17 different endings, and lots of trophies for you to collect.Rating:  100% A+","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0002BJQDY","description":"Guild Warstakes the best elements of today's massively multiplayer online games and combines them with a new mission-based design that eliminates the tedium of those games. You can meet new friends in towns or outposts, form a party, and then go tackle a quest together. Your party always has its own unique copy of the quest map, so camping, kill-stealing, and long lines to complete quests are all things of the past. Within a quest you have unprecedented freedom and power to manipulate the world around you: your magic can build bridges and open up new pathways, or it can burn down forests and tear the ground asunder.You don't have to spend countless hours on a leveling treadmill to get to the interesting parts of the game, because combat is designed to be strategically interesting and challenging right from the beginning. You don't have to spend hours running around the world to prepare for a quest, because Guild Wars allows you to instantly travel to the beginning of any quest that you've previously unlocked. You'll never spend days playing only to discover that choices you made early on have left you with a permanently uncompetitive character, because the unique skill system in Guild Wars allows infinite experimentation but doesn't allow bad decisions to ruin a character. And you'll never meet new players only to discover that you can't play with them or compete against them because their characters are on a different server than yours; in Guild Wars, all characters live in one seamless world.Built for CompetitionAfter learning the game and building up your first character, you may choose to test your skills in head-to-head competition or guild warfare. The game is designed to reward player skill and teamwork, not time spent playing, so you won't need to spend hundreds of hours leveling up your character to compete.The game includes integrated support for guilds, with guild banners and halls, chat rooms and forums. Guilds can challenge other guilds to battle, compete for control of key parts of the world, and be ranked on a worldwide ladder.Unique Streaming TechnologyArenaNet's unique streaming technology forever eliminates the concept of patching a game. You don't have to wait a month for the next big patch to experience new content. Instead, the game constantly and intelligently streams new content to your computer in the background while you play. The world can change continually. This allows us to build a much more dynamic game world than any that has existed before.","reviewerName":"R.

The sequel takes place a couple of years after this.  While on a routine mission in Shanghai, China Rios and Salem find themselves trapped in a city underseige.  Their initial reaction is to locate their mission coordinator Alice Murray and to leave the city; however things aren't quite so simple.  They'll have to use their wits, skills, and teamwork to fight for every inch of ground in this city.  Along the way they'll have to make life or death decisions that'll test the strength of their bond.The sequel makes many improvements over the original game while still managing to maintain the best parts of the previous game.  This time around if you're playing in solo campaign mode your AI partner is much more intelligent.  If you're wounded your partner will not drag you right in to the enemies' line fire so that you can both die.  Also it doesn't matter what part of the game you're in you can command your partner to take the lead versus the original game where even if you wanted them to go first at certain points they wouldn't.Other improvements to the game play include the use of the shield.  Instead of always sharing a shield now both people can take a shield and split up to take on the enemy.  Both characters' can also sprint at any time, which is really useful in some areas.  Now you can customize your weapons at any point during the game when you're not in battle instead of going shopping before and at the end of missions like in the first game.  There are now new options in how you engage the enemies.  You don't have to kill them all the time, you can tie them up, or you or your partner can do a mock surrender while the other person takes the enemies out.  When you're wounded instead of lying out in the open waiting to be shot now you can drag yourself someplace safe until your partner arrives to heal you.  The environment is now destructible which presents a new level of fun.  Also depending on the type of gun you use you can blow enemies' heads clean off *weg*.  Another noteworthy improvement for the sequel is the visuals.  Shanghai is stunning to behold especially the zoo level.  Once you beat the game you can unlock different outfits for both Rios and Salem including the original Ao2 gear.Great things from the 1st game that have returned include the aggro meter.  The aggro meter is a gauge that indicates which player is the focus of the enemy's attention. Whichever player has the highest Aggro rating will attract all the enemies towards them. This allows the other player to become virtually invisible and thus sneak up to enemy positions.  You can still go back to back at certain points, engage in blind fire,  perform step jumps, do the fake death, and the emote factor has returned.  The sequel features some new emotes both positive and negative that I'm sure anyone can appreciate.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2010"}

I have EVERY system ever made, from Colecovision to PS2. I have played TONS and TONS of games, including almost every new hit PC and PS2 game on the market today. If it's out, I probably own it. That being said...Max Payne is TRULY the best game of the year. The storyline is captivating to say the least. Your an undercover NYPD cop working the streets of New York City. A couple junkies break into your house and kill your wife and son. The graphics and sound are movie like, and as convincing as anything you've ever seen in a video game. The story is what makes this game great.The game play is also amazing. There are tons of weapons that you obtain throughout the game. The slow motion \"bullet time\" effect is something out of the future. The enemys are FAR from easy to handle. This is not a run and shoot game. It takes time. You can quick save (atleast in the PC version) at any time during the mission. They allow this because of how challenging the game can be at times. You'll explore hotels, old prostitution houses, and office buildings looking for the root of the evil that caused these junkies to kill your family.This is a game you will get involved with. You learn a little more of the story every time you beat a mission. It's like watching a mystery movie, except this time your the star. This is the type of game you won't kick yourself for buying. It's what I like to call a \"no risk\" purchase. It's going to keep your attention ATLEAST long enough to be worth the money. It takes a while to beat, unlike alot of these 4-5 hour long mission type games. It's a long story. If your looking for a game to get into, grab Max Payne. You will be VERY happy you did.P.S. Looking for another AMAZING game? Try Ghost Recon for the PC. It's my 2nd Favorite of the year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2002"}

Mok","summary":"Style over substance, resulting in insurmountable problems.","reviewText":"Max Payne is like an exaggerated version of a typical no-brains action movie.  On one hand, the heightened action, the thrilling &quot;bullet-time&quot; innovation, and arsenal of weapons get your adrenalin pumping; on the other, incredibly bad stylistic choices prevented me from enjoying this game to the max.First, the plusses.  I am a *big* fan of John Woo's action movies, and Max Payne's action gameplay evokes them very well.  I had been suspicious of the &quot;bullet-time&quot; technique before playing the game, but it turned out to be pretty easy to use, and yes, it does look dead gorgeous.  Control of the character is pretty fluid, and your control over your jumps feels quite snug.  Just the look of the surroundings and the characters in-game is great, with beautiful lighting effects, explosions, and good detail.And now on to the problems...For a game that champions its stylistic conceits so vocally, Max Payne fails disastrously in the area of aesthetics.  True, the explosions and gunfights look good (though pretty damned violent), but why, oh why did they not bother to cast proper actors to play the characters?  When the characters are just drawn in computer, they look fine.  But whenever they use photo captures, such as during the drop-dead boring &quot;graphic novel&quot; sequences, all the characters look like they are either played by people in the development team and their friends, or they had found actors so bad, so thoroughly incapable of dramatic expression, that they look like people in a game development team.  Either way, Max Payne features the worst acting I've ever seen even in video games, and their image is equally atrocious:  &quot;Mona&quot; looks like a twentysomething neighbour rather than a mob hitwoman, and Max himself looks so much the dolt that it's a real drag playing as him.  Not to mention the fact that he CAN'T SHUT UP.  The comic-book aspect of the game's style is easily the worst idea they had.  By translating comic-book-style writing into direct voice-over, Max Payne shows just how bad comic-book writing is as a whole.  This stuff was never meant to be said out loud.  Of course, the writers (if you could call them that) were so enamoured with every syllable they had written, they used everything -- serving to bog down the one element of this game that works, which is the action.  And the graphic novel parts look just ridiculous, but take up about 30% of your gametime if you let them play out.  Comic books are very hard to take seriously, and when you try to mix this style with the melodramatic, dead-serious style of the John Woo movies this game emulates, you have an absolute stylistic disaster.  This was why when Max encounters his dead baby and wife, I actually burst out laughing.  The terrible acting and writing, served up in Hong Kong melodrama style, entirely sabotaged any engagement I might have had in Max's situation.The two &quot;drug sequences&quot; were actually a pretty neat idea, but they screwed it up by designing mazes and long, arduous &quot;puzzles&quot; that would make your eyes glue up, so unengaging and drawn out are they.  This game is very weak on the puzzle front.  Where games like Syphon Filter and Medal of Honor keep you interested by making sure you always know what your objectives are at any given point, in Max Payne, it's usually a matter of walking through the level and trying to use/shoot everything in sight in a trial-and-error attempt to find what the game developers want you to do next.  Sometimes you can find the right door, but you have to wait for the pesky enemies to open it for you.  And in terms of level design, you end up having to go back to old places so often that it's drop-dead tiresome.I enjoyed the action portions of this game immensely.  But it seems to me this development team only succeeded in creating half a good game.  If Max Payne were as &quot;gritty&quot; as some reviewers called it, and if they had bothered to hire real actors rather than cast everyone they know, and if they had good writers who were dramatists rather than comic-book doodlers, they probably would've had an absolute classic on their hands.  As it is, Max Payne is a technical breakthrough, but its aesthetics are so twisted around that it's impossible not to deride its shortcomings.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2002"}

The threesome set out on a mission of vengeance, striking back against the five criminals who killed Sly's father and stole the Thievius Raccoonus.The Fiendish Five have split up and gone their separate ways since stealing Sly's book, so you'll traverse through five separate worlds.  Each world has seven main objectives that manifest themselves in the form of treasure keys. Once you've collected all seven keys, you can fight the world's boss.Aside from getting through the levels, there are also a few extra objectives in the game's standard levels. Each level has a collection of bottles hidden throughout. Once you collect all the bottles, you can open that level's vault and retrieve a page of the Thievius Raccoonus. Each page will give Sly an additional move, such as a forward dash attack, the ability to slow time down while jumping, and a high-speed roll. Each level has a time attack objective that becomes available once you've gotten a  key and all of its bottles. The most difficult part of the game is that Sly normally dies after taking just one hit. Collecting a lot of coins can bring this number up to two or three hits before Sly dies.One-hit deaths can be a little frustrating in a few of the game's more difficult portions.  With only a couple of exceptions, all the enemies die with one swing of your cane.

This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible.

Your on mars in a martial law type of environment and you land and your brother is blown away ( again it makes very little sense) and than your given a sledge hammer and you have to smash everything,i mean everything. Tedious gameplay! Makes no sense and is NOT FUN after first one minute !!!Than you get a gun which doesnt sound like a gun at all..Horrible sound effects ,,,than you use your seldge to smash more things. Than you go into suv and drive and drive and drive than you realuize your going wrong way turn around and drive more and than eventually your led to some more areas to seldge things apart and some bad guys around poor graphics( PLAYSTATION 1 like) .Than you get more very poor constant interaction with broken voices and really nonsense babble.

It has nice shooter design and awesome destructible environments. I had a lot of funwith this game. It took me 14 hours, but I could have played longer if I had wanted to.There is quite a bit of driving within the game. Most of the time I hate driving missions, but RFG's driving missions were mostly a lot of fun. There was an earlier mission I had trouble with, but I eventually beat it. Some missions are timed, but even these were fun. I also liked riding shotgun in the one mission type. It was fun to ride around and destroy stuff.Most of the missions are optional or even random. Random missions pop up when you are out and about. They are completely optional and there is never a penalty to skip or even fail them. I liked the destroy convoy random missions, they are fun. The optional missions are always on the map at certain areas. You just have to get to them and accept the mission. If you fail any mission in the game, you are allowed to retry them. Dying, however, will slightly lower morale in that sector.Morale is only needed to receive guerrilla helpers while fighting. Since the enemies respawn no matter what you do, these guerrilla locals will eventually die, and that reduces morale. They are still helpful, however, as there can be quite a few enemies to deal with at one time.The game has a threat meter. Green, yellow, orange, and red. At orange and red many enemies will spawn near you. This includes soldiers of various types, vehicles and air units. Destroying them will only add more as the threat level will increase. The game is called Guerrilla, and I found it wise to pull out and run whenever the threat level was too high. After the threat level drops, I would rearm and go back. Hit-n-run tactics will win the war.Destroying key buildings is a lot of fun. It lowers the control of the Earth Defense Forces in the sector. Also, some buildings will remove soldiers from the area, after the threat level drops. Then there the liberation missions. These are fun! Each mission will also lower control, accept the last mission. The last liberation mission will unlock once control is zero, and completing this mission will free the sector, allowing you to move on to the next sector.When buildings are destroyed they leave salvage. Vehicle and air unit destruction will also leave salvage. There are also mines scattered about the land that can give some salvage. Salvage is required to upgrade weaponry. Gathering lots of salvage is a good thing.The weapons are very cool. The basic weapon is the sledge hammer, useful in combat as well as destroying buildings, even land vehicles. It requires close range, always kills enemy soldiers and uses no ammunition. There are other weapons that unlock in the game. Explosive charges are also great. Once placed, they are set off with a controller key. The first unlocked weapon I did not care for, but then I found the right mix of weapons. You may carry four weapons at a time. Returning to a safe house allows rearming, but there are also supply boxes out and about. One weapon disintegrates the target, and this weapon is good to use against air units.While playing the game, the story plays out nicely. There are radio comments as well as the locals who talk about some of your exploits. The cut scenes are very nice.The graphics are outstanding considering how old this game is. I also liked the music, it was a little sci-fi and neat.Red Faction Guerrilla is a stable game, I had no issues while playing. No lockups are graphic problems. Destroying almost anything was a lot of fun. The liberation missions as well as driving around were both exceptionally terrific. This is a great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2014"}

Character'sThe game has many characters but in story mode u can only play the selected charactersSilver is a new chracter but i call him Pothead the porcupine. He has pyschic powers and is SLOW!!!!!!! Then there's Blaze from Sonic rush with speed, double jump and a fire dance attack, Shadow has fighting moves and sonic's got mach speed sections.2. StoryI call this the game that never happens after Shadow the hedgehog cause i feel this game is a time paradox game and has lots and lots of story. Might aswell try to talk about it.In Soleanna (inspired by Venice) the Festival of the Sun's opening ceremony is disrupted by the arrival of Doctor Eggman who seeks the Flames of Disaster from Princess Elise and captures her, before Elise tosses the blue Chaos Emerald to Sonic the Hedgehog who arrives there. He meets Miles \"Tails\" Prower and they rescue Elise, Tails distracts Eggman's robots while Sonic and Elise escape. Meanwhile, Shadow saves Rouge the Bat, who dropped the Scepter of Darkness that unleashes Mephiles the Dark, a creature in Shadow's image who reveals Shadow sealed him within the scepter ten years ago, before opening a wormhole which transports Shadow and Rouge to the future and post-apocalyptic world that is caused by the Flames of Disaster and a fiery monster named Iblis. There, Silver and his friend Blaze the Cat meet Mephiles who reveals Sonic as the Iblis Trigger, and sends the two back in time using the purple Chaos Emerald. Silver and Blaze are separated upon arrival, with Silver witnessing Eggman's attack on Soleanna and Sonic's departure. He meets Amy Rose who accompanies him to find but defends Sonic when they find him, while Eggman recaptures Elise. Sonic flees and meets with Tails and Knuckles the Echidna, before Eggman lures them into a trap sending them into the future where Tails discovers Elise and Eggman died one day before Iblis was released. Shadow and Rouge find a shutdown E-123 Omega, and reunites with Sonic, Tails and Knuckles. Using two Chaos Emeralds, they return to the present. Shadow faces Mephiles, but learns in the future he was imprisoned by Omega, blamed for the destruction. Shadow and Omega returns to the present-day.Shadow and Silver travel ten years into the past and learn Iblis and Mephiles are parts of the Duke of Soleanna's project to harness the power of the city's god Solaris. The Duke gives Shadow the Scepter of Darkness, which he uses to seal Mephiles, while Silver and the Duke seals Iblis into a young Elise's tears, the dying Duke asks his daughter not to cry for her tears could release Iblis. Sonic fails to reach Eggman's destroyed ship with Elise inside it, but Silver sends Sonic back in time so he can save Elise. With Shadow, Rouge and Omega defeats Mephiles' clones, Silver and Blaze (at the cost of her life) stop Iblis in the future.After surviving Shadow's attack. Mephiles holds up the purple Chaos Emerald in use and kills Sonic with an energy blade behind him, causing Elise to cry and unleash Iblis. Mephiles bonds with Iblis, recreating Solaris to rip the time-space continuum apart. As everyone mourns Sonic's apparent death, Silver notes that seven Chaos Emeralds' power would revive Sonic, telling everyone to find all of them. As they are all gathered, Elise gives Sonic CPR which allows him to transform into his super form who copies some of his powers to Shadow and Silver, and together they defeat Solaris. Sonic and Elise go back in time, finding Solaris' original form as a single white flame. Elise blows out the candle to erase Solaris from existence and the story's events so that Solaris can befriend Elise again, rebooting the time-space continuum. The game ends with Sonic watching Elise in the festival to show signs of recalling their friendship.3.GlitchesThere are many that are hard but i will explain 1 when u first fight Silver as Sonic u get to a certain part near a wall and silver will throw u outside the boss fight zone and some times in the air to the point it game breaks.Music is great the final boss fight u can use Super Sonic, Super Shadow, and lastly Super Silver.Finally the game has flaws and story problems but otherwise an ok game","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2012"}

The graphics are stunning and the gameplay is as focused and smooth as any you will find. The cel-shaded graphics are gorgeous - think Valve's Team Fortress 2 - and fit this game well.Personally, this is my second favorite Zelda after A Link to the Past,  and a smidge ahead of Ocarina of Tims, although I realize it is more critically acclaimed. But almost every Zelda is a &#34;9&#34; or better, and many of them approach legendary status with metacritic scores well over 95 and into all-time status rarified air.This is the epitome of an action-JRPG and Zelda has always done the JRPG elements so well. JRPGs focus on you playing a hero, such as games like Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Fire Emblem. American RPGs focus on playing YOU as the hero, with such games as Skyrim.This is one hell of a game and I really appreciate the work Nintendo put in the first times around and now revising it. I honestly hope they revisit Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Mario 64, any any others either as full HD re-releases or as high quality Virtual Console titles.I can't imagine a single person actually purchasing this game and regretting it.

This is one of the best games available on the Xbox 360, period.Vanquish has it all: bad voice acting, wacky Japanese attributes, cool weapons capable of utter destruction, ridiculous cut scenes and plenty of challenge. It's action packed and the controls are very precise, once you get the hang of them. The game definitely rewards you for sticking with it with a ton of gorgeous visuals and frenetic gameplay culminating in some of the craziest boss battles you're likely to see. There is an insane amount of detail in the graphics, even just in the intricacies of your character's suit. A lot of the stuff you'll see in this game will leave you with your jaw hanging open.The game is an amalgamation of plenty of other games, mixing in facets from Gears of War, Max Payne, Mass Effect and plenty of other familiar titles. Like I said earlier, the controls take a little getting used to but once you get the hang of them, you'll be zipping around the stage blowing away the legions of bad guys out to get you.The graphics and sound are a literal assault on the senses. The levels are huge and rendered impressively, giving you a true feeling of scope and vastness as you make your way through the space station under siege. Nearly every stage has something crazy happening in the background as you play and it makes the game even more of a spectacle. If you have a surround setup, every speaker will be active from the moment you start playing until you're done. Once you're done with the game, you can replay on the harder difficulties and even post up times to the leaderboards. The campaign is a bit short but what's presented here guarantees that you'll want to revisit this game soon after you're done with it.Platinum Games has a truly remarkable track record and speaking as a huge fan of their other amazing game Bayonetta, I can recommend this game whole heartedly.

{"product_name":"B00005J536","description":"This vehicular combat game brings the original developers of the popular Twisted Metal series back for a dark, eerie installment for the PS2. This version will have new weapons, veteran and rookie drivers, weather effects, and night driving.","reviewerName":"\"arxane\"","summary":"Perhaps the best vehicular combat game ever created!","reviewText":"Talk to any hardcore \"Twisted Metal\" fan, and they'll say two things: the first two games were excellent, and the next two were terrible, which can be attributed to the fact that the series changed hands between different developers. So when the original developers were brought back to the series, they decided to do one thing: rebuild the genre of vehicular combat from scratch. The end result is \"Twisted Metal: Black\", a darker, more sinister version of its Playstation cousins. But it's all for the best, because \"TM:B\" has to be the best game in the \"Twisted Metal\" series and one of the must-have titles of the Playstation2.There is a reason why this game has the subtitle \"Black\" attached to it. \"TM:B\" is one of those games that doesn't just meet the requirements of an M-rated title; it lives up to it. Themes found in this game include homicide, depression, suicide, self-mutilation, medical malpractice, and physical abuse. Don't believe me? Watch any of the game's characters' opening sequences (particularly Sweet Tooth's), and you'll understand why this game belongs in the same category as \"Grand Theft Auto III\".But the shock factor isn't just for show. The stories of all the twisted, demented characters are deep and powerful, giving them depth and personality. A player actually wants to help his chosen character win, actually wants his character to defeat all the other characters so that Calypso, the mysterious host of the Twisted Metal tournaments, can grant the winner what his heart desires. It's pulled off so perfectly that you'd almost forget you're rooting for a homicidal maniac or a fanatical preacher or whatever character you've chosen.In terms of gameplay, \"Twisted Metal: Black\" makes you earn your way through the game. The controls can be complex at first, but once they're mastered it's almost like second-nature. Each character has his own unique vehicle, and each vehicle handles differently. Some are slow but can take a ton of damage, while others are weak but are unbelievably fast. Each vehicle also has its own unique Special Attack. For example, Sweet Tooth's icecream truck can transform into a robot that fires a hailstorm of homing missiles, while Outlaw sends a stream of locked-on, powerful bullets from the roof of his police vehicle. And all other weapons like missiles and gas cans have their own unique placement on each character's vehicle; the game is worth buying just to see where the weaponry is located on each vehicle.The AI in the game can be described in one word: brutal. One mistake will result in serious damage, and each opponent knows when to fight and when to run. Players looking for a deep experience don't have to look farther than \"Twisted Metal: Black\". Probably the only fault in the gameplay is the lack of an all-out brawl in multiplayer. Players can fight each other in multiplayer, but not with any AI vehicles as well. The team battle mode does have an all-out brawl and somewhat makes up for it, but players in team battle mode share lives, which is questionable at best.Graphically, \"TM:B\" is amazing. Even with titles such as \"Metal Gear Solid 2\", \"Final Fantasy X\". and \"Grand Theft Auto III\" out already, \"Twisted Metal: Black\" still looks impressive. It runs at a solid frame rate, even in multiplayer, and the loading times are minimal. The frame rate does slow down occassionaly when the front-back view (looking in front and behind at the same time) is selected, but it's not really that important. The environments are dark and eerie, giving the game the atmosphere its title of \"Black\" proclaims, and most of them are massive, which is a testament to how the PS2 can be used probably. And the characters' vehicles are all detailed and uniquely designed, showing how dedicated the developers were to bringing the series back to its former glory.Soundwise, the game can't get any better. The dark music in each stage sets the mood right, and sounds like missile screams and explosions are top-notch. And the voice-overs for each character are Academy-Award worthy, making them believable and realistic. Listen to Sweet Tooth's movie sequences and you'll understand just how sinister he is. Listen to Billy Ray's sequences and you feel the immense pain in his heart. This level of realism brings vehicular combat to a new level of enjoyment.All in all, \"Twisted Metal: Black\" is undoubtedly a must-have for vehicular combat fans, and is a worthy addition to any PS2 owner's library. Be warned: this game lives up to its Mature rating; anyone who can't handle an R-rated movie should stay away from this game. But any gamer who is mature enough to handle \"Grand Theft Auto III\" should be more than comfortable with the dark nature of \"TM:B\". And the multiplayer shortcomings will be more than made up for when \"Twisted Metal: Black Online\" is released.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2002"}

In fact, I get annoyed when people look at something beyond the standard range of creative and their first thought is \"I wonder what drugs they were on?\" However, after playing this game I think I think I may have to revise my opinions on the matter. Describing this game as \"weird\" is to do an injustice to the word. When a game contains scenes with a Japanese schoolgirl saying things like, \"I feel it! I feel the cosmos!\"  you know has to be inspired by far too many mushrooms (which, oddly, feature throughout the game in sizes from very small to larger than a building).The plot, such as it is, is fairly simple: you play the Prince. Your father is the (somewhat dim), King of the Cosmos. One night during a drunken binge he managed to break all the stars in the sky. Now it's your duty to rebuild them!This rather insane goal of rebuilding stars is accomplished by going down to Earth with what's called a Katamari. You use this to roll over objects that then stick to the Katamari. You might at first only be able to snag paperclips, but before you know it, you'll be rolling up chickens, books, houses, people, mountains, major land masses, entire weather systems and Hindu gods.Controlling the Katamari is a fairly simple affiar. Those of you who are of a Certain Age will remember playing \"Battlezone\" in the arcades. Aside from being notable for being one of, if not the, first game to use vector graphics, it's also notable for using two joysticks to control the tank you drive. Driving your Katamari is much the same.No review of this game would be complete without mention of the award winning soundtrack, which, indeed, gets mentioned in every review I've read so far. It's an odd combonation of J-pop, jazz, swing and other things I can't even begin to describe. Trust me, you'll be humming... or singing... or whatever the heck it is you'd do... the theme music for weeks afterwords.The game has fairly high replay value and as the controls are so simple, the basics are easily mastered after only a few minutes. A lack of any sort of violence (aside from rolling up chickens, people, houses, etc), and the bright, colorful graphics makes it acceptable to people of pretty much any age. It's attractive price point, only $20 brand new and available used for about $15, make it even more worthwhile.All in all, it's a fine example of the same sort of Japanese whimsy that leads to games like Mister Mosquito, Super Monkey Ball and Frolf (all you need to know is that it combines frogs... and golf...). A fine addition to any PS2 collection. Indeed, your collection is bare without it.Interesting note: the game was never really a hit in Japan, but it, and it's two sequels (\"We (Heart) Katamri\" for the PS2 and \"Me and My Katamari\" for the PSP), have been very popular in the USA. What exactly does this say about us as a nation?Oh, well, it matters not. The sky needs me!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2007"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"256 Players, 0 Lagging","reviewText":"MAG stands for Massive Action Game is online only game that has you playing one of three factions. One is basically made up of Americas, another of Europe, and the last of Asia. Each faction fights online in battles from 64 to 256. To play battles that range from 256 players you will have to earn it by ranking up to level 8. Now when you enter, its not a everyone for themselves try to complete the objective.This game is completely team focused. You will be a part of a squad and have a team leader that is ranked (if I remember right) 16. He will give orders where to go and what to do. Teamwork with him and doing as he says will boost everyone else's stats to force teamwork.When you level up, you will gain a point but unlike Modern Warfare's perk system, you only can upgrade if you have enough points. You can enhance close combat, sniping, your rifle, and such to map your own skill tree how you want to play but the more you upgrade one branch, the more necessary points you will need.Now the game is very fun and enjoyable. For a game with so many people, I had a pretty damn great time with zero lag. You won't see a lot of campers as the maps are so huge and there are too many people running around. Sniping can be a bit of an issue but one thing that had annoyed me is constant grenades that you might encounter. Beyond that, there isn't much negative to say about the game. it doesn't have the quality graphics of Modern Warfare 2 but they are good enough. It holds up really well online and is a great experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E986","description":"","reviewerName":"Aaron Keating","summary":"The Forza we've all been waiting for.","reviewText":"My only real gripe with this game is the physics engine is still a hair off from where it should be. Real life counterparts are faster than their in game counterparts, I don't know if the testers for the cars in Forza ever got to study some of the current race cars and super cars alikes hero laps. It seems like the grip is just a hair low in Forza4 from where it needs to be. If they tweak the grip they'll be able to bury everyone I think. Some of the cars are still not accurate to their true to their real life counterparts (2002 Camaro and WS6 for example... seriously? who's 02 weighs 3500lbs? Mine weighs in at a sprite like 3280 with me in it. Maybe they got the most porked up optioned cars they could find??) Also, the cockpit view on some of these cars I think whoever did the driving and seating was a Midget. The dash on an 02 Camaro and TA do -not- take up half your view of your surroundings for example. Was the seat tester like 5'3\"? Definitely needs work there still. I'll just stick with the bumper and hood cams.My other gripe with car accuracy stems from the Cheat Cars. Sorry, Mosler doesn't make a world beater of a race car. If they did they'd have championships to their name. They Don't. I'd like to see them do actual testing with some of these cars so they can be embarrassed and at the bottom where they belong. (I'm still plenty quick in my R3 GT mind. it's just a gripe of mine that they seem to take it on faith about how fast some of the cars are from the manufacturer, when they aren't that fast IRL)Track Accuracy, Laguna's cork screw seems much more newbie friendly than I remember it being it's like they stretched it out which is kind of a shame. Otherwise I've not noticed any other significant disparities other than Sebring seems abit too smooth.Graphics, I'd like to see abit better shading on some of the cars, but this is easily the most beautiful that Forza has ever been. Tracks also look -much- better than they did previously.Sound, This is where Forza really excels especially compared to Gran Turismo. V8s sound like V8s. Ferraris, Chevys, Fords, and Dodges all have their distinctive notes, and it really really is worth getting a -good- quality sound system to enjoy the sounds of Forza. The cars almost sound like you are near them in real life. (at least with my less than .1 percent distortion system) The chevy's have that distinctive make you cream your pants rumble at idle, and sound like they are getting ready to destroy the world when they hit 8grand. The Fords have that distinct raspyness, the dodges lumpy and loud, and the ferraris scream at full throttle. I can sit in a test drive and listen to some of the engines at idle and smile.Controls, the controls are tight, fluid and intuitive. They are also customizable. Even the controller, as gimped as it is due to it's controller nature, is really apt in Forza4. I was surprised at the laps I could throw down with the 360 controller.Car Selection. They pretty much nailed every performance car you can think of. Unlike GT which seems to think you need 12 different honda civics, Forza gives those lame sauce cars a passing nod, and delves straight into performance icons and doesn't hold back. There's a few they missed that were sleepers in their day, that no one knew about but overall they did a great job. I am still waiting on my caddy XLR! (the coolest caddy ever made also one of the best handling) and Mid 90s Elderado! (2 dr.. with the 300 hp Northstar)I'd also like to see the Olds Aurora as it was a pretty quick car back in its day. The chevy Monza also needs a place in the game (people just -loved- stuffing big engines in this thing). There's a few Fords I'd like to see added as well as a couple of Mercuries and a Lincoln. Also no 80s Monte Carlo? 550 Marenello? Wtf? heh. There's also at the time of this review a whole slew of DLC cars, however the ones I've mentioned thus far aren't there yet. If you like Old Muscle, New Muscle, New Sports, and Classic Sports cars it's all here. You'll find at least 15 dream cars in your car porn list in this game.Tuning. Still no cylinder head replacement.. there's only so far you can port stock heads even with the marvel of modern CNC techniques. I'd -love- aluminum heads on my SBCs and fuel injection swap/upgrades on the classic V8s and that's just for starters. Tires.. I'd love to see a return of specific tire companies from Forza 2. I would also like to have Suspension swaps not just upgrades to the factory stuff, but I mean total replacement, like swapping in a C4 Corvette suspension into a classic Camaro, upgrading the trailing arms, panhard rod etc on an Iroc or later Gen 4 camaro and so forth. You can totally change the attitude of a car with a suspension swap and upgrade, Forza does a great job in this department otherwise but I think after 4 titles we definitely need to see the next step taken here.Engine swaps are also more limited than you can do in real life considerably. I'd love to see more variety in engine swaps. (Like a return of putting the 427 LS7 into everything you want again -for starters-... Duramax Diesel swaps, stuffing Ford engines into chevys vice versa and so forth)I would also like to see TCS adjustments. In Forza it's either on or off, but on most race cars you can actually dial in when the traction control takes over, and just how much intervention it performs.I would also like to see more body kits in this game for the domestic's particularly. There's some really trick stuff you can get for the American cars, and you are just so limited in this game. (like the kit that turns your C5 into a Neo C1 corvette).Online racing. Oh my god they brought back our private races. Thank you. So Very Much. The other game modes (ie not circuit racing) like Cat and Mouse are really fun (soccer sucks though.). Circuit racing is incredibly fun against other players and I still prefer it to anything else.That being said, the game is incredible. Absolutely the best racing experience you can have for the consoles. They just need to take the next step, on suspension and engine swaps and then adjust the grip slightly. I would buy this for a friend, easily.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2012"}

As a guy who has played a lot of post-apocalyptic games (yes, including Wasteland/Fallout -> Fallout 3), I have to admit that Borderlands hits that nice sweet spot between pure FPS and pure RPG.  In Borderlands, you pick one of four characters and get to go for a romp in a fun quasi-post apocalyptic wasteland that is part Mad Max and part Pitch Black.  Basically, you are on a different planet that is a rough and tumble outback world filled with nasty aliens, rogue humans, and lots of gunfights.  It's a good time.Borderlands is not as much an RPG as Fallout 3, for example -- your character is more of a Diablo style with skill trees rather than fully customizable.  Quests are also less elaborate, and a bit more on rails with areas unlocking for exploration only as you advance the plot.  Borderlands also reminds one of Mass Effect for its combat heavy emphasis and shield technology, but let's get down to some specifics:1)  Guns, guns, guns.  I knew Borderlands was hyping its \"17 trillion guns\" bit, but didn't realize quite how awesome this would be until I really got into it.  It really is amazing how varied the weaponry is.  With just a 20th level character, I've already found sniper rifles that launch explosive rounds, rocket launchers that set everything on fire in a 10 foot radius, scoped shotguns that put 8 slugs in a tight circle on target from 200 meters away, SMGs that fire 4 shots at a time and electrocute the target, and everything in between.  A good gun can really make a difference in a fight, such as finding a strong sniper rifle early, or getting a machine gun with a +60 round magazine that lets you walk up to someone and put a hundred rounds into their face.  Sometimes enemies drop guns, but more often you'll find yourself giddy as you open a sealed gun case and see a gleaming new rifle.  Really addictive.2)  Weapon proficiencies.  Instead of putting points into weapons skills as you level up, you gain bonuses for them the more you use them.  This is more realistic and a lot more fun, since it gives you a way to reinforce your powers through use.  Clearing a few caves with a shotgun will quickly net you added weapon bonuses that really pay off.  Separately you can also (starting at level 5) put points into your skill trees, so you can get some nice cumulative overlap.3)  Second wind.  One great concept is the \"second wind\" -- when you get KO'd, you get a few seconds to kill one of your foes and get a \"second wind\" that pops you back onto your feet.  This is particularly nice when you get overrun by mutant dogs or flying enemies without warning.  In a number of fights, I killed nearly every foe only to have the last couple take me down at close range.  With a second wind, you manage to survive -- and it is extremely gratifying.4)  Level resets.  One nice feature is that quitting and reloading the game resets all the areas, so you can farm areas repeatedly for EXP, different guns, and the like.  This lets you level up if you are having problems, make money, and get those weapons you wanted.Now, a few negatives:1)  No armor.  Your character gets a wide array of selections between guns, grenades, and shield generators.  However, there is no other armor in the game.  This seems like a big oversight and cuts into the customizability of your character a fair amount.  It would be nice to have slightly less guns in exchange for boots, gloves, helmets etc.2)  Level-specific foes.  Enemies have a high respawn rate and scale somewhat based on your level.  This usually works fine, although you will face a lot of dangerous and accurate enemies.  One problem however is that you seem to do less damage against higher level enemies.  In particular, if a foe is much stronger than you, your weapons do almost no damage, while theirs will destroy you.  This might be an effort to keep your level growth under control, but you usually find out through trial and error.  I had a character go up a level in the middle of a fight, and he went from doing 20 damage to some high level raiders to doing over 100.  It was pretty strange.3)  The graphics in the game are interesting and appealing, but there are some unfortunate bug effects.  Despite a nice strong jumping ability, it is possible to get stuck in the terrain, which can also effect enemies.  NPC scripts can sometimes get broken if interrupted by fights or the like, usually requiring a reload (for example, I've had that little droid from the start of the game freeze up a few times, meaning you can't get through a gate and the game is basically broken).4)  There are vehicles you can drive around in, which is another nice feature.  They also make good heavy weapons platforms if you are having problems with higher level monsters.  However they are also a little buggy -- I had one simply blow up for no reason (and with full shields), and another get stuck on some rocks that wouldn't let me exit and required a reload.  And reloads take forever.All in all, Borderlands is a fun game with much to recommend itself.  Popping people with a sniper rifle and then cleaning up with a shotgun or assault rifle is a simple joy that is endlessly repeated.  If you're looking for a FPS with character development, or an RPG with lots of fighting, this is your game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002Z7BE24","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Very much like Resident Evil 4, for better and for worse. Excellent co-op play","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4 was one of the best games of the 6th generation of consoles. It turned the Resident Evil franchise on its head, delivering a tense, frantic game with an over-the-shoulder perspective that influenced nearly every action game that came after it. It maintained the nerve-wracking intensity of the previous games in the series while making it much more action-oriented in a way that resulted in perhaps the finest game in the series thus far. Four years later, with the 7th generation of consoles now in full swing, Capcom released Resident Evil 5, a game that looks, plays, and feels a lot like its predecessor. This is a good and a bad thing.For some reason, Capcom did not update the control scheme at all in the intervening 4 years after the release of RE4. While games like Dead Space have taken the basic RE4 control scheme and evolved it to match modern sensibilities, it is quite odd that Capcom decided to not change this at all. Controlling Chris and/or his new partner Sheva feels very lumbering and tank-esque in the modern era. Sure, the controls work, and once you get re-acclimated with them, the game is quite playable, but it is very odd that Capcom decided not to update the game's controls. Also, the structure of the game feels very much the same. The game moves from exploring & gathering into intense action against humans who have been infected with a plague, just like Resident Evil 4 did.Luckily, because Resident Evil 4 was such a good game with such excellent core concepts, Resident Evil 5 also happens to fare quite well. It's a very fun game, especially on some of the game's more brilliant levels, such as an crocodile-infested swamp and a Raiders of the Lost Ark-esque room with an elaborately designed set of traps and passages. The game looks pretty good and features some phenomenal sound design. What really sets the game apart is the inclusion of co-op, which really is the way this game was meant to be played. Exploring the levels and fighting the horrific Majini with a partner is a ton of fun. Solving the game's co op-centric puzzles is satisfying, and having each player specialize in different weapon sets bring forth lots of new tactical options in dealing with the hordes of parasite-infected Majini.The Gold Edition exclusive to PS3 contains DLC containing additional story episodes and multiplayer gameplay modes, as well as a slew of new extras to dive into. For me, the best thing about the Gold Edition was the support for Playstation Move, which is an excellent way to play the game. The Move controls work great and made aiming a breeze.So in the end, Resident Evil 5's strong resemblance to its predecessor is both a curse and a blessing. If you were a fan of Resident Evil 4, and enjoy co-op gameplay, I highly recommend this game. If you are looking for a more cutting edge single player experience like Resident Evil 4 was upon its release, the Dead Space franchise would be a much better bet for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2013"}

Walk down a hallway, and all of the sudden a fire demon busts through the cement wall, or enter the streets again from the sewers and try not to get stepped on by a 100 foot golem composed of pipes, cars, rocks, whatever magnetized together by magical energy from Pandora's box. The scenarios in this game are just insane and will make your jaw drop.Cons:Monsters keep respawning most the time, or you have to kill a set number of them before you can move on with the game. I guess you could say it's a boss fight, but instead your killing 30 werewolfs instead. There is boss fights were you have to kill just one boss, but it just varies. Other then that, the monsters will just keep respawning every 20 seconds after you kill them off, and when your trying to look for your objective, it can get pretty frustrating and it takes alot away from the fun factor.~This game is unbelievably hard, even on normal. I don't quit many games, but I got to this boss fight were I had to kill spirit werewolfs, and in order to shoot them, you have to turn them physical with one of your powers, and in order to get your power meter up to even use your power, you have to kill things, and I couldn't kill werewolfs because I couldn't shoot them because I ran out of power, so yeah. I started over and played on easy after that, but eventually I got caught on something else just as stupid. So I had to trade this one in. But if anyone wants a really hard challenge with some killer graphics, then I recommend this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2013"}

Same call of duty but a different story.  They changed a couple things in multiplayer.  One of the biggest changes that they finally did was at a file share to multiplayer (exactly like they do in Halo) which is cool.  Other than that it is the same call of duty with a new story.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2010"}
