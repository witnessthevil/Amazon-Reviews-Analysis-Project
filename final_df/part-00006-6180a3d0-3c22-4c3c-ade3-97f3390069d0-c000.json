Even though Unreal Engine has seemingly become much more ubiquitous than id tech.And RAGE is definitely impressive. The detail is sharp, but the draw distances and levels are truly grand. I'm not sure how it stacks up with like the Frostbite engine, but it does a pretty good job.This is basically two games. One is a shooter component. The other is a demolition derby car component. Both are done well enough. The enemies are standard fare, but they have some tricks. Like, melee enemies will juke and dive like Emmitt Smith while they run towards you. range enemies use cover well and so on.The enemies also seem to have an inordinate amount of HP. Which results in rattling your rifle and running out of ammo trying to kill them. This is a little frustrating, since one of the joys of shooters is seeing the enemy go splat with a quick shot. Here, you shoot and shoot and they keep on coming at you. When you finally kill one, it's like an eventuality.The game world has some neat art stylings, but it was also very linear. Yes, it is open-world, but you really can't do much with it other than go to quests. And the quests basically go like, enter area. Shoot up stuff. Get to to end of area. Door to outside magically appears. step out door. go back to base.There are some areas of creativity in manufacturing stuff, but mostly it's just shoot everything in a room till it's dead and then move on to next area. And shooting everything in room till dead takes some time since the enemies have a lot of HP.The interface is truly bad in this game. ID is supposed to be a PC company, right? So why is everything consolized? The worst offender to me was weapon switching. You can only switch 4 weapons at a time, despite carrying 9. This is for the d-pad obviously, but with a mouse I should be able to go through all of the weapons using the scroll wheel. Unless it's not the emphasis.I beat the game and it ended. I wasn't left with a feeling of awe, more like relief that it was over.hopefully we'll see impressive use of this tech in future games. hopefully those games will be better than this game.Oh, and one last point, make sure to defrag your hard drive before playing this game. The game apparently needs a good hard disk subsystem due to some streaming tech. If your hard drive is fragmented, get ready for periodic hanging of the game while it searches for the bits of data. For me, it was like 2-3 seconds every 2-3 minutes. Pretty bad.Defrag solves that.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

Here's a brief breakdown if you're a diehard fan of RF Guerrilla. The graphics are slightly better with an improvement in overall physics, movement and the lighting effects are fantastic. The controls have a more first-person shooter approach with excellent aiming and reticle (with an upgrade that you can see the enemies remaining life). Overall sounds are a HUGE improvement over Guerrilla with pounding shotgun blasts and tumbling concrete/twisted metal. The guns no longer sound like toys and the voice acting is on-par with Guerrilla (sounding like SyFy movies...lol). As for gameplay... well, here is where it changes. If you're a hardcore fan of the previous game and you want a complete overhaul... you will be disappointed. It's not open-world by any means and IMO it resembles Resistance 2/ Dead Space with it's linearity. But if you actually enjoyed those games and expected a fun sequel, you will LOVE this one!! Being linear gives it a more direct and powerful approach to actually using every weapon and strategizing an attack. The demo only shows you 1/10 of what you can do in this game but if you enjoyed it, you will have hours of entertainment with the full version.Edit:I have yet to beat the game because of the Infestation mode. It really brings a challenge to the gameplay and trying to beat 30 waves on all 10 stages (I think)... alone or online... is really fun. Also for those trophy hunters, this game is not impossible to platinum and looks quite enjoyable to achieve (Hit and Run with vehicle, Kill 5 aliens with one Impact).After reading so many bad reviews, it's certain that a lot of people are obsessed with the idea that this is not a sand-box game... therefore, it sucks.

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Nick Watkins \"Nick Watkins\"","summary":"Sad to see it go...","reviewText":"I have had a N64 since early 1997. From that time until late 2001, I had purchased over 30 games. This system has served me well. In late 2001, I bought a Playstation 2, but it's nothing like what the N64 (was) to me. I would spend hours a day playing Banjo-Kazooie, Super Mario 64, Goldeneye, and others. And the games actully lasted long amounts of time. Sure, they didn't have as good cinamatics as the PS1 versions did, but they lasted long! For example, I beat Banjo-Kazooie in a course of a year and a half. Then I beat Spyro the Dragon in 3 weeks. See my point? So, even though I now have a PS2, it'll never, ever be anything like the N64, and even though they now have all these great new systems, N64 will always be the greatest.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"ACEMAN1 \"HERE TO PISS YOU OFF\"","summary":"NEVER GETS OLD 9.5 OUT OF 10","reviewText":"This was the first real game I ever played along with the first I ever owned.

K \"Esco\"","summary":"For Those Who Prefer Intense Fear Over Cinematic Fear","reviewText":"As you could guess, being a film student and all, that I prefer slightly the cinematic fear of the Biohazard/Resident Evil series over this, much more eerie style of fear, but that doesn't mean that this game didn't scare me as much, if not more.What's so great about Silent Hill is that the danger has a sense of reality to it, unlike in Resident Evil where you really just fight some monsters who jump through windows at you and watch some highly entertaining scenes. The fog adds a new element of fear, in which something might be out there; and with the radio, you KNOW when there is an unseen terror lurking in the shadows or precipitation. Real life is more like that: where you can't see your enemies, not where they are just big enough to withstand several direct shotgun shots.However, enough comparisons to the horror-king series, because this game is neither better nor worse. This game is simply different. Your hero isn't a cop, and the disaster is much more philosophical and fantastic than scientific, which isn't just Resident Evil, but also Parasite Eve. This isn't as much X-Files as it is the Twighlight Zone.The story is about Harry Mason, an average Joe, coming to the resort town: Silent Hill, with his daughter. What he doesn't realize is that at that very time, the forces of darkness are struggling, almost fighting one another. As a result, there are many dead people around, and the town itself is now pulsating with evil. Sometimes he'll leave a building, where the time of day, or the design of the town will change within seconds, right before his eyes. However, after each boss battle, all the super-levels of darkness will subside, and the daytime will come about again, where the danger is much more scarce; it's kind-of like Castlevania II: Simon's Quest (a true classic), where there are times of light evil, and times of overwhelming evil. However, unlike Simon's Quest, you cannot just wait it out.The main point that I'm trying to make, is that this game is easily as scary as Resident Evil, but it's less in the real world; yet, it has a strange sense of familiarity to it. However, if you were brought up with the other survival horror world, than don't expect this to just me one of the better entries; this is it's own unique bloodline (well, Fear Effect was similar, but THIS is MUCH MUCH BETTER!!). I know horror players who have given up on this game due to the fact that it is too scary. I have myself, and I'm sure all these other reviewers did as well.

But I am also glad they evolved to make something different.At first glance, yes it is an FPS. (WHAT?? I rather play MW3 or BF3... ??) Hold your horses, the emphasis is different.The campaign is fun but is not the real point of the game. This game is made for multiplayer. And the producers made sure to make this game different from the regular FPS.First off, Co-op campaign mode. This is admittedly fun, and make up a large chunk of the whole game. It is well designed and very entertaining, with its own storyline. It is very hard to find a game with good co-op campaign.Second, multiplayer online feels very different from run and gun. Teamwork is very important if you want your team to win. I shall not say too much to repeat what online reviewers are already saying, but that is the direction the game is heading.Overall, it plays more like Left4Dead than Call of Duty. So, no, it is \"not another FPS\". Many people who had negativity towards the game changed their minds after trying the multiplayer demo.So do not judge this game too fast.

Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd.

Yes i have played everyone that came out. dont listen to these one star reviews about a game freezing and stuff, every game has a game that freezes, its just a part of life. if you are a splinter cell fan go buy this game or if you are new to the series buy it to you can not go wrong. the controls are pretty simple but run very smoothly. the graphics are awsome. you have more guns then the old splinter cells but not as many gadgets. im just talking about the single player campain here by they way. this games takes everything a stealthy gamer wants or a run and gunner. you will be addicted from the opening cut scene.so i finally finished the game and i loved every minute of it. the story was good and the action was awsome. it took everything i love in a video game and put it into one game. it is very short though, so if your not into online then rent this game. i am into online and i know i will be playing this game for a long time. i tried out one of the online modes it was the hunter mode. you go around with a teammate and just have to kill all the bad guys. it was fun working as a team with your partner and just kicking but lol. i cant wait to get home and play some more online tonight. cant wait to play the coop campain. hopefully there are some good people online that want to play it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAVA","description":"Battle the insidious Umbrella Corporation and the flesh-eating zombies and horrific beasts they have unleashed in their twisted bio-tech reign of terror.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Long, hard, and satisfying","reviewText":"Resident Evil Code: Veronica X is a port of the original Dreamcast game, and includes the extended cutscenes from the later PS2 version. You are Claire Redfield, and must escape from an island controlled by the Umbrella Corporation. You'll battle zombies, mutant animals and other abominations of nature. Halfway through the game you'll journey to the antarctic, and you'll take control of Claire's brother Chris as he tries to rescue her.I've completed all the Resident Evil games with the exception of the Rebecca Chambers prequel, and Code: Veronica is a rather lengthy and intricate, yet difficult adventure. This is the first game where I've had to restart from the very beginning multiple times because I simply used up my ammo and healing items too quickly. The programmers weren't shy about placement of many of the \"harder\" enemies (such as the Tyrant-esque Bandersnatches or the infamous Hunters), and while usual player instinct is to gun these creatures down, there are even tougher boss monsters further in the game that need the ammo. Also, the more powerful weapons and ammo seem to be hidden on optional sidequests and backtracking, so players who don't really explore every area to its fullest are outta luck later on.Otherwise, Code: Veronica has probably the most complex storyline of all the games, and it's set up in such a way that just when you think the game's coming to a close, you've only reached the halfway point. The voice-acting is typical Resident Evil, earnest in a deliberate B-movie kinda way but with one or two miscast actors (read: Steve). This is also the only game (excluding RE4) with full 3-D backgrounds and a dynamic camera.So should you buy the Gamecube port? If you have a Dreamcast or PS2, you can find those versions for much cheaper. Storywise the game is worth it, but of course the graphics are somewhat dated, even if the atmosphere is still convincing. Best bet for Gamecube owners is to find a cheaper, used version before shelling out big bucks for the retail price. Capcom has stopped production on this port, so don't expect it to come cheap.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2005"}

I can easily write a 4 page essay to accompany this.>>>>To support you (the customer) who hasnt bought this game yet and is reading these reviews in hopes of finding something worth the dollar. You (the customer) will ultimately hate this game and feel cheated for your hard earned currency.this is the part where I have to convince you why....its also the hardest part because there are SO MANY PROBLEMS that take away the ENJOYMENT of playing DIABLO 3.to put it in perspective...you will not notice the problems at first, you might even say to yourself, these 1,000+ people on amazon are crazy for writing poor reviews. This is a review for hardcore players mainly.What are the issues with this long awaited game?you cant play single player offline, you have to be online at all times in order to play the game! You have to wait during \"maitenance schedules\" which means blizzard turns off the servers and you dont get to play until they are done \"fixing\" problems which can take anywhere from 4-5 hours or even the whole day. You cant be disconnected in hardcore mode or you will automatically lose your character, even if the problem is caused by blizzards server you cannot request for a revive or have your 100+ hours of work returned to you, you lose not because you played the correct way but because blizzard lacks the responsibility to maintain a safe and secure network. You are online the whole time, if your router, a storm comes any sort of problem occurs, you cannot reverse it, your hardcore character is screwed!There are hackers who are depeleting people of their in-game money, hacking peoples accounts and changing login information, there are patches that make the game worse and there is also an auction where you purchase items for your character. thats right you dont need to farm anymore you purchase! in fact its required that you purchase in order to progress. the game also takes away the fun when you realize everything is  \"cookie cutter.\" a cookie cutter is a system where the game forces the player to choose certain stats for the character they are playing without giving the player the freedom to choose for his/herself. you are playing blizzards way, you are not playing your way.once you see these problems clearly, there is no more fun for the game, the replay-ability is gone. your 60$-100$ is also gone, and deposited into a billion dollar sharehold no longer holding the title \"blizzard north.\"You are just another crazy amazon reviewer, what are you talking about?To be honest I feel cheated. I waited 10 years for this \"amazing\" game! Ive been through the first the second diablo the expansion, anyone from that time period who enjoyed the franchise for what it was would be a fool not to have purchased d3 from launch. Its sad to see that these companies are not respecting anymore what customers want, they are making everything a business and putting down rules that break players freedom in enjoying the game.first there was the change in graphics, the toned down gore, the short story, the lag, the lag spikes, people filling up chat with ads from china, items becoming useless without buying from ah, problems with playing hardcore without being paranoid of blizzards servers, having to wait for maitenance periods. I just want to enjoy the game,  I dont want any problems. I dont want to wait 10 years to discover there are still problems. Why blizzard? You are a billion dollar company. billion dollars! you have laid off workers to make more money, you have screwed the community into buying this game based on a franchise that used to be reputable. You have turned it all into a business for the benefit of yourselves.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Just plain awesome","reviewText":"The X-Men Legends series were a couple games that were unusually good for a licensed game series; combining Marvel's merry mutants with RPG elements in a Diablo-esque style and atmosphere.  Marvel Ultimate Alliance takes everything the X-Men Legends games have set up and considerably ups the ante; starting with a huge cast of Marvel universe characters to play as, team up with, and fight in environments that touch almost every aspect of the Marvel universe.  If you're the least bit familiar with the X-Men Legends style of play, Marvel Ultimate Alliance will fit like a glove.  The storyline involves the latest sinister plot by Dr. Doom, which unites a host of Marvel heroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Thor, Iron Man, Elektra, Ghost Rider, Blade, Doctor Strange, the Fantastic Four, the Silver Surfer, Moon Knight, Luke Cage, Deadpool, and Spider-Woman to take on Doom and a horde of villains including Galactus, Loki, Mephisto, Blackheart, the Mandarin, M.O.D.O.K., Fin Fang Foom, the Super Skrull, Ultron, and more.  As you progress through the game, you'll earn enchancements and new abilities; all of which are surprisingly rewarding.  The gameplay is surprisingly deep as well, and the co-operative play and online capabilities (and this is the PS2 remember now) are excellent as well.  The graphics aren't anything super special, but they serve their purpose, while everything else about the game is a real treat.  Best of all, even if you're not into traditional RPG's, Marvel Ultimate Alliance is easy to just pick up and play.  The fact that we are given this huge list of characters to play as and fight is great enough as it is, but the fact that each one controls and reacts like their comic book counterparts is something all the sweeter.  All in all, Marvel Ultimate Alliance is just plain awesome, and even if you've never played the X-Men Legends games or don't like RPG's but dig the Marvel universe, you should definitely give this a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2006"}

Here Comes the Pain's TV-style presentation will also be enhanced with new dynamic camera angles, improved audio, Superstar voiceovers, realistic animations and improved arena and crowd elements.","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"A good, but very unbalanced game","reviewText":"Another year, another wrestling game...and Smackdown 5 is a darn good one at that, but its not without its fair share of problems.The graphics in the game are very nice...characters look very lifelike, though are unrealistically shiny...it looks like the wrestlers got dipped in wax before they came out to the ring. Otherwise the characters all look great, and look almost exactly like their real selves, though there are some noticeable differences. For example, Eric Bischoff looks more like Andy Richter from Late Night with Conan O'Brien, and Sable looks about 20 years younger than she actually is in reality. There is also blood in the game now, but for some reason female wrestlers do not bleed...I guess it isn't 'politically correct'.The sound is fairly decent, though this game is noticeably lacking commentary and voices of any sort. The least they could've done was add some of the wrestler's one-liners (&quot;If you smell what the Rock is cooking&quot; or &quot;Can you dig it, Sucka?&quot;). The music is almost the same as the last game during matches and the actual action sound effects are virtually identical.There are meters to determine how much damage you have done to you and how much damage you are inflicting on your opponent. This is a nice change, since it allows you to keep your attention on whatever part of your opponent's body is weakest by checking their status. The controls were somewhat changed, with now 2 types of Reversal buttons: one for Grapples, and one for Strikes. By jamming the corresponding button you may be able to reverse the attack. However, this latest version of Smackdown has quite possibly the worst reversal system I've ever seen in any wrestling game.Trying to fight the computer AI is basically a push and shove match...most of the time it comes down to who can't reverse in time, and if you're lucky you'll get a move in there. While some may think that this makes the game more fun because it calls for quicker reflexes, I just think it makes the game more long and drawn out and the matches get boring quicker. And running at a wrestler while he's dazed and trying to hit him in the back with a chair seems to be impossible...AI opponents almost always reverse weapon attacks. When they are on the ground, the weapon attacks miss half the time, and all other times, whether they are facing you or not, they grab the weapon right out of your hand, which makes weapons in this game utterly useless. And the referees are now invincible...you absolutely cannot touch them unless its completely by accident. They reverse anything and everything you do to them. You can also get disqualified for punching a referee one or two times.There are now multiple types of grapples, which makes for a heavily expanded movelist for wrestlers and is a very cool feature. This makes your wrestler's repertoire very diverse and learning your favorite wrestler is now more fun.This is one of the worst games yet in terms of balance, however. Characters like Brock Lesnar or Goldberg, though understandably very strong in real life, are ridiculously powerful in this game. With only one move, Brock Lesnar or Goldberg can defeat any opponent. I once was laid out in a single punch by Brock Lesnar and I lost the match. While it shows how tough these characters are, it makes for an incredibly annoying and unfair matchup. These characters are also virtually invincible...it takes up to 10 minutes of pounding them before they even begin taking damage on any of their body parts, yet they can wipe out other wrestlers in a single blow.Created Wrestlers are useless. They are so weak and pathetic that they cannot possibly hold their own against any of the real wrestlers in the game. I find it funny to watch my created Hulk Hogan get obliterated by Sable in a matter of 2 minutes. You are very limited in distributing attribute points for you created wrestlers, and there is no point to using them in season mode, unless you like to lose alot. Although you gain experience points in Season mode that you can use to increase the stats of your created wrestler (or ANY wrestler for that matter), its very irritating and you'll just end up losing most of the time by using the created superstar.There are tons of storylines to become involved in which is fun, but one of the game's weakest points is its lack of roster. This is one of the smallest rosters I've seen in any wrestling game since the first Smackdown for the Playstation. Some of WWE's biggest current stars are not even in the game, which is pretty lame. Some of the wrestlers aren't even wrestling anymore...about 9 of them are 'Legends' which have retired over a decade ago. Some, like the Million Dollar Man Ted Dibiase and Sgt. Slaughter are fun, but don't get excited...their entrances are lame and none of their entrance themes are in the game. Many wrestlers in the game don't even have their current themes, speaking of which. Some wrestlers have old themes, and some don't have their own themes at all, just midi remixes.Overall this is a fun game that will keep you entertained. The Create-a-Wrestler mode hasn't changed at all from the previous year, other than the fact that its easier to customize clothing now. Wrestling fans should adore this game if they can get past its shortcomings. I enjoy it very much, but I feel that it is lacking alot of key aspects that would've made it probably the best wrestling game yet. There's always next year's game to improve.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2003"}

Great story telling, won't mention anything to not spoil. Combat becomes a bit repetitive that is the truth, but you are a Roman soldier, with an armor, a sword, spears, a shield and a scorpio (stationary flame arrow thrower) in some areas. Those are your weapons and you fight man to man as a Roman soldier would do, with your skills and agility to survive. In some areas you will lead a formation of soldiers all at once to penetrate some enemy areas (pretty awesome), where all protect themselves or attack at your command. Also you can unleash your rage when you have filled one of the meters and attack very fast and unchallenged for a few seconds (good for some of the boss fights). It is not button mashing, you need a strategy to attack, push, block and evade to survive. Executions are gory and brutal even still a bit repetitive too. At higher levels, if you do not execute quickly when the icon appears, your enemy will continue fighting if you miss the short window. Many times you will be outnumbered and you need those skills to stay alive. Also you have some heavy attacks that can open almost any opponent guard. The single player consists of 8 (VIII) acts or chapters, each one taking around an hour each. A bit shorter than I expected but sweet. At the end you finish with a feeling of accomplishment and an epic and big ending.  I have not tried the multiplayer yet. If you have an Xbox One, then it is a recommended game. I am giving 4 out of 5 stars. From 1 to 10, it would be like an 8.5. Great original story. Recommended and enjoyable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2013"}

If you are trying to aim and there's a tree or another obstacle in front of you, it won't let you see where the ball would land were the obstacle not there.  You have to mess around endlessly to put the aiming grid where you want it.  Also, the top view is much harder to aim with than it was in Golf 64.  The aiming on the green is not bad using the C-stick but it's *very* sensitive so it takes some getting used to.Also, when you putt, sometimes the camera lingers on your player instead of showing you the ball... you have to rely on the sound to know if you made the shot or not.Everything else improves on Mario Golf 64, with (eventually) six courses of amazing hilly terrain and water effects, new \"fast fairways\" (that you don't always want to land on) and easy-to-implement backspin and topspin. (I love how the spinning ball burns a streak in the fairway). The ring shot, speed golf and club slots are back, along with a par-3 contest and a slew of excellent mini-games.The play is very goal-oriented, and outside the tournaments, the other players \"invite\" you to play them one by one... when you beat them, you increase their maximum drive - a nice touch.  You can earn more characters by defeating the mini-games and collecting birdie badges as in the N64 version.The new characters, including Boo, Petey Pirahna, Baby Bowser and Birdo, are welcome, and they all have great animations, including one that's a little shocking but funny... Petey Pirahna vomits a huge puddle on the green when he gets a bogey.This version also has much more room to save your best shots (like holes-in-one), and you can \"lock\" your favorite ones so they don't get automatically erased as they do in Golf 64.One thing I wish the newer games would take from NES Open is the cash collection mode.  In NES Open, you won cash for placing in tournaments and for winning long drive contests, etc., which you could deposit and save in a bank.  It was fun seeing how much you could get.  You could also name all 40 of the other players in the tournament.

I'd like to analyze Capcom's strategy here for a moment, as my feelings about this version parallel the GCN version quite closely...  but before I do that I would like to congratulate them on making this game as close to the original as they did. It may not look quite as good as the GameCube version, but its close enough that most people may not notice a difference without having it pointed out, and being that the PS2 is a technologically weaker system than the GameCube pulling this off must have been a nightmare, especially in only nine months.Ironically Capcom corporate ordered Production Studio 4 to port this over. It was not something series creator Shinji Mikami wanted done. He made very clear that Nintendo was his system of choice when he declared that he would rather cut his own head off than port the game to another console. Once more the corporation trumps the desires of the artist, much to the delight of PS2 owners everywhere... who incidentally aren't buying this port.The GCN version was expected to sell over a million copies, and during it's first three months it seemed that it would, but then something unexpected happened. Though the game debuted at # in January 1 on the sales chart and stayed there until the middle of March Capcom's premature announcement of a PS2 version with added content shot the sales of the game in the foot. Capcom's idea was \"despite what our artists want we can make more money on the PS2\". A Capcom representative posted in a blog I read that \"Capcom has had enough of loosing money on Nintendo\" and so the game came out to PS2... only to debut at #3, and to slip to # 4 in its sales. Why? Has the PS2 lost it's love for Resident Evil? Probably not, but let's examine the strategy.1. Announce the game as an exclusive for a platform capable of realizing the artistic vision of the director.2. Force said director to port it over to a system he is well known to hate, and force him to add additional content against his will.3. Announce that a \"better\" version will hit said weaker system later on.4. Be perplexed that people are now going to hold off on the purchase of said game until the \"better\" version comes out.5. Launch the \"better\" version on a dying, weaker system just before the launch of a super powerful new Xbox 360, as well as an onslaught of highly anticipated new titles for Xbox and PS2.6. Be surprised that the game isn't having strong sales...Let's take a look at what Capcom did wrong, shall we?1. Never announce a directors cut 2 months in advance of the release of the original game.2. Never launch said directors cut on a competing system without offering the original system and it's fans an alternative with the same features.3. Never launch a port of an \"older\" game against the launch of a shiny new more powerful console.4. Wouldn't have made more sense to have ported this to XBox 360, or even PS3 with improved the graphics, and sound, and then put in all the additional content on a version that could be universally improved? I imagine, were that done, and if the game were announced, say 5 months after the game debuted on the GCN, then perhaps Capcom could have the blockbuster hit that this gem of a game deserves to be for multiple platforms.Regardless, I am highly impressed that the PS2 version looks as good as it does, I must confess I was skeptical of the system's ability to handle it, and while there is more aliasing, weaker, muddier textures, fewer polygons, cut scenes that have been converted to FMV rather than running off the game's engine, poorer lighting effects, and fewer particle effects the game absolutely still holds up the to GCN version, as these minor details are indeed minor differences, and the PS2 version offers a true Wide screen mode (removed from the GCN version at the last second so that it could be a PS2 exclusive feature). Thankfully the GCN version does still offer progressive scan mode, and if your TV can zoom in while in progressive scan you won't notice any disadvantages compared to the PS2 version. Additionally I have the old PS2, the original unit that does not do either wide screen or progressive scan, so the PS2 \"upgrades\" do me no good.In closing great job on the port Capcom! Awesome job! Nevertheless, I do feel ripped off not having Separate Ways for my GameCube, and I am perplexed as to why PS2 would receive the port and not the more logical choice of having a fully and truly enhanced experience in a \"directors cut\" launching with the Xbox 360 rather than on a dying platform.Update: RE4 for PS2 is continuing to decline in sales and has dropped to # 9 in the US.Update: The PS2 version has fallen off the top 10 in the sales charts just about a month after its release.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"Media Lover","summary":"An Epic Journey of Sci-Fi Terror!","reviewText":"WOW! I own an Xbox 360, and Doom 3 has nearly as good of graphics as everything else I own. Besides this fact, Doom 3 is easily the scariest game I've ever playes (except for Resident Evil 4.) I've heard people say that the gameplay is shallow... I couldn't disagree more. Doom 3 is brilliant in the way that it uses sounds and images to shock and surprise you. I can recall several instances where I jumped, and more than a couple where I felt chilled to the bone. Besides all of this, Doom 3 is just a joy to play, like a mix of Halo 3, Half Life 2, and Resident Evil 4.If you enjoy FPS's, love getting freaked out, and are up for the graphical ride of your life, buy Doom 3.A Quick Note To Christian GamersDoom 3 is essentially about fighting demons, zombies and various other beasties. Although potentially extremely offensive, I feel Doom 3 draws the line about where films such as \"Ghost Rider\" or \"Van Helsing\" do. If you or your teen would watch those films or play those games, this one won't be much different. As far as other content, language is extremely mild with a small smattering of h--, d--, and maybe one or two \"s\" words. Sensuality is non existant. Violence is extreme, involving splashes of blood, decapiation and various other violent acts.Overal, I would just say if you trust your child, he has a firm hold on real/fake spirituality and you would let him watch films like \"Ghost Rider\" \"Van Helsing\" or even \"Predator\" this game would be fine.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2007"}

Boasting next-gen lighting effects, robust anti-aliasing, and Dolby Surround sound, Quake 4 provides the audio and visual power for Hi-Def run-and-gun gore galore.Humanity is in peril as cyborg aliens (known as The Strogg) continue to clean sweep the universe in search of organic body parts to build more Strogg. Putting faith in 'the best defense is an aggressive offense,' Earth's military leaders mobilize an intergalactic assault on the Strogg home world to end their menace once and for all. As Matthew Kane, member of the elite Rhino Squad of Space Marines, your objective is to storm the Strogg fortifications, secure a landing site for a second wave, and annihilate the Makron (the Strogg leader). Following a decisive victory, the remaining Strogg captures Kane and begins their slice and splice Stroggification procedures. But before a mind control chip is embedded in Kane's cranium, Rhino Squad raids the facility and retrieves their mutilated comrade. Armed with the enemy's weapons but retaining your human mind, you are Earth's only hope for survival.Though a verbatim port of the PC title (released earlier this year), Quake 4 adapts gracefully to its 360 iteration with fluid and intuitive controls. Aiming, reloading, switching weapons, and crouching for cover respond to the speed of your instinct. The enemy AI is by no means brilliant, nor do they possess any strategic thinking, but what they lack in brains they make up for with aggressive brawn and sneak attacks.Taking the FPS away from horror, Quake 4 puts more emphasis on military style maneuvering. Kane is often flanked by fellow Marines who are autonomous in their actions (breaking the current trend of every game having some level of squad-based controls). Keeping your comrades alive prevents them from being used against you later in the game (every human that falls eventually becomes a Strogg). Life and armor are replenished by standing near your teammates and they will provide cover for you as you angle for a better shot.The Strogg are hardcore, grotesque machinations of malice. They don't feel pain and will not go down easily. The game offers a versatile array of weapons that will be very familiar to anyone who played the preceding Quake games. Armed with a pistol, assault rifle, shotgun, grenade launcher, rail gun, nail gun, rocket launcher, hyperblaster, and a lightening gun, players can dispatch their foes with whatever firepower that suits their murderous sensibilities.Lacking the major innovations expected from a next-generation title, Quake 4 is nonetheless a solid first-person shooter, brimming with blood, riddled with bullets, and heavy with atmosphere. Up to 8 players can frag and brag over the Internet, but there is no option for local co-operative or tete a tete play (unless somebody else ponies up for another console and you link systems via LAN).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2006"}

After the whole concept of \"VR\" seemed to drop off the map in the '90s, I wasn't expecting much of the Kinect.I'm happy to say I was wrong.  The Kinect sensor is a lot smarter than I'd expected it to be.  It's also very simple:  you position the sensor bar somewhere in front of your TV, above or below, and tilt it to about the right angle for where you wish to stand.  Really, it's a good idea to be 4 feet back (or further) if you can.  When you stand in front of the Kinect and tell it to \"find\" you, it's actually very quick at picking out the human shapes of one or more players.  I understand Kinect can detect up to 6 people, but thus far I've only seen two.  This process takes no more than a few seconds, and once you are \"seen\" you can not only play the games in Kinect Adventures using your whole body movements, you can use some gestures to access the XBox (for example, left hand held at 45 degrees downward for 4 seconds means \"pause\").  When you are presented with a menu, you will see a ghost of your 'avatar' to help you figure out where on the screen your hands will be touching.  When you are in-game (at least with Kinect Adventures), your ghostlike avatar stands in front of you, almost perfectly mirroring your movements.Almost.  I got to play Kinect Adventures with the unit and the only real flaw I noticed was that fast movements may sometimes suffer from game lag.  It's not enough to make gameplay impossible, but it is something you'll have to train your brain to get used to, and I get the feel that it's more to do with the XBox 360 hardware than with the Kinect unit itself (my XBox 360 is very new, but suffers random hiccups in just about every game I play).  Naturally if you get really stuck you can fall back on a standard controller to get into the menu and \"re-calibrate yourself\".There are a couple of caveats here.  The first is the obvious one--it'll take a while for a lot of Kinect-specific games to really begin to tap this technology.  Like Sony's Sixaxis controller, the way games integrate Kinect into their gameplay will probably get better with time.  The second should also be obvious but apparently isn't:  you can't play Kinect in the dark.  You need good lighting in order for the built-in camera to \"see\" you.  And although most people don't wear trenchcoats in their living rooms, keep in mind that the more like a stick-figure you are the better Kinect will work...leaping about in your bathrobe will probably make you harder to track.  Also worth noting: gameplay relies on picking out your frame and perceiving you as a kind of \"skeleton\", but some features that involve facial recognition (like logging in) are also a little bit trickier, and again good lighting will help.  There are also voice commands, such as \"open tray\", that respond very quickly to your speech:  unlike annoying voice menus you often get when you're on the phone, Kinect doesn't really need you to speak clearly or carefully pronounce syllables like a robot:  just speaking in your normal voice seems to work every time.  How far these vocal tricks will be supported beyond basic system commands will most likely vary from game to game until Kinect becomes more of a common platform that XBox game developers will program to.If you're curious about the Kinect and like being an early adopter, you will probably be happy with it.  A lot of your interaction might be for party games or other Wii-like social events and/or simple sports.  While the mini-games in \"Kinect Adventures\" are geared around showcasing the Kinect technology, with time I suspect Kinect-compatible titles will be a lot more about the game than the system.  While I hardly think that Kinect means \"the death of the game controller\", Kinect is much better than I'd expected.

This is no reflection on the game but i also for some reason or another didn't receive a game manual with it so i have had to figure certain things out on my own.All in all not a terrible game but it could use work..Hint hint EA","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}
{"product_name":"B006P5RW3M","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A fantastic, deep, and complex RPG","reviewText":"CD Projekt RED strikes gold for the second time with The Witcher 2. This is a masterpiece of an RPG, one that proudly stands alongside its predecessor as one of the best released in recent times.The game continues the adventures of monster-slayer Geralt of Rivia, as he continues to search for the lost pieces of his memory, and continues to get embroiled in a corrupt world of famine, racism, genocide, political corruption, and horrific creatures. Nearly everything that made the first game so great returns here - the strong, well-written narrative, the endlessly intriguing game world, the plethora of things to do, and the deep RPG mechanics that should satisfy both veterans and newcomers alike.There are a few key differences here from the first game. Despite being an obviously bigger and more expensive production, it is a much shorter, more compact and streamlined game. This does not make the game any better or worse, but simply different. The game manages to be equally as affecting and epic as the first game, even if you never get to know the world quite as well as you did the first time around. Combat has received a major overhaul, which now resembles the 1:1 combat often found in other sword-wielding, fantasy action RPGs. However, the combat remains incredibly satisfying, and is actually much more challenging this time around, as parrying and dodging have become even more of a necessity alongside the various sword and magic attacks available to Geralt. Inventory is now based on encumbrance as opposed to number of slots, and the alchemy and skill trees have become much easier to manage while retaining all the depth they've always had.The game has also received a major graphical overhaul, as environments and character animations are not only a huge step up from the first game, but are among the best of any games out there. The Witcher 2's presentation is simply stunning.Fans of the first game should be very satisfied with this excellent sequel, and The Witcher 2 also functions as a great introduction to this amazing universe, although I would highly recommend playing the original game, The Witcher, if possible. CD Projekt RED is one of the developers to watch going forward into the future, as they have created a game world that has few peers in the industry. If you consider yourself a fan of Western style RPGs, do not miss this game. It's easily one of the best out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2013"}

Traveling with hordes of demonic minions, Baal intends to corrupt the powerful Worldstone, which protects the whole of the mortal plane from the forces of hell.You will face a new series of quests and challenges to prevent the vile minions of the underworld from destroying the world of Sanctuary.Diablo II: Lord of Destructionrequires the full version ofDiablo II. Players will be treated to an all-new, full-size act set in the Barbarian Highlands. Other features include new monsters, two new character classes (Assassin and Druid), a larger stash, new Horadric Cube recipes, support for higher-resolution graphics, and thousands of new magical items.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Act V: The Lord of Destruction","reviewText":"\"Lord of Destruction,\" Blizzard's official and much-touted expansion to \"Diablo II\" is certainly a mixed bag. While it provides many new features and an entire new Act in which you, the hero of the land, take on the Prime Evil Baal, to get the most out of your money you had better be willing to play through the game a second time (or more). Purchasing \"Lord of Destruction\" merely to give the new Act a run-through is worth considering, since the new adventure is quite enjoyable, but your experience will be so brief you will almost surely wonder whether or not you actually got your money's worth.Aside from the story-finishing new quest, you will get two new playable character classes. The Assassin is a powerful character (good for newbies) with a knack for katars and deadly traps, and the Druid is a hulking man of nature who can transform at will into werebears and other ferocious creatures. Both of these classes are excellent additions, and easily surpass some of the original game's selections. Each new character comes complete with brand new character specific items that can be found in both the original game and its fifth Act. Likewise, character classes from the original game can find items tailor made for them in their quest to rid the world of Baal. Also noteworthy is the new resolution, which greatly enhances the look of the game - but should have been available in the original \"Diablo II\" release.As far as the fifth and final Act of \"Diablo II\" is concerned, it's easily the best one yet created for the game. The levels, both exterior and interior, are much more realistically designed, and are packed with details that add to the ambience. The new snowscape, homeland of the Barbarian, is the setting for \"Lord of Destruction,\" and it's different enough from the previous realms to keep things fresh. The new enemies are likewise inspiring - though you'll lament the inclusion of the game's teleporting Imps, which spell lots and lots of frustrating busy work for melee fighters. Unfortunately, despite the new Act's many virtues, it's too bloody short. In fact, this Act feels considerably shorter than the first three, and only slightly longer than the fourth. It's a shame, since the six quests you do undertake will be some of the best you've yet experienced in the game.In the end, if you have aspirations of going through the game's five acts from start to finish with a brand new character, \"Lord of Destruction\" is for you. It feels like you're paying a little too much if you tackle it any other way. Even so, the snowy adventures that await your avatar here are some of the best and most visceral you have yet experienced. Truly a mixed bag.Final Score: B-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2003"}

One thing that really bothered me was that you had to have someone drop their weapon or armor before you could pick up something else and equip it, and once thrown away, these items were irretrievable.If you want to try this game, best to try the Gameboy Advance version of this game, which comes with a better item/weapon(and magic) system along with several bonus dungeons, and many cool items you never had before.

Great dynamics in control of the characters, cool weapons, the anti gravity stuff and portals are mentioned quite a bit by most who comment on this game, but they are just part of the whole thing.The voice acting is almost uniformly great (with the exception of Jen sometimes), and the story is mostly original, save the overall plot, which we've seen a zillion times before. But the characters are new to the genre, (nope, no super human marines, or master gunfighters) and treats the traditions of the cherokee with respect and dignity.There are some moments where it feels like some other games, an occasional dopey boss battle, and too many elevators, but wow, the overall pace, artwork, character control, and AWESOME MUSIC makes it the most movie like video game I've EVER played.

Overwhelming tank/artillery force and troop numbers are something that is not there, and the air war/power is non-existent here as well. I think using all of those more interactively would have made a great difference, in COD you can call in artillery strikes, in MOH you actually fly the planes at points. Get rid of the monotonous environments and put more  of that in please, although I didn't see it in EIB.I never used the overhead map option, it does add some strategy to it but did the real guys have that? Nope, it takes you out of the flow of the game too much. I'm here for fun only.I like the interaction and use of the tank and the sound is awesome. Yes the aiming is frustrating but I don't think any one is that accurate during real war period, unfortunately the Germans seem to be marksman at all levels, but it gets MUCH worse as you replay on the higher difficulty levels, although the Germans were dug in well when the Allies got there.And the idea that the Germans seem to think you are target number one no matter what is ludicrous, I should be able to send 2 groups on 2 different flanks to hit or distract units and then be able to snipe with a Kar 98 from the center without being shot at by everyone, don't get me started on the me Vs. Panzer with a panzerfaust, what about your teammates grabbing a couple as well to triangulate fire?This series doesn't give you the feeling of being a part of a larger army like COD does and I don't like it. Being in a group of about 10-15 bots and never meeting up or being a part of a large army group seems unrealistic for regular GI's, only commandos would be so isolated and small in my opinion. The story I mostly tune out of and gets overly serious and has long scenes, I'll watch Flags or Ryan if I want that.I have to say I enjoyed the game, but am glad I paid current prices only for it. I played it through a couple times so it was a good value, but the replayability pales in comparison to COD. This is a fresh game in terms of the WW2 genre and should not be missed but it does have it's flaws, but I could write a similar review of the other WW2 franchises outlining their flaws as well so try all of them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2007"}

I've out grown console gaming, but several games make me flip the PS2 or NGC power switch back on. This version is definitely worth $19.99.Once the battles start it gets less difficult through progress as you become comfortable with the controls. Controls are spot on and very precise. Graphics are very nice on the PS2. I'm playing with Gold Star continue system on Normal/Default setting, which supposedly makes the game much easier due to unlimited continue. Still you must keep track of your items. If used during a stage or boss fight the item is gone even if you fail to complete a stage or beat a boss. Being items are hard to obtain just be sure to conserve until ready to use. With the Gold Star continue system I play the ending stage bosses one or two times w/out using any items to get a feel for them. This is a good thing with the Gold Star system, but less difficult. Most importantly the game allows the player to replay previous stage/missions at any time to get a certain item they may have forgotten (blue orb piece, etc.). Challenging and very entertaining game.

{"product_name":"B0000TSRA6","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"It's good","reviewText":"Resident Evil has always focused on the solitary experience, often times putting you, the lone survivor of a biohazard apocalyptic catastrophe, against an army of monsters and time-consuming, awkward puzzles. Outbreak opens up the playing field with an online component that makes you and three others to rely on each other to survive. It's an interesting concept that for the most part works. In Outbreak, you play as one of eight unfortunate, specialty specific characters in Raccoon City at the time of the virus outbreak. To survive, you must pass through five different scenarios, but the pressure's on-during each scenario, your character is exposed to contagion, and if you don't finish in time, you'll turn into one of the (briefly controllable) living dead. Resident vets will be likely recognize some of the locales and creatures, as the events take place between RE2 and 3 with Raccoon City slowly overrun by monsters. Each scenario has multiple objectives, hidden files, and diverse activities that are impossible to complete entirely in one play through-an excellent hook that creates high replay value. Points are given at the end of each stage that can then be used to purchase character renders, music tracks, more characters, and other rewards. The atmospheric visuals create an uneasy feeling of doom and destruction as smashed cars, trashed buildings, fire, and smoke that become more vivid with each completed scenario.Outbreak's defining property is multiplayer cooperation. Up to four wannabe survivors can play simultaneously via online, and the game's structure is such that you must work together in order to reach the finish line. With a limited inventory capacity (and no item boxes), you can swap items with others, give a shoulder to lean on, hold doors shut, and even fight zombies hand-to-hand. Outbreak provides a plethora of ordinary items that can be used for defense, such as iron bars, rocks, lab acid, and brushes. Puzzles also stand in your way, many of which are lifted directly from the Resident trash bin-pushing crates, collecting items and inserting them elsewhere, and pressing switches-activities any series vet will instantly recognize. Yet a key aspect of teamwork, communication, is severely hampered by lack of voice chat as players are limited to a series of pre-determined phrases (\"I have a thought,\" for instance) and other vocal cues that, in most situations, could mean anything. All scenarios are available in offline mode-just be prepared for a robust challenge and barely adequate NPC A.I. Lengthy load times also hinder the flow of the action (a problem that will hopefully be resolved with the PS2 HDD that was unavailable at press time for this review). Yet, despite its shortcomings, Outbreak's hefty replay, intense action, and clever scenario designs make for an engaging play-on- and offline, and a must for any Resident fan. Here, success ultimately depends on how helpful everyone's willing to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"Twins Daddy","summary":"Lots and Lots of FUN...Even If It's Over Fairly Quick.","reviewText":"According to the game's timer, I beat Uncharted: Drake's Fortune in a little over 20 hours of gameplay on Normal difficulty. While I expected at least twice that much play time, I will say it SEEMED like a great deal longer than 20 hours. I attribute that to Naughty Dog successfully creating an environment that truly DRAWS YOU IN the further you get into the game...In fact, the actual ending seemed a little anticlimactic.The scenery is just dazzling. The controls are easy enough to master, although some spots require precision when jumping or you'll find yourself respawning back at the previous checkpoint...This in itself can be frustrating when you're near the end of a protracted sequence, only to miss a jump and have to start all over again.I really liked the voice work and it was a pleasure to have your character carry on conversations as opposed to Gordon Freeman in Half-Life 2 (the Orange Box) who never, ever says a single word. I would suggest scattering out the thug comments a little more since the predominate \"There he is...I see him...Shoot to kill!\" gets old pretty quick.The difficulty curve was a little weird. It was pretty standard fare through about the first 85% of the game and then BAM!...It ramps up to where it really challenges you in multiple settings. The plot twist near the end was also strange, but it's a video game so you just go with it. The only other thing I would change is the targeting of enemies at certain points. For example, you can be behind a crate or rock and peek out to see your target, then when you try to lock your weapon on him, you can't see him anymore. So you nudge Nate out a little more to get your shot and you try to lock the weapon on the enemy and again you can't see him in your field of view...However, Nate starts taking fire from the guy he can't target. This takes away some of the \"realism\" when it happens.In all, Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a GREAT game! Can't wait for the sequel...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2009"}

When the game came out, it turned out to be an exceptionally well done button masher with a clever little gimmick to convince gamers of all age to purchase figures for it. I ended up purchasing at least one of each figure type and the entire Undead set. Then came Skylanders Giants. It was more of the same, but now with a few new figures and larger figures. I enjoyed Giants, but not as much and I didn't feel the need to purchase figures from the Giants line except Flashwing and Fright Rider.Now here we are with Swap Force. The gameplay for Swap Force is very similar to the previous games. You put a figure on the Portal of Power and use them to bust heads, gaining experience and new powers (or strengthening old ones) along the way. The new gimmick involved figures that can be bisected with other swappable characters, giving you a new combination of type and power. There are a lot of neat new figures for the game and I myself ended up getting Grim Creeper, Night Shift, Smolderdash and Star Strike. I enjoyed the new characters and swap power more than the Giants, but I'm starting to notice that the games are becoming little more than a yearly face lift, with some new gimmick designed to make you not only purchase a 50-80 dollar game but spend at least that in figures as well. it's a great money making scheme Activision has got going and it's made them a crap load of money, but at some point the concept and the extra monetary expenditures are going to blow up in their face the same way Guitar Hero died a terrible death. At this point I'd like to see more of a DLC focus than a yearly game release.As well, Skylanders Swap Force is noticeably buggy with many people mentioning ways the game stalls or outright crashes on them. This is true regardless of system format, but the Wii version seems to be especially bad at this. Of course this being a game for the Wii, it probably won't seem a patch, whereas the Sony and Microsoft versions (and even possibly the Wii U version) will. It's a shame because I have Skylanders for both the Wii (provided by Amazon's Vine program for review purposes) and the PS3 (provided directly by Activision for review purposes) and although I prefer playing the games on the Wii, the PS3 version does run better and has less bugs.In all, I'd give this a thumbs in the middle. The games are fun, but the cost to play them adds up quickly. I like the new characters, but after three games in as many years, I'm dreading this becoming a yearly face lift title in the same way I don't really get as enthused about sports titles anymore. The Wii version is the worst of bunch this year due to all the issues the game seems to suffer from bug-wise, but it's fun enough that it's still worth a purchase for bigtime fans of the game. Just be prepared for some frustrating freezes and knowing that there are better versions of the same game out there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2013"}

I was excited for it.  Dual sticks.  Large OLED touch screen.  Amazing graphics processing power for a handheld.  And the price looked awesome.  But!Then they announced that you had to buy a proprietary memory card, and they weren't going to be cheap.  I of course had to have the biggest size memory card you could get, 32GB.  Price, $99.99.  That made that wonderful system, at an attractive price, into a wonderful system, at a price that didn't match the value.  I canceled my preorder, and I'm glad I did, because this bundle was exactly what I was waiting for.  2 very good free games, a small, but free memory card (to get my feet wet) and three months of Playstation plus, which I had been dying to try out for some time, because I also have a PS3.After 1 month with the system, I'm still very impressed by it.  The screen is gorgeous.  The graphics are amazing for a handheld.  Nearly PS3 quality.  Three weeks after buying it, I plunked down $80 for the 32 gig card on sale, because I'm all in.  I love this system.  It just feels great in your hands.  It's got a great library for a system only 1 year old.About this bundle:1.  The Assassin's Creed Vita is slick.  The white with brushed silver looks really great, and white doesn't show scratches as easily as the normal black. I'm SO glad they didn't put any Assassin's Creed branding on this thing, because that would have ruined it.2.  Assassin's Creed Liberation is a fun game.  It doesn't feel quite up to the quality of console games, but I'm sure this game had a fraction of the budget, and it's awesome for what it is.  The graphics, and what this game is doing on a handheld are truly fantastic.I'm a little nervous about Sony's commitment to this system, and the games, or lack thereof, planned for the Vita.  That said, there's a huge library of downloadable games, PSP originals that you can download and play, as well as quite a few great games already out (Uncharted, Persona 4, Gravity Rush, Lumines, Sound Shapes and on and on).  I heartily recommend this system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}

The combat is fairly difficult but is made even worse by the fact that each area you enter typically consists of about 6-7 sections before it is complete, completely resets if you leave, and you can only heal by using food items that are quite expensive considering the small amount of money you may or may not receive after each section...or you can grow your own food in the middle of battle but if you let it grow too long it becomes over ripe and no good...and also it steals Phozons (which are basically like your experience points and Magic Points in one) to grow.Monsters will sometimes drop treasure chests when you kill them but you have all of about 5 seconds to knock it open before it disappears.You can equip ONE item at any time, but this item still takes up inventory space even when equiped for some odd reason...A lot of people seem to honestly enjoy this game, you may be one of those people but I'm not.

(though there's this one one liner that you will roll your eyes at)Enemies that you shoot break into pieces, which is good to see. I'm tired of enemies just dropping & fading away. It shows your bullets are doing damage.the music was OK.The partner choosing & leveling up is cool. I did not expect that from this game.Boss battles are VERY COOL. why? cause it takes a lot of ammo to take them out.I was thinking WOW this is what I WISH they had in those newer Terminator movies!!!Also the designs of the bigger enemies & the bosses, very slick. You can tell someone put a lot of thought into them.THE BADThe downside is there are some very weird level designs.there should've been hordes of bots to shoot in those big empty areas.The Ai partners are sometimes a pain. sometimes they run ahead of you, leaving you to fight on your own, or they just DON'T SHOOT bosses. even when you command them, they say NOT NOW. hahahaalso there is no Game+ in this game.IN THE END, while the controls are taken right from Gears of War, I didn't mind, cause Gears is my favorite game. So I could automatically start shooting bots apart LOLI liked that the game did/tried new things. which a lot of games don't do anymore. It actually felt FRESH. & the fact I'm going to beat it again right away on the hardest difficulty is a good thing.If Sega had taken more time to work those things above & other minor things out & cranked up the difficulty, this could have been a solid 5 stars.It's less than $20 now here on Amazon, so YES!!!! its worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2013"}

Hughes","summary":"Some things right, some things wrong","reviewText":"What this game does wrong- Double jump is broken 20% of the time. Meaning you hit the button twice, but Kratos *doesn't* double jump. This means simple tasks like jumping from one ledge to the next kills you 20% of the time. Very frustrating!- Fixed camera angle is lame. Like all other GOW games you can't move the camera. This makes the game feel very scripted, i.e. you *must* walk down this path *this* way to get to the *next* fight.- Puzzles feel very contrived! i.e. Many of the puzzles feel like they were added *only* to prolong the game and have no point or purpose to the story. Case in point, after you rescue Pandora she get's caught in numerous traps and you must figure out how to save her over and over and over and over again. I also thought the \"guitar hero\" type puzzles were lame.- The game gets overly \"quiet\" and lonesome. Often times after you have killed everyone and you don't immediately solve the puzzle the game sort of sits there with only the sound of the wind blowing (or nothing at all). It's super boring at these points until you figure out how to progress. i.e. one time in the underworld I couldn't jump onto a necessary ledge (didn't know I could) for like 5 minutes. I couldn't go back or forward. So boring I didn't even pause the game to get up and grab a drink.- The game begins to have a very \"as if\" (unbelievable) feeling to it after a while. What I mean is, it's hard to buy that Kratos could defeat *so many* enemies and gigantic beasts. Don't get me wrong, it's still cool, but it's just too far fetched that you kill about 100 various enemies followed by a titan (or god) and then repeat. Either Kratos would get tired, bored OR you'd think the enemies at least would stop trying.What this game does right- The boss battles are beyond EPIC. This sole fact alone keeps me playing the game. If they could just make the game these battles one after the other the game would get 10/10.In summary this game starts with an epic battle and then gets slow. Followed by more epic battles and more slow boring stuff. I'm currently 50% through the game and I'm no longer drawn to play it every chance I get. I'm also certain now that I will trade this game the minute I beat it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2010"}

First of all, the camera zooms in on all of the fatalities to give you a close up view and every fatality that I have seen are decapitations, dismemberment, and even bodies being ripped in half or cut up in some very violent way. This is definantly not a game for kids and even some adults. It is also not for the faint of heart. The Xray moves which I think are the coolest moves in the game, are also zoomed in and you can actually see the characters bones break and the arteries and organs destroyed. The game itself however is a great fighting game because there are tons of stuff to unlock, lots of game modes and more depth to the actual combat. Every character in MK has an enhanced version of their special moves like the EX moves in Street Fighter 4. The story mode is also pretty interesting and gives you more information on the characters and why they are fighting in the first place.

Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Hasn't aged well","reviewText":"The Good: Deeper more strategic fight system, game looks good, return of mini-games are a nice touch, the Krypt is a nice addition for fansThe Bad: Characters look like plastic dolls, blood looks too gelatinous, overall lack of content, boring arenas, most of the new characters are unlikableDeadly Alliance was a turning point for the series. MK4 got mixed reviews from fans and critics and wasn't exactly what they wanted. Being only the second 3D Mortal Kombat game it was another reboot that took itself more seriously and became more complicated and deep. It featured three different fighting styles, long combo chains that you had to memorize, and gone were the days of fast button mashing. You now had to think ahead for your next move and strategize. It was the most robust and sophisticated fighting game ever made at the time, but it didn't come without its flaws.Deadly Alliance was the first MK game to venture out away from just fighting in a core title. The team added a Konquest mode which is a giant tutorial on how to use every fighter and learn all their moves. This is pretty big for a fighter and can be a lot of fun. You follow Raiden down a long path across various MK worlds and learn about each fighter. They each have three different fighting stances; two regular and one weapon stance. That's not all though, these can combo into and out of each other for major damage. Characters with blade type weapons can impale their weapons into the opponent to make them bleed out, but they lose the weapon for that round. This more technical fighting style for MK had mixed reactions, but I like it a lot.One thing I wasn't fond of were the lack of special moves and fatalities. There's only one fatality per character and a lot of them are mediocre at best. They aren't as gory or as awesome as previous games. Cyrax is missing his net move, a few characters only have 2-3 special moves, so it feels a weak. At least the mini-games make a return because they haven't been seen since MK1. A new Test-Your-Sight mini-game is added which is a cup and ball game. The team also added a Kurrency system and a Krypt to unlock costumes, videos, art, and interviews. I love this a lot and is a great fan service. However, once you unlock the entire Krypt there's not much else to come back to. Unless you are playing with a friend on the couch the game is just seriously lacking in single player content and is why I got bored with it after a couple of months.The graphics were decent for the time, but the gore looks like balls of Jell-O and the characters look like plastic dolls. The women's breast physics look like swaying punching bags at 100 MPH even when you tap forward slightly. The sound effects are a bit weak and a few are recycled from MK4. The arenas are also kind of boring and many of them are new. The overall game is pretty solid but needed more polish. I also wasn't too fond of the new characters. A few were likable such as Frost, Nitara, and Drahmin, but all the rest just felt forced or rushed. I also didn't really like a lot of the redesigned characters such as Sonya and Johnny Cage. The character design is just really lacking here, but that could be just me being a picky fan.Overall, Deadly Alliance is a nice change for the series and the more complex and strategic fight style may not be for everyone. The lack of content really hurts his game though, and it suffers from an overall lack of polish. It's still worth getting in your bargain bin for some couch time fighting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

This game takes strategy. Takes planing. Takes everything you learned from COD and Medal of Honor and throws it out the door. Nice open levels. Gorgeous to look at. Stunning fights with well armed aliens. Epic battles in Grand Central station. This game blew me away. Now I never got a change to play the first one. Only tried the demo and had fun with it. I'm gonna have to play that game now. Lets start with the obvious.The graphics are second to none on the Xbox. Lighting is amazing. The city is well rendered. Only a few technical hiccups happen during the gameplay. I can forgive that because I never thought the 360 would even come close to running Crysis 2 this great.Gameplay is a nice refreshing break from the normal. Maximizing your abilities is a must. The gun fights are vicious. This game will beat you down if you don't come prepared.  Controls are smooth. It's everything I wanted from a shooter times 10.Multiplayer is a blast. Smooth matchmaking. An area for new people to play with other low level people help you get situated. 12 maps all varying. (yay no snow levels lol).

Supposedly this game was to be so much different from spiderman 2, built totally from the ground up. New Awesome combat system. Larger more robust city.  Deeper side quests. PFFF.  THis game is SPIDERMAN 2 with a worse camera and a horrid combat system.WOW, Bosses havent been this cheap since MAXIMUM CARNAGE.  And I'm only 45 min into the game.  OK,  so I'm supposed to stop a gang called Apocalypse from blowing up an electric grid.  I get the bomb toss it into the ocean and guess what i have to fight a boss but he isnt alone.  he has 5 other guys with him.  they go down like you would expect and i still have all of my health. Pretty good odds of me taking this guy out right?  WRONG.  Not only is his health bar twice the size of mine.  I have to make use of this horrid new reversal system thats been thrown into this game.  Basically as ur fighting an enemy a yellow fist appears above his head. Which is supposed to prompt you to hold down the left bumper to slow time down.  When time slows you are supposed to tap X when it appears on the screen.  Easy enough right.  Wrong again.  Since X is the main attack button.  I am halfway through a combo when the yellow symbol appears over the enemy.  So when the X is supposed to appear im not able to press it because im in the middle of my combo.  So i am forced to cheap my way into beating this guy and his goons by sitting ontop of a roof and pulling them up with my web one by one.  Now does this sound like a fun and innovative new combat system?THE missions are set up so bad its laughable.  Ok I start the lizard mission.  Rumors of the lizard in some park in the city are going around. THe boss wants pictures.  SO instead of going to the park.  Spiderman decides to go right outside of the office and take a pic of a guy in a lizard suit.  No where near the Park in question.  So i go back to the boss with the pic and he tells me hes no fool and sends me on my way to the PARK.  Useless time wasting mission right?  Ok so i get to the park and i am supposed to find a lizard.  Thats all the mission objectives say.  SO i click the right stick to bring up my Spidey sense and Voila the lizard is in an alley and i can even see his footprints thanks to the power of spidey sense.  SO i go in balls to the wall ready to lay the smack down on this chump only to hear Petey say \" OH no i got too close.\"  Dun Dun DUNNNNNNN.  \"Mission failed\"  pops up on the screen as the lizard jumps into the sewer.  WHAT?! are u kidding me.  if u wanted me to sneak up on the guy please let me know in advanced.  THis game is poorly poorly poorly put together.OH boy dont get me started on the CAMERA.  Just let me say there isn't a Camera Center button so u can snap the camera back behind Spiderman to see whats in front of u.  ANd since im not a huge graphics fan i wont even ding it for having the worst cut scenes ive ever seen on a HDTV.  U know when a lil child shows u a pic of something they drew. THey tell u what it is and in ur mind u know thats not what that object looks like but since it's a child u smile and say very good.  Well Activision isnt a toddler and they should be ashamed of the cutscenes in this game.Maybe I'm still bitter about the disappointing movie SPiderman 3.  So maybe im being too harsh on the game.  Maybe i am.  but please for the love of GOD rent this game before buying it.  In my opinion this game is worst than Spiderman 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2007"}

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

For starters, I had to use an old laptop to load the disks onto an external hard drive before installing on my machine. This was due to some dual layering that high end drives cannot read. Secondly, the Amazon code proved to be invalid and the Witcher servers are largly inaccessible - even after creating an account. Once you get past all of that and actually load the game, you are faced with a prologue that you probably will not finish on Medium setting unless you played the first Witcher. Even at that, I had to run in a circle shooting fire balls over my shoulder for like 20 minutes to beat one guy. The contracts I got in the first town are not going any better and the AI is non-existent. You stand at point A and monsters will ignore you - you stand a foot closer and they will attack!? Basically, you have to go around looking for glitches instead of strategies to beat  the tough battles. On top of that, Geralt deals a pathetic amount of damage. Maybe things will improve with subsequent levels; but, that is part of what makes a good game. Level progression should be better tied to the available quests. All in all, this game was not the breath of fresh air that an anemic PC Gaming community needs. Let's hope that Diable III delivers on that front.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2011"}

But you can get through the game in just a few hours, and the multiplay in this game just aren't as good as in previous games. The gadgets are few and far between.

While an extra case would have been nice, this game's four trials are more than worth the cost of admission on their own. All of the major characters of the series return, including Phoenix's deceased mentor Mia, her sister Maya, the bumbling Detective Gumshoe, and Phoenix's friend and rival, Miles Edgeworth. Joining in the fun are Pearl Fey, Maya's adorable cousin who is much stronger both inside and out than she looks, and Franziska von Karma, the whip-wielding prodigy who has made it her life's work to destroy Phoenix in the court room.Players new to the Ace Attorney world would be highly recommended to play the first game before this one, as that will help give a better appreciation for the character developments within. For those who want to start with the second game, though, the first case serves as a tutorial. Phoenix must defend a client from a murder she didn't commit. The only problem is that he has amnesia, and doesn't know how to act as a proper defense attorney. Once you clear this hurdle, though, the other cases return Phoenix to his (semi-)competent self as you clear the names of the innocent with nothing more than your unshakable faith in your client.Justice for All keeps in step with the great humor and bizarre legal environment of the last game. You'll find yourself dealing with spirit mediums, interrogating circus clowns, and dodging blows from Franziska's whip throughout the game. The music is spot-on, and the animations are subtle and humorous. Moreover, the characters are even better this time around, now that they've had the five cases from the first game to establish themselves. The last case in particular is amazingly done, and is in my opinion the best case of the entire series. Old fans will find that this game keeps up the quality expected from the first one, and new fans will find themselves in a bizarre but uniquely enjoyable world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2007"}

That was the seed that began it all, however.A few months after that I found a jewel case for about $20 in a used PC store. Figuring that I could spend $20 on worse things, I snatched it up and went back to my dorm. Took a bit to tweak the settings to balance visuals with framerate (the computer I owned at the time was ancient even then) but finally worked all of that out.And it didn't take too long before I realized why my brother liked the game so much.I'd played a few games that allowed for freedom of choice before, but not to the scale that was offered here, and certainly not one that had as much replay value. I couldn't even begin to imagine how many times I replayed a particular level, or the game from beginning to end, trying something else just to see how it'd play out, and it took many, many playthroughs before I finally could say I saw/heard everything. Even on playthroughs where I already figured I must've seen/heard everything, I still ended up uncovering something new.The game had a stronger emphasis on the shooter aspect than sneaking/hacking, but the general gaming atmosphere, and the expectations of the gaming audience at the time, were far different than it'd be today, so it shouldn't be too much of a surprise that shooting through the game was oftentimes the main path. There always was a stealth route available (apparently, even the most secure, heavily defended bases on the planet all have at least one air duct large enough for a man to crawl through - and they can crawl through completely silent at that!) but breaking stealth, accidentally or otherwise usually meant a fight until everything around you gathered flies. The fact that decisions in one level rarely impacted the game in the long term was disappointing, but it was more than fun enough to see everything it had to offer. In the end, the game was easily one of my favorite games and likely always will be.Then, about a year ago, I stumbled across a copy of the much less well received sequel, Deus Ex: Invisible War. By the time it originally came out, I was drifting away from PC gaming as a whole and didn't really bother to check into it before this. I knew that lots of people hated the game, but some enjoyed it, and I finally decided that there was only one way to find out which camp I belonged in.By then I had a computer that was made several years after DE:IW came out, and was far more powerful than the recommended specs on the box.Yet, somehow when the game began, I had to spend at least 15 minutes messing with the visual settings before finally having no choice but to scale everything - resolution, textures, the whole nine - down to the lowest levels. If I made one single setting go higher than the absolute lowest, it'd be a slideshow. Didn't matter which one, every single setting had to be at its lowest. Yet somehow everything at the lowest was smooth - there was no in-between. Not a great way to start things off, especially when you already have concerns about the game.And it only got worse from there.It's already very hard to ignore the mechanical flaws this game has, such as the horrible voice acting from every major character who wasn't in the first game (and some who were) the clunky gameplay, the annoying side quests that I ended up just ignoring about half way in, the horribly washed out colors, goofy character animations, the tad bit TOO streamlined inventory and magic ammo pool from whence all weapons drew being examples just off the top of my head. These might - just MIGHT - be forgiven if the story and characters themselves are great. But these are also two areas where IW failed to deliver. There were zero - literally, zero - great plot twists. There is a plot twist towards the latter half of the game that changes how you view the factions, but even if the plot twist was mind-blowing and completely unpredictable, (it's not!) it doesn't hold any weight to the game, so replaying the game and knowing the truth doesn't really make a difference. The plot twist in this game doesn't quite hold the same impact as the original KOTOR when you discovered who Darth Revan was, or perhaps Andrew Ryan telling you to stop (and what he says after) in Bioshock, or when Harbinger said what would be his final two words to...somebody who's not Shepherd in Mass Effect 2, despite the fact that it looks like that's what the developers were striving for. It seems like they were trying to wow us with that plot twist, yet it just falls flat.There's also no real sense of escalating tension between protagonist and antagonist(s) either. In the original, every step forward meant two steps back, as it should be. Here, there were multiple factions going head to head and trying to convince you to take their side, but there's no real reason to care about any one of them, and the fact that you could have actively worked against any one of them the entire game yet still be able to fulfill their agenda was disappointing. In one instance, this can even mean going so far as to kill a key member of the original game in cold blood. You could do that, and still work with that faction, as if nothing was wrong. No real consequence for your actions.Speaking of factions, did anybody else's hand attach itself to forehead upon finding out that one of the factions is - I'm not making this up - the Templars? Oh, but it gets better! Despite being disbanded over 7 centuries ago, somehow the Templars manage to raise up a formidable army, in a horrible, global recession no less, complete with walking mechs, choppers, tanks, you name it. You also spend the majority of the game sneaking into, killing, destroying, disrupting and otherwise giving anything that is even remotely Templar a headache of titanic proportions. But towards the end of the game, that doesn't matter none! Nope! The grandmaster of the Templar order doesn't seem to care one bit that you've killed countless soldiers and cost him millions in equipment loss. He'll still let you work for him if you're so inclined! And unless I missed something, the game also didn't really explain how Chad went from peaceful protester to megalomaniacal, homicidal dictator who would stop at nothing for total control. He was easily as detestable as the grandmaster of the Templars, if not more so.The endings do require that you commit to a certain path at the very end (but only the very end) and they divulge largely from each other - they are mutually exclusive. In the original, they're not really so exclusive, a fact that this game takes on, because the canon \"ending\" the sequel uses is a combination of all of them. That is to say, JC fulfills every ending, and the world is shaped by that. But despite being mutually exclusive and forcing a final commitment, they still disappoint.The only real improvements this game had over the original are that unlike the first game, you can 1.) Play a male or female operative. 2.) You can't save, get a door code by paying somebody, reload the game and use the code without spending the money - this time, you have to have the code to open the door. 3.) Air ducts are also guarded this time. 4. There's an interactive AI who resembles a major pop star. In one exchange, you can reveal the actual pop star's manager doing a dirty deed and ask her what she'll do. Her response? \"Oh, tra la la...I'll probably just fire the b---h!\" That got a good laugh. 5.) And the last level in the game was a good choice, as it ties the storyline back to the original game.But those are it. And those plusses do not even begin to compensate for IW's many and deep flaws. So, in the end, I have no choice but to side with the camp who loved the original but hated the sequel. Fortunately, Human Revolution proved to be just what the series needs to bring it back into the limelight, so hopefully we can all move forward and forget this awful game.Deus Ex: 9.5/10Invisible War: 3.75/10 (And I feel that I'm being generous with that score.)Human Revolution: 8.5/10","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2011"}

A place to keep things too valuable to throw away but not needed in your day to day adventures in the game.BioWare provides this from release, claiming that it *was part of the original game* but 'due to deadlines' couldnt be integrated - so instead of content that *was supposed to be included in the original game* we get to BUY it 'for a small additonal charge'. If it was some lost missions, maybe a side talent or something, fine, I probably wouldnt care, but because storage is so crucial and their excuse so convenient- it really struck a nerve... /rantoffThe Game itself, is REALLY polished and  pulls you right in from the beginning, Cutscenes are very well done: the voice acting keeps your attention. Although this isnt what is traditionally considered an 'open ended' rpg, there's so much to do and see that you never get that 'on rails' feel. There are quests all over the place, from the lone stranger in towns seeking help to factions that help out 'interested parties', there's lots. Another thing very cool is how the everyone is '6 degrees' from each other, something you'll see as you play other Origins. Unknown people who you helped in one origin (just to be nice or to get exp) could be key characters from another Origin - so be nice to all you meet!Nice Achievment system in place, you'd be suprised what you get achievements for.Quest system has nice options for those who get lost, but what's better is the ability to toggle it on or off (for those who dont like hand-holding).Unlockable abilities for companions makes going back to camp it's own little mini game.Gifts to favor your rep with party members - some gifts mean alot more to some than others.Way too many features to go over. I had the bar set pretty high for this title and I'm suprised it was more than I expected. Replayability is very high because each origin is very different and exclusive from the last one played.The final thing that I really liked: At the end of your game, they recap all (well, a LOT) of your in-game actions and how they affected the people and country. If you were playing the game with a 'good' or 'evil' persona, THIS is where you see the fruit of your labors.This game would have gotten 5 stars EASILY but because of their shady handling of the Day 1 DLCs - clearly you can see the apple (BioW) not falling far from the tree (EA).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2009"}

In the end what probably matters most is that they are both great games. Neither is perfect (the A.I. in Gran Turismo has the intelligence of a playstation 1 era game and the graphics of Forza may never catch up to Polyphony's best), but both are definitely worth playing.I wasn't a fan of Forza 2 because its physics was about as irritating as that of Ferrari F355 Challenge (you brake where you should and slam into the wall). Forza 3 borrowed (okay, STOLE) a lot of ideas from great racing games like CodeMaster's GRID and managed to make a bright, colorful, far more fun Forza 3.Do I play Forza 3 constantly? No. But it is definitely worth a purchase for the times when you want to play a next-generation racing sim on the best hardware that pumps out high-def to your beautiful big-screen plasma or LCD screen. But if you bought the game and then caught sight of all the downloadable content you may have felt just a wee bit...cheated. Well, consider your problem solved!This is basically the game Forza 3 with all the downloadable content that a REASONABLE person could want (a raving obsessive fanatic will doubtless want to download new packs that come out after). You can even use your existing game saves (just delete your previous install data and reinstall the disc 2 to get all of the \"Ultimate Packs\", and then activate the additional downloadable content using the code that comes with the game).One thing to be weary of, however, is that this game requires a HUGE install...particularly if you have one of the smaller Xbox 360 hard drives. This sucker wants 3.4 GB of space BEFORE you install the additional downloadable content. If you have already installed a ton of downloadable games on a small Xbox 360 hard drive you might not have enough room!All that said, this is an outstanding value. For a mere $30.00 or so you get the complete game and a massive amount of additional content. When it was released the game itself was $60.00. And as others have pointed out, the cost of the content alone costs more than the game.Personally, I upgraded my copy of Forza 3 that I had already puchased. I got $7.00 for my old copy of Forza 3 in trade, and a brand-new shrink-wrapped copy of Forza 3 Ultimate for $30.00. That's $23.00 for a WHOLE lot of content. I'll say it again. This is an OUTSTANDING VALUE for racing-sim fans. See you at the starting line.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2010"}

I'm sure my head is a little larger than average as well as my ears and I find this headset to be very comfortable.  I get headaches very easily, especially with over the head headsets.  They typically squeeze my head a bit too tight that causes headaches within 30 minutes or so of usage.  I can use this particular headset for hours before my head starts hurting.  They're not as tight as other headsets that I've used including other Turtle Beach headsets.Sound- The surround sound is incredible with this headset which is very important in the gaming world.  Especially the shooter games that I like to play.  I can hear people all over the map and know when they're getting close and from what direction they're coming from.Setup- Setup was very easy for me.  I was up and running in just a few minutes.  The Quick Start Guide is easy to follow and should answer any questions you may have.Headset Stand- One of the best new features to me is the fact that there's a headset stand attached to the top of the base unit.  I never really had a place to set my headset before so it was usually just laying on top of my dresser.  This feature helps me out greatly.  I love it.Wireless- I love having a wireless headset.  Not sure I could go back to playing a wire after playing wirelessly for the past couple years.  I love having this feature.Charging- If I had anything to complain about this would be it.  Although you have an incredibly long cord that allows you to charge your headset while playing, I would LOVE to have a wall charger.  I'm sick of having to charge everything by USB these days.  I would love to be able to just plug it into the wall at the end of the night and it be ready to go the next day.Battery Life- Luckily the battery life is incredibly good with these headsets.  It even comes charged right out of the box.  15 hours is what the box states and I think it's pretty accurate.  I'm very happy with the battery life.I think this headset is very easy to use and sounds incredible.  I would highly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00A750QIE","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"MLB: The Show Finally Delivers the Total Package","reviewText":"As a series MLB: The Show has been the most consistent of all the yearly sports representations this generation. Consumers have come to rely on exceptional baseball authenticity, realistic gameplay, fantastic graphics, and deep franchise and career modes to invest time with. What has been missing though is sense of accessibility and an acceptable online experience.Those aspects however are no longer holding the franchise back. MLB 13: The Show is the iteration that pulled everything together to finally become a complete product and in doing so will absolutely deserve to be in contention for \"Best of\" awards late this year.POSITIVES*Gameplay and AuthenticityThe unforgiving nature of The Show has finally eased off with the expansion of the hitting timing window. Far more rewarding and satisfying, hitting success has improved dramatically but not to any sort of unrealistic level. Averages were so consistently low in the past, with too many instances of timing and placement feeling \"right\" but still being punished, that now it just feels far more fair. Ultimately fan factor is being impacted here to a great extent.All facets of MLB 13 show improvement over MLB 12. No longer unforgiving at the plate the overall balance and variety in games has increased. Scores are more realistic and producing runs through means other than home runs is a more viable strategy. Comebacks can be made and momentum and confidence are factors.Changes to make \"Guess Pitch\" less of a crutch have proved worthwhile, and the new throwing meter provides more involvement and control over events in the field. Franchise mode benefits from new budgetary adjustments, scouting overhaul, and numbered player ratings. The Show is also well known for providing as many options as possible in regards to aspects such as controls, difficulty levels, and camera angles.*GraphicsOutside of the crowd MLB 13 shines in the graphical department. The lighting, player faces, player models, parks, and animations are all top notch. Though the PS4 will be needed to take that next step there is no discounting that MLB 13 is arguably the best looking sports game out today. Understated changes from year-to-year have gotten it to this place and, even though not dramatically different than last year, it has earned such recognition.*Road to the ShowLargely due to the increased timing window at the plate enjoyment in RTTS has expanded. The shift this year for pitchers is less evident but general gameplay balance regardless of position has been good making the experience challenging but far less frustrating. Changes to fielding cameras don't have much of an impact, and presentation wise the focus being from a player's perspective works in some ways and in others doesn't fully connect. It was fine to lose the commentary but having them jump in for a statement here and there unexpectedly seems odd. The camera cuts and on-screen displays after important events within the career are great touches. Not sure what the point is to the leaderboards but they are there now. The new sim screen which allows for seeing the events take place is a valuable addition. Loading times feel as though they have been reduced. What the mode desperately needs is a form of situational training rather than expecting people to learn things on the fly by trial and error.*OnlineThough not perfect online has taken huge strides this year. Connections are more consistent and performance smoother, the opened hitting window makes the games more entertaining to play, and several smart design decisions (pitcher fatigue, Guess Pitch, matchmaking) have made the entire experience one worth seeking out. The result is obvious as scoring and batting averages are up across the board and ERA and strikeout numbers are down.*Postseason modeInterest in the new Postseason mode was not particularly high heading into release but it exceeded expectations. This is a great way for those people who don't want to invest the time, or don't have it, within franchise but want to play games that feel as though they have meaning. There are plenty of options available in setting up the brackets and the special presentation and ratcheted up atmosphere makes the games stand out from all the others.NEGATIVES*CommentaryWhile the commentary is by no means poor, it has become tired, and is long overdue for an overhaul. That realization wasn't just made this year but has been discussed as an area that needed addressing since MLB 09. MLB 11 switched out Rex Huddler for Eric Karros replacing one poor contributor for another. MLB 13 brings in Steve Lyons with Dave Campbell departing. Lyons presence is not really felt all that much. The feel of the commentary, the pacing (including too much empty space) and manner in which it is threaded together, just hasn't advanced while competition within the genre has taken major steps forward technologically and featured complete booth changes. It is particularly disappointing within playoff games as the commentary just does not match the heightened atmosphere.*Minor Issues and OmissionsGameplay wise the frequency that the CPU throws strikes in power zones on the first pitch of each at bat, which has been well documented, is worrisome and affects strategy at the plate. There is also some sort of slowdown affecting players as they round third base. Those few issues and an occasional stutter on pitch releases will hopefully be patched. Elements of baseball like rainouts, doubleheaders, and retractable roofs that close still haven't been implemented.There is a growing sense that The Show has stalled as far as the PS3 goes and really needs the capabilities of the PS4 to advance any further. That's not to say it is totally deficient in any single way, just that in playing it every year the series is showing reduced returns as far as leaps go. Areas discussed already such as commentary may fall into that category as SCEA isn't going to make big investments in the last year or two of the current generation when they'll be looking to totally differentiate one from the other and help to justify the PS4 next fall.SUMMARYThis is the year that MLB: The Show finally pulled it all together to offer a complete product with exceptional value. Though it may have hit somewhat of a wall on the PS3, the PS4 providing an opportunity to break through in the weaker areas like collision detection and commentary, the changes that were made for MLB 13 still made a significant impact. The Show is a now must-have for any true baseball fan regardless of whether interest lies in Play Now, Postseason, Franchise, Road to the Show, or Online.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2013"}

Arkham Asylum had great graphics and an alright story; however, the gameplay itself became linear and boring. It reminded me of the first Assassins Creed which required you to investigate, beat up thugs, and assassinate target. OVER AND OVER AND OVER...Arkham Asylum was very similar to that. Investigate, beat up thugs, get to target. OVER AND OVER AND OVER...But, in Arkham City, they managed to make it a little more interesting. The story missions and side missions were different. They weren't as linear as before. The graphics are still great. I will warn you that it is a little sandbox, but not completely. Getting around Arkham City is also a bit annoying at times, but overall, it wasn't too bad.If you are a fan of adventure/action, DC comics, or Batman in general, I think you will definitely like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2012"}

well, it's hard to know if you can give the developer credit for work that the player has done, especially when their one preset scheme is mostly borrowed from another game. regardless, fully customizable remote options have become standard in every wii shooter since, making the conduit a watershed FPS in that regard. however, the customization still leaves a little to be desired; locking on does not stop turning on the Y axis, which defeats the purpose of locking on (stabilizing the camera) in the first place. vertical motion in general feels awkwardly sensitive and jittery, with your weapon constantly bobbing up and down with the smallest of movements while the horizontal plain remains steady.adjust all the settings you want, there is no effective way to address this and make the vertical turning feel good. put in a copy of the metroid trilogy, set it to advanced and everything feels right again; the conduit may have the edge when it comes to the range of adjustments but the overall feel is simply not as natural, hammering home the lesson that customization can only do so much without a solid developer based scheme to build off of. that said, the controls can still be tweaked for a great, if not perfect, scheme.-the conduit was developed with a new engine built specifically for wii in order to utilize every bit of power at the system's disposal, a wasted effort in retrospect considering that the conduit is one of the most bland and generic games seen this generation. the weapon models are well done with impressive lighting and texture effects, but nearly everything else looks like it's pulled from an n64 game; the blocky, polygonal, drab environments unintentionally hearken back to goldeneye in ways that don't inspire nostalgia.from sewers to subways to underground bunkers to above ground bunkers, nearly every setting is beyond cliche at this point and yet the conduit manages to make them feel more generic than ever before... walking through the streets of D.C., you'll see storefronts with beige panels where the windows should be, with only a humble neon sign reading \"restaurant\" or \"bar\" to separate one from another. some of the environments are so pathetically uninspired that it's hard to believe this game is running on the same system as metroid corruption, a game with more going on in the background of it's most mundane environments than the conduit has front and center in it's best levels. if it sounds unfair to compare the work of a small developer to a 1st party one, well, high voltage kind of asked to be held to that standard when they un-humbly boasted it would be the wii's best looking game.it's not just the total lack of art direction that makes the levels boring- the layouts themselves are so linear and repetitive that you'll frequently feel like quitting before the halfway point. every level is a series of beige hallways with only the most basic scattering of crates for detail- this was the state of level design in the late 90's for a reason, being that it was all the limited horsepower of the time would allow. high voltage has no such excuse for the emptiness of their level designs; they simply didn't put much effort in (a fact they've tacitly admitted to with their promise to pay attention to art direction and design in the sequel). there are brief moments where the game lets you out of the hallways and tunnels and actually gives you something interesting to look at, but even then it feels like the game is just managing to look \"adequate\".--thankfully the weapons arsenal is fairly diverse and features some creative designs (albeit ones that borrow a little too heavily from perfect dark); you'll be able to find at least one or two guns that will become favorites. some effort has been made to utilize the abilities of the wii remote in firing, such as twisting the remote sideways to activate an alternate fire mode or even directing missiles with the cursor after they've been fired, innovative little twists that are fun to use and work well.for the entire first half of the game you'll generally be facing two different kinds of enemies with those weapons, guys in suits and guys in armor. then, once alien enemies are introduced, it's once again mostly down to two flavors; big ones that shoot at you and annoying little ones that claw at your legs. while fighting is satisfying early on, it begins to feel a bit like a chore to take down the same enemies again and again in levels where enemies respawn endlessly (which there are a lot of). the game features almost no bosses or special enemies to break up the monotony, with most levels ending by simply giving you a few extra guards to fight before fizzling out. it could have been worse, but high voltage certainly didn't deliver much dynamism in the combat department.--if the single player isn't much of a draw, how about the online mulitplayer? shooting real human players with decent guns and precise controls... it's hard to screw up, isn't it? let me describe a typical online encounter in the conduit- you approach another player and empty round after round into their head with no effect. you get the point where you run out of bullets and get shot to death by your opponent while trying to reload; is he hacking? is the game really that slow that it hasn't processed your shots yet? you won't know for another 5-10 seconds, when you'll either see a skull icon appear on screen (indicating that you did in fact kill him at some point during the fight), or see nothing at all (confirming that he was in fact cheating).the laggy nature of the game removes the \"winning\" part of the equation from winning a fight. you'll often deliver the fatal blow to your opponent only for them to continue shooting you during the several seconds (sometimes minutes) it takes before the game recognizes them as 'dead', often making it impossible for either player to come out alive. the lag is the least of the online problems, with invincible hackers firing rocket launchers like machine guns in nearly every match and a heinous spawn glitch that often makes it impossible to even play at all; after setting up the match and waiting 5 minutes to connect with other players, you'll frequently find yourself staring at a glitched screen, unable to move or even return to the wii menu to reboot the game. this once happened to me 5 times in a row, costing over half an hour of time without a single second of gameplay. the silver lining is that the online mode is very fun when it works, with great guns, challenging enemies and a couple of fair maps to shoot them in... the key part of that sentence is \"when it works\".---the single player campaign is bland to the point of unplayable. the online mode rarely connects successfully, keeps up to speed or is free of hackers. all in all, the conduit is a pretty poor excuse for a game. it may sound like i'm being harsh, but no game with this amount of bugs and glitches should have been allowed to reach shelves, and for that reason part of me feels like it could deserve an even lower score. however, the game does stand as having contributed something to this generation of shooters with it's in depth customization scheme, the online multiplayer can be great fun when all the planets align for you and your match actually functions, and the game does deserve credit for taking it's own approach and not using the \"call of duty/battlefield/medal of honor/halo\" mold for it's gameplay, leaving the game with enough redeeming qualities to keep it from being a total disaster.are those redeeming qualities enough to still justify buying this game now that better FPS like red steel 2, goldeneye, numerous call of duty ports, and even high voltage's follow up, conduit 2, are becoming available? in my opinion the answer is no, absolutely not. pass on it, and pass on it hard.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

While the storyline might not be as impressive as that of the original, it is still superbly done, and the game has many other new improvements to offer.Fantastic graphics, some of the best character interaction available, and a continuation of the superb storyline from the original Mass Effect make this game a must-purchase. The gameplay is much improved over the original Mass Effect as well. The game includes support for beautiful high resolution gaming as people have come to expect from modern games. Many of the scenes in the game are just breathtakingly beautiful.To Biowares' credit, they have also vastly improved the immersion speed of Mass Effect 2. The original, while superbly done, took a long time to become interesting. You basically had to play through about 1/4 of the game before it started getting particularly interesting and you got situated in the new universe, etc. Mass Effect 2 has improved by leaps and bounds in this category. I was aching to play this game from the moment I picked it up until the moment I completed the main storyline, and even that wasn't enough.The game also includes some great new improvements in the characters over the older Mass Effect. Miranda Lawson makes an excellent addition to the Mass Effect universe, and her character was just phenomenally well done!As with other recent games by Bioware, the company has opted to go with the decision of not including SecuROM in Mass Effect 2. No need to worry about oppressive and obnoxious methods of DRM with this game.I've heard some compare the Mass Effect series to Star Wars. In many ways, I can't help but see it as a reasonable comparison to make. It's been about that long since I've had a game universe and story I've enjoyed this much, with few exceptions. Don't miss out on the sequel to one of the best military Sci-Fi epics of the decade!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Maximus \"MIRR\"","summary":"Easily the SECOND greatest game of all time","reviewText":"In my opinion, this game is second only to \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\". If I was to buy only two of the games in the Resident Evil-series, I would choose this, along with the remake of the first RE from 2002. Things that separate this from the previous Resident Evil-games:*No fixed camera angles (\"The camera\" follows you wherever you go)*More \"realistic\" enemies (At least some of them. The \"standard\" enemies you fight in this game feels more like inbred and brainwashed humans than zombies. It actually feels a bit like playing \"Deliverance - The Game\". But every now and then there is also a cave-troll (or worse) to deal with)*Ability to buy and sell items and weapon-upgrades from a mysterious vendor (you can sell jewelry collected throughout the game and use the money to buy weapons and other cool stuff:-))Resident Evil 5 is also made with this \"recipe\" and is also a great game that I highly recommend, but it's not as spectacular and epic as RE4. Besides, I think that a misty spanish village (RE4) is a better place for true horror than Africa (RE5). Incredible atmosphere. You'll never get tired of playing this.

Most FPS were basically corridor crawler frag fests designed in a pretty linear fashion. Story line was basically nil, and the intellectual depth was more shallow than the shallow end at your local community swimming pool.But who needed storyline and depth, right? You usually played some sort of military or warrior who was bent on revenge and death, what else do you need?Well, there have been many great FPS over the years. Games that have re-defined and re-designed the FPS genre, added humor and some decent story line as well. But nothing had really come out that altered or re-configured the age old formulaic FPS.Enter Prey.In Prey, you star as Tommy, an Indian who is hell bent on leaving his reservation, and his heritage in the dust. He longs to take his girlfriend Jenny with him, but she is rather content where she is, bartending at the local watering hole. Tommy's grandfather wishes for Tommy to embrace his heritage, to which Tommy merely scoffs at.Lets just say that abduction changes everyhing.The first two levels of Prey are so jaw dropping and eye-openingly shocking, they gave me that oh-so-rare \"epic\" moment that happens only with a handful of games.I don't want to ruin anything for future players, but you WILL see humans being tortured, screaming for thier lives, and other such monstrosities.The premise for Prey is so original and so \"outside-of-the-box\", that this game gets brownie points based on premise alone.There are actually many original and inventive ideas in this game.The story line is very well done. Actually, Prey features one of the best storylines in the FPS genre. There is so much depth and intellectual deepness to the story, which is both frightening and intriguing at the same time.The graphics are really spectacular. The Doom 3 engine is used, and you can really see it shine on the Xbox 360. The architectural and decor theme used in this game is so dark and alien.This is especially apparant when you reach the \"ship\", which is a living, breathing organism unto itself. Some of the walls are made out of breathing brain like matter that shines when light touches it. The metal parts of the ship look just as amazing as well.Character models look really great, movements are believe-able and bodies don't look \"awkward\".And since Prey utilizes the Doom 3 engine, you get lots of shadow and light contrast, which looks really awesome.The ship is a massive, massive construct that is both artificial and living. This ship is so huge, there are rooms that house planet like rocks that have their own gravity.Weapons in Prey are very original and cool. Instead of the typical weapons found in most shooters, Prey features both organic and non organic weapons. And example of an organic weapon would be the creatures that substitute regular grenedes and the hunter rifle. Non organic weapon would be the Leech gun that shoots energy and Tommy's trusty wrench (melee attack).Another neat feature that makes Prey even more original, is Tommy's Zippo. Instead of a flashlight, he has his trusty Zippo lighter for illumination into dark areas.Instead of health packs, there are spores scattered throughout each level that emit a healing gas. This heals a small portion of health. There are also health basins, which are very interesting looking. They heal a large portion of health.If you die, fear not because you will enter the Death Walk. In the Death Walk you are transported to a dimension filled with bird like spirits. Here you must use your bow and kill these spirits. There are two kinds, red and blue. Red replenishes Tommy's health, while blue replenishes Spirit energy. This Death Walk sequence is timed, as Tommy's body slowly lowers toward a hole in the ground during this process. Once it reaches the hole, Tommy's Spirit is sucked back into his body and you are transported back to where you died. This is a very unique and original concept, but kind of detracts from the overall play because it can encourage rather sloppy playing. It doesn't really feel like there is a consequence to wildy running and gunning.Another very cool concept are the gratiy switches located throughout the ship. Once hit, they will shift the whole room around so that the ceiling will become the floor and the floor the ceiling. Or the wall will be come the ceiling and the ceiling the wall. It makes for a very unique experience. There are also magnetic pathways that trail the ceilings and walls. Once activated, Tommy can walk on these to access other areas.Prey also presents a new take on doorways. There are traditional door ways, and then there are the portals. These portals are like tears in the very fabric of reality. You can see them from only one angle, if you walk behind one it will appear that there is no portal. These portals lead to other areas of the ship. They look really cool and add so much to the overall immersion feel.Tommy also gains the ability to Spirit Walk later on in the game. When Tommy activates Spirit Walk, his spirit leaves his body, and he can use his spirit to pass obstacles or attack enemies with his spirit bow.The spirit walk is a completely original feature, but is mainly used for puzzle solving and the occasional \"find-a-way-to-turn-off-the-motion-sensor-lazers\" type puzzle.There are quite a few puzzles to solve in this game. They range from easy to hard, and you will have a blast figuring them out.The enemies range from sentry type aliens, hounds, flying creatures, half machine and half organic creatures and mutilated human slaves that are put to work for the aliens called, well, The Mutilated.There are also bosses through the game, which are usually over the top half machine half organic abominations. Most of the boss battles are epic in scope and are very fun.There are also hazards that will harm Tommy should he encounter these. Cilia jut out of the ground and the ceiling and emit damaging acid upon contact. Tommy can shoot them and they will retract for a short time, but they will reappear. Vomiters spew forth acid waste, which takes out a good chunk of health. There are also egg spawners which shoot out eggs that can be blown up. If left alone however, these eggs with hatch into hound type creatures that will hunt you down.The enemey AI however is rather lackluster, sometimes an enemy with not move an inch while you are shooting them to pieces, other times they will bounce around like a rubber ball. And you are never really bogged down with enemies until later on in the game, so most of the first few levels feel like a cake walk. For the most part, the only negative aspect of Prey is the enemy AI.If you like collecting achievements, you get one for each level you pass in Prey. There are a host of achievements to unlock via multiplayer as well, and some secret ones.The controls are standard FPS fare, and will be easy to remember and use.I have not yet tried multiplayer so I cannot comment on that.As far as the single player version goes, Prey offers a top notch gaming experience that will keep you engaged until the end, however the multitude of levels seem somewhat dragged out and extended beyond what it should be. There are about 23 levels I believe. The AI is decent, but not the best.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2007"}

Disney Interactive on the other hand is known for making games based on their movies and characters.  Based on the very different backgrounds the two companies are coming from, I'm willing to bet that no one would ever think that they would come together to make a game.  Turns out it was a match made in heaven.Kingdom Hearts probably wasn't an easy sell; most of the games that Square makes are geared towards players who are at least 12, an age at which kids tend to lose interest in Disney's animated movies.  Yet here was a game with the difficulty levels of most Square games starring characters such as Donald Duck, Goofy, Peter Pan, Pinnochio, Alice, and Tarzan.  As it turns out, this is a great game.  While it isn't a normal RPG, seeing as how there is no turn-based combat system, it lives up to Square's legacy as a maker of great games.  And despite the large cast of \"cute\" Disney characters, the story is actually very intelligent and engaging.  One other very interesting thing regarding characters is the inclusion of former Final Fantasy characters such as Squall (voiced excellently by David Boreanaz), Cloud, Tidus, and Aeris.The story follows a young boy named Sora (voiced by Haley Joel Osment), whose clothing looks a lot like that of a certain cartoon mouse.  Sora and his friends Riku and Kairi live on an island that they have always dreamed of leaving someday to visit other worlds.  When a freak storm brings a bunch of monsters known as the Heartless to the island, the trio is seperated, and Sora winds up in a strange place where he meets Donald Duck and Goofy.  They are high-ranking officials in the court of King Mickey, and have been instructed to find the owner of a special key, which turns out to be Sora.  He is the Keyblade master, and only he has the power to close the keyholes on various worlds that are currently open and causing the Heartless to invade the various worlds.The trio travels to different worlds, such as Wonderland, Neverland, Halloweentown, Agrabah, Greece, and Atlantica, in order to help various people from the Disney universe.  What they don't know is that a group of Disney villains (such as Maleficent, Jafar, Ursula, Captain Hook, and Hades) is kidnapping princesses to serve an unknown purpose.  In most worlds, a Disney character from that world joins your team to help you out.  Allies include Aladdin, Beast, Peter Pan, and Jack Skellington.While the first part of the game is a little slow, things really start to pick up once you start visiting other worlds (although having Wonderland as the first world may have been a mistake, seeing as how it is pretty much a huge puzzle).  The game is definitely very challenging, which will keep even the best gamers trying to figure out certain bosses weaknesses.  The graphics are beautiful, the voice-work is actually pretty good.  A lot of the voice actors who played the characters in the movies came back for the game such as James Woods, Jim Cummings, Brian Blessed, Robby Benson, and Jodi Benson.  Other voices are provided by Billy Zane, Mandy Moore, and Dan Castellenata.While this game does have a lot going for it, it does have a few minor problems.  The camera takes a LONG time to get used to.  I was more than 3/4 into the game before I was able to actually master the camera system.  There were a few other minor grievances, but this is definitely the most blatant.Overall, this is an engrossing game that will have most gamers enthralled.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2005"}

And it is absolutely true these games, as a rule, do create the quintessential on-line multiplayer experience.  All others are imitators where this is concerned.  However, I actually got this copy for free (its previous owner apparently did not place much value on it). 2) I am not here to laud the merits of Battefield 3.  I have in fact not played it, and I would have no expectation for loving that game much more than this one if I did play it.  So, given these admissions, on to the review.I will concede good marks for the multiplayer (hence the 3 stars on the fun factor)...however, this game is a glorified (and overpriced) expansion pack disguised as the full package.  The single player experience is just okay at best, lots of style but very little substance.  It is pretty much a nice lengthy tutorial for the multiplayer, which is more appropriately designated as an MW3 expansion pack.  Honestly, I see no innovation or upgrade that would warrant a purchase price over about 20 bucks.  What is most disturbing, IMHO, is the trend this game and others like it reinforce...the radical decrease in quality, depth and length of an excellent single player experience in favor of multiplayer mayhem.  For my 60 dollars I would like a truly complete game that delivers on all aspects, Black Ops is simply not that game.  I truly hope someday more gamers will use their purchase power to demand more from developers, until then I suspect we will continue to be inundated with the hollow tripe of this game and its imitators.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2012"}

Johnson","summary":"A true masterpiece worthy of 5 stars","reviewText":"This game was released in the early 90's, a time in which video game makers still focused more on fun gameplay rather than graphics and sound.  These days it seems more and more video game makers just want bragging rights for the best graphics and sound, therefore abandoning the most important aspect of the game; rushing out games that are clearly not finished and very little regard to actual gameplay.With that being said, at the time Zelda:Link to the past had very good graphics and sound to boot.  But what kept me playing this game over and over again was the fun gameplay!  I originally got this game when I got a replacement SNES and this game was bundled with it.  It took me over a year to play it, because I thought to myself, there is no way it could be better than the original Zelda on the NES.  One day I decided to pop this game in and realized that I was WRONG!  This was the most fun game I had ever played on the SNES even better than Super Metroid in many aspects.  It was very easy to pick up and play and easy to learn.  Once I started playing, I just could not stop.  It took all the aspects I loved from the original Zelda on the NES and multiplied them!This game was very succesful in capturing the nostagalistic feel of the original game while at the same time allowing me to enjoy a brand new one.  Absolutely fantastic.You still have to search for heart pieces, weapons, upgrades etc, but this game like the original makes it fun rather than tedious and boring.  I got a real sense of accomplishment when I found a new item and a even greater feeling when I finally beat the game.  This game was fun from start to finish and was never once bored, when I stopped playing this game after a long sitting, it was because I physically couldn't continue, not because I was bored or tired of playing the game.  In fact if I picked this game up today, I know that I will STILL enjoy it as much as I did back then!Its too bad that these days, I am finding myself rushing through a game just to finish it because other than the great graphics the gameplay is subpar and it gets boring after a while.  Rushing through a game causes one not to really appreciate the game and it tells me that the gameplay is lacking and the developers did not do enough to keep the player involved.Honestly, if I had to choose between a game with superior gameplay and OK graphics or a game with superior graphics and OK gameplay, I would choose the gameplay over the graphics everytime. While you get your occasional blockbuster on today's systems, for the most part the games are just all fluff and no substance!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2005"}

The Revenge of the Sith story game allows you to play as Anakin, Obi-Wan or go cooperative with two players reinacting the movie through an action-arcade style game. It's a movie game where you play out the movie, it is what it is.The other component is a duel mode which allows you to fight Jedi vs Jedi. This is where this product is frustrating because this duel game is exactly what many of us have been longing for (think: Soul Calibur set in the Star Wars universe), it's frustrating because the duel mode was added as a bonus; it's an underdeveloped concept, so you have to unlock characters as you play along in story mode (or you can use cheat codes) once you've unlocked them all you get a few surprises (Darth Vader in full armor and Obi-Wan from Episode IV), but I was let down not to have Yoda and The Emperior as playable duel characters.What I hope is that Lucus Arts will have The Collective create a pure dueling Star Wars game based not only on Episode III, but on the entire Universe. There are plenty to add from the expanded universe as well (e.g. Darth Bane), if someone would make this it could be the ultimate Star Wars game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2005"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"Different from the Sands of Time, but still a great game","reviewText":"For starters, I own all 4 of the Prince of Persia, Sands of Time games. I enjoyed them all. This one differs in a few aspects but also has a lot of similarities.Story: The un-named prince in this game is diverted from his course by a sand storm and runs into a woman named Elika that is being chased by bad guys. The journey begins. You learn that a long time ago, there was a power struggle between the gods Ahriman and Ormazd. Ormazd and his people, the Ahura, imprisoned Ahriman and his minions (called the corrupted), in a tree. The Ahura people were to protect the tree so Ahriman could never get out. The King of Ahura lost his daughter and made a deal with Ahriman that if he revived her, he would set him free. In order to put things right, you must defeat four of the Corrupted that have escaped. The hunter, the alchemist, the concubine, and the warrior. Once defeated, you can prevent Ahriman from escaping the tree.Gameplay: Action-Adventure game. You traverse the lands using the Prince's standard acrobatic maneuvers. Elika accompanies you allows you to reach certain areas you can't by yourself. She also prevents you from dying. If you fall, she grabs you, if you are defeated in battle, she revives you. It is basically like using the dagger and reversing time from Sands of Time. This isn't a bad thing since basically if you die in a fight you have to start over instead of picking up where you left off. The land is set out on a map, and you can track your progress and see what areas you haven't completed yet. The game is open world so you don't have to go in any order. You can choose what area you want to go to next. The fighting is similar to the Sands of Time games, but you only take on one bad guy at a time, instead of hordes. Standard sword fighting with special moves and acrobatics. Elika can aid the prince with some combo moves using a sequence of buttons. Once you defeat one of the corrupted, Elika is given that power, represented by a token throughout the land. If you come across one of those tokens, Elika can use it to take you to a new area. Throughout the land, you are also trying to accumulate the \"light\" that you find. Basically they are like orbs. You need a certain amount to complete the game, but you can also try and get all of them as a side mission.Conclusion: The controls are easy to execute. I took off one star on the game for how easy it is. I didn't find the same challenge that I got from the Sands of Time series. The game is still fun and worth owning and there is even some DLC to continue the story. While this game should have a sequel, it doesn't look like Ubisoft is going that direction.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2011"}

It doesn't take long for this game to get to you ( in a good sense ) and then completely emerse and draw you into it's world. I see people complaining about the camera most of all. That doesn't bother me and is part of what makes this game play more like one of the classic's IMOP. The camera works well for me. Now, the biggest thing for me is that this game is long. I feel that the majority of games out there today stray away from this too much and we, as consumers are getting a little ripped off. I dont care so much about multiplayer anymore. Quite frankly Im starting to get a little bored with it and Im tired of most games almost entirely being geared towards the online factor with less of the single-player campaign.

{"product_name":"B0087OZ5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"The Tech Fanatic \"The Tech Fanatic\"","summary":"Best Headphones for Playstation 3","reviewText":"I have used the other third party headphones such as Turtle Beach and they are all too expensive and do not perform anywhere near as good as these. I find that the third party headphones are built cheaply and do not last. I have had my share of experience with Turtle Beach and others where one side of the headphones would stop working or finding that hissing sound that can be very annoying. The microphones on the also do not last. And when they are working they do not match Sony's headphones. And another thing is that they come with a hardware the size of routers just to perform what these headphones can do without them. The only hardware it comes with is the USB plug that you use to connect to the Playstation 3. That means less clutter on your entertainment system shelf or desk. Most of all, the Sony Playstation 3 headphones cost a whole lot less. These headphones like its predecessor were designed for the Playstation 3 by those that know their console. First of all, and most of all, these headphones integrate with the Playstation 3. That means that you get an on-screen display of the charge level and the features such as mute are all on display for you so that you don't have to guess whether your voice is being broadcast or not. That's great because you don't want your comments during frustration being broadcast. Further you can do all the other stuff that those other headphones can do such as mute the chat communications when you are with the company of online adult gamers who act more like thirteen year olds. You know, those that carry trash talking to the worst level and those who use the chat feature to verbally abuse other players because they didn't get enough love growing up. Frankly, I don't need that in my gaming. I came here to relax, not be verbally abused by a man child. Some people's children just don't know how to take a loss. Anyway, I'm getting carried away here. I also own the predecessor and I will give you a comparison here for those of you trying to decide on which model to get. The older model is looser and feels more comfortable. But this newer model has a feature that allows you to use it on not only just the Playstation 3 but with other devices. So you can actually use it to listen to your iPod wirelessly. I haven't used it with my Xbox 360 but I guess if you have a headphone amplifier that converts the signal to analog so that you can plug a headphone jack you can actually use it for that. I use my Sennheiser with the Xbox 360 as I do not need a microphone for that one. I don't play online on the Xbox 360 as there is a toll fee in the form of Xbox Live Gold which is a rip off in my opinion. Why would I play on Xbox Live when I can play for free on Playstation Network? The graphics are the same and in some cases better.  Another upgrade to the newer model is the bass feature. This basically works like a subwoofer when you are watching movies on Blu-ray. If you use your headphones for this purpose, you should really get this model instead as you will be amazed at the sound that you get from movies. For those of you who do not have a theater system, this is like have a virtual surround theater system. I have never heard Blu-ray movies sound as good as on these headphones. They rival or best the premium headphones. They sound better than my more expensive headphones. One reviewer stated that the battery life is short but I have used them for a couple gaming sessions at a time without having to recharge. And I spend a lot of time on Call of Duty online. Speaking of, you can actually hear where your enemies are coming from. They make a difference in your performance. You could be moving around and hear footsteps of you enemy coming at you. It is so good, though, that sometimes you find that a teammate would be coming in your direction in an unstealthy manner and you get all excited for nothing. Also, those with larger heads may find these headphones a little too tight so the older model might be more useful for gamers. The older model has great localization feature in sound like this one does. This headphone, like the older model, allows you to adjust the headband to allow for more wider heads. But then I am only saying this because some are very picky about the comfort level. I think that this model may be tighter but it would still be okay for those with larger heads. It's only those that are really picky about it that it will matter to. Finally, these headphones look very nice. I would say they look better than the older model. Why buy wannabe headphones such as Turtle Beach when you can get the real deal? I would never trade mine for those.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2013"}
{"product_name":"B009LEIUY4","description":"","reviewerName":"azog","summary":"Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan","reviewText":"I hadn't heard of this game, or seen any reviews, but when I saw it on the new releases, I decided to pick this up on a whim. Sometimes such impulse buying can get you burned, like the recent SimCity release. But this game is certainly not one of those.It is a nice mix of classic dungeon crawling using some of the newest technologies. If you're not familiar with dungeon crawling, basically you start out at a base town with a few services (buy, sell, etc), and then venture into a dungeon, but there is more than one dungeon in this game.Also similar to some of those old school crawlers, usually you can only save the game while in town. You can make restore saves, which get deleted as soon as you start playing again, and there are a few special save points in the dungeons. But if you die in this game, you won't be doing the typical save/load routine. And yes, you'll die. And probably often.The game is a bit difficult. There are two settings, normal and easy, but I am playing it on normal. The overall story is just to go out and explore, but don't be reckless. Recklessness will ultimately harm you, as will complacency. There are even a few early encounters that (try to) teach you the detrimental effects of being complacent.Different than many modern games, where the dungeons are side-notes and the maps are fully revealed, where you can beef up and go nuke anything that moves without worrying about dying. So don't get trapped into EZ mode thinking here.There are a few other features in the game that make it unique:Primarily is the mapping system. If you've played any of the classic dungeon crawl games that did not have mapping systems, you might remember the old pen-and-paper maps we'd draw as you explore the dungeons. While the game has an auto-mapper feature, it's by no means perfect. You'll use the 3DS stylus to draw walls, make iconic notes, paint water, and so on. The maps are saved even at the dreaded \"game over\", so that particular hard work is not lost. Get used to mapping, it's necessary, and actually quite fun and enjoyable. Get used to spinning around in a 360 degree circle, and checking to make sure there are no secrets.Oh, how I wish we had this kind of mapping system back in the days of the Bard's Tale!Somewhat related to the mapping system is the auto-play. You can place various movement icons on the map (left, right, up, down), and press \"START\", and the game will automatically move in those directions. Kinda like a macro, but not a fully automatic. You can map out a circular patrol pattern so that you can keep walking around the dungeons waiting for random encounters, without having to keep pressing buttons. I know some players will frown on such \"auto levellers\", but try it. It eases the grinding which seems to be inevitable in these kinda games.Another nice feature is the content delivery system. The developer blog posts QR codes to unlock items, quests, and so on. So far, there are only two such postings, but I hope they continue doing so. You use an in-game feature to access the QR system.Like a lot of newer 3DS games, they try to incorporate StreetPass, which is interesting, altho since I purchased my 3DS during the initial release in January 2011, I've only gotten a single Mii Plaza StreetPass tag. But I'll still hope to see if I get other tags. Apparently you can acquire new characters in this manner.Finally of note is the music and the graphics, which are also just as good. The graphics are nicely drawn, also evoking nostalgia for hand-drawn graphics, instead of perfectly rendered 3D models.  The package I picked up even had a CD of the OST; dunno if the version being sold on Amazon does as well, since it does not specifically note it.All in all, if you like old school hack-n-slash dungeon crawling games, you'll probably like this game. If you've never played one before, why not give it a try?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2013"}

NGII on the other hand I played previously, found it borderline controller-throwing and figured no game is worth this frustration so why am I in the store buying it? It's really the combat system which is arguably, for me anyway, the funnest and most satisfying of the fighting styles, easily besting those in God of War, Devil May Cry, Heavenly Sword or even something like Prince of Persia games. But you know what? That doesn't excuse the poor cheap hits, odd bits of programming and large amount of enemies and this makes this a game that's incredibly hard to love.Story: There's a cutscene in the game where a werewolf named Volf (Volf the Wolf...lot of thought into that name, no?) declares to his minion werewolves that he wants an adversary worthy of him. That's all you need to know about this story: it's frequently stupid, doesn't make sense and is just a placeholder for the sexy violence. There's some kind of baddie who wants to revive a potentially world-destroying Archfiend and yeah, Ryu's the man to stop everybody's plans.Graphics: Team Ninja's animators do really great jobs at delivering not only fast combat but having it be as fluid as possible and seeing Ryu jump, dash and slice his way on screen is quite something to watch. Cutscenes look great and certain locales are quite stunning. However there is one thing they still haven't been able to perfect which is the skin on characters. Quite frankly, they look like shiny mannequins and even with Dead or Alive 4 released several years ago, they still haven't fixed this. Oh and we get it Team Ninja: you love bouncy breasts.Sound/Music: The music's quite dynamic, epic and nicely energetic though not memorable in terms of melodies but it provides an adequate soundtrack at your demon slaying parties while sound effects from roars to swishes of the blade(s) are very good at making the hits and kills that much sweeter. As for voice acting? Keep it on Japanese with English subtitles since the story and the VA becomes a hell of a lot more tolerable. I don't know why it is but even a flatly-delivered line in Japanese sounds cooler than English.Gameplay: Team Ninja are notoriously in love for difficult games; ones that challenge you and push you to the brink but at a certain point you got to ask yourself: is the game worth it if I'm madder at the game the more and more I play it? That's the crux and indeed the proverbial straw that might make you stop playing this. I find it funny on the back of the game's box is mentions that having the ability for save points to replenish your health or major battles will refill your health bar is helpful to a \"casual gamer\". Well you know what? Having played all Devil May Cry games, God of War as well as Ninja Gaiden Sigma, I honestly don't get how they think this game will be easy to Ninja Gaiden newbies or veterans since it frequently adds things detrimental to the enjoyment of it all. Enemies throw exploding shurikens with reckless abandon. Enemies with rocket launchers. Giant mechs in addition to enemies with rocket launchers. Then we have all 3 at once and yeah, this game can frequently get unfair. The game was even winning me over with parts that were challenging but not too bad but then boom, one annoyance after another.And all of this is further enhanced by one of the worst cameras you'll ever be in control of. This camera seems to love the scenery and you more than showing you what you're doing and very frequently I'd have to reposition the camera just to figure out what's going on or who hit me or where that enemy came from. I get that the kill animations wouldn't be as impressive if it was like God of War's camera being your eye-in-the-sky but at least then you could figure out what was going on in the battlefield. Like Tomb Raider games, you'd think with reviews and fans complaining of bad cameras, Team Ninja would go \"damn, we should fix that camera problem next game\" but apparently not. Game's so difficult even the game does stuff that'll make it easier to kill you faster.Now the game as I mentioned way above has probably the most visceral and all-around entertaining fighting combat systems around. Sure it's really just LT to block, X for weak, Y for strong like most games but honestly; being able to go all over the screen tearing enemies apart limb by limb has never felt as rewarding as this. Like I said, save points can regenerate you to full health while major battles can heal you fully after they're done (provided you don't have any red sections) and the wealth of weapons make it apparently easy to make it through the game. Also thankfully, Team Ninja toned down the precision-based platforming sections as well as those damned ghost fish though in their place are respawning jelly fish that explode,  a boss that explodes and kills you unless you hold block (chapter 7, so I save you the aggravation of replaying him) and an item limit of 3....3! You can only carry 3 of each item and yeah, fun fighting, annoying game design.I wish Team Ninja didn't make such frustrating and difficult games since they'd make some of the best action games around but alas, if you're going to get into this, make sure you're not the controlling-throwing kind.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"im \"N/A\"","summary":"More like Multi-Slayer than Multi-Player","reviewText":"When I first played Black Ops 2, I first compared it to MW3, not the first Black Ops. So here's my breakdown.Multiplayer -Not such a big selection of guns, very limited in Light Machine Guns and Submachine Guns. There always is a good amount of Assault rifles, but they didn't even include the P90 in this Black Ops. Game takes place in 2025, yet their using RPG's still and its the last launcher to in the game, By the way, there are only 3 Launchers in the game. 1. Smaw. 2. Stinger. 3. RPG. The End of that.The other thing, they changed multiplayer by a lot. You no longer can get a grenade launcher straight up early in the game, you actually have to level the gun up and it takes time, whether you do good or bad.  The perks in the game are changed up too, you no longer can have a perk that makes you immune to UAV's until your level 55. So while you are playing from Levels 1-54, you are pretty much naked to all UAV's. If you can't have a perk to hide you from UAV's, then at least make a UAV a 4-5 kill streak. They have it as a 3 kill streak and everyone in the game pretty much does not have Ghost.The have also weakened the power of RC-XD's in the game, weakened Grenade launchers, and weakened the Smaw. The Smaw no longer shoots straight and accurate like it did in MW3, it now has a delay and it has a drag when you shoot from a distance, they made the smaw act like the RPG from MW3.I don't know it is frustrating playing Multiplayer, because the Spawning system in Regular Team Deathmatch is seriously outrageous.  I cannot express to you the amount of spawn killings that happen, and it isn't even from kill streaks.  There just always is someone near your spawn, the game automatically spawns you near an enemy most times.If I have to compare it, ALL THE MAPS ON BLACK OPS II, SPAWN YOU LIKE YOU ARE PLAYING DOME IN MW3. IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Campaign isn't bad, I like it as always, just watching the clips and the breakdown of the story.Zombies was kind of crappy, you have exploding fire zombies now. So they blow up next to you, you die. So no point in knifing zombies.The End.Game is not worth your money. Save it and buy it when its cheap.---------------------------------Update: So I was playing recently and I just wanted to confirm to you that, Spawn killing in this game is alive and on-going non-stop in this game.I was spawned right into an enemy semtex grenade. It exploded and it actually did damage to me, and I literally had spawned, it wasn't a - *get to run for 3 seconds spawn kill* - No, it was die, come alive, blow up. The end.The spawn engine in this game or whatever the heck you call it, it is bugged or rigged, I can't express to you how frustrating it is to play a 1st person shooter game that is competitive and have multiple spawn kills ???? I got spawn killed 5 times in a row in one game, it wasn't even funny. Almost every game I get spawn killed in multiple times in a row, not just here and there, IN A ROW. I just quit the game.Honestly, if you are looking for a 1st person shooter. Stick with MW3 for now or Battlefield 3.Wait till they update Black Ops 2, because they really did a Great *Fail* job at their profession in designing a game that is screwing the customers and the players in total.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}

The games violence and Organized Crime are just the tip of the iceberg many are willing to point an angry finger at. This game is a very fun game that revolutionizes games being made for the Playstation 2, not only does it have lots of missions and other things that will keep you up way past your bedtime, it also offers a free-moving world that is all around you. The game covers from a excellent viewpoint that shows off the player amazingly and also gives you the option of switching the viewpoint to such things as the classic overhead view or &quot;Cinematic&quot; view which is amazing and could put some action movies to shame. The game takes place across three islands which you progress through as you do mission and when all three are open to you, the fun truly begins. There are many more features I could talk about, but, there isn't time. So I would recommend this game with all my heart and I would recommend buying the game if the rumor of it being edited any time soon are true.

The Mature rating is there for a reason. This game is not kidding around when it comes to violence, prostitution, racial slurs, homosexuality and so on and so forth. I discourage any parent from allowing their child to play this game.However, if you are over the age of 18 and are responsible enough to realize that you should not imitate everything you see on TV or in a video game, then this game is a must-own. It is not possible to spend a few hours playing this game and not get addicted to it. There is just so much to do. There is a story line involving your character moving amongst different mob bosses, completing various missions. But there is so much more to the game than just the story mode. You can drive around getting to know the area, steal a taxi and earn money, steal a cop car and kill criminals, steal a fire truck or ambulance and save lives, find hidden packages to earn various weapons at your hideout, look for the special jumps hidden throughout the game, start killing people just to see how much attention you can attract, or just wander around experimenting with the different cars and weapons available to you. One of the coolest things about this game is that is has its own built-in stress reliever. Instead of decreasing the life of your controller by smashing into various objects, you can just pull out your favorite weapon and take out your anger on innocent pedestrians.In terms of gameplay, this is one of the deepest games I have ever played. It is completely open-ended. When you start playing, there are so many options that it is hard to decide exactly what you want to do. It could take weeks and weeks before you squeeze every bit of gameplay out of this game. For me, the only negative about this game is its overall offensive theme. While many of the people I associate with complain about this game that is taking the Mature rating to a whole new level, I cannot help but play it because it is just so much fun. It is easily the best video game I have ever played, and that is a pretty heavy endorsement.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2002"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Cole with personality?","reviewText":"'Infamous 2' is the best video game I've played all year. It's a sequel that takes the strengths of the original game, polishes off the rough areas and injects a heavy dose of color and personality. The gameplay's more exciting, the setting is more appealing, and not since 'God of War' has there been a game that makes you feel like a super-powered badass!'Infamous 2' puts you in the role of series protagonist Cole MacGrath, a person with electric superpowers who's done great good or evil (depending on how you play) for his home town of Empire City. After losing a battle with a super being known only as 'the Beast', Empire City is destroyed and Cole and his allies flee to New Marais (think New Orleans) to upgrade. The story is pretty straight-forward comic book fare with Cole getting involved in the conflicts of New Marais while powering up for his rematch with the Beast. The comic-style cutscenes from 'Infamous 1' are back and sharper than ever, but the real joy is the improved in-game cutscenes which seem movie-quality thanks to the engaging main characters. The cutscenes and story do change a little in 'Infamous 2' depending on whether you're a hero or villain but it's mostly towards the end of the game. The story DOES assume you've played 'Infamous 1' so interested gamers will want to start with the original game first.The graphics in 'Infamous 2' (with a few exceptions) are excellent. While the actual graphics are a little more detailed in texture than in 'Infamous 1', the improved motion-capture makes Cole and other characters move naturally giving them an organic look. The setting of New Marais is also a big improvement over Empire City as each location looks fresh and varied with excellent use of color and details to make the town come alive. It's no Liberty City (and is a bit smaller than Empire City) but it suits 'Infamous 2's comic book world perfectly!The audio in 'Infamous 2' is also a treat with more Bluegrass-inspired tunes to compliment the New Orleans-themed setting. The voice-work is top-notch with new voice and mo-cap actor Eric Laden (of 'Left 4 Dead 2' fame) making the character of Cole his own! Nika Futterman is also a standout as the fire-powered 'Nix'.While 'Infamous 2' is aesthetically an improvement over 'Infamous 1' the basic gameplay is very much the same. You're still running/jumping/climbing/flying across buildings and covering and shooting with your powers. The side quests are much more varied than 'Infamous 1' but still not that complicated. The dead-drops (which I all but ignored in the original game) are now essential if you want to flesh out more of Infamous 2's story and characters. There are some racing-type missions (or 'overload' missions) on rooftops but they take a back seat to more super-powered battles in the streets. I personally liked this change as battling against other super-powered beings was my favorite part of Infamous 1 but some gamers might be put off with a more 'shooter'-minded approach. Also, the camera does get stuck sometimes (especially during the melee attacks) and while I never died as a result it did become a hassle.The major gameplay change in 'Infamous 2' is your powers. You still need EXP to upgrade abilities (which get unlocked as the story goes), but to actually obtain a power you have to pull off certain stunts and moves with your current abilities. This makes the game much more involved in my opinion in that it makes you experiment with each power before upgrading. There's also a LOT more powers to obtain in 'Infamous 2', so much so that you have to go into your menu and assign different upgrades to different buttons. The Good/Evil powers are much more varied as 'Good' powers focus on precision and 'Evil' powers focus on destruction. For that reason alone the game is worth playing through twice!While 'Infamous 2' won't impress detractors of the first game, it does just enough different and does it with more excitement and thrills that it'll easily entertain series fans! I want to stress that you DO want to complete the first 'Infamous' before diving into this sequel as certain story-elements may not make sense ( and hey, Infamous 1 is still a great game...which will hopefully make one kick-ass holiday bundle!!). Fans of Infamous 1 and empowering sandbox games, this is a must buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2011"}

I really can't believe how many people were so angered by the ending of this game.  I really don't think its fair to judge the full game just on the ending.  Yes, I do agree that things were summed up a bit too quickly but am i going to waste time and energy worrying about the ending to a freakin video game?  No. No Im not.The journey to the end of the game is what I played the game for and it largely did not disappoint.  I got to see my actions from ME2 play out and that is what I played the game for.  It answered my questions that I had throughout the entire series and that left me pretty satisfied.Some things during my play time did end up affecting my overall rating of the game, however.  There are quite a few glitches in this game.  Not so much during the actual action parts, but during conversations and cut scenes.  Characters disappearing from view mid-conversation, sometimes awkward animation hitches, etc.  I was pretty frustrated so many of those things made it into the final game.  There were a few times that the cover-system made me get caught in the geometry of the game world as well forcing me to load my last game.  This happened only twice, however, and I have not heard this complaint often.Other than those glitches and bugs, this is the best looking mass effect yet.  The battles against the reapers especially look amazing and are intense. There are also more weapons and you can now upgrade them with better accuracy, power, ammo capacity, etc.  This allows much more customization.Other than these changes, and probably a few more, there isn't a whole lot different from ME2.  This may be good or bad depending on what you liked or didn't like about ME2.  Thankfully, you won't be searching every planet for elements.  It is now used to search for resources to aid in the war effort.  Only a few planets in each galaxy contain them so you won't have to be constantly shooting off beacons left and right.  It's a lot less time consuming this time around.Again, the game is very fun to play and is very worth playing if you have followed the series.  The journey to the end was worth the price for me.  I didn't really even mind the ending.  It just wrapped things up too quickly.  I wish there would have been a lengthy ending sequence to explain how everything went down.And just a bit of advice.  If you can, play the multiplayer.  This will raise your combat readiness in the main game which, in turn, will give you the \"best\" ending in the game if its high enough.  You'll know what Im talking about when you start.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-16-2012"}

There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones.

With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well.

C. Bryant","summary":"Fun, nice to look at, but lacking in depth.","reviewText":"It's been said of Stephen King before that he could publish a grocery list and it would sell a million copies.  The perception of Rockstar Games is very similar these days.  From GTA3 forward, the Grand Theft Auto series have been instant classics.  That Rockstar is promising to \"blow people away\" with the upcoming San Andreas title is a scary thought considering how far they pushed the envelope with Vice City.  With titles like State of Emergency, Max Payne, and Manhunt, they further solidified an already stellar reputation.  Here's a company who puts out games the way gamers want them.  No compromises or shortcuts, this crew clearly lives and breathes gaming and it's evident that they enjoy what they do.  These days that's something pretty special, as huge production houses churn out/rush out titles that feel like they were made by people who never played them.The point of all of this is that many people (myself included) probably went out and bought Red Dead Revolver more because it's a Rockstar game than anything else.  Sure, it hits shelves at a time where HBO's Deadwood might have rekindled some national interest in Western-style media.  But if I'm honest, I don't know that I buy this title on the first day if it's coming from EA, UBI, or some other company.In that light, Red Dead Revolver is going to be a bit of a disappointment in the long term with people who buy it before checking the reviews.  Make no mistake, the game is fun, the storyline compelling, the characters fun and interesting.  The game play is solid, the controls easy to get down, there are no major flaws with the game.  Except that it's relatively shallow.  It is as linear as games can get. There's nothing to be determined or decided, save your shot/hit ratio, the damage you take during a given chapter, and what little extras you unlock.  My experience playing is going to be exactly like yours, and yours like anyone else's.Not that this is a bad thing for everyone.  Red Dead plays like an arcade shooter.  You play as one of a few different characters, but mostly the main protagonist, Red.  With a variety of weapons (which can be upgraded throughout the game) you take down waves of opposition in a number of gritty Western movie-style settings.  A ghost town, a graveyard, up in the mountains, on a train, on a ranch, etc.  Beyond the normal aim, shoot and run, you also make use of something called \"Deadeye Mode\", which is a familiar slow-time mode where you can make a series of precise shots against one or more enemies.  The third mode of play is QuickDraw, which is just as it sounds.  The screen comes up, you pull down on the right stick, push up, and try to line up a number of shots before a slow-time clock runs out.  I would have liked to have seen this worked into the game a bit better.The game as a whole is fun once you put aside what could have been, accept it for what it is and enjoy the experience.  It is not a title I will keep long-term, once done with the single player mode, it will get traded in towards something else.  There is a multiplayer mode, but it's limited, and doesn't add (in my opinion) anything to the long term playability of the title.  I felt Rockstar could have done much more with this title.  There are times where you run around town between chapters with no real purpose.  Let me get myself in trouble at the Saloon with a bar brawl, or end up in a Quickdraw shootout because I hit on some saucy barmaid that some other tough unwashed thug is interested in.  Without some of the freedoms and depths Rockstar has worked into its other titles, you do eventually feel like you're just pulling the trigger in one chapter after another, just going through the paces until the inevitable finale with the men who killed your parents.I highly recommend renting this game before buying it.  I'm glad I played it, and I enjoyed it, but when you're done, there's nothing drawing you back in.  Even Western fanatics might not find this one worth keeping long term.  Definitely worth playing, but you might be better served hanging on to that purchase money for Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas if you're a fan of that series.  Make no mistake, this isn't about Red Dead not being considered on its own merits.  I'm not holding it up against Rockstar's previous home runs, despite that being what drove me to buy it blind.  This game isn't a flop, and it's not going to ruin the image of Rockstar, but my opinion is that it's one of their weaker titles.  This game was handed off a couple times, starting with Capcom, ending with Rockstar, perhaps that has something to do with the lack of depth.Positives:Graphically impressive, everything is convincingly gritty and bleak.  Everything has a spaghetti Western-style feel to it visually.Solid storyline.Fun arcade-style gameplay.Hard enough to be a challenge, easy enough to be fun.Bull/horse riding, stagecoach driving and train-related opportunities really add to the fun factor.Negatives:Restrictively linear, no opportunity for playing outside the lines.Shallow.  I know I keep harping on this, but depth is a hallmark of Rockstar titles.No real replay value.Weak online aspect doesn't really add to the game.After about half the chapters, you start to feel like you've been there and done that.Wants to be both an action shooter and a story-based adventure game.  Doesn't really grab onto either and is sort of missing a real identity.Rent it.  Play it.  Enjoy it.  Then move on to something else.High end of the 3 star rating for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2004"}

Each flavor gives your skeletally-challenged friend the ability to transform into an object. For example, if you fed the blob a punch flavored jelly bean he will turn into a hole. Get it? Punch > hole? You ccan then use this hole so that enemies will fall into it or you could jump in to get to an area below you. There are 15 different shapes in all including a ladder, an anvil or even a cannon.You can play A Boy and His Blob with the Wiimote and nunchuck but I prefer to use the Classic Controller Pro. The game works fine with either control set-up. The art style is reminiscent of a cartoon. In fact, the theme of the game is friendship and there are little reminders of these characters' friendship throughout the game. There is even a button dedicated to hugging your alien friend. As far as I can tell there is no in-game benefit of hugging your companion but it is just a little touch to highlight the relationship of these two characters (not entirely unlike Elliot and E.T.)Despite all of this, A Boy and His Blob does offer a fair bit of challenge. While the side-scrolling aspects are pretty standard, some of the puzzles in this game are truly devious in ways reminiscent of Adventures of LoLo or Oddworld. If you are picking this game up for your children be prepared to step in and help them out (and you will probably be stumped once or twice yourself!)Even the boss battles are very much a thinking affair.And this is what makes A Boy and His Blob so difficult to review. There is a temptation to compare this game to Kirby's Epic Yarn, Donkey Kong Country Returns or New Super Mario Bros. Wii. Those are side-scrolling platformers with puzzle elements. A Boy and His Blob is a side-scrolling puzzler with platforming elements. The games may look very similar at first glance but they are two different approaches and so a direct comparison is unfair and inaccurate. On top of this, while the puzzles are very clever the game is not particularly innovative. If you have been playing games for a while, particularly from the NES and SNES eras then you have played games like this before.You do get a lot of levels and it will actually take longer to beat this game than say, Metroid: Other M. If you can find A Boy and His Blob for around $10-$15 new you will get a great deal. I am glad that I own this game but I do not consider it to be a \"must-play\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2011"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.

Gears has always been good but its over, Cod was good and it wont die and now we're back to halo, in my opinion its a great change of pace from Cod and Battlefield, the past 2 entries MW3 and Black Ops 2 have disgusted me with the multiplayer content, the only joy I get out of those titles are zombies mode and the story.  This is a good game, it is a great change of pace and when you play it you can take pride in owning an xbox or in my case having owned 5 of them, sadly though the bar was set too high with the previous entries but compared to any other shooters that came out this year I feel this game makes them look very poor, I hope this review helps at least one person.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2012"}

E Jackson","summary":"I was WRONG about this game","reviewText":"Updated review- March 20, 2007I was completely wrong about Metal Gear Solid.  I've really grown to change my mind about the negative thoughts I once had and NOW I think Metal Gear Solid deserves 5 stars (4.5 to be exact).  I especially grew to appreciate the main purpose of the game which is, as many have already mentioned, being encouraged to AVOID the guards that appear on your radar.  The idea of the game is to find ways to avoid enemies- not just go in and attempt to either shoot or break their necks.  No wonder I originally gave the game a low rating.  I went in expecting to kill everything that walked in my way!  The gameplay is a radically different approach from anything I've ever experienced before.I originally said Metal Gear Solid was one of those games I respect more than I enjoy. I said this because so much thought and energy went into the storyline and voice acting, that I felt the game deserved to be respected, and Konami deserved credit for making it.However, playing the game today for the first time in months, I don't know what happened. When I hit the triangle button to put myself in first-person mode, and looked across the hallway to see if a guard happened to be standing there (or walking towards me) I got caught up in the excitement and the quiet atmosphere of trying to find a way around him. It was addicting. I finally figured out how to break their necks and that was a lot of fun, too. The boss fights are actually the very best thing about Metal Gear Solid.  Every single one of them is fun, not to mention they all require you to figure out the best way to defeat them using your rather large selection of guns and figuring out which gun is the correct one. I love fighting that ninja without using weapons and hearing him speak between the action segments.  Hearing enemies talk while you're fighting them makes you want to kick their butts even MORE!I also love when everything is nice and quiet, and then you accidentally walk right by a guard.  When this happens, a loud sound effect comes in that gives off a feeling of \"Oops, my bad!\" because now the guard is chasing you around.  You now have to run for your life.  I didn't realize last year that this is actually a lot of fun. This IS a really good game. I'm sorry for saying it was average last year. Sometimes I need to actually PLAY a game before speaking my mind.Metal Gear Solid is the revolutionary Playstation game that showed the world a new, life-like way to play video games in the late 90's.  The influence this game had on the future of video gaming is simply astounding.  Metal Gear Solid showed how you can take stealth fighting and wrap a gigantic, memorable story around it.  While I'm not a big fan of lengthy twists and turns in video game storylines, I will give Konami a lot of respect for putting an *incredible* amount of time and effort into the game, and in the process, having the Metal Gear Solid series continue to do well on the Playstation 2, and soon, Playstation 3.I especially like the quiet atmosphere while you try finding ways to walk around guards.  It comes off like you're watching a movie instead of playing a video game, or, to put it another way, you're \"playing\" a movie.  Not many people can create an atmosphere quite like this.  Good job Konami.Sometimes the guards aren't as intelligent as you'd like them to be (you can actually walk into an elevator and they will walk right by, without noticing you) and apparently none of them can see you if you're standing only a couple feet away, but you know, these problems are actually pretty nice because it allows gamers to finish Metal Gear Solid without any major difficulty problems.  I can only imagine how hard the game would be if guards were extremely observant all the time.I still have a problem with the overall darkness of the game, though.  More often than not, an important health or ammo pack is located in a hidden dark area, like near a corner, behind a crate or somewhere you can't see.  It's really not a big deal, though.  Just remind yourself to always check every dark area you come across.  If you're still having trouble finding items, just press the triangle button to put yourself in first-person mode, and hit the left or right buttons on the directional pad to scan around.  This works really well.  In fact, the whole first-person camera angle was a great idea from Konami.Even though 20 minutes of cutscenes and conversations isn't really my thing, at least you are given the option to skip through them if you want (by pressing any one of the four main buttons, plus the Start button).  I hate when game companies FORCE you to watch them.  I don't think the storyline is bad in any shape or form.  It's actually decent.  You see, my whole life I've had a belief that a video game should be more about actually \"playing a game\" and less time should be devoted to storyline segments (I'll make an exception for RPGs).  The storyline in Metal Gear Solid is so big and lengthy that if you were to sit there and listen to the whole thing you would be sitting there for HOURS.  Honestly, Metal Gear Solid focuses more on storyline than actual gameplay.With changing times and technology, people began to prefer the realistic aspects of video gaming.  Metal Gear Solid will go down as one of the originators.I DO have one complaint- there doesn't seem to be an option for you to lock-on to your target, so YOU are forced to find and face the target.  For example, if a guard is located south/east of you, you have to actually use the directional pad to face south/east and THEN you can shoot him.  You have to face him directly or he'll continue shooting at you until you're dead.  This can be a pain because turning correctly is a bit of a challenge.  This could have been fixed with one simple \"lock-on nearest target\" feature.Sure, you have guns that can zoom in on a target, but to use THESE guns you have to get into a special position (which changes the angle of the camera).  By the time you get into that position the guard will have already killed you because it takes a few seconds to get into that position, and believe me, you don't have a SECOND to waste once a guard spots you.  I want a gun that features a QUICK lock-on target (such as a gun with high amounts of firepower and frequently-available ammo packs).  That way it won't feel hopeless when a million guards are after me.Besides a bit of overall darkness, a lengthy storyline and sometimes unfair situations regarding aiming and shooting, I have no other problems with the game.  These are really minor problems and it's easy for me to look past them.  A game that I SHOULD have given more attention to before attempting to give a final verdict.  Metal Gear Solid is a classic game.  It just took me a while to see that.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2006"}

Because it sure seems that way, the framerates, character models, and graphics all look very similar.  Of course there are no zombies in this game, nor are there any animals in Dead Island.  But from the opening cutscene it just felt like the same game engine.  And well, that's kind of a not so good thing because the framerates in Dead Island were just average at best (and in cutscenes they're just downright atrocious).The beginning of the game I have to say was the worst part of the game, but once you start leveling up your abilities and spend a couple of hours in the jungle, the healing from console port's shortcomings can begin to take place.  Most of my satisfaction from performing the various kinds of stealth kills.  The enemy AI is on par with the previous Far Cry games, albeit their eye sight is a lot worse in this outing.  I can crouch-walk across the road only about a  hundred feet directly in front of an enemy pirate without a drop of the caution meter building up.  I know people were crying about enemies having too good vision in the last game, but come on...at least when enemies are alerted, their vision goes from being 'legally blind' back to 20/20 again.The game play itself is a mixed bag of familiar but still awesome weapons to use combined with a completely hokey checkpoint/save system.  Ammo is a significant expense in this game, and while the bow is definitely the coolest (and cheapest) weapon to use most of the time, there are times when you get crank up the firepower with the rocket/grenade launchers and c4 explosives to do some real damage.  Then there's checkpoint/save system...wow, all I can say is that thank god it doesn't randomly not-save my data (like in Dead Island).  There's still some fundamentally flawed aspects of it, like the fact that it doesn't save in between checkpoints if you turn off your machine in the middle of doing a mission.  And missions can take a while, up to 30-45 minutes per mission.  So why wouldn't you want to let us turn off the machine at a checkpoint within the mission and come back to it later?All that crazy business aside, the story is the real shining star.  It's a well done, coming of age themed adventurer's tale with enough 'Bazinga' moments in it to warrant me giving as high of a score as I did.  Almost every NPC you interact with has a personality that's memorable going beyond the skin deep personalities found in a lot of other open world games like Skyrim.  The island is a beautiful and full of atmosphere like Just Cause (minus the snow), and stays true to the entire Far Cry theme.In the end, Far Cry 3 has the personality of a lot of the biggest games released this past couple of years while offering a storyline that goes above and beyond the call of duty.  Be warned though: Framerates are at times horrible, and the checkpoint/save system is pitiful at best.4/5 stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"Josh Perkins \"antisugarcoated\"","summary":"The scariest game ever.","reviewText":"Silent Hill games are not for everyone out there.But for the fortunate people who do enjoy the time they spend constantly afraid of going into the next room, I hope you consider yourself lucky.To start my review, I would just like to say this is the best survival horror game ever made.  Period.  It has a movie-caliber storyline, the best, most detailed graphics on any system, and the sound.  Oh the sound...For those of you who have never played the Silent Hill games before, don't worry about missing out on the story.  Each game is a different story with different characters.  It's just every game is set in or around the foggy town of Silent Hill.And talk about a story.  This game blew me away.  It's not that it has all kinds of twists and turns to throw you around in your head, no, it is just very intriguing.  Now, there is a twist, a big one, but it's at the end and I don't want to give anything away, so I won't say anything.You assume the role of James Sunderland, a man who finds himself back in the town of Silent Hill after getting a letter from his wife.  A letter telling him she's waiting for him in their special place, in Silent Hill.  Now this may not be very riveting to the passerby, but if you pay attention to the not-so-sutble facts, you will find out that the wife that wrote the letter has been dead for three years.  What a great beginning to a survival horror story.  That is, if the developers can pull of the rest of the game.  Which they most cerrtainly did.At the beginning of the game, you find yourself in the grimy bathroom of a rest stop on the edge of the eerie town.  You soon make your way through a trail in the woods and into the town.  The whole time you are accompanied by the most chilling sound effects imaginable.  Though the most frightening are still to come.  Throughout the game, you will visit  numerous places in the town.  The park by the Lake.  The historical society building.  A haunted prison, which is the most frightening area of the game, next to the last area in the game, an eerie old hotel, \"the special place\", where his late wife, Mary, is supposedly waiting.Now when I said this game wasn't for everyone, I wasn't just saying that for fun.  At times I found myself in areas that I could see someone complaining about.  Like the spot where you have to get in a little rowboat and paddle your way toward the light of the dock at the hotel.  The  whole lake is covered in fog and finding the light might take a few minutes, but if you love the story so far, you find yourself strangely drawn to the hotel, and the conclusion of the story.  People have complained to me about having to run all over the town to find things, they think they shouldn't have to run all the way across town to pick up a key off a mutilated man so they can get into the apartment complex (the third creepiest place in the game).  Well, that's life.  If you break a tool and don't have a backup, guess what, you'll find yourself going across town to get a new one.  That's just how things go, so get over it.  It's not like it's hard to find yourself around the town, James uses a bright red marker to scribble out areas that can't be accessed and circles places you need to go.Speaking of James, I'll admit, he is a bit insane.  But after you've completed the game, you'll understand why, so I'm not even going to get into that.  But what I will get into is his archnemesis in the game (in my eyes anyway), a human like being wearing a bloody chef-type apron and donning a large, red pyramid-like apparatus on his head, covering his face and some of his chest.  My friend and I have dubbed him, \"Conehead Shankfist\" after the large red hat and the large metal blade he drags around with him.  Now this name might sound comical, but the second you see him, the lightheartedness(sp?) goes right out the window.  This is something else people complain about, not being able to see everything they fight.  \"Well, what the hell does he look like?  Why can't I see his face?  This is gay!\" are some things I've heard.  But I guess this is what seperates me from the masses.  It's much the same in scary movies.  The horror lies in the mystery, what your eyes can't see, your mind makes up.  This is why most scary movies fail, because the second they show what's chasing the hero or heroin, it becomes just another monster in the movie, there is no more haunting mysteriousness revolving around it's every appearance.  In this I have to give the developers a kudos.  Because after playing this game over and over, as well as the others in the series, I have come to find that, other than the apparent bosses (moths, tremor-like worms, humans) you never really get a good description of the enemies.  The best job I can do for the first enemie you see scurrying around the streets of Silent Hill, before standing up to spray you with a harmful green cloud, is a person in a straightjacket with a new coating of wet skin covering their entire body, and they are frantically trying to get out.  And that's just the basic creature.  Trust me, they get creepier.Anyway, the last thing I'll skim over are the weapons, which vary from an iron pipe, to a shotgun, to my favorite, the large blade old Conehead carries (which, when equipped, is so heavy James lets it drag on the ground, and it takes him a second to swing, which is pretty realistic)  There are multiple endings and secret weapons, which are pretty amusing to use.  And the grainy film over the screen tops off the chilling atmosphere to this great, great game.Let me just add here, yes, the controls are like Resident Evil's, so if you don't like those, you won't like these.  And, while not the best in the world, the voice acting is still enough to get the job done in a decent manner.  Now go buy this game and get ready to be kept up way after dark...My review (based on a scale of 1-5)Graphics-5Sound-5Control-4Overall-5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2004"}

This game is best experienced at night, with all the lights off, and no one home with you. It will seriously freak you out.None of the \"jump\" moments seemed cheap to me. They all fit organically into the structure of the game. They were \"fair\" and they got me every single time. The game builds incredible amounts of tension. You will be hesitant and afraid - even unwilling - to turn around that next corner or open the next door. You never, ever feel safe...the feeling of vulnerability and imminent danger permeates the game.Part of the reason the game achieves this level of tension is through its use of sound and imagery. The gritty, deserted USG Ishimura is designed very well, perhaps taking a page out of Rapture, the world of Bioshock. You get the feeling of a once thriving community that has been devastated and torn to shreds. A ghost town.An example of one of my expriences with Dead Space's use of sound and imagery/lighting: I was walking down a simple hall, just came from a relatively \"safe\" area I had just cleared out (to the best of my knowledge). I had to turn a corner, which I did, as always, with my knees shaking. Nothing. Just a door at the end of the hall. I breathed a sigh of relief and strolled over to the door. Right when I was about to open it, the lights snapped off, and the terrible noises of those horrible creatures ripping through the walls of the Ishimura screeched around me. I totally freaked out, and with sweaty palms and a racing heart, I ran back the way I came, trying desperately the dark and the noises. I got to the door I had came out of, but it wouldn't open either! I wanted to pound the door and scream for it to open, and all of a sudden it all ended. The lights came back on. Now I had to walk down the hall again, and turn that damn corner, again. Well, I did, and it was just that same door innocently waiting at the end of the hall. I walked up to the door (VERY cautiously) and tried to open it again. This time, nothing happened and I proceeded through the door...Dead Space is full of such moments. In this case, nothing really happened to me, but I was still scared out of my wits because the game is so good at building tension and cashing in on it perfectly at just the right moments.The game is also great at distributing the amount of ammo you have so it always feels like you are about to run out and won't have enough to survive the next encounter.Dead Space is an incredible entry in the survival horror genre, and one of the better games set in outer space I've seen in a while. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention the zero-G sequences! Have fun getting attacked from all directions!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8LY","description":"As stranded, miniature spaceperson Olimar, you must find the missing 30  parts your spaceship needs to get you back home. The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Big Daniel McFoot","summary":"This is GameCube at it's finest! Is Pikmin the next Mario?","reviewText":"Pikmin is finally here. The breath of fresh air that was supposedly going to change the way we look at strategy games is in stores as I type this. Everyone always asks, \"What is Pikmin about, anyway?\" Yet, no one seems to know. So, by reading this review, you will not only find out what the hell it's about, but you will also receive the green light to go pick up this awesome game.Pikmin is about a strange, size-of-a-Quarter alien-creature named Captain Olimar. The good ol' Captain seems to live a normal human life, as we are told throughout his adventure on this even more strange planet than his. He has a family, and is apparently a Spaceman. He's also a very intelligent being. A meteor hit the Dolphin, which is Captain Olimar's trusty rocket, thus destroying the poor guy's spaceship. Once he lands on this odd planet, he has noticed that he only has 30 Days to stay on this planet, as the air is highly polluted, and his fresh air system will fail in that amount of time. The Captain is also missing 30 Pieces of his Spaceship, the Dolphin. He finds a contraption that sprouts seeds, which he names an \"Onion.\" The seeds, you ask? They are called \"Pikmin.\" These Pikmin are half animal-half plant creatures that will help Mr. Olimar find his ship pieces, and return him home safely.Well, now that we got that out of the way, let's cut into the beefy center of the game... Pikmin is a strategy game that will control your boredom hours for several days. If you actually have a life, then it will control your boredom hours for several weeks. It's about 12 Hours long, so it's not as short as Luigi's Mansion, but it could be a lot longer. Nonetheless, the game is a MUST OWN if you have a GameCube, and gets my vote for GameCube Game of The Year, without a doubt.Okay, so now that I've given you the story and the green light to buy this bad boy, I guess you want details, eh? Okay. You can have up to 100 Pikmin on the screen and under your control at once. Pretty nifty, huh? This will come in handy for boss battles. Certain monsters are tiny, some are huge, some roam the land, some swim in shallow water, and some like to fly. What you will have to do is send a pack of 60 or more Pikmin to defeat huge monsters, as they can become a pain in small numbers, and kill most of your poor, innocent little Pikmin. There is nothing more frustrating than planting 60 seeds and having 70 dead Pikmin in return. Tsk, tsk.Speaking of seeds, once you kill enemies, drag their dead, lifeless bodies back to your \"Onion\" to sprout more Pikmin! That's right, not only will you get parts to your ship for defeating bosses, but if you have enough Pikmin to carry parts and carcasses, then send one pack of Pikmin for a part, and one pack for the seeds.There are three types of Pikmin; Red Pikmin, which are land animals! They can defeat enemies in a jiffy without dying as much as the blue or yellow, and they are immune to fire. Blue Pikmin, which can swim without a problem, but die easier than the rest, and Yellow Pikmin, who are known for their incredible strength to lift Bombs! How do you get different seeds, you ask? Whichever color Pikmin lifts an object to get de-seeded, that is the color of Pikmin you will get out of that object.Enough of the mushy-stuff. The real fun lies in Pikmin's amazing perspective on making you think before you do anything. If there is a piece of the Dolphin on a ledge that Captain Olimar cannot get to, throw some Pikmin on top of the ledge, and guide them from there! I would explain more of this incredible feature that makes you use your brain like no game has in years, but that would spoil the fun for you, and why would I want to do that?You have a clock in the game, and the Pikmin can only be outside from Sunrise to Sundown, as the planet isn't very lit up. So each day, you have around 14 hours to roam around and collect parts. However, these 14 hours go by very fast, and you will find yourself on the next day in no time. Just ask anybody that played Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. They will tell you how fast the time goes. Make sure you have collected all of your Pikmin before time runs out, or the loose Pikmin will become Ladybug-Food. Worried about the time limit? Don't worry! It's what makes the game fun, and this is coming from me, who disliked Majora's Mask because of the same problem.If you own a GameCube, you must own this game. It's too short, and that is my only complaint. It's still longer than, let's say, Resident Evil, so don't worry on the length of the game. The game also has tons of replay value, and it's so charming, that you will be playing this one for years to come. The game also has that classic Miyamoto \"charm\" in it's writing and feel. The best game on the GameCube. Period.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2002"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"S. Schmidt \"TotalHavoc\"","summary":"Worth the wait!","reviewText":"This review is based partially on the third beta event weekend and the first day of the 3-Day head start for pre-purchasing the game.  I have played parts of the personal quest lines, the dynamic events, player versus player (pvp), world versus world (wvw), and have had some experience with crafting items.  I cannot speak to end game content.  Also, I have never played the first Guild Wars so I cannot compare the two games, but I am an experienced MMO player.Based on my initial impressions I can say that this was definitely an MMO definitely worth me picking up.  The fact that there is no monthly subscription fee was a solid factor in my decision to pick this game up.  There is an in-game gem store where you can spend real world money to buy some extras, but these extras are not needed for the game.  I believe most items that can be purchased are primarily cosmetic in nature so a person cannot buy their way to giving themselves an advantage in the game.  There may be items to temporarily increase your experience rate, I can't say for sure, but if there are it has no impact on other players given that both pvp and wvw normalize all players to level 80.You can tell that every aspect of the game was carefully considered from the ground up.  That is not to say that ideas from other MMOs were not taken and incorporated into the game, but you can tell that the game was carefully crafted in an attempt to correct the past mistakes of other MMO's and to take some of the ideas in previous games and make improvements.  There are a lot of aspects to a game of this scope, so I will try to touch on as much of it as possible, but it may lack detail in some areas.  If you have a question, leave a comment and I will try to answer it in more detail.CHARACTER CREATIONThe customization of your character is extensive.  There are 5 playable races and 8 different professions (their term for classes) - Mesmer, Guardian, Ranger, Elementalist, Thief, Warrior, Engineer, and Necromancer.  All of the character models are visually stunning.  You can tweak things like body type and different facial dimensions to make your character look even more unique.  GW2 employs a dye system that allows you to place up to three different color combinations separately on your chest, legs, gloves, and boots.  What is nice about the system is that as your pick up new armor and equip it, it will inherent these colors so no more mismatched gear.  Yeah!  And you can change your color combinations at any time.  You pick your character's personal storyline.  Did you come from a wealthy family or are you a commoner?  Which of the 6 Gods do you align yourself with?  What experience/goal in your life are you striving to overcome or what regret do you want to right?GRAPHICSThe in game animations are amazing.  Every spell that is cast is unique and satisfying.  If you cast a phoenix to attack an enemy it will create a yellow glowing bird that will flap it's wings to the target and burst into flames.  The environments are epic and awe inspiring.  The settings are varied and the lanscapes feel organic.  All of this adds to the feeling of being in a world that is less engineered and more like one that would truly exist with things living in it.  One thing I can say is that the game has done a tremendous job with scale.  The map and the vistas feel enormous.  Cities feel like cities.  This may also be due to the fact that there are no mounts, so you will be running everywhere you go, but there are waypoints where you can pay a nominal fee to fast travel.  I thought I would miss mounts, however, with my progress in the game up to this point I haven't yet thought, \"I wish I had a mount.\"GAMEPLAYGW2 is a very open world in terms of quests and dynamic events.  Things just sort of happen around you and you go with the flow.  I find the concept refreshing but if you are the type of player that likes structure and direction, you may not enjoy this setup.  The game starts with tutorials to help you get started, but as the game progresses the amount of direction on where to go and what to do drops off.  With GW2 you no longer cash in quests.  You will get item rewards occasionally, usually in your personal storyline where there is more interaction with npcs, but any financial gain you get is mailed to you.  There are few quests that require you talk to a person. If you are traveling around and see something you want to participate in, you can, or you can keep moving on by and look for something else that tickles your fancy.  If you help in an event, all players get a reward if they contributed. You don't have to worry about people stealing your kill because everyone gets loot from attacking a mob.  No rolling for gear and no more ninja looters.  Same with gathering crafting materials.  Three or more players can mine the same node, so you don't have to rush to be the first one there.Each server is constructed such that gameplay on that server during questing is cooperative.  There is no picking of dark and light sides or ability to flag yourself to fight one another.  Competitive fighting is left to the pvp arenas within a server and wvw is massive pvp that pits 3 servers against one another at the same time.  More on this modes later.  There is also aquatic combat that allows you to use harpoons and spear guns, which again have there own unique attacks.Something I found interesting, which may be part of the original GW, is that your abilities are linked to the weapons you are using in both your main and offhands.  You start with one base attack for a weapon.  For example, if you have an axe as a hunter use of that specific axe attack will unlock another unique axe attack, and so forth.  The weapon you are holding in your offhand will also affect the next two abilities you unlock.  If you pick up a two-handed great sword, you start again working with the first unique attack for a two-handed sword and unlock additional abilities unique to that weapon.  Unlocking weapon abilities goes quickly.  After level 10 you start unlocking points to assign to certain attributes to tailor your character to the type of play you want.  You can increase your dps or survivability, etc.  While each character can play any role and has healing abilities.  Some professions are better than others at specific roles still.  You also accumulate skill points that allow you to unlock other spells/attacks that are not weapon specific.  Another feature is that any player can revive any downed player at anytime.In order to keep world populations full, Arenanetessentially \"instances\" the server you are playing on so you can continue to play the game along with everyone else in the overflow, instead of waiting for a queue in a loading screen.  I like this idea but I'm not sure whether is causes problems when grouping or not.  I have seen some comments in the game chat that grouping isn't as friendly as other games, so you may want to take this under consideration when considering your purchase.  Something I'm not fan of is the fact that you pick a single server that all your characters on.  You can visit other servers and quest with friends, but you can only play wvw on your own world.  Also, it appears that you may only get 5 character slots???  Maybe someone reading this can confirm whether there is another way to unlock more slots.Arenanet has also added some little features that help make questing easier.  You can carry around what is known as a salvage kit and reduce items that you don't want/can't use into base components for crafting.  And any crafting materials can be sent to your collection, so it really frees up bag space.SOUNDThe music in GW2 is pleasant and non-intrusive.  Background music consists of the type of scores that you can listen to for hours and not become repetitive.  Spell and weapons effects are solid and the voice acting is fairly good in some parts to really good in others.  The ambient conversations that occur in the world add life to it and can be quite humorous at times.  Kids playing say things like you would expect kids to say one another.PVPI played a limited amount of pvp during the last beta event weekend but I haven't touched it in the game at launch.  Players are normalized to level 80 and every ability you can unlock is unlocked.  The intent is that it is pure skill versus skill, as opposed to abilities giving another player an advantage.  The games are set up to just continuously cycle through all the maps so if you get into a game there is barely any delay until the next map.  The idea is that if you get into a group you like you can just keep playing, which I like.  I wonder, however, if you can get into a situation of too many people leaving at the beginning of a match and putting one team at a disadvantage and trying to play catch up when they finally get their full complement of players.  If I recall correctly I believe all matches are 8 on 8.  The matches seemed fun and the design of the boards made for some interesting battles.WVWTaking the concept of scale that I discussed earlier, the scale of WVW is epic.  Three servers compete for keeps, resources, and a large castle in the center of the map.  The battles are enormous.  Like PVP each player is normalized to level 80 but for WVW you are limited to the skills you have already unlocked during PVE.  There is some lag during WVW gameplay but it appears to be significantly reduced from the beta.  I have adjusted from running full settings to the bare minimum, but it doesn't have any impact on framerate.  The never ending 3-way tug of war that wages in WVW has real implications to each of the home worlds.  The server winning the WVW gets buffs for the server.  I haven't gotten a chance to look at the types of perks/buffs given, so I will try to update this review when I get a chance to look at that.All in all I would give the game 5 STARS for fun and 4.5 STARS overall.  I'm thoroughly enjoying the game and aside for some minor things that impact me I think the game is great.  Again, some of the issues may be more significant to others, but I am looking forward to playing the game for sometime.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00000K1VE","description":"Note to Parents: Realistic violence, gore, horrorAn abandoned research complex on a remote jungle  island, a team of special forces operatives, a horde of vicious velociraptors, and one big, mean  Tyrannosaurus rex constitute the setting and cast ofDino Crisis, the latest masterpiece from the  makers ofResident Evil.You play as Regina, a member of a four-person team sent to retrieve an expatriate scientist. Your radio man  became a midnight snack for the T.rex, so it's up to you and your two remaining teammates to explore a  dino-infested research station, rescue the scientist, call for a helicopter retrieval, and escape with your lives.  Along the way you'll uncover the grizzly remains of those who got in the dinosaurs' way, and you'll unravel  the mystery of how a top-secret energy research project turned into a Jurassic nightmare.And about those dinosaurs: they're all over the island. One instant you'll be walking along a second-story  balcony, admiring the view, the next instant you'll be dodging a T.rex as it smashes its huge maw through  the concrete walls. Velociraptors chase you down blood-spattered corridors, flying reptiles circle the  outdoor areas, and your only weapons are your pistol, whatever else you can salvage, a dwindling supply of  ammunition, and your wits.Packed with clever puzzles and heart-pounding surprises, all superbly presented with realistic graphics and  horror-movie camera angles,Dino Crisisis a triumph of survival-horror gaming.--Mike  FehlauerPros:Great sound effects and musicWell-integrated, varied, and clever puzzlesAwe-inspiring, terrifying dinosaursBranching story line improves replay valueCons:Doors impervious to explosives","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"Really terrifying, intelligent dinos, detailed cinimatics","reviewText":"Steven Spielberg proved that Dinosaurs could be menacing and terrorizing and this game only adds to it. This game is similar to Resident Evil (also from Capcom), but more dangerous, because the dinosaurs actually run and jump over things to eat you, unlike sluggish zombies. Rather than stalking screen to screen like with Resident Evil, you can now run through a room and the camera will follow you, making for great chases (Dinosaurs chasing you), but unfortunately this leaves the player at a great disadvantage, because the camera is focused on the player, not the room, so Dinosaurs constantly get the edge lunging onto the screen. A huge plus to the game is the production, because hard work went into making this game and story excellent. The cinematic scenes to start with are of a higher quality and are very detailed, from breezing hair, brushing plant life to seeing the scales on a dinosaur. The dialog is not cheesy or over acted as in other survival horror games. There are nice visual details which no screen shot can show, such as the lighting effects are realistic, a light sources (computer screens, ceiling lights) illuminate on whatever the source hits. An unfortunate detail of this game is that whether you are bitten, clawed or pounced on, you can actually bleed to death without proper medical supplies. Another downfall of the game is that the item screen is not as neat and tidy as Resident Evil's screen. This new system is rather difficult to use. Finally, with the start screen there is no cinematic introduction that will tip anything in the game to the player.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2002"}

It may seem simple on the surface, but hidden beneath is a complex fighting game that will take you a very long time to master each of the 13 characters.All of the fighters from Virtua Fighter 3 are back, along with two newcomers, Lei Fei and Vanessa Lewis. Each fighter has a staggering number of moves they can perform, an average of 77 distinct moves per fighter, and thats without projectiles! Take that, Street Fighter! Vanessa Lewis tops out at 123 moves, in case you were interested. This is a very deep game that will take you a long time to master.Graphics: This seems to be one of the focal points about Virtua Fighter 4. First, because the graphics are so stunning, but also because the game contains jaggies. Well I'm here to tell you that the jaggies are there, but there's no way you'll care about them while you're playing this otherwise beautiful game. The environments are the highlight, in my opinion. Snow, water, and sand are the three elements you'll encounter on the floor of the fighting arena and each are realistically recreated and interact with the battle taking place. For example, when there is water on the floor, it splashes up when you slam someone into the ground and when your fighters move about the arena. In the snow arena, snow even gets trampled down so you can trace your path in the arena and even work the snow down to the wooden floor beneath. Wind and light are also represented accurately, almost to the point where you don't notice it because it's so natural.The backgrounds are also alive with activity and add more realism to each arena location. One arena is set in the middle of a large aquarium, with fish and sharks swimming by as you fight. Another arena is set amongst Roman-inspired pillars, and lighting strikes these pillars as the match progresses. Another arena is set in a cage surrounded by screaming fans, and all the fans are separate, 3D polygonal entities instead of the drab, one-dimensional bitmap fans we're used to seeing in games like Madden. Really makes the crowd come to life!With all this going on, you almost forget about how good the fighters look. Very detailed faces and outfits, and the fighting animations are very fluid. This game moves very fast, and the character models don't miss a beat. Never any slowdown or choppy framerate, no pop-ups, but there are jaggies. Barely noticeable, but they're there. Like I said earlier though, you won't even have time to notice or care about them.Game Modes: As stated earlier, there are a lot of moves to learn if you want to be a contender in Virtua Fighter 4. Fortunately, there are three different training modes to help you familiarize yourself with all the attacks, throws, jump attacks, down attacks, rising attacks, and reversals. Button mashing will get you through your first few matches, but if you want to excel in Kumite mode, you'll need to practice here a lot. The first Training Mode is Command mode, where on-screen instructions walk you through all the moves your fighter can perform. The next is Free mode, where you can set up specific situations to train in. Finally, Trial mode places you in certain battle situations and then explains what you need to do. This mode focuses on repetition so the moves get burned into your brain.Arcade mode is just what it says - a direct translation of the arcade version. Battle your way through the other fighters for a chance to take on Dural.Vs. mode is for when you have friends over. You and a friend can battle using any of the 13 fighters, or load a built-up fighter from your memory card. No tournament mode, but it does keep track of wins for each player.Kumite mode gives you an endless number of challengers and is really the heart of the single player experience. Here you can choose a fighter and increase their ranking, gain special items, and save your fighter to the memory card.AI System mode is perhaps the most confusing mode in the game. You have two options, sparring and replay. In sparring, you basically teach your AI character different moves and combos. There's no winning or losing here, just teaching. Once you feel your AI fighter has learned enough moves and combos, you can go into reply and watch your AI character fight. If your AI character performs a move you like, press the circle button and your fighter will \"remember\" that move and use it again. If you didn't like the move/combo, press X and your fighter will know not to use that move again. An odd mode that is not explained well at all in the manual, and will take a lot of time to get your AI fighter any good. Kind of a Tomogotchi mode for those interested.Controls: The controls are very simple, it's just how you use them in combination with each other to create all your combos, throws, and reversals. There is one guard button (square), one punch button (X), and one kick button (circle). The triangle button acts as a secondary punch button, and the shoulder buttons are simply combinations of the normal buttons. For example, L1 is punch and guard together. Easy controls to remember, but difficult to remember some of the long move commands during the heat of battle.Audio: Most of the battle tracks are laden with rock guitar, which works with the fast-paced fighting. Sound effects are very good for the hitting and environments (water splashing, etc.). Voice-acting is good, but gets a little repetitive. Thankfully, most of the talking only lasts a few seconds. Not much to say in this game besides taunting the other fighters.Overall, Virtua Fighter 4 is very well done and will definitely please fans of the series and fighting fans in general. There's really not much to complain about, unless you're a graphics whore and can't get past the jaggies. Can I say whore? Anyway, this is a very deep game that will take you a long time to master your chosen character, and should provide a balanced challenge all around.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2006"}

This one Torneko is fun but not powerful enough to help you out with any major monsters as the game progresses.It's a good game and if you liked the original it's not going to give you many surprises. I've got 36 hours into it and still have to grind a bunch more levels to beat the 2nd Boss. Lots of cheap shots by the monsters and it's boss battles at least the end one seems longer and it's cheap in that the boss gets 2 hits and so far none of my guys have had a miss. If you equip spell reflecting items they also stop good spells like major healing spells.Over all it's fun if you like the old style, mandatory level grinding games and it's not a rogue game so if you die, you lose half your cash but not all your armor and weapons and you can save your money in a bank. All DQ games have that feature.DQ just like Final Fantasy and the Tales RPG's all have their own world and rules and styles and I like all of them. But if you want balanced RPG this isn't it. You will have to go out and fight lots of battles to increase your experience, levels and money.

Carter \"Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club ...","summary":"Great product...one big oversight.","reviewText":"This is more than likely the best steering wheel for the PS3. The Playstation 3 Logitech Driving Force GT Racing Wheel has all the bells and whistles that you would expect from Logitech. 900 degree wheel rotation, advanced force feedback, a real-time adjustment dial for fine-tuning your driving experience and a whole lot more. The wheel basically comes with the wheel and the break/gas pedals, both of which connect to your PS3 via USB. Wireless would have been nice, but I guess that would have made it prohibitively expensive. You'll also have to connect an AC power unit to the wheel, which is kind of a hassle, but it's worth it for the driving experience, which is second to none compared to the other console wheels I've used.The one big oversight that the product has is that there's really no way to play with it on your lap. You basically have to mount it to a table or desk, and considering that this is a product for a console, to me that's kind of a major oversight on Logitech's part. Apparently there's going to be a \"lapboard\" attachment coming for an additional $20, but that should have been included. People don't play console games at a desk.Overall, this is a good product. If you really get into your driving/racing games, the price isn't too much to ask, and the wheel is exceptionally responsive. It's a bit bulky, and getting it at a good level is difficult since we're talking about console gaming here (how many console gaming tables do they make again?), as most coffee tables are way too low, at least for me. If they can fix that one problem, they'd do a lot in improving this wheel's functionality among it's target users.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2008"}

This one is really a well put together one.  The steering wheel itself is covered with a rubber grip so it feels good and won't slip when your hands sweat.  The pedals themselves are pretty cool and have a heavy duty touch to them.  Not flimsy.  I tried the wheel with two different games.  Gran Turismo 5, which is WAY COOL, and Need for speed.  I didn't care much for the graphics of Need for Speed, but I'm not here to review the game.The only down side to the wheel are:  1) It does this weird little spin on it's own at times.  I don't like that 'cause if you are gripping the wheel, when it starts to spin, could there be the potential for it to break?  2) Then there is the cable connector from the wheel.  A couple of times it came off and I didn't realize it until my car crashed.  I tried to figure out why until I looked and it just came out.  Now, this wheel does require that you clamp it to a table.  I unfortunately, couldn't at the time, so it was hard to steer without moving the wheel a lot.  That's probably when the cable came out.  I remember a neat wheel I had for the PS1 that actually had a plastic base that you would actually sit on and the wheel came up between your legs.  That was a great way to play and not have to worry about clamping on the table.3) The clamps themselves didn't have rubber grips, which I think it should so that it doesn't ruin nice tables.  I can find those at the local hardware store, but I shouldn't have to.Overall, this wheel is incredible.  I also noticed that the front of the unit looks like the front hood of a car!!!

Here I am with my 1080p led, lcd, 3D tv and my 480p Wii hurling 1999's graphics at the screen while I wave my arms around trying to take out enemies with my imaginary sword.So they upped the motion control, by making you spend $20 on a thing that plugs into your controller and makes it long and flimsy or a new controller that cost $40.

Do I want to take a few hours and explore Hyrule? YES!!!!!!! Do I want to do it standing up and flaying about like an idiot? NO!!!!!!You know who I have noticed owning and using the Wii? the over 55 crowd and the under 12 crowd. The rest of us have PS3 and Xbox.Look, I love Zelda (and Metroid for that matter) but by forcing this damned motion control on us Nintendo has changed a Game of exploration and puzzles to a 40+hours of standing and waving your arms about. Sure, it's a fun novelty but seriously?I'd gladly give this 5 stars. It's a great game, it's everything you want when you play Zelda ... but since my f'n back hurts from working all the time I really need to sit down and and play Skyrim instead. Sorry Zelda, some one else will have to guide Link for you, the price tag is too high and I need to sit down.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002BSC54I","reviewerName":"Phantom","summary":"Perfection","reviewText":"I would like to begin my review by stating that I'm a gamer. I play PC games, console exclusive games, and portable games. I treat all platforms equally and only judge the content. In addition, I'm fortunate enough to have been alive and well pre, during, and post the golden age of gaming.Visuals:The new visual direction is amazing and it works. It's art! Everyone has their own option and some will disagree and that's OK. But it works for me and I was impressed. It's a blend between cel shading and the more realistic approach art direction of Twilight Princess with a touch of water paint.Sound:I really enjoyed the music scores and sound effects. Again, it's my opinion and some will really like it and some won't. Everyone has different tastes.Gameplay:Simply put, one of the greatest aspects of the game. The controls work and are implemented very well. This particular game can't be played with a regular controller because there are gameplay elements that make that impossible. Motion controls adds another level of satisfaction that a person can't get any other way.This particular game has changed the \"Zelda formula\". If you've played other iterations of the game, you'll notice the difference early on. There is now a central hub from where you will branch off to complete various tasks including side quests. In addition, the dungeon designs are genius.There is a crafting system in place that works very well. Though it's basic in comparison to other games, it works very well and adds another level of greatness to the game.Presentation:I would love to see a Zelda game with the full glory of voice acting (some will disagree with me) but this game sticks to the traditional text bubbles. And you know what? It still works. Especially because of one particular reason, elaborate facial expressions. It's done extremely well and it fits.The game interface works well but can get very clunky. Thankfully, there is an option to make most of it invisible.In conclusion, this new Zelda game simultaneously feels new and familiar. In my humble opinion, it's better than Ocarina of Time which makes it the greatest game ever created.If you own a Wii, this game is a \"must have\". If you don't, this game should be the reason to purchase one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"fun, but it's clearly time to end this series","reviewText":"New Super Mario Bros. U is a pretty solid game both graphically and from a gameplay perspective, but I believe with this game it's honestly reached the point of being \"been there, done that\" quite convincingly now.  We have MORE than enough games in the New Super Mario Bros. series that it's probably time to call it quits and come up with another innovative style of Mario platforming (like the Galaxy series executed so well).While I feel sort of guilty for giving New Super Mario Bros. U a 4-star rating, the truth is, it's absolutely *fun* to play and the amount of entertainment you get from a video game is the most important aspect above everything else (including originality, as much as I hate to say it).  But seriously Nintendo, this should be the last game in the New Super Mario Bros. series.  We've seen everything the series has to offer, and it's quite obvious that showing off beautiful graphics is the main attraction of the series anyway since the platforming itself isn't *that* much different from the older Mario games.  Certainly not very challenging either even though a couple stages have a few tricky moments (a challenge created mostly from collecting the star coins located in clever spots scattered throughout several levels).  The star coins allow more bonus levels to open I believe, but I haven't gotten to that point in the game yet.  I'd say the challenge is strikingly similar to Super Mario Bros. 3 but probably not quite as consistent as that legendary game.On the flipside however, if I compare this game to the NES and Super NES Mario platformers, I can't help but be blown away at how updated the New Super Mario Bros.s series looks.  The platforms are probably slightly trickier than most of the ones from Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World even though the idea is almost exactly the same, and the graphics are so beautiful I can't help but fall in love with the game anyway.  Nintendo really went the extra mile in dazzling gamers with little details around every corner, which is why every level feels so jam-packed with goodies, because they are.  There's an abundance of coins everywhere that simply appear by either walking through hidden sections of walls or by jumping to certain areas and coins rain down from above- these are two common occurrences.  It's a really amazing experience which proves why Mario Bros. is always going to be my top platformer pick forever and ever despite being repetitive by this point.I suppose to name a few graphically pleasing parts that stand out above the rest- the purple woods in the background of the ghost house stages are absolutely *incredible* looking.  Also the colorful crystal caves in the background of another stage is a high point.  The music is memorable but nothing extraordinary.  Actually that's a compliment- quite often Mario themes annoy the crap out of me.  Not so here, thankfully.  Slightly baby-ish perhaps, but there's bigger crimes out there.  The music seems to be remixed/altered themes of previous Mario games but with a new twist, which is nice.All the familiar classic enemies return which is another benefit.  Every stage drastically stands apart from the others which provides a great deal of diversity that I appreciate.  The one water stage is my favorite- you have to avoid a giant water snake creature from persistently chasing you, which is quite the challenge.  I'm also a big fan of the ghost house stages, some of which provide mazes that encourages the player to choose the right doors to figure out the way forward or find star coins.The squirrel suit is alright, but too reminiscent of the raccoon suit from Super Mario Bros. 3.  Yoshi returns- both the rideable green Yoshi and the baby Yoshi you can carry around (first introduced in Super Mario World).  One thing that bugs me is that the game allows you to wall jump.  This means whenever you're on the verge of death, simply by clinging to the side of the wall assures you can jump up and probably reach safety.  Older games (ahem, like ME!) didn't have this luxury back in the day.  Almost feels like cheating whenever I use it.  I'd rather just fall and die and try again.  I'm also not particularly fond of the fact you can ground stomp on TOP of bricks and coin blocks.  Makes the game too easy.  The boss fights are awesome.  While essentially it's the same exact set-up as Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World (stomp on the heads of Bowser's children 3 times) these boss strategies are more elaborate compared to their older NES and Super NES battles.  Ludwig's blue-firing shooting abilities is really intense.  He's actually harder than the Bowser fight at the end (and by the way, Bowser's appearance DESCRIBES epic here- wait 'til you see him!!)Word to the wise- only play 2-player mode if your partner is experienced with the Mario series.  There's nothing more frustrating than playing with someone who doesn't know what to do.  If you play with an inexperienced player, the most effective way they can contribute is by creating colorful platforms for you to jump on and advance.  Otherwise they'll constantly get in your way and just be a great big unnecessary obstacle standing in your way (literally).To give an example- let's say you're ready to jump to a higher platform but... your partner is standing in the way, so you bump into their Luigi character which takes your focus away from the original obstacle and causes interference, which will probably result in Mario falling down the screen.  Really annoying, trust me.  Also, if your partner fails to keep up in time and sticks to the left of the screen, this will subsequently prevent YOU from moving to the right (forward) and if you're on a stage where you need to master tricky platform jumps to succeed, you'll probably end up falling down and losing a life.  Yeah, stick with 1-player mode.Otherwise, the game is fairly easy.  I had an assortment of lives (up to 70) by the time I reached the final world.  I died a few times along the way and I'm by NO means a Mario platform master or perfectionist or anything- I lose lives when I play games just like everyone else.  It's just not a very hard game.  A lack of challenge and being derivative of previous New Super Mario Bros. games are the only two reasons I'm lowering my rating to 4 stars.  Otherwise, terrific game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2013"}

Humanity has been ravaged by infection, the diseased prowl through the streets, waiting to prey on your living flesh at every turn!  ZombiU is built from the ground up to take full advantage of the WiiU and its revolutionary New Controller and will test your will to survive in a fear-fueled zombie Survival Horror First Person Shooter. Make every second count; you only get one chance.  Stay Human.","reviewerName":"Raven A. Wind","summary":"A fresh take on the zombie genre","reviewText":"Some people are calling this \"Survival horror\", and I think that's a fair description. Personally, I see it more as \"realistic zombie adventure\", because unlike the survival horror genre, you're not stuck with awful controls. Face it folks, the intentionally-slow controls on Resident Evil were clunky.But in ZOMBIU, you're able to control your character easily enough, just like any First-Person RPG or Shooter. The difference is that you aren't given a massive gun and unlimited ammo, and the hordes act like hordes. They surround you, and you can't just blaze your way through them. Ammo is limited, and your character isn't a commando. Sometimes it takes several shots to take down a biter, and even when you knock some of them down they'll crawl toward you and bite your ankles-- All while you're still trying to hold off the rest of the horde.And that's just basic combat if you're lucky enough to have ammo. Most of the time, you're out and you're stuck using your cricket bat. It takes four or five good whacks to take down a zombie with the bat, and when you've got many of them around you, it's not likely you'll manage to take them down.What further makes it feel dangerous is the fact that you can't just pull the trigger and swing away. Nope... You have to use one trigger to \"ready\" your swing, and the other to go through with it. Otherwise, you'll just shove the zombies back a bit. This two-trigger method makes it feel like you really have to work to take out a zombie, and it amps up the fear factor when you find yourself cornered.Oh, and you will be cornered. Don't doubt that.The GamePad is a cool addition to the game. You access inventory, scan the environment, and turn on your flashlight/torch from the GamePad screen. Scanning is cool, as you have to sweep around with the controller to look at your environment. Everything happens in real-time, though, so if you start digging in your backpack, you'd better be sure you have a moment to take your eyes off the TV screen-- your environment-- and find the item in your bag.Other cool enhancements from the GamePad include the separate sounds coming from it, as if it's a portable communicator, and the ability to transfer all game sound to the controller so you can put on some headphones.The game mechanic of having the different lives be different survivors, and then having to hunt down the previous (non)survivor to get your gear back is pretty brilliant. Having the occasional stranger from online show up in your game as a walking corpse is also pretty cool. Especially if you loot his corpse and find something you need.The atmosphere is creepy... And dark. This game is awesome at night! Several sections take you through darkened rooms and tunnels, and only your flashlight can make it possible to maneuver safely. The sound is great, too. Thunderstorms shake the room and rain pouring down sounds beautiful and foreboding. The howls, moans, and screams of the undead make the world seem very hostile, even when you're not near a group of ghouls.The game also feels a little like a horror version of Skyrim, in that you develop skill with the weapon you're using as you use it. While it's not as open as Skyrim, you still have a lot of freedom to wander the world in various locations to loot, hunt the dead (or be hunted), and get back to your safehouse.If you're looking for a fast-paced shooter, this is not your game. Go get Black Ops 2, instead. If you're looking for a horror game with heavy emphasis on your weakness as a human being, and moody atmosphere, then this is what you want. It's a worthy launch title for the Wii U, and I'd say it's a must-have for anyone who likes horror.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2012"}

It's a valid criticism, but I don't think most of these reviewers really believe the game to be 1-star. Despite the short story mode, this is still a very fun game and even after you finish the main story mode there are numerous tracks to run in the challenge series which are much more challenging than the main game.What I like about this game is that there are elements from Carbon, Undercover and Hot Pursuit in this game. And the stages where you are driving through the canyons in the southwest and the snow/ice in the rocky mountains and dodging avalanches, and trying to dodge head-on collisions during the Midwest stages are really very fun! And though the animation graphics/cut scenes are just so-so the visual and auditory affects at times are just stunning. The sound of the thunder during the Badlands stage was I think the most impressive though the vivid colors of the Eastern forest also impressed.I finished the main story mode in about 2 1/2 hours which makes it the shortest game I've ever played! But I've only played through some of the challenge series and if it is anything like NFS Undercover I likely will be playing on it for quite some time to try to get gold medals on all the stages! The collection of cars is nice, too. In story mode I only used 4 different automobiles but in the challenge series on most of them you have many cars to choose from with the usual suspects like the Pagani, Lamborghini, Porsche 911, etc. but also some cool 90's models are thrown in there like the Audi Quattro.FINAL GRADE: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"Returning to the Field","reviewText":"I got a lot of mileage out ofBATTLEFIELD: BAD COMPANY 2. While the campaign was pretty much a bust, I was still having fun with its multiplayer mode until only a few weeks ago - when it was time to start bracing for this game. It was the most fun I'd had with an FPS since the original BATTLEFIELD 1942, another game that wasn't necessarily all about having an itchy trigger finger, but whether or not you could work together with your team to complete an objective. BATTLEFIELD 3 continues that tradition of addicting team-based gameplay, again delivering one of the finest multiplayer modes I've ever played.But in its mad rush to dethrone the CALL OF DUTY franchise, the developers over at DICE may have pulled the trigger a bit too early. While still a game that holds itself high above all others in the genre, it does so weak at the knees.CAMPAIGN:As I said, the campaign for BAD COMPANY 2 could've been better. It was pretty and frantic at times, but it wasn't very long before it started to feel repetitive. You can throw as many enemy soldiers as you want at the player, but if there's no substance, no reason to even care if you're being shot at, then something's off. BATTLEFIELD 3 tries to rectify this by making the missions more involving - mostly through action. It's not so much \"Go Here, Kill Them\" (though you will be doing a lot of that), but more like \"Go Here, Guess What's Gonna Happen Next.\" There's more variety in terms of how each mission is completed. For an idea of what I mean, it kinda boils down to this: If you've played the MODERN WARFARE series... well, there you go.DICE have tried to capture that proverbial CoD lightning in a bottle by delivering a campaign that feels like MODERN WARFARE if it tried to take itself way too seriously, and that might be good or bad depending. BATTLEFIELD 3 has all the action, but a startling lack of characters that exude anything other than military protocol. You know that you, for the most part, play as Staff Sergeant Henry Blackburn, the solemn, stone-faced U.S. Marine that you see in cutscenes between missions. You also know that Blackburn was attempting to stop a nuclear threat of some kind before being placed under interrogation by his superiors. Aside from that, the eye-popping action, and the attention to detail, there's not much more to it than that.Granted, all of the levels look dazzling and unique from each other. It's obvious that A LOT of work went into the level design. I can't tell you how many times I found myself holding up the mission just to take in the scenery. It's definitely one of the best- (if not THE best) looking games currently available on the Xbox 360. For a game to look this good on six-year-old hardware, DICE must have magicians working for them.It's definitely the best BATTLEFIELD campaign that I've played. Unlike BC2, I was rarely bored; the action is intense, there are some interesting twists and turns, and the visuals take everything up to a whole other level. The main caveat being that it's just nothing that hasn't been done before. Military-based shooters involving a nuclear threat are in no short supply these days. Add to that your typical launch day glitches/bugs, questionable AI, and lack of compelling characters to care about, and you've got a campaign that won't disappoint but, at the same time, only raises the bar for its own franchise.Though it does pull off a framed narrative with more competence than DRAGON AGE 2. (I'll take any excuse to rail against that game.)MULTIPLAYER:A majority of BF3's players will very likely forget that there's a campaign disc and throw themselves straight at the multiplayer. Almost did that myself. To be brief, that multiplayer is good. Very good. I wasn't sure how DICE would improve on BAD COMPANY 2's near-flawless (in my opinion) multiplayer mode, but they've certainly found a way. A lot of the changes are cosmetic. The levels are more city-based, which adds a whole new element of strategy, coming from BC2's mostly rural setting.The destruction aspect is still there. Smaller one or two story buildings that take a little bit too much flak will eventually collapse and taller buildings, under the same treatment, will shed mounds of debris onto the streets below, exposing the inner floors and decimating any players unlucky enough to be standing on the wrong part of the sidewalk. There was some concern about whether or not the destruction was toned down for BF3, but I don't believe it has; there's just different forms of destruction now. You're not going to see towers collapsing onto the streets or anything but, like in BC2, the levels probably won't look very pretty by the time your game's over.The vehicles are back, with the notable addition of the F/A 18 Super Hornet, enabling jet combat with its own set of weapons and countermeasures. New to the series, vehicles can now be disabled, making it possible for ground troops to get the upper hand with some effort. The classes have also been tweaked a bit, with Assault now fulfilling the role of Medic, as well, and the new Support class being for ammo distribution and enemy suppression. To top it all off, there are many more options for customizing and fine-tuning your weapon and sidearm to suit your playstyle. No colorful weapon skins or anything like that, but I consider that a plus in this context.Movement has been improved, with the ability to vault/slide over obstacles and the reintroduction of being able to go prone. At first, I was very much against this, since I could envision half the map hiding away prone, sniping until they got bored. Doesn't mean that didn't happen, but the lack of maneuverability you have makes it difficult to defend yourself should you be discovered. Keeps things nice and balanced for now.The current downside to the multiplayer is that it's not quite stable. It's very clear that EA underestimated just how many people would be playing, so lag and entire servers going dark is a constant. At this point, I haven't even been able to access all of the maps yet. It's tough for me to complain less than two days after launch, since this is usually the case for all games of this type, but with the campaign being in the \"almost\" state it is now and the rest of the game being so heavily reliant on its online element, you might have yourself a two disc game and nothing to do!This should be cleared up and stabilized within the next few weeks along with the battery of patches that are sure to come, but if you like having the certainty of playing as you like, waiting to pick this game up might be in your best interest.As it stands, I've played through the campaign and seen enough of the multiplayer to know that I won't be regretting this purchase. I can nitpick - about this aggravating \"online pass\" business, the AI teammates that like to push me out of cover, or how the only female character in the game is the only one who doesn't talk - but it wouldn't take away from the fact that I've been having the time of my life (when the servers permit it). In my mind, these nitpicks are what keep BATTLEFIELD 3 from achieving the absolute greatness that I thought it would on its first try, but even so, it's still met my expectations - and it's been a great ride so far.Now we can all sit back and wait for the inevitable BATTLEFIELD 3: VIETNAM.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E620","description":"","reviewerName":"Carlos E. Coto","summary":"Different yet funny","reviewText":"Ratchet all 4 one is a new game with a complete different playstyle that every single ratchet and clank game ever made. The characters however, have not lost their touch nor have they lost the moments which make the games hilareous. Now on to the real review. I rented this game on redbox and decided to give it a try. Issues with the game is the game mechanics are completely different which I myself am not accustomed to. The guns are unlocked as you clear stages and you get to level them up as you use them, but you pick the gun out from the right analog stick removing any camera controlling features. That for many gamers is a flaw. You are trapped to use the camera movements from the game itself without you having a 360 degree angle control.Still I can't seem to find a dull moment in the game offering me the colorful details of the levels with an impressive look that ratchet and clank is known for. The character voices return and Dr. Nefarious still has the glitch with his gears picking up the space opera at random times that still make me chuckle since ratchet and clank up your arsenal. The animation style still has the ratchet and clank feel of the background colors and enemies, but the game for me feels a bit similar to the sonic series. (kind of like sonic heroes esque)However this game might not be what many expect and can be quite controversial as this game changes from the feel of the series. Do note that after each ratchet and clank trilogy series, a different game is made for more co-op features. Ratchet deadlock is a perfect example of this, though it doesn't separate from the norm of the game as much as this one.What Ratchet and Clank All 4 One offers is the basic idea of having a 4 way multiplayer co-op where there is no bonundaries of you killing players in the game, A sort of feel from castle crashers or Scott Pilgrim vs the world. Still this game is not exactly a side scroller, it does have a sort of feel to it. Level quality has not dropped in this series but can give you a bit of mix thoughts when you actually play the game and see the story progress. While I have not yet experienced the game 100%, I can say I have enjoyed the hours I played on it. I suggest to people to rent this one, because it either may or may not be what you might be looking for, as an individual, and renting it can give you a feel if its worth buying or just renting and playing it with your friends for a while and then returning it back at redbox or gamefly.The game could have been a bit better by adding camera controls like in the other games, where holding the triangle button and the analog stick would be used to choose your weapon, while having the right analog stick to be your camera movements, but the voice animation, the jokes and the random moments of the game make this flaw seem bearable.

{"product_name":"B00C7103JI","description":"Warner Bros. Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381344 PC Games","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Moments of brilliance and disaster lead to an uneven, frustrating game","reviewText":"It's the coldest Christmas Eve in the history of Gotham City, with residents taking cover from a furious snowfall. Criminal gangs take advantage of the empty streets to settle old scores and pull off robberies and heists, none more virulently than the gang led by Black Mask. Batman, only a couple of years into his crime-fighting double-life, takes up the fight against Black Mask but learns that there are eight deadly assassins on his trail and a chaotic new villain has also emerged, known only as 'The Joker'.Arkham Origins is the third game in the Arkham series of Batman games and acts as a prequel to Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. Like Arkham City, it depicts a large section of Gotham City and allows the player to free-roam through it, either pursuing the main storyline or undertaking optional side-missions. The game is heavily focused on combat, with Batman having to defeat (but not kill, due to his ethos) hundreds of henchman and criminals as well as several major enemies to progress. The game also emphasises Batman's use of gadgets to overcome obstacles, such as using a crypto-graphic sequencer to hack locks and computers or a glue grenade to block up gas vents. Finally, the game allows Batman to use his detective skills by investigating crime scenes and piecing together sequences of events from clues.If you played and enjoyed the previous two Arkham games, Batman Origins offers a lot more of the same. Combat is mostly the same, aside from boss fights which are now more dynamic and feature more epic moments and mid-fight dialogue exchanges to make them more interesting. Investigating crime scenes is now a lot more fun, as Batman has more clues to analyse at each crime scene and as he pieces things together the player can rewind or fast-forwards through events to get a clearer idea of what happened and where more evidence might be found. These two additions to the game help differentiate it from its predecessors, but over the course of the 20+ hour game they're not really enough to overcome the feeling that you've seen it all before.Arguably Arkham Origins's biggest failing is that it is unsuccessful in working as a prequel. Aside from showing the first meeting of Batman and the Joker and Batman and future-Commissioner Gordon, and a cameo by pre-crazy Harley Quinn, not very much play is made of the fact that this story is set earlier than the previous two games at all. It's not even an origin story, with Batman already having been fighting crime for several years. The fact that a lot of the bad guys still think that Batman is a myth means that Black Mask's decision to offer a $50 million reward for Batman's head strains credulity as well.Where the story really falls apart is its lack of coherence. We start off with Black Mask sending eight assassins after Batman, but several of them are defeated so out-of-hand that they're completely unmemorable. The rest simply act as recurring boss fights through the game. Then, like an episode of The Simpsons, the initial set-up is forgotten quite quickly as the threat of the Joker moves to the fore, but even that gets shunted aside in favour of a showdown between Batman and Bane. Given Bane's status as one of Batman's most genuinely threatening foes due to his role in the Knightfall saga, it's a bit disappointing that Bane ends up being overused in the Arkham trilogy to the point of just turning into another disposable boss.There are moments where Arkham Origins flirts with the superior, focused storytelling of the previous two games. A sequence where the Joker realises that he and Batman are two sides of the same coin (during a psychiatric evaluation by Quinn) is extremely well-handled and dips into the Joker's lunacy without going overboard. There's a running tension between Batman and Alfred about why Batman does what he does that occasionally sparks into life, and another between Gordon and his daughter. But every time the narrative threatens to come to life it soon fizzles out in another succession of fistfights and fairly straightforward puzzles.Still, the Arkham trilogy's hallmark has always been the physical, visceral combat and that remains engaging, as do the set-pieces where Batman has to take down a room of heavily-armed enemies through stealth, setting traps and hiding in ventilation shafts. Arkham Origins's length - the game clocks in at slightly more than Arkham City's and more than twice the length of Arkham Asylum - does make this a little repetitive and wearing after a while. The Arkham formula is highly compelling, but Origins does threaten to drag it out past its sell-by date.Where Arkham Origins really suffers is the amount of bugs that still litter the game even after multiple patches. Sometimes doors refuse to open until you reload. Sometimes villains and Batman lose the ability to fight and just wander around each other. Sometimes the ability to interrogate enemies after a fight just vanishes until you reload. Opening a door before you're supposed to can result in Batman falling into a bottomless abyss off the side of a level. Attack warnings sometimes fail to appear, and hitting the counter button at the right time has no effect. Most frustrating, during room-takedown set-pieces, the game will not give you the opportunity to swing to another ledge for several seconds rather than instantly as it should. In isolation some of these bugs can be borne, but combined they make playing the game more frustrating than it really should.Batman: Arkham Origins (***) is the weakest game in the Arkham trilogy, although if you really enjoyed the gameplay of the first two it will suffice. It's certainly entertaining and fun to play, but is littered with more bugs than any modern AAA release should have and the writing is extremely uneven. Recommended, but just beware that what was incredibly fresh in Arkham Asylum has now become a little on the stale side.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2014"}

Marshall \"Geoffrey Marshall\"","summary":"It's a great game, BUT...","reviewText":"I remembered seeing ads for this game on TV, but I'm not the kind of person to buy games at full price when they just come out (unless it's Halo/Grand Theft Auto). However, my cousin was raving about the game to me and how he had just beat it, and so I decided to borrow it from him and see what it was all about.Firstly the good...This IS a very good game. It is addictive, the game play is very well done; the puzzles and fight modes are interesting and challenging, the opponents are varied and don't mess around on higher difficulties. There are a lot of boob shots in certain points in the game, so this should probably cause more of a ruckus than the GTA issues but who knows what goes on in the minds of our nation's moral guardians &lt;rolls eyes>. The lack of camera control takes a while to get used to, and while some of the puzzles may seem frustrating, it is not TOO hard to solve them. I only asked for help once, and was able to figure the rest of them out on my own. Kratos is an interesting character...I can't say I was rooting for him (\"the gods demand a sacrifice\" and you just fry the guy like that???but I was interested in following the story to see what led up to his beginning statements and what would happen afterwards. I had a great time playing this game, i had to draw myself away from the TV when playing it and I felt great when I finally beat it, even if it was on easy.Now the bad.The replay value is not good at all. Once I beat the game, I was at least hoping that if I could start the game over on a higher level, i'd have the Blades of Athena and all the experience I had when I finished the game. Nuh-uh! You start over from scratch, and do the second verse, same as the first. Same puzzles, same story, just harder enemies. That doesn't qualify as good replay to me...If you are a hard core gamer, then play it on Spartan or God mode, even if you are just playing it for the first time. I am not a hard-core person, I was playing it for the story and for fun, so I played it on Easy and beat it within a week. I bet that you would do it even quicker and that wouln't be much fun. Easy mode was much too easy.To me, this game was like a movie. Good story and action, and I would check out the sequel when it comes out. However, I wouldn't pay new price for this game or the sequel, since it's just like a movie. One watch/play, and you don't need to play it again unless you forgot how it went.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2005"}

As mentioned in the title, the first console had the blue light issue right of the box and as you can imagine I was very pissed and disappointed but Amazon did the right thing (best customer service BTW) and sent me a replacement console right away. The second one works like a charm and it grew on me to the point where I felt that changing my review was the right thing to do. I like the redesigned controller a lot better than the PS3 controller but comparing it to the 360/Xbox one doesn't seem fair. For some games I feel the 360/One is a better controller (i.e.: FPS games) while others play a lot better on the PS3/PS4 (fighting games, arcade games). I also feel the design fits the 21st century (who in his right mind thought VCRs are still cool in 2014?) and looks a lot snazzier than the competition's. Launch games are of course a disappointment with only 2 exclusives currently available (Knack, Killzone Shadow Fall) but this doest make the XB One any better either (to be expected though). The software has been revamped (I had an unfortunate game crash while playing Killzone but the console didn't freeze), the interface looks a lot like the XMB but feels faster and more intuitive in some aspects. In others it lacks... It's still not clear to me how to close a game, If one can really be closed. Remote play is something I have yet to test.Graphics are now on par with the modern PC but are not the leap we have experienced with the PS2->PS3 upgrade, the blu ray drive is indeed faster as well as loading times. Overall I believe the PS4 has given the XB One a good beating, numbers speak for themselves.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2013"}

The Thor game absolutely sucked!  The graphics were so Playstation 2, and the game play was shotty and not really all that enjoyable.  I played not even a level of that game and turned it back in.  Thor got jipped on that title.  Sorry Thor!  However, a good friend of mine, whose gaming opinions I hold pretty high, told me that the Captain America game was actually pretty good, so I placed a hold on a copy at the library to try out.  It actually arrived in good time, because I had just finished beating Killlzone 3 when it came in, and so I began playing it right away.  The graphics weren't the best I've seen, but at the same time they weren't half bad...ever so much better than the graphics on Thor, and the gameplay was actually pretty fun...a cool combat system, which was a mixture of some different game combat styles out there, and there was some cool story too it...a predecessor to the movie from what I could tell, and as far as I know, most of the characters seemed to have been covered by the actors that played them in the movie, though I could be wrong, but even those that may not have been, they did a pretty good job covering the voices.  Some of the sound effects were so so, but most of them were pretty good.  The controls were pretty tight too, so I really had no big problem or frustration with those.  There is plenty of content lying around as well for players to try and find.  I did not find all of it, but I hunted around and found a pretty good chunk of it.  All in all, if you're an action/adventure gamer, don't pass up this fun little gem...it's not the most amazing game, but it's still pretty awesome.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Spendsters","summary":"Fun Fun Fun","reviewText":"I played this on the Xbox when it first came out, and have now decided to buy it for my pc and play it again.

LOL cause when you're playing as Riku his cards are different from the GBA version and also It threw me off when it came to that new feature where you have to stack your cards quickly before the timer runs out and you'll be left stunned while the enemy has a free hit on you. But if you play it right the combo comes out amazing! (Riku only)And other positive things I gotta say is that now I KNOW how Larxene, Marluxia, Vexen, Zexion, and Laxeus sound like when they talk other than having to try hard to imagine how they sound like while playing the GBA version. Oh and another thing that Threw me off again was when it's the final battle between Sora and Marluxia it is very surprising how you gotta quickly pick up ALL your cards that he knocks off of you during the fight. Now this is a great challenge for me and I LOVE it. If you're a die hard Kingdom Hearts fan. GET THIS NOW!! Trust me you won't be sorry!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000035Y6N","reviewerName":"Ashley Billings","summary":"Chrono Trigger","reviewText":"As you can see from my title... Yes. It's the best RPG game of all time.This was actually my first RPG game though and before I ever thought about playing the game, to me it looked boring just by watching how it plays and reading its balloon texts. Crono's Luminare is one of the main figure that caught me and dragged me out on playing this game. When I was watching my little brother battling against Lavos, to me the sound effects of the scene activated my \"low action fuel\". It was armageddon; characters unleashing devastating magics (some may look kind of silly) especially the (i forgot what it was called) double-attack with Crono with other characters. The story itself was intriguing and for me who gets bored pretty quick at reading, this made me understood why great stories are written and published.. ..and yes I hated reading even from school =PPointers:Gameplay - the game is easy at first, of course, but once you started progressing and fighting higher level enemies, it gets harder. Urging your characters to level is what keeps you playing this game. The menus and options are easy to adapt and friendly (not like how RPGs nowadays..)Graphics - character designs by Akira Toriyama 'nuff said...Story - the story combine with its gameplay is probably my most memorable RPG game of my once in a lifetime gamer. This is the RPG that made me an RPG gamer today. The story is funny especially the happy accidents where Crono gets framed; Magus turning sides, and meeting different kinds of people during time traveling.This game will add taste to those gamers who aren't into RPG games.I'm pretty sure most hardcore RPG gamers today started on this game too..This game is a must own and if you weren't born on the day this came out, I just don't know how to feel sorry for you.. But don't worry, for those who don't own a Super NES, there's a new version with new additionals such as animation cutscenes for the Playstation version.This is a must own; I would suggest you to buy this game now because this is a game that only exists once in a lifetime.If you want to know if this game has a replay value, I would suggest beating the game first from start to finish and wait till Crono awakes again...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Does Zelda 64 really live up to all that hype?","reviewText":"Back in the late 1990s I wrote two articles for a now defunct game website about \"Ocarina of Time\". One is a review of the title, and the other is the how in many ways Ocarina of Time feels like a remake of the eternal SNES classic (and my personal favorite Zelda game), THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: A LINK TO THE PAST. Rather than leave them unposted, I issued them on Amazon back in 2007, one article on the \"Collector's Edition\" (\"Zelda 64 a Remake?\" and and one on the \"Regular\" edition (an actual review of the game). When the 3DS version came out, I wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content. Originally this review only featured one of the two articles - I am now putting both articles up.Mike London, 9-9-2012-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------This commentary on \"Ocarina of Time\" was written as a gaming article for a retro-gaming site back in May of 1999.  I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it.  Mike London, November 3, 2007Article 1: Does \"Zelda 64\" really live up to all the hype?[Blurb: With all the hype, its hard to be objective about OoT.  Is it the best game in the series, or does it have to settle for second (or, egad, third?) best?  Is it like Star Wars Episode I, all special effects and no substance?  Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history.  In fact, I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet.  There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype, and this product is in an entirely different industry.  Star Wars: Episode I had the same amount of coverage.  Being a big fan of both, of course I've beat the game and have seen the movie.  And they have one thing in common.  They're both eye candy.  But how do they hold up to the rest of the series?  In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie.  But what about OoT you ask?  How can I defame such an instant classic?One reason mainly.  In the original and in The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past, (I can't speak for Zelda II because I haven't beat it yet) the ending was spectacular.  Not the game ending, for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise, but the last dungeon.  Ah, the last dungeon.  Only recently (like December 23, 1999) have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda.  That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer, a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it, save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol' Gannon.  It was truly a great dungeon.  Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version.  What have we here?  A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda!  Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version, including the last dungeon.  Whew, and I thought the original was harder, but no way!Then, in 1993, we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda.  The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd.  But guess what!  No end dungeon!  In terms of dungeons, this is the smallest of the Zelda titles (again, not including Zelda II).  You beat eight dungeons, and then you go and beat the Wind Fish.  Personally, I'm half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game (Dungeon Seven, which I completed half of, went and beat eight, and now I'm back on the last half of VII).  That last dungeon was challenging, granted, but what about that classic end dungeon?  No where to be found here.  Granted, it's a Game Boy game, and it is huge for that consol.  So that offence is not to serious.  And we did get a new dungeon, though not the ending I was hoping for, with the Colour Dungeon on DX, which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour.After five long years, The Legend of Zelda: Orcarina of Time was released for the N64.  So cool!  Link in a 3D adventure.  About time too.  Mario, the cash cow counterpart to Link, got his 3D adventure way back in `96.  Of course, I bought the game.  And of course, I beat it.  It is an excellent game.  Truly it is one of the great classics.  But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past.  The end dungeon absolutely sucked.  That is my only disappointment with that game.  As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple, I was really looking forward to getting into Gannon's tower.  I was expecting a great closer dungeon, just like in Link to the Past.[Spoiler: If you haven't beat the 64 version of Zelda, don't read this]What did we get?  Instead of a great closer dungeon, we got a door way that was blocked by barriers.  What did we have to do?  Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them, then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway.  And what did I get?  A great disappointment.  Sure, this might have been a good way to end a novel or something, but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible.  The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable, but this ending to Zelda 64 was truly despicable.  That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series.[Spoiler Finished]Others say The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game.  I have to disagree.  Don't get me wrong.  It is easily one of my favorite games of the N64.  It's a great game, very innovative (espically that nifty Z Targeting feature) and an epic in its own right.  But for what the system is capable of, The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game.  LTTP is huge.  It fully utilized the SNES technology.  It had a full twelve dungeons, two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy, and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever.  That's one more than the original has.  (LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest.)  After you beat the bad guy twice, you go and fight Ganon.  There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also.  Overall, for the system's capabilites, LTTP is my favorite.But what about The Legend of Zelda: OoT?  My two chief complaints are these:1.  Weak closer dungeon (as I spent a good time detailing up above).2.  Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld.All other Zelda games, including the black sheep of the family (Zelda II), has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld.  But what have we in OoT?  A few measly skeleton dudes at night, and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field.  Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen.  For all the time they put into it, you don't think it would be to hard to correct this problem.Then we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N64 version of Zelda.  Granted, LoZ had two main tracks, one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme.  They could have had more variety, but it was back in the Stone Age.  That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series.  And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT?  The Overworld them from the original LoZ!  I couldn't believe they did that!  Hopefully we'll see it in Zelda Gaiden.  Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too.  Just a thought.Now, after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article, you may think I hate the game.  Quite the opposite, really.  It's a great game, and worthy to be in the Zelda Series.  (Gee, it sounds like I'm defending Zelda II, which I've already done in a separate article).  But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo, and it is totally out of balance.  Great 3D game, but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above.  It's a fun game, and I had a great time beating it.  It provides a lot of enjoyment.  But, just like Star Wars: Episode I, it just can't live up to all that hype?  I wonder if any game (or movie) could actually.[May 9, 1999.  An article originally written for NintendoLand.com.  I've written four released articles and one unreleased article (dealing with SMB 2).  It will have to be edited.  Also, perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article.].....--------------------------------------------------------------------------Article 2:[Originally this was written for a retro-gaming site back in early January, 2000. It has never appeared on Amazon.]Zelda 64 a Remake?[Blurb: Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda has several similarities, almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda 64 is a remake. Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena! Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer!]After playing the course of The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, I've noticed something very intriguing about it. It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game: LoZ: Link to the Past. Why do I say this? I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda 64 and LTTP.Lets examine it. For one, there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP. This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple. Well, this time around, you don't rescue Zelda, but you do go and talk to her. After that, when you get the three pendants, you go and she is kidnaped. This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods. In Zelda 64, you go thru the first part of the quest, getting three spiritual stones. After you get those three spiritual stones (which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d----- Lord Jabu Jabu's belly. I hated that dungeon! =)), you go to the town. Guess what, as Link approaches, there it cuts to a cinema, and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf. Hmm . . . haven't we seen this story before? It turns out that you have to get 5 of the Sage's medallions. Rauru conveniently gives you one, so we can cut the sixth one away. Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf. How intriguing.In the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart, it is seven crystals, and you don't get one given to you. Link wakes no sages this time. Instead, the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons, and Link has to transverse thru 13 dungeons all together, 5 the first part, and eight the second part. They are challenging, fun, and intriguing. Granted, Zelda 64 has some great stuff. But it is not as consistent as LTTP. After you have gone thru the seven dungeons (two more than in Zelda 64), you now have all seven crystals. That's great! Now, go to Death Mountain, and by doing so you will open the way to Ganon's big bad temple.Okay, what do we have in Zelda 64? You go and get the five medallions, plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link. Guess what? Now you have to go to his tower, and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions.* Hmm . . . isn't that what we did in SNES Zelda? Why, I do believe it is, Watson!Another issue yet addressed is the Light World/Dark World. Zelda 64 does the same thing, save this time it is time traveling (I'm not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this . . . that's a whole separate article in itself). In SNES Zelda, you have a little mirror the old man gave you. There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule, transporting back and forth. If you are in the Dark World, you can use the mirror to go into the Light World, making a temporary transporter. Well, in Zelda 64, there is no mirror or transporters (the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth, found nigh in the Shadow Temple). But if you go and put the sword back, then you go back to being young. That creates two versions of the same world to explore. That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP. Not only that, but at the end if the first three stones, Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword. This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place. Hmm . . . isn't that what happened in LTTP? After getting the three pendents, Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword. But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents. Well, that's the same in Zelda 64. He can't get the Ocarina of Time, now can he retrieve the sword, until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones. I swear I've played this game before . . . . ; )The real question is why did Nintendo do this? Well, Miyamoto is a great gamming god, but as far as stories go, his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense. Again, another article, another time. The structural symmetries lying between Zelda 64 and LTTP is quite frightening. Who knows why they chose to do that? Granted, the story line is different, but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same. In review:A Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 641. SNES: First Part, Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda. This is to get the Master Sword. Upon doing so, and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword, Zelda is kidnaped.2. N64: Link, after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree, goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones. Upon doing so, he goes to Hyrule City, but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped. He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place, and the Door of Time is opened, and there the sword is. Retrieving the Sword, goes to the Temple of Sages, or whatever it is called. Is given first Sage Medallion.3. SNES: After winning the three pendents, Link must now go between two versions of the world (Light World/Dark World). Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game.4. N64: In this great stunning adventure, Link must go between two versions of his world. One is when he is young, the other when he is an adult. This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal. Just like in SNES LTTP, Link have to go back and forth to finish the game.When he is an adult, things are noticeable more evil, for Ganon's power has grown.5. SNES: One version (Light World) is good because not corrupted by Ganon. Version II (Dark World), is an evil corrupted version of the Light World.6. N64: One version (Young Link's world) is not corrupted by Ganon's evil. Ganon has just recently showed up. Version II (Adult Link's world), is an evil corrupted version (albeit older) of Young Link's world. The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing, in Zelda 64 it's the time barrier. But for game play, they're the same.7. SNES: He, Link, must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons (sounds logical). With the maidens' power, they will open to door to Ganon's castle.8. N64: Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganon's Tower.9. SNES: The (massive) closer dungeon is a tower.10. N64: The (weak) closer dungeon is a tower.11. SNES: After beating Ganon, you save Zelda, who had been kidnaped. Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock, she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens, each in their respective Crystals.12. N64: Sticking to the standard Nintendo story, after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon, guess what, Link saves Zelda. There's a shocker.13. SNES: There are various mini-games, heart pieces, and extra things to do. This trend is continued in Link's Awakening also.14. Zelda 64: Stuck with the trend of mini-games, four heart pieces to make a heart, and extra things to do.15. SNES: In some of the houses, you can find a picture of Mario on the wall.16. N64: In Zelda 64, after meeting Zelda, look out the window, and you can find some pictures of Mario, Luigi, Bowser, and the Princess. Yoshi also comes up. Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also. Just goes to show, Nintendo likes cameos.As you can see for yourself, the various structural symmetries between Zelda 64 and SNES Zelda is quit a few. If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N64 that's what he should have done, I suppose. This, as far as story goes, is pretty much an update with little changed. Its like they took the game's basic plot, changed the circumstances and added where appropriate, but allowing the basic structure to stand. And, although both are great games, sadly, SNES is better, consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex. But I love Ocarina of Time all the same. This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company, not a writing company.*In all previous Zelda games, the end dungeon was in the mountains. This is the first game in the series to break that trend. The first three (Zelda I, II, and LTTP) their dungeon was in Death Mountain. Link's Awakening, Link's only Game Boy adventure (currently) is in Tal Tal Mountains. At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2007"}

But this installment was hit so far out of the ballpark that I truly cannot get into this game. Aside from the ridiculous, Duke Nukem monster-esque, alien overlord that I have to fight; this is what really irks me:I don't like how our country is being represented. I don't like seeing the American eagle with a machine gun in one talon and a rocket launcher in the other; not to mention the bullets up above.I don't like how the past is mocked for being too \"artificial/fake/oppressed\" yet Generation Y and the Millennium Generation fail to see how far things have spun out of control today.I don't like sitting in my recliner stealth killing terrorists in a game when I know that I have family and friends who have risked their lives to confront the very same and very real threat.I don't like a joke being told in the game that the Pledge of Allegiance should be changed from \"One nation under God\" to \"One nation under me.\"I don't like the fact that one of the testing dialogue lines for the female president is a PC rant about \"Gender equality\" yet at the same time I have the option to increase her bust size to porn star status.I don't like the \"president\" punching someone in the face or kicking them in the nuts because that person does not agree with their ideology.I don't like having the option of only being able to \"cure cancer forever\" or \"no one goes hungry.\"-- yet at the same time I can have a huge playhouse \"crib\" edition of the White House complete with strippers, pole dancers and exotic pets.I don't like the concept of gang lords being passed off as \"anti-heroes\" or thug rappers being depicted as presidential advisors who rule a pseudo-America that would be indifferent enough to pass off evil as good and vice versa.I don't like nor have I ever liked propaganda in a game or any other form of entertainment. This is a FREE country. I just want to play a game, watch a show, listen to music AKA be entertained. I never asked for your constant insinuation that my way of thinking is wrong and yours is right. You won't change my mind anymore than I will change yours;so as The Beatles said.... \"Let It Be.\"To the game developers; two important lessons should be learned from making SR4.Number one: keep the gameplay/storyline in synch with the genre. I would have much rather seen Kinzey ,Shaundi, Pierce, Oleg and the rest in bigger, multiple cities taking over more gang territory as opposed to being trapped in a virtual city (Superman 64??) in the midst of an intergalactic war.Number two: ease up on the ideologies being installed. If you are truly as open-minded as you claim to be, then you can accept the fact that not everyone is going to agree with everything you do-- you would also be able to refrain from demonizing and vilifying such persons.Now that I've had my fill of the Saints, I'm going to go play (and truly enjoy) Diablo 3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00BRQN2H4","description":"","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"A halfhearted effort that still trumps most other titles","reviewText":"Let's get the bad out of the way first. Yes, Saints Row 4 reuses the maps, character models, art assets, vehicles, weapons, and progression system from 3. It was built from an unfinished expansion while Volition hung in a hoary nightmare limbo between the folding of THQ and their purchase by Deep Silver. As such, SR4 seems rather stale, as though it doesn't bring much freshness to the table in terms of gameplay.But under all that samey rust, there's some gleaming steel of awesome.The plot sees The Boss, now president of the United States, trapped in an alien virtual reality prison. Escaping, you must return to the prison to wreck havoc, which allows Kinsey (your hacker friend from the first game) to slowly undermine the alien regime. Periodically you must also venture aboard the alien ship in the &#34;real&#34; world, missions which have a less cartoony, more cautious feel. Within the simulation you develop an arsenal of superpowers, complete a variety of familiar minigames to achieve territory control, and generally just mess stuff up.Missions in the simulator are frankly rather lackluster. Most optional missions are just strings of minigames you would play anyway (I could turn half of them in upon getting them) and the campaign missions are all pretty easy. But studded into this are gems, such as the inside of an accomplice's head rendered as a 16-bit fighting game (which itself could carry a full length title) or a spaceship escape set to Haddaway's What is Love? The problem is that these slivers of awesome are mostly stacked toward the game's end, and you have to wade through a few hours of Saints-Row-3-Over-Again to see them. There are other oddities- vehicles become useless fairly quickly due to your powers, and the new guns (Dubstep gun!) so hugely outclass the regular pistols and shotguns you'll never use your whole arsenal. A number of environments that were interactive in SR3 are just left in and sit around being eerily empty as well.For me, the good and fresh outweighed the bad and stale (especially a fantastic 80s cartoon reference at the end that I won't spoil) but I can't in good conscience say that will be true for everyone. Part of what made Saints Row 3 so awesome was that it was all new and all that craziness came as a surprise; here most of it won't.

{"product_name":"B002I0KP4G","description":"","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"Campaign improvements","reviewText":"The campaign is noticeably better than Wings of Liberty. The graphics are nicely improved and the characters are more satisfying. Wings of Liberty seemed to suffer through an unusually protracted development, but this one seemed to have gone well.Overall, the whole RPG thing they promised in this game ehhh kinda holds true. It's not that different from Wings of Liberty's upgrade system. Kerrigan does get more powerful, RPG style, as the game progresses, but she never really feels too overpowered and if you're not careful she can still die. When she dies she goes on like a timer countdown to respawn. I've had the enemy destroy my base in that time.The characters are better. I feel like the characters are more interesting this time around, because the writers get to have more of an RPG moment where they...get into character of something completely foreign. It's more fun this way. Wings of Liberty's characters at times felt like Nickelback.It's really not that hard. I for the most part did the same strategy on all of the maps, which was swarm with zerglings. And I played on brutal. You will see echoes of like previous Starcraft campaigns. Like, there's a \"defend the chyrsalis\" mission, there's a \"hold out for 15 minutes mission\" (just like in the original starcraft), and there's even like a super-friends teamup on the very last, just like in the original game.There are some diablo moments and thankfully not too many annoying corridor-crawling. There's also a starship sequence which is kinda like a popular mod on SC2.There are several changes to the MP game which I haven't at this time tested out completely. I will say that the biggest change to me is the inclusion of a \"select all\" button. This changes a lot. with one hit of F2 I can select all military units. This makes playing with the zerg much more effective for me, because one of my biggest problems playing them was actually selecting the entire swarm.My biggest complaint with SC2 had been that there was too much time spent on unnecessary clicking and not enough on battle tactics. Well, with F2 select all, at least one of my strategies is viable again, the strategy of macro economic superiority with the zerg. I still do feel though that this game, at least how I play it, is really about macro-economic superiority overall, and macro-economics is about...clicking.Anyways, the campaign is better than WOL overall. Better characters, better story, better graphics. Mission variety...eh, not quite as good, actually, but in WOL I did pretty much the same thing as much as I could in all of those missions also.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00FM5IY0Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Bart Motes","summary":"Fun zombie stomper with some frustrating aspects","reviewText":"First off, let's acknowledge that this is a Capcom game about surviving a zombie outbreak. This is not Mass Effect or even Dead Space, and if you came here in search of transcendent meaning or to be touched to your very soul, you and Commander Shepard will be very disappointed.What Dead Rising 3 does offer is a fun gonzo take on smashing zombies with a huge assortment of weapons and vehicles, many of which you can construct yourself after you find either semi-random or plot triggered blueprints. The weapon and vehicle construction is fun stuff, though the game's decay mechanic means that you can never enjoy any weapon for too long, by design.As I alluded to above, the dialogue and plot would embarrass the writers of a children's cartoon and the zombie stomping can get tedious after a while. But my biggest complaints about the game are (1) the inventory system, and (2) the annoyance of trying to find important items on the ground while being attacked by scores of zombies.The inventory system annoys the @$%@ out of me. You start with four slots and can upgrade later by a couple. Four would really be fine for weapons (even though they decay and you can quickly run out of weapons, there are almost always a bunch lying around), but that number includes healing supplies and anything you want to craft. So if you see two things you want to craft you must pick both up, possibly dropping other items, then craft them, then hopefully remember to pick up your dropped item. Would a backpack be too much to ask for? Probably. Again, this is a zombie smashing button smasher and it shouldn't have to make apologies for it. (Later in the game, there are \"safe zones\" where all items you've discovered appear in lockers, making dilemmas over keeping items irrelevant.)My other complaint is that the game aspires to have interesting side quests and points of interests like the Batman Arkham series, but the objects you are supposed to be collecting or the \"scenes\" that you are supposed to investigate are not always clear. I've died many times in this game after receiving a helpful alert that a \"tragic ending\" is nearby that I should investigate. But, even if I can find it, the mechanism for interacting is to pick up an object. This can be difficult when you are being swarmed by an endless horde of zombies. Modest suggestion to Capcom: code it so the events trigger when you run over them.It would also be nice if you could clear areas of zombies for a little while. There's one scene on a bridge where you get access to a ton of weapons--not unlimited but maybe 20-30 assault rifles and shotguns. I cleared every zombie from that bridge. But within minutes there were practically as many as before. It would be nice to get both the temporary sense of accomplishment of clearing an area and the perfect zombie apocalypse terror of realizing that you'll never be able to keep them down for long. (The game does provide some \"safe zones\" where you can hide out relatively unmolested.)There's also no sense, like you get in Dead Space, of having to conserve bullets or save a good weapon for an emergency. Weapons are too plentiful and its too big of a pain to try to manage inventory to worry about saving a primo weapon.On a technical level, the game is extremely pretty, but not mind-blowing. Load times are indeed incredibly long when the game first loads and then non-existent. What astounds me is how long the game takes to quit. It's a good thirty seconds after you tell it to quit game. What on earth is going on there? The menus are good, the inventory is frustrating, and the leveling system is motivational. Bosses are really not that bad, except that you have to train yourself to run around looking for supplies while fighting them, which seems odd at first. Deus Ex: Human Revolution used the same dynamic and it always seemed odd to me--ah, what a careless villain to leave the objects of his destruction lying about! But whether you love them or hate them, the boss fights are few and far between.All of that said, this game falls squarely into the mindless fun category and, the category of games that make me ask: if I was fourteen, would I enjoy this game? The answer: heck yes!If you enjoy whacking zombies, this is your fast paced nightmare zombie game. If you cringe with bad plots and dialogue or like your games to be a bit slower and thoughtful, you probably won't like it.(I hope you found my review helpful and won't down vote it simply because you either unconditionally love or unconditionally hate the game. I've tried to provide an honest take of the pros and cons of this enjoyable, yet simple game.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2013"}

Controlls are no longer clunky and unresponsive, no glitches, graphics and frame rate are excellent along with the sound. I fully enjoy this game as an old school gamer and my 5yr old son loves it as well. Good daddy / son bonding time as well! :) This game can be a little challenging at times, so i help my boy get through those parts, but mostly he has picked it up and completes all the levels by himself. Definitely 5 stars for fun factor, the only reason i took away a star for overall rating is because sometimes after beating a level, you try to move to the next, but it says there has been something unacomplished in the previous level you thought was completed. It doesnt give much of a hint of what you missed as i have went through that same level 5 times and somehow keep missing whatever it is im supposed to find. But, even playing those levels over and over is still fun, as there is so much to do and explore so it doesnt get repetitive.

{"product_name":"B000U34SZA","description":"","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"I'm really liking this portable party!","reviewText":"Nintendo's take on the classic board games with the Mario and co. characters has been around since the days of the N-64, with games in the series also being released for the Gamecube (4-7), the GBA (Mario Party Advance), the Wii (8) and the Nintendo DS. This one is simply and appropriately called Mario Party DS, it's not a full Mario party game like the home consoles ones but it's a portable one and a very complete shorter version of the Mario Party games. I've been a fan of the MP games since the very first one was released back in 1998 and have played every one of them except the GameBoy Advance title, so I'm kind of a hardcore fan. Mario Party DS makes great use of the Nintendo DS' capacities; the stylus and the mic make for very fun games and ads a little different something which I quite like to the Mario Party franchise. That's a plus in my book.The storyline goes like this: there are five crystal stars falling from the sky and Mario catches one. Mario then shows it to his friends, afterward Bowser sends an invitation for a party to everyone because he feels that he's been awful towards them. It's a catch and Bowser steals the star and shrinks our friends of the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario and his friends must find all of the four remaining crystal stars...by playing all the board maps!  There are 8 characters that you can play as which is reasonable for a portable version (and twice as much as the GBA version that only had Mario, Luigi, Peach and Yoshi), they are: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy, Toad, Yoshi, Wario & Waluigi. You still can't play as DK but that was to be expected, the ones offered are enough for me and I don't really miss any other of the past characters you could play as. Of course you can also select the difficulty for the opponents, from easy, normal and hard.There are 5 modes to be played: Story Mode, Party Mode, Mini-game Mode, Puzzle Mode and Multiplayer, plus you can visit the galleries to view collection, records and more. The story mode is nothing really special because you basically play the four board games available and then you unlock one, however it works and that's all that counts really. I found it great that there are boss battles at the end of each board; it made the game that much more fun and it added something different to the party. Party Mode allows you to play the five boards, Mini-game mode lets you play the mini-games you've earned, puzzle mode is puzzles, and multiplayer let's you play with up to four friends  using one single card (which is a great feature and it's nice to play with someone else). Multiplayer mode even has two extra games when two players are playing.What's especially great is that the best aspect of each Mario Party, the mini-games, there are plenty of them. 74 to be more precise, and this means that there are about as many here than on any other MP game which is excellent being that this game is a portable one. The best part is that the mini-games are actually really fun. My favorites must be the ones where you blow into the mic to stop a bomb from exploding and such, the games that use the stylus are fun ones but there aren't a whole lot of them (mostly puzzle games). There are others that use the D-Pad and the A & B buttons and some use the Left and Right buttons on top of the DS, nothing complicated and the games usually aren't too hard (except the ones that require more luck than skills). The only bad aspect of the game is how the CPU controlled character can get incredibly lucky all of a sudden. They will buy a star which is a huge part of winning in MP (along with coins)  and the next star will luckily get moved a few spaces from them and they will get this one also (it happened three times in a row once) in a SINGLE TURN! Luck is a huge factor of Mario Party and in this game more than ever! That aside, it's an excellent game and there isn't much negative that can be said of it.To be honest I didn't expect a whole lot out of Mario Party DS and to some it will be boring but to me it was a nice surprise. Keep in mind that this is a portable version and that it doesn't have as good graphics as some of the home console ones and that the boards are not as big, if you buy with this in mind I'm sure you will enjoy the game. Don't let the fact that this is a portable game prevent you from buying it, it's a fun party. I'd recommend to borrow it from a friend if possible but if you're a fan of the Mario Party games or maybe even board games in general then this one is well worth it. I give this party a solid 4.5/5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2011"}

The typing feel is decent, and soft. The major issue I have with the keyboard is its backlighting. With a Macintosh backlit keyboard all of the keys are silver with the letters being in a negative color (black). When the backlight is not on on my mac, I can see all of the keys perfectly. On the Logitech G110 with the backlight off, the keys are not as easy to see. Its not that big of an issue I just mention it because those people that still may need to look at a keyboard to type may find it a bit difficult. Ok on to the gaming.Gaming:I played WOW about 30 hours using this keyboard. It is pretty comfortable and easy to set up to do some macros. I dont use WASD to drive, instead I use the arrow keys. The control was sharp and very accurate. I dont play much FPS so I am not sure how it would perform there. For raiding in an MMO I cannot think of a better accessory than a keyboard that you can setup macros. It brings your gaming to another level really.Ergonomics:The keys are pretty quiet and soft to type on. Which I prefer.  The angle of the keys are pretty much generically placed. There is nothing too innovative with regards to ergonomics other than the keys being soft to use, which can help lessen repetitive motion injuries.Customizability:You can change the backlighting to other colors but red is the best to see at night with (and daytime).Pros:>> Old school volume control which I thoroughly enjoy>> Soft keystrokes>> Adjustable colors to fit your rig better>> MacrosCons:&lt;&lt; Colors other than red are tough to see&lt;&lt; Nothing drastically innovative - its really a basic keyboard with some cool addons.Summary:Overall this keyboard is a fine addition to a gaming setup.Thank you for reading my review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2010"}

But it's also pretty darn good.  The cell shading graphics are simply amazing, and the gameplay is consistent, fun, and easy to begin with.  It's a little platform game that combines elements of stealth and action.  Sort of like Metal Gear Solid 2, but actually fun.This game is a short game.  It means that maybe they could have added another element, but it also means that there isn't needless repetition in any of the levels, except for the last boss.You are this raccoon from a long line of thieving relatives.  You're mission is to find all parts of the secret family thieving book, all while running away from a female cop who  is constantly on your tail (I'll let you decipher the meaning of that sentence yourself).The thing that strikes me most is the presentation of the characters.  While the background consists of 3-D objects, the characters are smooth, cartoon like, cell-shaded animals.  It's a nice change.  It's especially pleasing since the new, unreleased Zelda is going to use this type of \"revolutionary\" technology.The game itself is straightforward.  You have to jump, attack, and sneak your way through levels to eventually reach a boss.  Then once you realize how to defeat the boss, it's on to the next level.  Nothing original at all, but then again, it didn't claim to be.

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Mr Mister \"Mr mister\"","summary":"A game that MIGHT be worth it","reviewText":"For the most part, I am not a big fan of paying full price for Wii games since i find that most Wii games are.... a bit on the sad side.This is probably one of the few games I would put in the GOOD category for Wii Games.Of course this game is another rail shooter for the wii, but this one is intriguing and often creepy, scary... Basically its like riding a roller coaster and you point your gun at things you want to die. Which is more fun then it sound.StoryThe story line is VERY captivating (I actually purchased dead space after playing this game), and this game is a prequel to Dead space. The very beginning really grabs your attention because you literally thrown into insanity. Then the game basically turns into an alien horror film, and your objective is NOT to die.ControlsThe controls on this game are fairly simple. You see thing you want, point on them....You see you dont like, point at them.Then you basically have other lil quirks that you forget you have, and are told to use. One thing is the secondary function which requires you to twist your wrist... seems like a button would of did better.Another lil thing that annoys me is, to pick up things, you toss this glowing white ball which is awfully annoying to look at and sometimes takes up a huge part of the screen.GameplayThe game is awesome, although its a rail shooter, you often times have options/choices to pick from. When youre at a cross-road you can pick left or right, when you find a gun you determine which one you want. There are often points in the game where you decide the direction of gameplay (not sure how that affects story yet, makes for another play thru)Did I mention they curse in this game? That is mainly a side note, but this game is packed with extra features. The comic is probably my favorite part and they do a LOT of cursing in that.ConclusionIf you were to buy any Wii Game, there are few justifiable buys.Mario Kart, Smash bros, Twilight Princess (for multiple reasons), Metroid, Mario Galaxy... (the list goes on, but it is a short list).I would argue this game is a justifiable buy","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2009"}

InYear of the Dragon, Spyro still has all of hissignature moves--as well as the special moves he learned inSpyro theDragon 2--and can control such vehicles as tanks, submarines, andspeedboats. There are over 30 levels in which to recover 150 eggs andseveral minigames that complement the standard gameplay, includingboxing and skateboarding.","reviewerName":"JoeAZ92","summary":"Great gameplay variety and tons of collectibles make up for some pretty dull levels later on","reviewText":"Positive:+ gameplay is still solid+ controls are still excellent+ tons of eggs to collect+ speedway levels are great fun+ extra characters are a smart additionNegative:- wait... haven't I seen some of those positives before?- some graphical issues are less forgivable the second time around- the levels get a little boring after the first areaSpyro the Dragon was one of the defining characters of his genre back in the day. He had three great games: a great start, an even stronger sequel, and now the third one: Year of the Dragon. Does it live up to the expectations generated by its predecessors or does it fail to live up to the other two?When an evil Sorceress from another world sends in a bunch of goons to kidnap the eggs in the world of the dragons, you know who to send back to retrieve them. Hunter the cheetah! ...Oh, and Spyro of course! Basically you go on a journey to get back the eggs through four big worlds each with a lot of levels, and each of which has a lot of stuff to do for completionists.The core gameplay of YOTD is pretty much exactly the same as it was back in Ripto's Rage: you charge, you glide, you breath fire, and you get power ups through gates every once in a while. Thankfully all the abilities you learned in the previous game are available to you right off the bat. The downside to this is that you don't learn any new abilities as the game goes on, which makes the Spyro gameplay hardly vary at all.Fortunately, there are four other characters that come into play every once in a while to change things up a bit. Sheila the Kangaroo can jump really high and kick enemies to kingdom come, Sgt. Byrd can fly and shoot the crud out of baddies with his shoulder cannons, Bentley the Yeti can smash guys with his giant club (my personal favorite), and Agent 9's levels are kind of like third-person shooters. These guys each have their own level and also have a few areas throughout the game within other levels in which you can get eggs. All the characters are really fun to play as and offer some great diversity.The game has four huge home worlds, each of which has many levels. The first world is home to a handful of great, fun levels, and then you go to the second world and find that you're suddenly not having as much fun. Could it be that the levels are just... not so great? I can't put my finger on it, but there's something about the later levels that I just don't like. Maybe it's the slight lack of creativity, I don't know.Although many of the regular levels aren't much fun, there are four speedway levels in the game as well, and these are surprisingly entertaining. They each have a time attack mode where you have to fly through rings, torch cows, and the like within a time limit, but there is also a race on each of these levels as well as a Hunter challenge, usually involving you playing as the cheetah flying around in a plane shooting down sheep in flying saucers. Good times...Collecting eggs is the main goal of the game, but there are many ways that you get them. Of course there are some lying around on the ground every once in a while but there are also times when you have to do certain tasks to get them or play a minigame kind of thing. There are also a ton of gems, but these are more annoying to collect as they are all over the place and if you want them all you'll have to do a lot of backtracking. Still, the combination of eggs and gems makes for a great game to try to complete.The visuals of YOTD are exactly the same as they were in Ripto's Rage. Nothing has changed. Yes, Spyro's eyebrows still detach from his head every once in a while. Yes, everything still looks a little polygonal. They weren't so bad the first time, but when there is zero improvement in a game that came out a year later, polygonal and occasionally glitched graphics are a bit less forgivable. Not to say they look horrible for the time, but I definitely would have liked to see some kind of improvement in this area.The sound effects are no different than they were back in Ripto's Rage, but there wasn't really anything that needed changing. There are still nice, sometimes silly effects that fit well with the game. The music is great as usual and is, like the sound effects, fitting to the environments. Some of the tracks are reused a few times but it's really not a big deal.Overall, Spyro: Year of the Dragon is still a great game. It may be exactly the same as its predecessor except for a few fun variations in the gameplay, but that's not to say it's a bad game by any means. The Spyro formula had already proven itself twice, so why change it for the last game of the generation? Still, a few new abilities and graphical improvements would have been welcome and the levels could have been much more enjoyable. Despite these few flaws, though, YOTD is great for anyone who liked the other two games or someone looking for a game simply made to be completed, and I would also recommend it to just about anyone who likes 3-D platformers.Gameplay: 9Grahpics: 7Sound: 8Value: 9FINAL SCORE: 8.4/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}

K \"Esco\"","summary":"Great Frustrations Tarnish This Otherwise Perfect Title","reviewText":"I played through this game just once, and while I LOVED it, I don't know how long it will be until I do it again...for the first time since RE1, it won't be for a while.That really upsets me, for this game is AMAZING!!  The graphics are very good, the voice acting is great, the story is incredible, it's longer and IMO scarier than its predecessors, Chris Redfeild is cool--way unlike in RE1, the soundtrack is brilliantly composed, and THE PUZZLES ARE INHUMANLY WELL THOUGHT OUT!!  I know, if you've read any of my countless reviews before, you know I'm not one for capitalizing things; it's just that this game is, besides the difficulties (which I will mention later), is quite possibly the greatest game ever made.Before I go more into depth with the good aspects, I just want to explain why only a four star rating.  As I stated several times before, it's the difficulties.  I have almost never played a game as frustrating as this game is.  Bullets are very scarce, and so are health revivers.  Some of the puzzles require an hour or two of thinking, as some of them are just so advanced that they are mind boggling.  The bosses are much harder...or, at least more resource consuming; same with the hunters and the spiders, even the zombies too, require much more to kill, and do greater damage.  This game keeps a number of times you die in the memory banks, and I died I think it was 27 times.  I commonly ran out of ammo during the last boss, and I dreaded the idea of restarting over because of it.  This game isn't really fun, it's just incredibly well thought out and entertaining.However, I will state that the music, plot and puzzle setup (which COMPLETELY obsoletes that of RE1) easily alone justify a four star rating.  This is obviously the most nicely Hollywood-ish entry to the already very Hollywood-ish series.  The story digs deep into that of the birth of Umbrella, as it also prepells you further into the future.  You start off as Claire on an island that belonged to Umbrella...until it was mysteriously attacked and the T-Virus is unleashed.  On the island she meets fellow inmate survivor Steve, a real pest with a high pitched voice.  Steve, while a rather ratty and simple character, does grow on you very effectively, and twice he generates very emotional scenes: one right after you first play him, and the second is at the end.  Both of those scenes were very well acted, directed, and the music for both scenes is superb to say the least.Later, Chris is told by Leon where Claire is; while he always manages to stay a step behind her, he eventually finds her, and escape...only to return again in some other sequel later.  Chris, however, is being stalked by Wesker, who survived RE1, and is mad as hell.  As to why he is mad at Chris, I have no idea.  The other villains though, the Ashford's, are much sicker than Wesker, Birkin, even Vincent from RE:Survivor.  They play the McCoy-Hatfeild scenario with the Redfeilds in what I believe to be one of the ultimate tales of good vs. evil ever told.  One of the greatest moments in gaming history is typing in the final self-destruction code: Veronica.This game is unforgettable, as it is both a great game and a fantastic adventure.  True, sometimes you will get too scared, or VERY frustrated, but those are the only letdowns.  Trust me, as you could see with my insanely long review that this game is a keeper.  GET THIS GAME!

Left4Dead is through and through a MULTI PLAYER cop-op masterpiece. How long does it take to get a match on line? A mere seconds, with dedicated servers , you'll be hard-pressed to not find a match within seconds not minutes. Having said that this is by far the best zombie game I've ever played , yeah I said it zombies , I don't care zombie purists will say they're not zombies, well OK 'Infected' , I'll give you that. Aside from that the only downside to L4D is there's only 4 campaigns with 5 maps each , it gets a little repetitive seeing the same environment , but behold there's DLC just around the corner opening up 2 more campaigns for VS. and a new mode called survivor. Anybody worth their multi player weight in gold MUST get this game, it is by far a fantastic achievement in co-op goodness. The game really forces you to work as a team , I always get giddy when I see a nube join and watch them run ahead like Masterchief thinking \"I can take these zombies\" Only to see them get nailed by a smoker or hunter a mere 20 feet from the safe house. That NUBE just learned one of the most valuable lessons in L4D  \"Stay Together\".L4D really benefits teams who use real world swat tactics ' move and shoot, where you enter rooms one after another covering flanks. Its quite an intoxicating experience and one that NO gamer should miss. Teams that run around and jump like mad-max on crank , won't last long , L4D punishes solo artists but rewards team players. Again \"stay together\"The graphics aren't gonna win any awards , but the game play by far will soften any hard feelings you have to wards the graphics. The graphics work well to support the mood and it does fit the zombie movie genre. You can tweak the film grain to make it look better too. The overall package is fantastic, besides what's a pretty game worth if it doesn't have great gameplay? L4D certainly has gameplay even if the graphics aren't of stellar proportions.

Not a great comparison since both games are different , but I used the comparison because I think L4D is equally revolutionary as COD4 was and even more so becaue of  the AI director , which by developers interviews is only in its infancy stages of development. The AI director really works well , by throwing a different experience at you every time you run through the same map. More than a random enemy generator it throws enemies at you procedurally not random, and its a formula that is unmatched in just about any game this gen.  Sample this game for yourself , you can get it on avg. for $40 these days . Well Worth every penny and your gonna need extra pennies for the DLC content due out in Spring. L4D is awesome","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SY77E","description":"","reviewerName":"Marcus Fenix","summary":"Superb strategic FPS","reviewText":"Graphics are the best ever for the current generation, top notch. Gameplay is very fluid, and it is not a shoot, hide and kill. You really need to use the nanosuit abilities wisely to survive. AI is very intelligent, if you hide they can find you, no safe place, enemies come from everywhere (above, down, sides, behind). Ability to hack weapons and devices to make them work against your enemies is unique and cool. Ammunition is well balanced, but you must conserve it. Weapons are awesome, especially the hunting bow (Wow), it is so satisfying nailing down any enemy with the explosive ones, and see it explode in pieces :) Alien weapons (Cell) are incredible. Single player story is EPIC!!. The bosses especially the final boss showdown is EPIC and tough. This game is NOT easy to go from start to end like other FPS, but it is very rewarding. You will die a lot, but all is strategic, use your abilities and weapons to find a way to survive.  Games should be done like that. It is all action pack, you do not have a lot of resting places. At many times running is the only way to escape from certain situations. There are multiple vehicles (ground and air), makes the experience even better. Maps are really big (Single player). It is simply epic. Game might not be too long (6 to 10 hours) as other FPS, but it is more enjoyable and challenging than others. This game will really challenge you even in Normal mode.Overall is an awesome game. I really recommend it, if you like first person shooters. For me is an improvement over Crysis 2.Thanks","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"impitbosshereonlevel2 \"impitbosshereonlevel2\"","summary":"Plea to stop crackheads from writing reviews","reviewText":"First, the aiming system has been changed to select most dangerous targets first, and not the closest ones. I don't know about you, but IMO this resembles real-life more closely than just targeting whoever is the closest to you.Second, yes, the rampages are simpler, but the missions more than make up for the simplicity of those. Plus, only the auto-aiming rampages are easier - using rifles is still difficult, and aiming a rifle in Vice City is actually harder than aiming one in GTA3. I'd say the two balance each other out.Third, if you don't understand the concept of a \"theme\", please don't remark on things like fonts. Fonts are fine, and serve the theme perfectly.Fourth, map is probably difficult to read if you're dyslexic, but that's hardly the fault of the game.Fifth, there is a concept of \"memory\" and gta makes great use of it by not loading everything; instead, it loads things as it needs them. Ergo, loading screens when you go in and out of hideouts and other interior locations, like buildings. It's either that or no interiors. And I can just imagine how many people would have been whining if there were no interiors in the game. Be a man - loading time is barely two seconds.Now, let's discuss the delicious additions:1. At least four new motorbikes, each with fairly accurate physics and ridiculously fun control. The game could have consisted of only riding a dirtbike in the city and would have already deserved at least 4 stars.2. Helicopters, that don't take a surgeon's accuracy to fly.3. Diverse, vast interiors. Yes, those have loading times, but they're less than two seconds long4. City at least twice the size of Liberty City5. Soundtrack that makes the GTA3 soundtrack pale in comparison (as excellent as the GTA3 soundtrack was)6. Throng of new weapons. You haven't seen a game until you've held a chainsaw in your hands7. Missions much more diverse than the GTA3 missions8. Guest voices (Miss Cleo's character is hilarious)9. Aiming that resembles real life much better10. Significantly more realistic citizens that gather in groups, talk to each other, etc...11. Cops that don't just chase YOU12. Continuing in the excellent tradition of GTA3, with subtle crude humor, such as calling the dirtbike \"Sanchez\"13. Tire damage. This may seem like a small thing until you're running away from the cops14. Melee weapons can now damage carsFinally, Rockstar never wanted you (as in, the gamer) to get the idea that this was GTA4. They've openly admitted that this was more like GTA3.5, as most of the stuff the game uses is from GTA3. In my opinion, they've FAR exceeded that goal. I love GTA3, but Vice City just makes it pale in comparison.P.S. You didn't get Godfather III - you got Scarface instead, and Scarface eats the Godfather series for breakfast.P.P.S.

{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"THE game","reviewText":"Without a doubt this is the best single player games ever made..... ever. In short, if you own a PS2 then you own GTA: Vice City.What makes Vice City so good is the fact that everything in terms of content is exaggerated a tiny bit which gives this game the edge that no other has. Basically the game design is simple but highly complex. It is very hard to describe this game. Imagine you are a games designer. You make a map of city. You built it up with bridges, shopping malls, airports, garages, parks and anything else that you find in most places. Then you add a variety of people walking around the place with Artificial Intelligence so that they bump into each other, start fights, get into cars and drive, steal cars, wait at bus stops or run away from a cop and get knocked down in the process. On top of this you add gun shops, hundreds of cool vehicles, helicopters, boats, motorbikes and cool ramps on the road so that you can perform stunts like launching a Harley Davidson over the local river. Then you create a character that can earn money, buy things and raise all sorts of hell like crashing helicopters into buildings, driving over pedestrians, stealing an ambulance, drive cop cars, fight SWAT as they discharge themselves from the overhead helicopter, use a bazooka to blow up traffic........ OKAY LETS JUST GET IT OVER AND SAY IT........ IN THIS GAME YOU CAN DO ALMOST ANYTHING YOU WANT!...And if you do not want to just walk the streets or raise hell then you can actually play the story about Sonny Forelli, a small time gangster who must go on various missions so that he can get rich, buy lots of mansions, kill the bad guys, own really fast cars and get the girl in the end. And when you have done that there are extra missions everywhere that can you play.There is NOTHING like Vice City. This IS the GAME of GAMES. Vice City is directly responsible for marriage breakups, flunking university, not eating, not sleeping and ignoring the rest of the world for the next six months. Be prepared to loose your job, shun your neighbor and let the dog starve. It is advised that you go get an IV drip if you buy this game. Vice City is an experience that has to played to understand how awesome it is.Simply a hyper-jump in Evolution.*** As a note parents should not be complaining.

{"product_name":"B00D96BNGM","description":"","reviewerName":"D. R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"What's That? I Can't Hear You - Because I'm Never Taking These Off!","reviewText":"I've been using Turtle Beach headsets for years now and these CoD: Ghosts Phantoms are replacing my comparable Ear Force Deltas that came out with MW3 a few years back.  I really liked the Deltas for a number of reasons (primarily sound quality and durability/build quality), but they did suffer from random bouts of interference/dropouts.  The Phantom maintains the same sound quality while completely erasing all dropout issues.  They also added just a bit more comfort for wearing them long periods of time, which is good because a headset this great will be worn quite a bit.Setup was simple, particularly since I was swapping out essentially an earlier version of the same transmitter/headset.  I ran only two wires to the transmitter:  power (via USB on the console) and the optical audio out of my Xbox 360.  The hardest part of setting them up is deciphering the directions, which show you a million possible ways that you might have to connect your headset to your gaming setup, but in all likelihood won't - if you own a top-tier headset, you're probably not connecting your console directly to your TV via standard-def RCA cables, right?  Keep it simple in your head and you'll have the Phantoms set up in no time.  The package comes with all required cables.Soundwise, the Phantoms deliver clear surround definition with deep bass and crisp treble.  Music, sound effects, dialog - it all sounds great on this headset.  The addition of dual-band WiFi seems to have made a world of improvement for me.  The Phantoms have been performing flawlessly for over a month now, something no other wireless headset has ever been able to do in my house.Battery life is as advertised - I get about 12 - 15 hours of uninterrupted use.  The rechargeable batteries included in the Phantom take about six hours to fully recharge but the good news is that they continue to function during charging.  This is good news because (as is the case with any rechargeable), there's very little warning between the &#34;battery low&#34; prompt in your ear and the headset completely shutting down.  No more popping open the battery compartment and spinning the alkalines to get a few more minutes!  The kit includes an extra long USB cable that should reach just about anyone's console.  I've also charged it with the cable via a laptop as well. I'm concerned about the potential life of the battery - I can't find anything in the documentation or online about whether or not it's possible to replace it down the road.  Hopefully this isn't a &#34;planned obsolescence&#34; move by Turtle Beach because I'd been doing fine with my own rechargeable Eneloops already.Build quality feels solid just as my other Turtle Beaches have.  Another nice upgrade for the Phantoms is that they headset is a little bit bigger than my Deltas which were always a little bit tight on my head even at full extension.  The Phantoms take care of this issue and I feel like I could wear them for days.  The CoD: Ghosts branding is apparent with the skull emblem on each earcap, &#34;Call of Duty&#34; embossed across the headband, and in the color scheme.  I honestly don't like the color scheme as much as I did the black/graphite/green of the Deltas.  The accent color is not a cool off-white as it appears in the product shot as much as it's a light grey.  This really shows off the plastic of the components (which again, are truly solidly molded and built) which unfortunately gives off more of a &#34;toy&#34; appearance than a solid black headset would.  Bear in mind that if you don't absolutely need the CoD branding, the Phantoms are basically comparable to the XP510, which look more muted and cost less than the Phantoms.The package itself is just a big cardboard box with a molded plastic insert to hold the headset.  This is a bit of a downer for anyone who's owned a premium Turtle Beach headset in the past.  My Ear Force Deltas, for example, came in a hinged plastic tackle box with locks and a nicely-padded foam inset that held everything for transport/storage.  I guess that this isn't unique in the march of progress - getting a little bit less for the same price - but it's kind of a shame to see any scrimping on such a high-end product.As a number of reviews have noted, the Phantoms are compatible immediately with Xbox360, PS3 and the next-gen PS4.  The Xbox One does not immediately support chat via this headset; however, Turtle Beach is offering a redemption program via their website where Phantom owners can send in the UPC code from their headset box to receive the necessary chat adapter in the mail when it becomes available in February.All in all, the Phantom is a great headset and a gift sure to make any CoD fanatic ecstatic (even if it's a gift for you!).  It sounds great, feels very comfortable to wear, and is made with Turtle Beach's typical fantastic quality.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"Paul Hemenway","summary":"Simply Fantastic","reviewText":"Ten years ago I bought the first Doom, played at night with the lights off and sound blaring and it scared the heck out of me. Ten years later, I guess I didn't learn my lesson. I popped in Doom 3 and I thought my heart was going to explode inside of my chest because I was so scared.First off, the story line is fantastic. Instead of a run and gun kind of game like the previous installments, this runs more like like an RPG slash First Person Shooter that reminded me a lot like how Deus Ex was set up. You interact with characters frequently and at times you need to keep them alive in order to advance through the compounds.I found the gameplay to be quite realistic. You start off on a routine mission when everything goes to hell and you're left with your wits, your pistol, armor, and a trusty flashlight, and that's it. Making your way through the labs and such with the power being knocked out is not fun, because finding enemies is just ludicrious almost, as they find you most of the time instead, leaving your quick wits to think and fight your way through every crack in this game. I found switching between weapons and your flashlight to be simple, however, when the addrenaline is rushing, for some reason it can be a bit difficult to hit the 'F' key for some reason to switch from your flashlight back to your previously used weapon. :) Interacting with consoles and people is a brease, and finding your way around is not that difficult either, as there is usually only one way you can go anyway.Graphics are stunning, and I was impressed as to how high I could pump up the quality as previous reviews and magazines had suggested that Doom 3 would require an almost completely up to date machine. I'm running an Athlon 1900 XP with 512MB of PC2700 DDR 333 memory with a nVidia GeForce4 Ti 4200 8X 128MB video card, and I can pump all the graphics settings to high on 1024 X 780 without breaking a sweat.I would highly recommend this game to everyone, especially those whom have played the previous installments.

I'm sorry I listened to the critics and naysayers.","reviewText":"I was going to buy this game on opening day, but I hesitated because I listened to the slanderous/libelous mediocre reviews from the critics.  Nothing could be further from the truth.I'm happy I bought it (especially for only $24).Graphics can vary between great to mediocre to sub-par and colorless.  The graphics aren't artificially bright and colorful (and sometimes cheesy) like Killzone 3 for example.  The way the fire burns and the smoke fills the atmosphere is awesome. The environmental and game play graphics are great.  Many times you'll be engaged in combat at night or in dark environments and the enemies will have flashlights attached to their rifles shning in your eyes.  It's great. Other times, you'll be in smoke/fog filled environments and the enemy will have those rifles with flashlights attached.  Other times, the enemy will have floodlights shining in your eyes after breaching a door, ect.  The game and all the action graphics run smoothly.  There are about 5 times when you'll be engaged in combat in smoke filled environments.I like the controles: hold down the L1 button to aim OR hold down the L2 button to simultaneously aim and lean & peak out of cover or over cover (you don't actually have to be behind cover to use the L2 button's features).I like you you can aim and then you can click the Right Stick button to toggle scoping in and scoping out (only for the rifles that you are originally equiped with.  If you use an enemy's rifle, you can aim, but you can't zoom in and out).I like you you can slide or dive from a sprint.  You can stand, crouch and lie prone on your belly.You can cook your grenades before throwing them.NO HUNTING AND SCAVENGING FOR CRAP!  A lot of other games require you to spend a considerable amount of time scavenging for crap to find ammo, weapons, money, junk for the sake of being able to play the game and upgrade.  There is none of that in this game.  Just like in real life, if you need ammo, you go to your teammate with the packpack full of ammo and get more (if you picked up an enemies rifle, you can just walk over other rifles, from fallen enemies, to get more ammo).You just play the game and play the game and play the game.  No need to spend considerable amounts of time going out of your way to scavenge and loot like so many other games (for example, Far Cry 3, Mass Effect series, Tomb Raider, Borderlands, Bioshock Dishonored, ect.)VARIETY.  Sometimes you'll be a sniper--yes you need to steady your scope and hold your breath, sometimes you'll be piloting a little drone vehicle with a powerful firearm attached, sometimes you'll be the aerial gunner in a chopper, sometimes you'll be in a car chasing enemies or trying to evade being captured by the security forces.  One mission requires you to drive and hide from the security forces, and drive and hide and drive and hide to escape the city.  You'll be engaged in combat most of the time with a rifle and a pistol or two rifles depending on the mission.  Some missions you'll use a sniper rifle but only at designated times. A lot to combat takes place at night, sometimes in smokey environments as stated before.My favorite was when your character is on a ship and escapes from being captured by the enemy.  He has to use stealth to get a firearm and fight your way through the ship to the top and escape.The combat requires brains and patience.  Enemies can be hiding anywhere and come out of anywhere to initiate battle or to reinforce the guys you are battling.  Take cover.  Move and take cover.  Lean & peak and shoot.  Proceed with caution.You'll need to press the Start/pause button to remind yourself of what to do. Sometimes the order will be given while you were doing other things.The breaching the door unlockables keep things interesting.  For every 4 headshots after a door breach, you unlock a new door breech.  They vary from kicking in the door and throwing a grenade to using various charges, using a hatchet, a crowbar or shotgun to breech the door.  The all accomplish the same goal.Nice cut scenes. Great graphics during the cut scenes. This game is dedicated to those who chose to answer a higher calling and not merely live a normal existence.  For those who face death and then can come hope to rock their baby child to sleep in the same day.  It shows these Special Operator hero as being fully human with wives and family in addition to their super heroic job and not just  a surreal super human Ramos or video game characters.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2013"}

Every area is distinct and has its own sense of history, and once you get up to the higher buildings and plateaus, you'll be wowed by the draw distance (you can look way out towards mountains and far off buildings, and everything out there is rendered, not just some flat surface). The temples in particular are just gorgeous, with multiple light sources and highly detailed statues and idols. As with the first game, water looks fantastic, whether in pools or rapids, and fire is just as convincing. Nate and his companions look great and are animated with more fluidity this time around, and there seem to be more enemy types than in the first game (you can tell which ones are tougher just by looking at their armor and/or face paint).The first game got a little monotonous towards the end, as the last few chapters fell back on long gunfights against waves of bad guys. Uncharted 2 has a lot more variety in terms of gameplay, including some of the most memorable sequences of this gaming generation. In one of my favorites, you start off on the back of a train and have to run/climb to the front, all while battling enemies and trying to avoid fire from a helicopter (and you'll notice that the environment actually changes around you - no repetitive backgrounds here!). Even the seemingly mundane tasks are fun, as the platforming isn't as tedious and puzzles aren't as obvious (though they're are still spelled out for you in the journal). Gunfights are always entertaining and require some strategy (enemies will flank you and throw grenades/launch rockets/snipe you from afar). There is a greater variety of weapons, and combined with the possibility of stealth kills, it allows for multiple strategies.I haven't mentioned the story yet, but it's very good as well. I didn't really dig Nate's new friends (it's pretty obvious they're setting him up), but thankfully you meet up with an old one before too long. Nate and his friends spout tons of fun dialogue and lighten the air in otherwise tense situations. The plot is much like an Indiana Jones movie, with a brutal commander seeking out a mystical orb, and several parts were definitely inspired by the Tomb Raider and Metal Gear Solid games. There is a surprise revelation at the end again, and it fits what was set up pretty well. It's also followed up by an end boss fight that's actually worthy of the rest of the game, and exciting in its own right. I did feel that the fate of one person at the end could have taken a different path, as things are wrapped up a little too neatly.Now for the negatives. First off, the controls can be a pain, even towards the end of the game. Don't get me wrong, they're much improved from the first game (where I always had issues moving the camera, especially when transitioning from platforming to aiming). For one thing, grenades no longer require an arc, you just aim as with your gun and press L2 to toss one to that spot. But there are issues...As with the first Uncharted, I found the cover system annoying at times, as I'd keep jumping out of cover when really I wanted to run behind the next box or pillar. I also found myself getting \"unstuck\" from cover when I didn't want to be (Nate will often stand up from cover when walking behind a fence or wall). It doesn't help that the same button is used for rolling. If they had used the same system as in MGS4 (where you would remain in cover until you pressed circle again) it would have been more clear which position you were in. Platforming is more intuitive than the first game, but it's not always clear which pieces of the background can be climbed or jumped onto and which can't. Also, it's a minor thing, but over the course of the game, you'll repeat the same actions a few times, like rappelling down a line to a lower area, having to give someone a boost to reach a ladder, or pushing a cart out of the way.A few times in the game, I got stuck in a room or other area and didn't know what to do next. For instance, at one point you're on the roof of a tall building and there is no obvious way to get down. You're supposed to follow one of your companions to show you the way, but if you're not fast enough, she will be gone and you'll be left running around for half an hour, wondering how she disappeared. As I mentioned above, I would try jumping onto certain things and wouldn't be able to. Most of the time the game gives hints on how to proceed, but this isn't always the case.Occasionally there will be a graphical hiccup, as a texture would pop in after a second or two or Nate would clip through an object or the floor. These are small things and easily overlooked in light of the otherwise fantastic visuals. My PS3 Slim locked up towards the end of the game, but played the rest just fine (I think it was right before a cutscene). That was the only major problem in almost 13 hours of play.One other thing that's worth mentioning: There are no female enemies in the game. The only (two) women in the game are Nate's friends. One is the dark, mysterious type, the other a plucky \"sunshine\" girl. You play alongside the women at times, but never get to play AS them (which would have been a nice change of pace). I guess having them fight with you is enough for now though, as the AI is well done and they will take out some of the enemies for you.By the way, Sully is only in a small portion of the game, which is disappointing.These few problems do little to mar the overall experience. Uncharted 2 is lots of fun to play and has plenty of memorable moments, and remains one of the best games on the PS3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Powie","summary":"Another Epic Adventure For Uncharted Fans","reviewText":"As a big fan of the first Uncharted, I have been very much looking forward to this game.My review basically is just about the single player game, as I've yet to play the full retail online, although I have played the beta/demo co-op mode and it was a blast, I expect the same from the full version.First let's start with the visuals, the world is simply stunning. With plenty of detail for character models, as well as the environments. The game never seems to show frame rate issues.The sounds, music and voice acting are all superb, although I've noticed a few times when the lip-syncing was off. So a small glitch there, possibly related to me constantly hitting the pause button and pulling up the list of treasures, as I'm on my second play through trying to find all 100 treasures.The platforming and climbing is as fun, and challenging as usual, but not as hard as the first Uncharted, which is good there was one spot in U1 on the side of that castle which was very difficult. The puzzles are not too difficult to figure out, and won't hamper game play for the mentally challenged.Combat is very well done as well, from hand to hand combat which is not tiresome button mashing. A variety of weapons to be found and used, although you are allowed one pistol type weapon, and one rifle type. Ammo doesn't seem as hard to come by, just make sure you pick up the enemies after every battle, as well as look for treasure.I wish Amazon actually allowed a number rating, while this game does deserve 5 stars it's not perfect. As mentioned above I've had issues with the lip syncing being off, as well as I've got stuck in the environment twice, so if I could rate this game on a scale of 1-100 it would get a 98. Still it's one of the best games out this generation, as well as the most visually stunning games ever.Single player mode took me 14 hours to complete, the game tracks many statistics, and one of them is time to complete, as well as time just standing still which said 3 hours. Had a few phone calls, etc. So possibly 11 hours to complete the game, and finding 27 of 100 treasures with no \"Guides\". I'm now on my 2nd play through in hard mode, and using a guide to get all 100 treasures.I've played all the top titles this year so far, like KZ2, inFamous, Batman, Demon's Souls, and Uncharted 2 still beats them all. This should win Game of The Year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2009"}

The cars are beautiful and the selection of cars and tracks is amazing. Forza 4 is an incremental step up from Forza 3: so if you played and liked Forza 3, you will also like Forza 4.Forza 4's improvements and additions to the Forza franchise:1) Graphics: Beautiful.  The cars and settings are stunning.2) Physics: the cars behave better, turns feel more realistic.3) Season pass: get all the future DLC cars at a discount.4) Import: You can import your Forza 3 profile.  This gives you extra credits, unlocks some cars, and pops some achievements.  I like that this feature rewards veteran racers and creates some continuity between the titles.Forza 4 also adds some \"experimental features\"1) kinect control option: this, for me was a failure.  Imagine you're driving a car, put your hands on an imaginary wheel, and drive.  Maybe for kids who enjoy making car sounds in an old refrigerator box. But for me, this feature did not work/feel right.2) head tracking: also using kinect. But I liked this. If you're seated in front of your kinect, it will track your head. tilt down, and the screen will \"move\" so that your center can be mirrors or gauges.  I thought this was nifty.3) voice command: also nifty. As you play through the menus, customizing your cars and adding cars to your garage, you can navigate with voice controls.  Its nifty (but not necessary).My one complaint:1) there is no realistically priced wheel/pedals kit. The microsoft U-shaped wireless wheelXbox 360 Wireless Speed Wheelgot mixed reviews so I passed on it. I saw great reviews for the Fantec wheel, but it costs more than the entire xbox.  I think a wheel/pedal kit entering at around $100 would be great for Forza 4 because it would add to the realism.  But since that doesnt exist you can use the controller (which works, but again you miss out on that realism) or kinect (which feels a little ridiculous).Overall:Forza 4 is a great racing game.  Many cars, beautiful, detailed cars. Cars. Tracks. Engines. If you have money, I would recommend a great wheel set up.  If not, it is still a lot of fun with the controller.  If you already played Forza 3 and liked it, you will love Forza 4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001PKHRVE","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Very Good Combat Hindered by Awkward Movie Tie Ins and Platforming","reviewText":"X-Men Origins Wolverine is a fun action game that allows you to slice up and dismember enemies as everybody's favorite adamantium clawed mutant.  However, whenever the game breaks away from the visceral combat, it feels like anything but a Wolverine game.Concept:  9/10An M-Rated Wolverine Game!  This is a dream for most gamers and comic book fans.  You play as Wolverine taking on enemy soldiers, mutants, sentinels...  With the M-Rating, Wolverine dismembers enemies and performs brutal finishing movies on anyone unlucky enough to get in his way.  This is the Wolverine that comic fans have always wanted to see!  But the execution of this concept feels flawed whenever the game breaks away from the bone smashing, dismembering action.Story:  3/10The game tries to tell its own story while retelling the movie supplemented with some of the story arcs from the comics. It's a story about Wolverine, but flashes back to the movie, which flashes back to the movie flashbacks, then flashes forward to the movie, then flashes forward to the game, amidst other flashbacks.  The story is so confusing, you actually feel like you have Alzheimer's.  In the end, it's a complete mess.  After finishing this game, you will understand why Wolverine has amnesia.Gameplay:  7/10 (Combat)  5/10 (Other)Wolverine feels deadly and responsive as you slash your way through hordes of enemies.  He's got God of War style combos, the ability to launch and combo enemies into the air, throws, a long range tackle, and brutal finishing moves.  The enemies are a mixed bag.  Most of what you fight are soldiers with machine guns which is a pretty bad match-up for a guy with claws.  There are sub bosses, but you fight all of them the same way. Slash them, jump onto their backs for a few quick hits and repeat.  There are some exciting boss fights, and some close ranged enemies that are really fun to fight.When you're not fighting, you're pushing puzzle blocks or platform jumping.  Although the gameplay isn't terrible, most people didn't buy this game to walk on balance beams, push boxes, or jump onto platforms that retract causing you to fall to your death.  One level takes away your healing factor and feral senses and forces you to crawl through vents.  It's got the opposite feeling of playing a mutant berserker!Levels:  7/10From Ancient Ruins in Africa to Futuristic Military Bases, the levels look great.  There's a mix of combat and some acrobatic navigation.  If you ever feel lost, all you have to do is activate Wolverine's Feral Senses and they'll point you in the right direction and highlight all climbable ledges, hazards, and combat props.  The puzzles are fairly easy and you always know where to go.Art:  9/10The Levels, Characters, and Effects all look great.  Wolverine's healing factor is also animated.  You can watch the tissue mend itself as his healing factor repairs damage caused by bullets, blades, and explosions.  The cutscenes are also exciting, fun to watch, and 10 times cooler than the movie!Sound:  7/10The music is ok and the sound effects bring the action to life.The game is rated M for Mature for language, dismemberment, blood, decapitation, bone snapping, impaling, immolating, slicing, stabbing, gore... etc...Overall:  7/10This game is a big step in the right direction for Wolverine and if Activision could make a game like this without a host of convoluted movie tie-ins, it could be great.  The game is about 12 hours long and 8 hours of it are fun.  Aside from a Hard Mode and Achievements, there isn't much replay value.Buy it if you want a pretty good God of War style game or you love the latest Wolverine movie.Rent it if you want to experience a good, solid, violent action game.  It's about 10-12 hours long and pretty fun.Avoid it if you can't stand the sight of blood, you hated the movie, or want a game with a ton of replay value.Personally, I'm glad I rented it.  It was a game that I had fun playing, but I don't think I'll every play it again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2009"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Disappointing, don't believe the hype","reviewText":"I've always been more of a console gamer than a PC gamer, but with how hyped Crysis has been over the past year, gamers of all sorts (myself included) were eagerly anticipating it, considering the bombardment of beautiful trailers and gameplay clips that we've seen over all that time, and the fact that the game is developed by Crytek, the same team that brought us the excellent FPS Far Cry.  Once you get Crysis fired up (hope you have a system and graphics card powerful enough to do it), you'll be amazed at how stunningly beautiful the environments and areas appear, even on a low resolution.  The explosion effects are brilliant and the sound effects are wonderfully done as well, making Crysis one of most visually pleasing FPS' to come out in quite some time.  Where Crysis derails though is thanks to the assortment of bugs and glitches that are apparent throughout the game.  These range from physics glitches to mission bugs where you are wandering around wondering just what to do.  It should also be noted that the supposed \"advanced AI\" in the game is practically non-existant, as you'll notice enemies doing things not so intelligent in the heat of battle, at least when it comes to the human enemies in the game.  These range from shooting in the opposite direction of you to not shooting at all.  However, there are moments in the game where you will be left with your jaw hanging open, including some battles with massive alien adversaries that are done exquisitely well, but these moments happen nowhere near as often as advertised.  Crysis isn't a bad game one bit, and for FPS fans seeking a new shooter or for those who have been marginally interested in the game since it's announcement, it is definitely worth checking out.  Keeping that in mind, don't expect the next great shooter, or nothing close to what Crysis has been hyped as being.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2007"}

I was a little disappointed that the game doesn't use the motion sensors to play, it is just the basic button pushing just like the previous two games. The graphics are a little better than they were on Gamecube, but the game is still really fun. Brawl has a nice choice of interesting new and classic characters.

I have never played a game that is more all-encompassing or complex.  Despite all this, I do have 2 criticisms.1.  When you get killed it takes a looong time to upload a new game.  If you are fighting a particularly tough character and get killed multiple times, this can get fairly old.2.Too much talking !!  This game is a little too cerebral and a little low on action.  You can spend hours just talking to the hundreds (if not thousands) of characters trying to gain information about your surroundings.If you like a game that requires strategy and patience this game if for you.  If you like non-stop action you will find this game rather slow.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2002"}

After final fantasy 9 I wasn't really expecting much. This game however was tremendously good.Graphics:GreatThe graphic looks great. Although the areas aren't as detailed as MGS, the characters all look great.Sound:GreatMusic and such is good. The sound works really well, especially when the characters attack enemies. I wouldn't buy the game just for the sound though...Fun:Really GreatThis is where the game shines. The game has really fun fights becuase mostly the tag team. You can tag in other members of your party. You don't even have to play with Tidus. I have basically used 4 characters over the course of the game.Innovation:Really GreatThe new orb thingy system lets you move your characters across little tables. By moving across the tables with circles on them, characters power up themselves and learn new abilities. This works really well for those who don't care about some abilities and just want the good stuff. Me? I made tidus more agile then strong, but you can do it either way. The Summons can be upgraded also. Aeons don't have to be useless once you get farther in the game. I still use ifrit and he still rocks.Replay Value:GoodThe game is short, but that is fine. I stopped playing the game at Sin, and I plan to go beat that today. The problem is extras. To fight the dark aeons or something, you need to get the 3 sisters, and blah blah blah. I really don't want to spend the rest of my day looking for some mirror. That being said, Once you get the more powerful Aeons, the games basically a joke. Honestly, I spent two days building up my party(for about 3 hours each day) for Omega Weapon. I got to him and I used Shiva, Ifrit, and Bahamut and crushed him. He killed Ifrit and Shiva, but Bahamut just beat him in the last minute. He was way to easy and really offered no challenge what-so-ever.Pretty good game, I would buy it. It isn't extremely long, and by Final Fantasy standards it is pretty short. But have fun with it because it does have, in my opinion, the funnest battles in any final fantasy game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2003"}

The thing about AC is how quickly you become addicted to it, then how quickly you burn out.  By connecting to other players' towns, you can quickly collect millions of bells you never earned, as well as all of the other fruits, and even some rare flowers if they're willing.  What this does is let you pay off your multiple mortgages almost instantly, which defeats the entire purpose of the game.  Once I had the biggest house, and the biggest store, there was nothing left to do except hunt for the UFO.  Now, Nintendo has basically rereleased the same game on Wii.  Sure they moved several NPC dealers to a separate screen i.e. \"the city\" but nothing has really changed.  You still need to trade annoying friend codes, you still need to coordinate multiplayer via a third party instant messager, cell phones, etc.  This game is great for players who have never stepped foot in the AC world before, which I guess is the majority of Nintendo's new expanded audience, but for the experienced player, avoid this until they actually do something new with the franchise.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2008"}

I love the Burnout games and had played every single Need for Speed game since the very first release. I was sure that the Need for Speed franchise could bring in the smooth realistic handling and car upgrades while the Burnout series would add in the spectacular crashes.Well what had really happened was the the handling of the cars stayed floaty and arcadish beyond all reason with all cars feeling and sounding very much the same and the crashes from burnout are few and far between due to how the mechanics of crashing a car were implemented.First, you cannot ram your opponents off the road like you could in burnout. So as a speeder you can ram cops but that's it. Worse yet cars now have a health bar, so in a bizzare fashion it is possible to ram a car in the rear over and over until the HP is exhausted and the car flips for no reason. Annoyingly enough this is what you often have to resort to because PITing a car is exceptionally hard due to how arcadish the cars feel. Ramming a car perfectly in the rear wheel and pushing it simply causes is to slide into a light drift instead of losing traction like it's supposed to. Being able to PIT cars is something that worked great in the original NFS, hell it even works every single GTA game and even in APB with all of it's physics issues. No piting a car in NFS though - no, here you have to use the road blocks etc. To me personally, the road blocks, spike strips etc actually distract from the thrill of driving - well had there been one in the first place anyway. Oh and before I forget, spike strips, road blocks etc, are nerfed to uselessness compared to most wanted. In most wanted hiting spike strips meant game over, here it means you spin out - whoop dee doo.I am having a very tough time continuing to play the game, there is just no thrill to the chase or the escape, no desire to get new cars as they all feel the same and no storyline to advance so...why play?","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}
