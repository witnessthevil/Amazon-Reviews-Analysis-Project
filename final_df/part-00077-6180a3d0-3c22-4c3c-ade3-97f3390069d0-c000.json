{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Lemo","summary":"A good, but flawed, game","reviewText":"It's a great game with a few small frustrations that keep it from being a game of the year contender. The investigations and interrogations make up the bulk of gameplay, so if you prefer action packed games, then this won't work for you.  Personally I liked the more relaxed pace.  I had some troubles with the interrogations, specifically when I knew someone was telling a lie and had several solid pieces of evidence to prove it, but couldn't figure out with of piece of evidence I needed.  The game only gives you one shot at a question.  For me I think the weakest part came from some of the narrative choices (spoilers!) - solving 5 cases and then finding out that the 5 people you arrested for each case are innocent kind of goes against the idea that you're this great cop.  Finally, I was truly annoyed that the game switches main characters for the last couple of cases - it would have been nice to follow Phelps all the way to the end of the game.  On the whole though, it's a lot of fun and I look forward to the downloadable cases coming soon.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2011"}

Name them after friends, and you'll protect them that much more. The maps are extremely varied and destructible. Enemies are crafty, demanding smart play. The ramp-up in difficulty and abilities hits such a perfect pace, and it's extremely difficult to stop playing.

{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

It is beautifully simple.  It is a work of art.  Very few other games can even approach Ico's level of artistic and cinematic presentation.  More so than almost anything else, Ico is an evolution in game design.  It is different.  That is rare.  I, for one, would be disappointed if more games of the sort weren't created, though it doesn't lend itself too well to be a new genre.  At the very least, I hope it will influence others in the video game industry.Ico's graphics are good, and they exhibit an impressive unity and style.  The lighting and shadows are excellent.  The castle is perfect, and lends itself well to chilling visuals of far off areas.  There aren't too many cutscenes, but they are fantastic, and they don't drag like so many other games.  Some graphical affects, like the shadow monsters, and the little birds all over the place, and the spreading darkness when Yorda is dragged down into the nether, are very cool.Ico himself is cool, as a boy that was exiled for his villages good fortune, due to his horns.  He is an athletic 12 year old, leaping around and climbing chains and such.  Yorda is a mysterious woman whom Ico finds soon into his adventure.  She cannot be understood by Ico, but he helps her along anyway, as she seems to be in need of help.  She is kind of absent minded (as far as AI goes), but she never really wanders off very far.  Many complain about her not taking an active role in the adventure, but it felt to me like she was supposed to be mysterious, and not just a normal person.  That, and I don't know a single girl of her stature that could climb a chain.  I thought it all worked well.  When you are forced to leave her behind it is suspenseful, as she is can be attacked while you're gone, which is a terrifying experience.  There is also the \"Queen\", another mysterious person Ico meets.  Saying much more would spoil it.The gameplay itself was surprisingly fun, though not enough to satisfy die-hard action fans.  The puzzles, for the most part, are easy and they center around getting Yorda through the castle (which Ico can traverse easily).  The combat with the shadow monsters isn't too tough, especially once you've got your sword.  There's not too much to it.  There isn't a lock on system or anything, just running around and attacking.  You can't actually be killed (I think), so the important part of the combat is actually defending Yorda.  It is cool when you are swarmed by nearly unstoppable masses of enemies, and your only option is to drag Yorda to safety while trying hopelessly to fend off enemies.  Good stuff.Ico has some of the most carefully done sound I've ever encountered.  The music is eerily appropriate and never overpowering.  Often, there isn't even music, but just background noises or a chilling silence.There isn't an abundance of story.  Rather, it all just sort of exists.  The beginning and set-up are excellent, and it leads to an ending which is breathtaking.  It was beautiful.  I was left in awe.All this, and Ico only took five hours to finish, which is the only major drawback.  Which is kind of a shame, because I don't know how much longer it could have gone on without ruining it.  Some have mentioned that Ico is less a game than a work of art.  It is both.  You've got to experience Ico for yourself.  Unless you hate solving puzzles, play this game.  It is worth every moment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2002"}

Now they're back with Brain Age 2 - and I really feel they did a great job of enhancing the game's functionality!First, the infamous \"voice test\". In Brain Age 1, it was the classic see-a-colored-word-say-the-color game that so many magazines and websites print. The big problem there was that blue and black always got confused. With this one, they changed it to rock-paper-scizzors. It's just as challenging, and we've never had any problems with it understanding us. Hurrah!Next, the mini-games. I appreciated the challenge of the Brain Age 1 games, but they were pretty boring. They just weren't much fun to play, especially compared to some of the other games on the market.They did a great job of revamping the games in Brain Age 2. Some of them are still on the boring side, like the 'running people' game where you try to figure out what place the dark player comes in. Most of them, though, are truly fun to play. The spinning letters game where you try to figure out what word they spell can be quite challenging. I love the piano game where you try to play along with the song.There are the usual graphing options, so you can see your progress over time, and then the \"brain age\" with an ideal age of 20. Just like with the first game, I have to protest that it's a silly idea that your brain is best at 20. Your brain can easily be very slow at 20 and much better at 30! They should rate it as a 0% to 100%, rather than pushing this idea that youth is best. What's next, a diet program that gets you to weigh the weight of an \"ideal 20 year old\"?Still, it is certainly valid that the more you use your brain, the better it gets. Everyone needs to keep their brains exercised and fresh. Playing this game is far better than sitting back and passively watching TV all night. Best of all, you can bring this along with you and increase your brain power while you ride the bus, wait in line, and do other boring tasks!Highly recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2007"}

I have now completed the game and have raised the score to 4 stars from 3.  Here's why;The sense of dread one receives when playing \"Manhunt\" is undeniable.  The scenes are dark, the music is chilling and the blood flows freely as Rockstar leaves no stone unturned in the gore genre with this release.James Earl Cash is saved from execution only to be turned into director Starkweather's (the snuff movie master) stalking, muderous puppet.  As Cash is launched from death row into a society at its lowest rife with senseless murders, snuff movies, corruption, racisim and just plain waaaaay over the top violence.I really enjoyed Manhunt, though it could have been equally effective without Rockstar's insatiable desire for bloodlust.  There really hasn't been a game like it (conceptually at least) as far as I am aware.  The stealth aspects of sneaking up behind and 'snuffing' unsuspecting 'hunters' are really neat and extremely well done.  Some of the snuff scenes are so violent, they will flat out make you squirm.Turns out Manhunt is much more of a story than a mindless, murderous rampage.  The other reviewers reveal most of the plot, but lets just say you start out senselessly killing people at the direction of Starkweather.  Not really sure why you're doing it, but you've been saved from certain death only to end up fighting for your life in the seediest sections of Carcer City.  The plot slowly forms until you realize your a pawn in a huge 'snuff movie ring.'Hopefully you can get over the senselessly violent stuff, but it is an essential part of the story.

E Jackson","summary":"I never should have bothered with this","reviewText":"I never should have played the original or this updated version of the most overrated Mario title Nintendo ever released.  The praise this game STILL receives in this day and age, not necessarily for its gameplay but mainly for its influence mind you, is staggering... and sickening.  Super Mario 64 never impressed me at all in the N64 days nearly 18 years ago when I was supposed to swallow the enormous popularity but intelligently never did, and it certainly doesn't impress me now.  Nintendo had a perfect opportunity to finally make this overrated lackluster game into something truly special from a gameplay perspective but they failed to do so.  They could have finally corrected a wrong that's been annoying me for the better part of two decades.You can play as not only Mario but also Luigi, Yoshi and Wario each with their own unique abilities.  You have to search for and pick up their caps scattered throughout the levels, often times worn by the enemies meaning you have to take out the enemies to obtain them.  These are nice additions admittedly and I honestly don't even need to tell you what these abilities are- you already know since they haven't changed in years.  Luigi jumps high?  No way!  Wario's powerful?  Get out of town!  Yoshi spits eggs?  I doubt that!  Yeah, you get the idea.  There's a few other things this game adds that's totally unnecessary such as gigantic-sized Mario that can smash anything in sight for a few seconds, an overused cheap gimmick that would soon explode in eye candy redundancy when the New Super Mario Bros. games would release, and those irritating rabbit chasing games which appeared quite often in the Galaxy series.  The one mistake the Galaxy series made was including so many rabbing chasing obstacles and... Super Mario 64 for the DS gives us more of those than we can honestly handle.  Chasing rabbits is stupid!  The worst part is that there's an extended rabbit grabbing mission both inside and outside the castle when you get close to the end of the game that takes up a good 10 minutes of playtime and it's absolutely terrible.  The bloated floating Mario power-up is kind of cool though.The most unusual and annoying aspect of this game that totally perplexes me is that the levels *still* feel needlessly overlarge.  Nintendo had a ripe opportunity here to fill in all these dreadfully empty and boring areas with tons of goodies to make them feel complete.  I mean why not fill in the empty areas?  Instead Nintendo left these stages the way they are more or less.  They wanted to preserve the game the way most people like it which was of course a bad idea.  Of course the even BIGGER insult is that Nintendo added a few new levels that feel incomplete and outdated just like the regular levels!  Why Nintendo, why?  Why match basic, unfocused blocky-shaped level design with MORE basic, unfocused blocky-shaped level design?  Instead of fixing the outdated-ness of the presentation of the game, Nintendo just throws in a few more simplistically created areas and calls it a day.  Talk about a slap in the face for those of us expecting something more appealing visually.Another really big problem is that in order to grab all 150 stars, we have to go through the same levels AGAIN AND AGAIN!  Talk about repetition at its absolute worse, and going through the same areas over and over will only end up making me want to replay this game even less.  And by less I of course mean never again.  Knowing that the game is STILL intentionally made to force gamers go through the same areas yet again just to obtain another golden star is really pathetic.  Create Mario games either the Super Mario Bros. 3 way where you only have to go through a stage one time before moving on, or the Yoshi's Island way where if you successfully collect everything your first time and 100% a level, you won't have to return to the same stages anymore.  Don't MAKE us go through areas we already completed time and time again for one simple little golden star where the \"adventure\" getting to it is hardly ever rewarding, challenging or lengthy enough to make an impression anyway.The controls are horrible once again, this time persevering a d-pad instead of a big clunky N64 controller (both ideas fail to work right).  The music is absolutely terrible beyond comprehension.  Having to constantly rearrange camera angles is incredibly outdated and annoying.  Super Mario Galaxy proved that switching camera angles is no longer necessary.  It's WAY too happy which is no doubt deliberate on the part of Nintendo for the entire purpose of rubbing more salt in the wound.  Seriously Nintendo, it's possible to make happy music without the irritating obnoxiousness that only ends up distracting what's clearly already a really lame and outdated game overall.  No need to make the experience even worse with music that makes you want to tear the skin off your body.  An example of quality happy music is the stuff we hear throughout World 1 of Super Mario Bros. 3.  Remember the joyful and innocent music in that game?  The music was tame and never frantically irritating.  In Super Mario 64 DS however, the music's like a hayride from the county fair to the downtown post office that rides on an endless loop in the most annoying way imaginable.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is just one of several examples I could name that shows the way music SHOULD be for a platformer that often times requires concentration to succeed.  At least the remixed soothing water music now with techno-ish beats is decent.  If any other themes have been remixed I can't tell.And we have 30 more stars to collect bringing the total to 150 this time around, which means an extra hour or so to collect everything the game has to offer.  I would mention several other features that drag down this supposed \"classic\" but I already touched upon those subjects in my review for the Nintendo 64 version of Super Mario 64 so there's no need to repeat myself here.  The cuteness factor of certain areas is enough to make me puke though.  I don't mind the occasional childish graphics and objectives, but Super Mario 64 takes the childish aspects to really pathetic depths that feels more intended for babies instead of kids.  Take the penguin race level with the penguins and snowmen for example.  *throws up*  Not something grown men who grew up during the 80's when Mario was fresh, challenging, fast-paced and arcade-like would ever admit to enjoying without blushing.  And what DOES Mario say at the beginning of each level?  \"Let's tickle!\"  \"Miss Pickle!\" \"Popsicle!\"  There's like a million things he could be saying there.  I was informed he's saying \"Let's a-go\" but I absolutely can't make out those words at all.  I had this same trouble with the N64 version since it's the same exact line lazily copied into this game.Just skip Super Mario 64 DS.  I absolutely loathe this game.  The only reason I gave it another chance is because I thought Nintendo radically changed the game and morphed it into something entirely different by ditching all the old, outdated and tiresome ideas that never worked in the first place and yet only existed in the late 90's because Nintendo was riding the 3D wave and needed something cutting edge on the market.  It's no longer 1996, though.  My how I was wrong on all counts to give this game a second chance on the DS.  The two worst levels have remained which only adds to my anger.  The level where you have to tediously and accurately jump across a series of rotating poles above the water collecting coins, and the rainbow-colored carpet ride which is essentially an auto-scrolling level when you think about it.At least the ghost house is pretty cool.  A piano snapping and chasing me around the room is pretty fun, as is punching enemies and knocking them out for coins.  But uh... coins.  That brings me to another subject and another annoyance.  Absolutely the biggest thing Nintendo should have clearly changed is the \"collect 100 coins for a star\" levels.  This means for several minutes I'm forced to thoroughly explore mediocre levels JUST to obtain enough coins for a star.  A sickening, dreadful, terribly unsatisfying concept if there ever was one.  You'd have to be the most delusional person on the planet to enjoy collecting 100 coins while absorbing these unspectacular levels.  I'm done with this review.  Between gamers believing this game is actually a classic and the little enjoyment I get out of it despite relentlessly giving it more chances, I just can't handle it anymore.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2014"}

Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Sarah","summary":"Good console, less games","reviewText":"When Nintendo 64 is compared to PS1, which is actually cheaper than this is, there is one weakness that Nintendo 64 has. And that is the lack of games. Also, N64 runs on cartridges, and many of its games are costly. Since the console is old, you can get many of the items for this console, and the console itself, for a fairly low price. Nintendo 64 was actually a big hit when it came out, I remember so many of the kids going nuts over it. I actually never had one when I was young, but I don't think I really missed out on much. If you are thinking of getting this gaming console as a gift to a little one, then you should try to get it for a low price. My Mom bought one for[dollar amount]for my brother on Christmas, but I got one used for [less]. Even though it is old, there are many great games, especially multiplayer games available on N64.Pros:1) Large selection of multiplayer games2) Great RPGs, such as Zelda: Ocarina of Time.3) Fairly cheap if you shop around4) Pretty good graphicsCons:1) Lack of games2) Old, so lack of new releases3) Runs games on cartridges compared to small CDs.There are many games which younger children will love available on N64, so it makes a great gift for young ones.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2002"}

From the moment I put the game on in my system, I could see the lack of quality. As noted by others, the graphics in this game are LAUGHABLE. Running on a 720p TV and HDMI cable, this game looked cartoonish: almost a Playstation 1.5 game.I think the first warning sign should have been the fact the game was cut in price by about 8 dollars from an already surprising $45 retail price. Coupled with the fact reviews were scarce across the internet about what this game was really even offering. The gameplay itself reminds me of old PC shooters combined with Oregon Trail. This is a first person shooter but you only get to have like 3-4 weapons at a time and if you want more then you have to give up ration slots (that heal you), and also picking up fuel takes up a slot.  (Meanwhile, Lara Croft can hold like 5 weapons and hundreds of bullets with no problem).This game is LINEAR but you get to \"scavenge\" random places for bullets and rations. There are \"side quests\" but it usually involves you being someone's errand boy and getting them something they need. After you complete the single \"main\" task of the area, you advance by driving to a new location. When you are driving between locations, you can take 3 routes (high gas cost/scavenge more locations, medium gas cost/scavenge a few locations, and low gas cost/hardly scavenge locations). This part really reminded me of Oregon Trail because your car can potentially break down (remember breaking an axle on your wagon?) and also because scavenging on the road was like hunting for food.If you're like me you bought this game because1) You're a Walking Dead fan boy2) You were intrigued by Daryl's backstory3) Seemed like a good deal for about $404) You thought it could not possibly be THAT badWell, playing an hour I can tell you1) I played right into AMC and Activision's hands by buying the game based off a favorite show2) Daryl is just a red neck, not much of a back story to that3) At $40 it is still a huge rip off, this should have been a $5 DLC game4) It really IS that bad.Conclusion:If AMC ever pursues a Breaking Bad video game. DO NOT GET IT. I learned my lesson, I hope you save your money. In fact I'll sell you my copy for $10..........UPDATE:So I finished this joke of a game last night. I played a little over an hour for 4 nights after work and it was more than enough time. The most time consuming part of this \"game\" is just driving from one location to the next. I swear, you have to have a new car battery every couple of miles. So I would have to stop to get another battery, or radiator hose, or gas. And after seeing the ending for this, I have to wonder when this game began development. The story could have been one prologue TWD episode but Activision got Kirkman and AMC to make this into a game. It is semi fun to kill the walkers but this definitely should never have been released nor been priced at $40. It's worth a rent at most and that's being generous.GRAPHICS: 1/10PLOT: 1/10LENGTH: 1/10GAMEPLAY: 5/10COST: 1/10AVOID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Square once again strikes GBA gold","reviewText":"Over the past couple years, Square has been releasing ports of their beloved older Final Fantasy games to the GBA, with results ranging from great to excellent.  Final Fantasy V Advance is no different, once again offering superb and classic RPG action that does the GBA proud.  If you remember the Final Fantasy Anthology that was released for the PS1 years back, you'll remember this game, and when playing it on the GBA, you'll notice a few slight differences, most notably in the game's story and dialogue.  The graphics look like you would expect a 16-bit Final Fantasy game to look like, with fluid animations and environments to boot.  The lengthy quest is quite challenging as well, offering up a great amount of replay value which help you get your money's worth with this game.  If there's any downsides to Final Fantasy V Advance, it's the typical kind you'd expect from the older games in the series: the horde of random battles that you'll across will grate on your nerves, and newer RPG players probably won't dig the dated presentation.  Not to mention that for a Final Fantasy game, the game's story doesn't grab you and make you want to keep playing just to find out what happens next.  Despite all that, Final Fantasy V Advance is another wonderful port of the classic series to Nintendo's undying handheld system, and the better news is that the best game in the series, Final Fantasy VI, is on the way to the GBA too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2007"}

Just finished the game and Im a little disappointed and very suprised... here we go:Pros:Fast loading times.Smooth, clean graphics.Solid, immersive BioWare storytelling (hawk goes through some really rough stuff)Your 1st 3 years in KirkwallThe new organized look of the questing systemCons:*Consolized travel system:What happened to the real map, where you could see your progress to your destination and be possibly ambushed?*Companion relationships: Now you have to track them down in their own houses all over town.Too much running around. The dark camp with lit fire was such a better setting / environment. Granted, they arent on the run in DA2, but you could have at least had them all in the mansion starting in act 2.*Dialog: This one has been beaten to death about its comparison to ME. It's not the wheel so much, its the fact that reading is no longer neccessary: Just click top option all the time for safe convo... Is reading taking too much time to do now too?*All the side/secondary quests were standard 'FedEx' fetch and reward style.Quests: Are broken down into 2 categories:1- You do it willingly2- You do it unwillingly.Why give the option to refuse?*Combat: Combat in DA1 was awesome, it wasnt slow, it was realistic. It gave you time to think out your next round, etc.BUT: You have Grey Wardens, super natural abilities, fighting at this pace.DA2: Normal humans, backflipping, highjumping, twirling, tomahawking... looks great but...seems reversed.(how consoler's handled combat towards the end, I have no idea.)Dungeon Maps: Deja Vu doesnt even begin to explain the repetition you'll experience once you leave town. Srsly, I think there are 4 dungeon maps, recreated across 17 different side quests. You dont even search for the quest objective, you just run the through the dungeon the same way you did the LAST time you were on this map and BAM, you're bound to find what ever they were tryuing to hide.*Story:  Kirkwall and 1 large outside area...That's it? a couple of random locations that go away right after the mission is done. What happened to travelling from city to city...lemme guess, DLC? Seeing the world map in DA:O was like 'whoa, thats a lot of ground to cover'...I kept waiting for the world map to be more than just kirkwall and WC...never happened. I would be lying if I said I was gripped by it nonetheless, but to focus the entire game on this one town? The sweeping, epic that was DA:O was lost in 2. AND SHORT - Dont even get me started on the ending. Lackluster, to be gracious.*Crafting:  Crafting sucks in any game, but if you were up to the task, it was rewarding to put in all that legwork to find mats. Now you find it (a crafting resopurce) one time and it's in your imaginary resource store where you can pull out as many items as you want so long as you have the gold to cover.Plain and Simple: You cant make DA:0 then follow it up with this...its just unacceptable.DA:0 truly streamlined the PC RPG experience while delivering a movie-like story and managed to flesh out an entire world of lore that even interested me! ( I never read all that lore crap in other games).Im not afraid of change, when it's a change for the better. But if it aint broke (DA:O) WHY THE !@#$ FIX IT?This...unfortunately looks like a sign of things to come. If you cant trust BioWare to delivery nothing but an AAA game, who else is there? (Bethesda?...u must be crazy)Im not mad at how DA2 turned out but I am very disappointed with BioWare. I think EA has finally corrupted the last of the good RPG storytellers in the industry.*EDIT*:Ok, nerdrage aside, after finishing it a few times:  This game plays alot like LOTR-2, the one where they focus on that horsetown (or whatever).Its like BioWare said, 'ya The Blight is still a world-isse, but the Grey Wardens are on it...here's the problem in Kirkwall...\" It's like they put a magnifying glass on the town and it's outlying regions...while the story itself is short and the ending is very lukewarm...I would be lying if I said if on the whole it wasnt entertaining. But then again, this town had about as much detail to it as, say Redfall, or Orzammar from DA:0It's the little things (that BioWare has spoiled us on) that I really miss:No summary at the endgame. This was awesome to see at the end of DAONo 'quest within quests' like when you go do a main mission and there are side mission items inside, or subquest plot twists within a dungeon.No save feature: This speaks volumes about DA3.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2011"}

The developer's put forth a concerted effort to make this franchise more commercially viable with Conviction.Now Splinter Cell purest's have mostly criticized this installment for basically being dumbed down for mass appeal. I do sympathize with their point of view, and to some extent their constructive criticism is valid.However, the revamped gameplay provides far more depth in my opinion. What was once an unapologetically conventional stealth experince, has now become a tactical 3rd person shooter/stealth hybrid. These new mechanics are visceral, and fluid in execution. The player can storm an enemy location with guns a'blazin like John Rambo. Or, remain quietly in the shawdows, identifying ambush points, and striking with deadly precision, all while remaining undetected. This freedom of choice provides a more engaging and balanced gaming experience.Naturally, with the new TPS mechanics, the stealth aspects have been scaled down a bit. You can no longer drag enemies, or chose between kill or takedown. Also, whistling and throwing objects are a thing of the past too. However, the newly implemented \"mark and execute\" feature compensates rather nicely, and serves as an adequate replacement for the previously mentioned removed features.People do seem rather disheartened that the single player campaign is uncharacteristically short. But to be honest, there is so much replay value in Deniable Op's that the shortened length of the campaign mode really just seems like an afterthought to me. Plus, there is a co-op campaign that is even more enjoyable. That coupled with single player story provides a decent amount of playing time, probably around 10-12 hours combined.Conviction may disappoint the stealth enthusaist, but will undoubtedly reward the casual gamer looking for a fun stealth/action hybrid. The control scheme is relatively simple, but yet involved and engaging. There is a ton of replay value with this title, so the $60 price point is a worth while investment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2010"}

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale.

The voice acting is terrific, brought to life even more for using some of the same voices from the animated series.  The gameplay is smooth and easy to pick up.  What isn't good about this game?  Um.........I really have no idea.  This game has got to be THE best Batman game ever made, one of the top five SUPER HERO games made, and one of the top 10 games released in the last five years.I won't go in to a lot of needless plot description cause my review is coming in on the heels of many other reviewers who HAVE gone in to the plot.  I just have to say this is \"BUY NOW\" game with PLENTY to satisfy almost every kind of gamer.  Unlike alot of games out there, this one retains its fun throughout the game and actually has you wanting to go BACK through again.  The combat isn't so frequent that it gets tedious, but isn't so sparce that you forget how to.  There are puzzles, easter eggs a-plenty, action, stealth, story, and a game so well thought out that you truly do get sucked in.  Reserve me a cell at Arkham........I may just never get out of this one.  And on a side note, the \"interview tapes you can unlock are a superb addition to the story and really lets you get in to the head of some of the GREAT super-villains of Gotham.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2009"}

I really enjoyed the campaign and the multi-player is fun.  And I would like to give the game a better rating but cannot.  Here is why:The single player campaign is way to short.  I played on hard an finished the game in about 6 hours.  This is on hard.  Had I played on normal it would have went even quicker.  The tier one mode is pretty cool but is also far to simple in many ways.  The controls and graphics are top notch but the content is just to little.The multi-player is a real disappointment.  No, not because I do not like it or because it is not fun.  It is because of connection issues.  3 different times now I have not been able to connect do to server issues.  I go to the games forum at EA and the issue has been widespread each time.  Me and my son where playing together and I get removed from the game.  We had just started and had played roughly half a match.  He is still in the game and playing while I get the error message that the \"Master Server\" is down.  I have not been able to play a game since.  For 2 days now.  And 2 other times I have had server error messages and been unable to play that day or longer.  This happens way to often.  I wonder how many will just give up on this game before it is finally fixed (if it ever is).I have to say I would not recommend this game for the MP and would not recommend it for the campaign until you can get it for about $20-$25 at the most.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Deja Vu","reviewText":"The sequel to Bioshock is set 10 years after the end of the first game in which you are still the same character. There are a few notable differences between the first and the second. You are a Big Daddy the entire game this time through. There are still other Big Daddies, but now some of the Little Sisters are now Big Sisters and are just like the Big Daddies, but much faster and more deadly.  All of your weapons are generally larger and cause more damage because you now take on swarms of splicers instead of just a few at a time. Here are the main points to the game, both good and bad.Positives:-The same combat engine is used, with a few mods-Almost all the weapons are new and upgraded-Controls are tight and intuitive as was the original-Story is a little more psychological and deeper-Multiplayer mode was added-New gadgets prevent many of the old problemsNegatives:-Graphics now look antiquated and differ little from the original game-Enemies are essentially identical to the first-Some weapons are almost never used due to ineffectiveness-General game setup is a carbon copy of BioshockGameplay: 8 of 10For the most part, everything about the shooter part of the game was carried over to the second game. It was very good then and is still good now. The controls are pretty simple and now you're able to have your plasmid hand up at the same time as you're shooting. My only problem is: I believe there are even fewer types of splicers in this game than the first. Because of this, later on in the game it can get monotonous.Difficulty has a pretty wide range. I played through the game first on easy and found it almost too easy as I didn't die a single time. Hard offers more than a challenge even for a seasoned FPS gamer; especially if you're getting a little sister to gather Adam for you. In fact, fighting a Big Sister you'd be hard pressed to stay alive with a full load of ammo and health packs.Graphics: 6 of 10In 2007, the graphics were on the higher end for games at the time. They didn't really change anything substantial that most people would notice.  It's not a big deal, but a certain level of refinement would have been nice after this much time. Light and reflections are about the only thing that looks noticeably better and of course, the water does as well.Story: 7 of 10Try to imagine a terribly obsessed person is running Rapture, but not Andrew Ryan. Instead Ryan is replaced by a clinical psychiatrist named Sophia Lamb. She is just as determined and grandiose in her thought processes as Ryan, but she has genetically engineered her daughter to be the savior of mankind instead. As the antagonist, she uses the splicers and the like to do her bidding just as in the first game. And guess what? The city is falling apart again.Weapons: 7 of 10You start with a giant drill which is obviously only for close quarters. I hardly used it at all because not only do you get severely damaged from a distance, but it runs out of fuel pretty quickly. The other weapons are the rivet gun, chain gun, grenade launcher, shotgun, spear gun and remote hacking tool. Some of the weapons are not really helpful at all and I still felt like there could have been more. You can still upgrade your weapons and there are upgraded ammo types as well. Even with a game time of 10-15 hours I managed to get bored with the weapons.My feeling when I finished the game was, \"wait, was that really a sequel?\" It seemed like D&eacute;j&agrave; vu. This happens with most sequels unfortunately and I hate to be in the camp that said they didn't change enough, but it's true. There is a lot of missed potential here. You start out the game fighting the basic splicers, move up to the more dangerous ones and eventually fight mostly the Big Daddies at the end. This is all well and good as a progression, but it's what comes along with it. You walk around looking for those same audio tapes, you've got a couple of people helping you out on the radio and your main purpose is to gather as much Adam as possible. The only real difference is that you're now a Big Daddy, but that doesn't seem to provide as much killing potential as you'd think.So, as the old saying goes, if it isn't broke, don't fix it. Well that doesn't really work if you're trying to be an innovative gaming developer. Don't get me wrong. This is a good game and is probably still far above the average shooter in terms of cohesiveness, controls and overall fun. But with almost three years to develop a game with the same graphics engine, the same combat, the same level design and for all intents and purposes a long expansion pack; it's disappointing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-04-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Ella C. Weidman \"beawei\"","summary":"Great RPG with overshadowing technical issues...","reviewText":"\"Wow. That was one hell of an adventure\"- I spoke into the telephone as I watched the ending credits roll by on my screen.I had just finished playing through one of the most fun, intellegent, and exciting games of my PC game collection, and I truly regret finishing the game (I never wanted it to end). This seems to be the ultimate Star Wars games in all areas a Star Wars game cold rate in. Despite the fact it takes place 4000 years before those classic movies, KOTOR contains every element of them we loved. By the time your done with the game, you'll have discussed bounties with a rodian in a shady and smoke-fogged cantina, swoop-race yourself a fortune of money, condition your OWN (thats right, you- the player's!) mind to think like that of a jedi- or a sith, make a daring and death-defying escape against overwhelming odds several times, and just so much more. Without a doubt, this is the single peice of media that has re-created the Star-Wars atmosphere since Return of the Jedi left our theaters. Even the more recent prequal-movies can't create such an exciting, beleivable fantasy world as KOTOR does.Anyway, now that I've stressed how true this game is to the Star-Wars legacy, I'll get into the more deeper elements of it. I'll first say, that, despite being a turn-based RPG, this game IS NOT TURN-BASED. Whenever you see a website article claiming that this game is a turn-based system, know that they simply can't get the words across to describe it. You control every party member in real time, and fight them across the same map you explore in, and they all slash, shoot, and aim in real-time. How, then, is this an RPG? Well, for starters, each charachters slashing, shooting, and aiming (and etc.) skills still greatly affect the fight. When you see an enemy, the game's time-scale pauses, allowing you to focus the camera on enemies and give orders with an infinate amount of time at your disposal. When you move the cursor over to an enemy and click on it, three icons appear above thier heads. These are the several attack icons (attack, force-power, and grenade. Each with thier respective keyboard shortcuts, of course). You can click on one, and then it's registered in your charachers que to execute that order. So, for example, you can run down the hall and see an enemy. The game's time-scale then pauses. You can then click the \"attack\" icon above the enemy. On a que below, the attack icon appears. Then, you can click the next icon above the enemy, in this case, \"force push\". The force push icon appears next in line from the attack icon on your que. Finally, you click on the \"frag grenade\" icon above the enemy, and the same respective command appears next in line in the que. Then, you press space-bar, and the game un-pauses. Your charachter rushes to a convienent spot and fires off a few round at the enemy. Then, the force pushes it into a wall, leaving it stunned with a headache for a few seconds. Taking advantage of this, your characher throws a frag grenade from his safe distance, and the proccess is available to you again, if you want to continue combat. You can run around the enemy at real-time, clicking the attack or force power icons (or quickly snap they're keyboard shortcuts) one at a time to do it in a more real-timeish method. However, combat overall in this game is very unique and hard to explain. Im sorry I went to such a great big paragraph to try and put it together in words, but seeing as how many reviews there are out there that simply refuse to talk about it, I thought i'd start here.Next up, are the graphics. Now, I'll start off by saying theres not really much to be impressed with in this area. Its definatly not dissapoiting, but at the same time, not trilling. Most of all, the game looks like Activision's Jedi Academy above all else. There are a few quirks here and there, such as some very sweet-looking reflections, water, and facial expressions, and simply huge, vast feilds that help the game achive graphically, but overall, when you get down to the bare textures and models of things, its definatly average stuff for it's time.The story of the game was one I found to be very great. As was mentioned before, this game has such a wonderful atmospheric feeling I almost wet myself. In the beggining of the game, you wake up out of nowhere when the ship you were sleeping on was under attack, and the player really feels like \"whats going on? Who's that? Where am I?\" that the charachter must be feeling, with reasons explained later on in the game, with plot twists too big to give away here. You'll dwelve deep into the mysteries of the Jedi, Sith, and even you're own charachter. Later on, you'll land on a polluted but pretty city-planet. Once you get onto the vast patios and inter-building walkways of the planet's architeture, you'll see enormous metallic skyscrapers, ships flying overhead, and an enormous populace walking around on the street with you. When you get down to the planet's surface yourself, you'll see poverty-striken homeless people. You'll see horrible mutations ravage these people, and its just such a contrast to the classy and rich life of the higher levels that it sucks the player in the game immersivly. The grassland planet of Dantooine was specifically very impressive with it's miles and miles of hills rendered in the 3D engine. The charachters are also very nicely done. They all have their own backstorys and secrets, and even motifs and purposes for joining your brigade. In the beginning, the story seems very complicated and deep, with many un-explained holes a sense of \"why am I doing this?\", but once you become a Jedi, it all seems to mold into place and be less straining on your head. A weird thing I noticed was that once you take up the role of Jedi, you really start to feel like one yourself. You'll get to know the members of the Jedi council, learn the Jedi code and live by it, and always figure out non-violent solutions to several confrontations in the game. You'll come face-to-face with the dark side, and every time you do, you'll keep feeling tempted but stubborn at the same time (Unless you do succomb after all. Which is an endevour that can be started within the first 3 minutes of game play). It is actually difficult to stay on the Light side of the force, and leisurely easy to become a member of the dark. In the end, your fate is clearly decided by which side you allege yourself to, and how you do it. There are several alternate paths and endings through the game, and you clearly can't experience it all just one time playing through. There are a few endings and also rather hilarious lines of dialouguge that all lie on certain brances of the story.Overall though, this great RPG is overshadowed by major technical issues. Simply said: This game is very, very glitchy. And simply unplayable on many computers. My experiences with KOTOR's jumbled up mess of compatibility go like so:I installed the game very anxiously and exited. Much to my dismay, the installation took over an hour and the CD was very, very hot when I took it out. My computer was clicking like crazy and it just had me scared. I then booted up the game to play, and upon seeing the fairly average graphics, expected a decent FPS around the mid 20's range. Once I got out of the first room, it dropped down to (estimated) mid 10's range, and overall, my framerate shoult've been that bad on this PC that plays DOOM 3 and Ut2k3 so well. Then, once I got out of the attacked ship and onto the ground, my guy started flying around the room aimlessly without me being able to control him. After taking my sweet precious time to upgrade the game to version 1.03 (which I did twice, since it didnt install correctly the first time), did it work OK. The game still crashes on me quite oftenly, and many times, when it loads up a new level, cutscene, or the game itself, I'm left with a blank black screen and have to close the game, and re-load it from the previous quick save and hope it works the next time through. Thankfully, though, I was able to play it tolerably to the end, and am very gratefull I did. These glitches led to me quicksaving the game ALOT, much more than I actually wanted to. Also, I treid installing it on a freind's PC, and I had to update drivers for every friken thing his PC had before the game played okay. It's still off-screened in the main menu on his PC (the problems origionate with him having an Intel Express graphics card instead of the mainstream ATI or Nvidea brands, I think). Nevertheless, be wary as you play through the game, for there are glitches aplently to be found.Overall though, I love this game. Despite the weird combat sytem and constant technical gliches, it seems to be perfect, and should be played by any RPG, Star-Wars, or just Video-Game fan out there.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2004"}

She has thwarted their dastardly efforts before. She stopped them from amassing an army of Metroids and she kept Mother Brain from retrieving the last known Metroid larva. Now she must face the Space Pirates once again in an all-new adventure.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Release Date Review","reviewText":"This review was written when the game was first released.\"Metroid Prime\" is a game whose release has finally connected the Metroid series to the new age of gaming. The star of the series is Samus Aran, a bounty hunter who, actually, is never seen doing that much bounty hunting. She is more of just an \"alien hunter\" rather than a bounty hunter, but \"bounty hunter\" sounds cooler.So, anyways, Samus the \"bounty hunter\" is orphaned from an attack by Space Pirates, who aren't really pirates, just a race of \"interstellar nomads\", as the manual says. So after the space pirates zap Samus' planet, they go and build a huge research complex on the planet Zebes, wiping out most of the native population. They are researching these creatures called \"Metroids\", which had been recently discovered by the Galactic Federation.The Space Pirates stayed there for a couple years, researching Metroids, finding new and exciting ways to blow people up, when who should arrive but Samus Aran. She had somehow avoided being blown up along with the rest of her planet's population and had been raised by the Chozo, a bird-like race of creatures. It turns out Zebes had, before the Space Pirates moved in, been a Chozo colony! Whoops! So, the Chozo, being annoyed that a world's worth of their people had been blasted into itty-bitty pieces, they infused Samus with some Chozo blood (giving her super strength, endurance, and speed), gave her a power suit with a gun-arm attached to it, and told her to go smite the Space Pirates until there weren't any space pirates left to smite.So Samus blasted her way through them, cutting a bloody swath through their operation and even getting the captain, Ridley, and their giant spike-shooting reptile friend, Kraid. Eventually she got to the inner sanctum of the operation, and blasted every Metroid she could find. Finally, she got to the Brain of the Metroids, the Mother Brain, and she blasted that too. So, thinking her job was done, she went to look for the Chozo, who had for some reason gone into hiding.But the Space Pirates weren't done yet. The survivors immediately split into two groups. Group One returned to Zebes to resuscitate Mother Brain, Kraid, and Ridley. Group Two went off looking for a new planet to make a base on. They found Tallon IV, a planet that had been a Chozo colony until a meteor brought some freaky mutating stuff called \"Phazon\" that drove most of the Chozo to leave. Before they left, figuring it was the most they could do, the Chozo sealed the meteor off with a temple and split its core, sealing the pieces away. By that time, it was too late for the planet. Plants and animals had been mutated into hideous forms, the ecosystem was completely trashed, and basically the planet was one big nuclear mess. The pirates come across it and decide it's the PERFECT place to live, what with the new experiments they can perform on the little nuclear beasties and such. They leave their ship in orbit so they can send things up and perform \"Zero-G experiments\" on them. Samus finds them, lands on their frigate, and that's where the game starts up. Undoubtedly, there are a few holes in this story, such as: where did she get her ship? It was not mentioned, but in the game, it says it is, \"Registered to Samus Aran.\" So where did she get it registered? And why is she called a Bounty Hunter? These are just some of the many story-loopholes in this game.The reason I said that Metroid Prime connected Metroid to the new age is because, unlike the Kirby, Legend of Zelda, Mario, and Donkey Kong series, Metroid did NOT have its own game on the N64. Sure, there was Super Smash Brothers, but that was only a cameo role. There have been only four Metroid games so far: Metroid, for the NES, Metroid II: Return of Samus for the Game Boy, and Super Metroid for the SNES. The last one was made in 1994. Metroid fans have gone 8 YEARS without another Metroid game, and now they get it. And it was worth the wait. Metroid Prime is very well done. In their update to the New Era, many games, mostly side-scrollers like Mario or adventure games like The Legend of Zelda, took the \"Third-Person camera\" view, with the camera following behind the character. However, ruling that a 3rd Person shooting game (not adventure, it's SHOOTING!) would be kind of annoying, the Metroid Prime design team decided to make it a First-Person shooter. And by golly, it worked.One of the main differences between this game and other First-Person Shooters is that Metroid Prime has only four types of beam weapons, along with missiles. Most other FPSs have a huge arsenal of weapons, ranging from basic pistols to shotguns to Hi-Tech lasers to guided rocket launchers. Not this game. A basic blaster, an electric wave beam, an ice beam, and a plasma beam are all you get. And even though there are only five types of weapon, this game is anything but boring. Along with the four beam guns, you also get four visors: A basic \"Combat Visor\", a \"Scan Visor\", a heat-tracking \"Thermal Visor\", and an \"X-Ray Visor\". The Combat Visor is just the normal interface, seeing the world without special goggles. It does, like all the other visors, feature a Heads Up Display, showing health, missiles and a special Danger Level monitor, which goes up when you are near hazards like lava or poison gas.The Scan Visor, the only visor where you cannot shoot, serves another useful purpose: scanning objects and enemies. When you scan an enemy, the scan reveals the weak spots of the creature, its environment, and its habits. You can also scan hieroglyphs on the wall to read Chozo Lore, you can scan parts of the environment to study plants, you can scan Space Pirate computers to learn about their evil operation, and you can scan power-ups and various stations to learn about them. At some points, scanning nearby objects gives hints on how to get by an area. There are five categories of scan-able items in your database: Creatures, Artifacts, Space Pirate information, Chozo Lore, and Research (powerups). If a scanned object fits into one of these categories, it is put into your database for later research. If you fill up a certain amount of a category, then you are rewarded with Image Galleries, which contains concept art, storyboards, and so on. The Scan Visor gives depth to an otherwise lonely game.The X-Ray and Thermal Visors both are good for their own reasons, such as seeing invisible objects and enemies, but if you are trying to look at something right in front of you, then certain qualities may make it kind of hard to see. Also, in certain areas, wearing the thermal visor isn't such a good idea (such as in Magmoor Caverns, an underground lava-lake).The graphics in this game are great. From the icy, frozen Sheegoth to the Flaming Magmoor, the creatures of this game are all very well done. Also, the First-Person effects are very well done, too. Go near an electric enemy and your screen becomes static-filled and hard to see through. If Samus is electrocuted or hit for a lot of damage, she puts her hand up to block the blast. Things like these remind you that the character of this game is a person, not just a thing with a gun.Also, the sound in this game is incredible. The music gives a good sense of place. For example, the music in the Chozo Ruins is mysterious and dark, while the music for the Lava-based Magmoor Caverns is thunderous and includes chanting and such. Certain little tunes, such as the one that plays when you find a major item, will be familiar to players of Super Smash Brothers and Melee (the item tune is what plays as Samus' victory song). The creatures in the game growl, roar, or shriek, depending on what it is. The beam guns all have different sounds. If the electric wave gun kills an enemy, electricity crackles all over the enemy's body, making \"zzap-zzap\" noises for a couple seconds. The attention to detail is immense.Samus has always been the first real heroine, but the kind where hero or heroine doesn't matter. You didn't know in the first couple games that Samus was a girl. At the end of one of the later games, Samus takes off her helmet and reveals her gender, as opposed to being a robot. Heck, in most games you wouldn't even know she was human! But in this game, you can tell she is a she. You can hear her voice when she is hit, and (this is a feature that adds a lot of realism), when she dies, she screams and the display flickers and goes out. Also, in parts like elevators, the camera shows Samus from the front, and then zooms in on her face. Yes, her face! Instead of just an opaque green faceplate, the faceplate is now transparent, so you can see her eyes, eyebrows and the outline of her head (kind of). This is a HUGE step forward in realism terms. And about her heroine-ness: She is an armored, tough girl with a gun. Her competitors (for example, Lara Croft) go around dangerous ruins in incredibly skimpy clothing. Heroine advantage: Samus, obviously. Good sense counts for a lot these days.Overall, this game earns an eight out of ten. Metroid Prime is good, but not perfect. The scariness of some scenes makes it not a good choice for some small children. However, if you are used to that kind of thing, this is a great game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2012"}

I started with FF I&II; for the gba and then III for the DS and then this one.  So my impressions/review comes from playing them in order for the first time without any comparisons to the later ones (IE: highly regarded VI and VII)I enjoyed this game, but unlike others I enjoyed Final Fantasy III for the DS more.The 3D visuals and cinematics are fantastic for the DS!!!  Music is good as always for a Final Fantasy title.  The story is good, and the movies and voice make it better.The gameplay lacks compared to FF III in my opinion.  The characters that you get are limitted to their 'job' unlike FF III.  You can't customize the characters nearly as much, other than the augment system which is okay in my opinion.  I enjoyed leveling up my FF III characters with the jobs I wanted them to have and configuring my party as I wished.  In FF IV, your party members have their specific jobs that go along with the story.  I enjoyed FF II Advance more than IV due to this limitted leveling up gameplay.I gave it a 3 star for fun due to the limited character development/customization (which is very important to me) and a 4 star overall due to the enhanced movies and my enjoyment of the Final Fantasy series overall (FF II & III were better in my opinion)I've been playing Dragon Quest IV lately, and I have enjoyed it's story and character development (story-wise not stat wise) more so than the FF series.FF IV is definitely worth picking up but waiting until it's cheaper is not a bad idea (it has a premium prices currently at 40 bucks new).One final note...I was able to 'trade' it straight up for DQIV on gametz dot com which made the premium price not as big of a deal.  I highly recommend that site for trading games with others rather than taking them to rip off trading places like gamestop...stepping down from my soap box now :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2008"}

It's like playing a Texas Chainsaw Massacre game instead of trying to avoid slow moving/mindless zombies that attack you when you get too close to them.In reality this game was fun, but it did get long & boring. The story seemed to diminish as you went along so it seemed like Capcom worked its hardest during the beginning. If you played RE-RE3 you would notice the differences easily. Code Veronica wasn't even that great of a game, but even i liked that game a bit more then this one. I never finished this game mostly due to the fact it just didn't seem like a regular RE game. No Umbrella corporation & Capcom seemed too quick to shut them down. Not only that instead of the games being fairly moderate in difficulty, this game seems impossible. I couldn't get past various points in the game without giving up & going to something else. Even with a strategy guide it seemed wayy to difficult. There is no auto aim but you do get a laser aim. Controls are a bit easier to understand though & reloading ammo is more realistic.. would have been cool if there were mindless zombies walking around but it seems that most people prefer action over strategy.I like this game, but it doesn't feel like a RE game & its not as scary as the older games were.

{"product_name":"B002I0HJG8","description":"","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"Amazing Game, Amazing MMO","reviewText":"Tera is an extremely enjoyable game. Level progression is paced well, the community, while not perfect (it's an online game after all!) seems quite supportive and nice. This is especially true as you continue to level up and group more, join a guild etc. Since an MMO is in many ways defined by its player base this is an important issue to note I feel.The artwork is not only beautiful and inventive, it is many times cute, sexy, scary and exciting. The building architecture in game is stunning - I simply cannot imagine how long it must have taken to make some of the levels, the castles, the cities. I think that some people may be put-off by the fact that, and it really is true, the female characters in game are extremely sexy, almost always in revealing armor outfits. This isn't for everyone, but I think that when you look at the rest of the game art design and direction, it's merely a part of a massive artistic undertaking, the goal of which is to make the game, in every element, as visual exciting, interesting, and engaging as possible. The game engine runs extremely smoothly, and the UI has a lot of customization, and works extremely well to allow standard menu selections, inventory management etc. even though the majority of the time there is a crosshair instead of a pointer - part of what makes Tera an immersive and stunning gaming experience.Aside from the artwork, the gameplay is exciting and interesting. While many fights may not be too terribly different than a click, lock and spam, game (such as World of Warcraft's combat mechanics) but I assure you, once you get to dungeon bosses, BAMs, and many of the more aggressive monsters in game (packs of lunging wolves, coordinated magic and melee attacks, intense PvP) you'll see how demanding, and fun, Tera's combat system is.The game feels polished, it runs smooth, there are tons of quests at every level that keep you engaged and moving from zone to zone and switching monster types. While leveling may not be the fastest thing in the world, especially past level 50 (who'd want that anyway? relish the experience!) I'd never classify it as a \"grind\" since you're engaged with quests that offer new armor and weapon rewards, continue the story, and move you around the game world (which is massive!).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2012"}

The Wii motion Plus when it came out was suppose to help fix the wii remotes sometimes unsteady reading of the Wii remote motion during gameplay but even than it really didn't seem that much of a vast improvement,  but with the PS3 move as you play the gladiatorial fights and archery or just playing ping pong reading the wrist movements and the location of the motion controller is vastly superior especially if you've just played a Wii game and start playing this a couple of hours later.  Setting up the motion controllers is also vastly easier than the Wii remotes just use the usb hookup when you turn on your console and motion controller than go to the accessory settings on the PS3 and you'll see the motion control calibration setup to begin and within a few seconds you're set to go.  It does seem a little more fun though if you have two motion controllers for some of the games on the Sports champion one,  notably the Gladiator and archery one for the most part but not truly necessary to play the games if you just want to have one or just only bought one.  So for the great price for this is it worth getting?,  I definitely say yes while some have called it a clone of the Nintendo Wii I feel it's vastly more than just that with all it's been able to do and the great enjoyment you're sure to get while playing with the PS3 move as well...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2010"}

I was hoping that it wouldn't be the sum total of the game, but it pretty much is.  Sure there is a paper thin story to explain why you are hoping and jumping all over the place, but at its heart this is just a 3d platforming game.  The thing about platformers that I don't like is they are just repetition until you get the sequence of moves and the timing down.  Figuring out how to jump over things just isn't that interesting to me.  & the same jumps and stuff you did at the very beginning are the same ones you're doing at the end.  And in between is the constant frustration of trying to figure out the game's physics and right combination of button presses to get your character from point a to point b, then from point b to point c, then from point c to point d, etc etc.So if you're into platformers, then give it a go.

I got Binary Domain free by being a member of Playstation Plus.  The game is only $12.95 as of this writing so it's dirt cheap to own.  I would never have paid $59.00 for this game new.  The game play is fun but the controls are buggy.  If you do not stand in the exact right at an objective place needed options will not appear and you get killed.  I do not mean within a zone of reason.  I mean needed options fade in and out with the slighest movement even after battle making the option almost impossible to engage.  Also the directions given by characters in furtherance of the story are downright cryptic.  Hey you come over her Go over there, like whatever.All in all the graphics are beautiful.  The futuristic Tokyo city has a realistic feel to it. The realistic city made playing the Binary Domains very nice.  Killing the robots was always fun.  The boss battles were just right in difficulty.  The team mates weree a very high string bunch that quickly got on your nerves.  The one thing Binary Domains was is FUN.  So many video games take themselves so seriously.  Binary Domain takes itself just seriously enough to have a nice tightly told story that held my interest.

A single player review","reviewText":"I just finished Dead Island.  I didn't know what to expect, especially with the sheer volume of zombie games we've seen in the past few years.  I never play multiplayer, as I don't often enjoy them, and as a middle aged guy, I can't keep up with the younger crowd who are way better than I am.  Like most here, I've played hundreds, if not 1000s of game, have a giant game library, and have been a PC gamer for decades (pretty much as long as there've been PCs and PC games I guess)Setting and levels: Most of the settings were ok, with the resort being my favorite by a long shot. The resort legitimately felt resort like, and had all the right sounds and visuals to make you believe you could be on vacation on a tropical island.  Parts of it reminded me of a blend of Far Cry and Far Cry 2 in a wierd way.  Personally, I didn't care for the sewers, as it was annoying and extremely repetitive.  The city of Moresby was ok, but had some annoying repetitive parts as well.  The jungle and Lab were ok though, as was the prison.  It did feel as though the developers started out to make an epic, and spent way too much time working on the resort section, that they took some short cuts, especially with the uber annoying sewers.Enemies:  Pretty decent actually.  Real zombie fun...  silly dead guys running after you all the time.  There are some tough boss-ish ones, namely the Rams, but even those can be killed.  The Thugs are quite amusing as they are tough to kill, but you can dismember them while they chase you as they are slow...  typical video game fare.Weapons:  This is not really a shooter.  Its a melee game, that has an occasional gun.  As you level up, you get even more interesting blades, mauls, knives, hammers, wrenches, etc.  Most are pretty decent, although there are plenty that have no additional value.  Like Borderlands, they seem to be randomly generated, which makes for a wide assortment.  However, there are only a few that have actual usefulness. Weapon mods are decent, as they are completely based on finding junk around the island to improvise with in order to improve the weapons.Gameplay:  Good and bad.  The basics of killing zombies is fun, especially when you can dismember them piece by piece.  This is a bit of a button smasher, but also requires timing to make it work well.  There is some confusion with the gameplay, as sometimes when the reticle turns red, you can actually wound a zombie, but other times you can't.  It made it somewhat frustrating, and even exhausting on occasion.  The health system is simply awful, as you need to drink energy drinks and energy bars all the time, just to keep going.  There are health packs, but they are far and few between during gameplay, and they can be bought here and there, but it is slow to apply.  I got used to getting killed while trying to heal.  The save system is so so, as there are no quicksaves, and the checkpoints are oddly spaced....  sometimes close, sometimes dreadfully far apart.  This was annoying, and I walked away from the game many times when the save system put me so far back in the game, that I just didn't want to go through it again.Dead Island is another mutant RGP type game, with leveling, character building, etc.  Personally, it was a bit confusing.  This was a VERY hard game to learn how to control well.  It was easy to play from the start, but it took quite some time to figure out how all the bits and pieces worked.  There was no real storage capability, save for one of the NPCs who's sometimes there and sometimes not.In conclusion, it was pretty clear that the folks who built this game liked Borderlands, Far Cry, Far Cry 2 and and Left 4 Dead.  The game is pretty successful, and I did enjoy it for the most part.  It was LONG, and I felt as though I definitely got my money's worth, and it even may have replay value for me.  I could see playing through again at some point in the future.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2012"}

When people were going crazy for street fighter, I was focusing on Final Fantasy or Dragon Warrior. So, Fighters have never had a spot in my gaming library. I picked this game up on a lark, and because there's not a whole lot of choices right now on the PS4. I didn't expect to enjoy the game, just tool around with it a bit and go back to playing Killzone, however I found myself quickly hooked on this game!It's made by the same folks who did the Mortal Kombat games(And in fact has 1 MK character in it..Scorpion), so you know the game is polished. The graphics are absolutely incredible and will make your eyes melt with pleasure!So, what's so great about this game? Too much to list, but I will try and list a few! Most charactered have several different costume options/skins, so you can wear a classic superman outfit, or superman from the current movie costume. You can wear a classic batman outfit, or his outfit from Arkham city, You can be Classic Green Arrow, or &#34;The Hood&#34;/Arrow from the series. There are a lot of costumes.Also, the arenas are interactive, and will become damaged as you have your superbrawl. you can also interact with items around the arena. There's not TOO many arenas, but enough to give you a variety of choices. I hope more arenas get released as DLC.The best thing though, is the story mode. Now, I am not a big fan of fighters, so I am not sure if it's common or not, but this game has a full featured campaign mode, which is basically cutscenes connecting to a pre-determined arena battle. It's an enjoyable story as well, and I couldn't stop playing.Once the campaign is done, the funs not over though, since there's STARS Missions, Multiplayer Arenas and Single player arena battles(Which should just basically be practice for multiplayer mode).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

Both protagonists wield an ancient sword, the Soul Reaver - Kain's is the physical body of the sword, while Raziel is fused to the spectral essence of the mighty blade.  The time sorceror Mobius has cast both vampires back into the past, to the roots of Nosgoth's history, and it is here that we pick up the latest chapter.Soul Reaver is a 3D action adventure in which players alternately assume the roles of Raziel and Kain.  Each character is unique in that Kain requires blood to keep his health up, while Raziel, a spectral vampire, requires souls.  To this end each vampire has a unique repetoir of combat and finishing moves to dish out on enemies, such as Kain sinking his fangs in his dizzied victim's throat.  In addition, both characters are able deploy complex sword combos, as well as magical powers in combat - one that looks particularly satisfying is the ability to telekenetically pick up and hurl opponents off of cliffs, or into nearby spikes, impaling them.  Indeed, much of the focus for this game is an overhauled combat system, and the player will often find themselves attacked by multiple foes.In keeping with the traditions of the series, there will also be plenty of mind-bending puzzles to deal with.  Raziel is capable of shifting between the living and spectral worlds, and in each environment is able to achieve different things to solve a puzzle.  For example, while Raziel cannot pick up objects in the spirit world, he can warp through gates and other thin obstacles, or jump to otherwise inaccessable areas.  This gives the game a fantastic degree of scope and depth to 3D problem solving.The graphics for the series are top notch, and its one of the first series of games to do away with loading screens - clever coding allows the game to load upcoming environments before you reach them, allowing a seamless transition through the vast land of Nosgoth.  The world is realised in beautiful, lovingly crafted architecture, spooky, mist filled forests and flickering caves.  The spectral world, which Raziel is tied to is rendered in eerie blues and greens, and there's a lot of excellent lighting throughout.  Its one of the most atmospheric games you'll play this year.One of the chief critisisms levelled at the last game, Soul Reaver 2, is that it was too wordy and complex a plot, with not enough action and exploring.  This latest title seems to have addressed those concerns by upping the action in spades, while staying true to the devious twists and turns of the series.  This should be on every fan's wish list, and I'd recommend it to anyone in search of an offbeat and spooky adventure game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2003"}

I have playedMedal of Honor Allied Assault Deluxe(MOHAA),Call of Duty: Game of the Year Edition(COD), andBrothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30(BIA).Positives: Graphics are top notch and realistic. MOHPA improves all of the areas that were lacking in MOHAA. You can pick up any type of weapon in the game including the enemy's, Japanese ammunition only works in the Japanese weapons, you have full range of movement (crouch and prone), ability to use aim with any weapon. The teammate AI is greatly improved over MOHAA. Your teammates are useful and necessary part of the game to complete tough missions. There was added feature where one of your teammates is a corpsman and can heal you and your teammates. The enemy AI is also much improved on higher difficulty levels. They use team assault techniques and effective flanking tactics. Basically, MOHPA brings all of the game play features that COD brought to the table.Weaknesses: The main reason I gave this game lower marks is the campaign missions. I really did not like a lot of them. The Pearl Harbor scenarios were a drag and boring. It would have been better to just show a movie for Pearl Harbor scenario. The flying mission was irritating. If I wanted a flight simulator, I would buy one. The controls were horrible and unrealistic and I also could not destroy the Japanese carrier after hitting it with 4 bombs and a torpedo. Most of the rest of the missions were jungle patrols and capture the huts. These missions reminded me more of Vietnam than WWII. The real complaint with these missions was that the play field was so limited that you could not use flanking. Most of vehicle missions seems poorly setup. It really didn't matter if you did anything in several of the missions; they still had the same outcome.While the teammate AI was improved, the teammate controls were limited. BIA has vastly better teammate controls which allows you to move them in certain directions and put fire on specific targets. Also while I liked the corpsman feature, basically he would heal your teammates indefinitely. Your teammates cannot die and he can even heal himself from deaths door. Very unrealistic. Basically they used this to offset the overwhelming odds you were usually fighting in.Summary: If you have waited this long to buy the game your computer should be able to handle the hearty system requirements. MOHPA gets A+ for graphics realism, but falls short of realistic campaign missions. Loading times are also extremely long even for high powered modern machines. If you really want to experience the Pacific theatre of WWII, you may want to get this game. Otherwise, you likely won't find much enjoyment here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2009"}

Read on if you want to find out why.Folklore's style is absolutely fantastic.  This is the type of game that Neil Gaiman would envision on one of his really, really good days.  The environments are colorful and dream-like, just filled to the absolute brim with wonder.  I spent a good ten minutes early on wandering around an empty field just watching all sorts of sparkles and colors flow around the world.This charming world frames a dark story about a girl named Ellen who lost her mother as a small child.  As the game begins, she receives an obviously surprising letter from her long dead mother - asking her to come to a small village named Doolin.  At the same time a dude named Keats, who works at a magazine that covers the paranormal, receives a phone call from a woman rambling on about magic and Doolin Village.  Keats decides to go check things out, hoping to land a scoop.The two characters above both arrive safely in Doolin and some serious stuff starts to go down.  The story is told through a variety of techniques, from traditional RPG fare like cutscenes and character models trading text boxes back and forth to something a bit more progressive - a sort of animated comic book feel with frames and speech bubbles.  This technique works very well and definitely keeps the storytelling feeling fresh.The bulk of the gameplay revolves around battling weird monsters, the Folk.  As you progress through the game Folk, you are able to rip out the Id (soul) of a wounded Folk in order to gain their powers.  This is how you unlock abilities and become more powerful as the game moves along.  Each Folk has a few different powers available, ranging from various attacks and shields to combo extensions and status bonuses.Early on in the game you run into a Folk named Pouke, and absorbing his Id allows you to summon Pouke and perform a basic attack.  Absorb five or ten more Pouke Ids and you'll increase the number of attacks in your basic combo.  You'll also find a weird Folk named Henky, who flies around shooting bubbles.  Absorb his Id and you'll be able to fire off bubbles to take down enemies up in the air.  Give Henky five Pine Nuts, and you'll 'level up' your mastery of the Henky Folk and reduce the MP consumption.  Some Folk abilities require you to provide items, some require you to defeat a specific Folk with another specific Folk, and so on down the line.Once you gain a bunch of Folk abilities, you're able to mix and match as you see fit and assign each one to a button on the controller.  This allows you to customize your Folk Id repertoire and design an arsenal that fits your style.  It's a lot of fun to determine the weak points of new enemies and figure out the best way to defeat them.  It's very satisfying to win a battle after busting out three or four completely different abilities.  Visually the combat looks great and gives you plenty of sweet effects to keep your interest - the only bummer is that the framerate occasionally reaches the 'starting to get painful' level.Based on everything I've said thus far, Folklore sounds totally badass doesn't it?  Sure it does, and this is what makes it such a disappointing game.  As I mentioned above, there are two main characters: Keats and Ellen.  They aren't just main characters, they are both playable characters - which is the beginning of the problem.The game is divided up into a number of different chapters.  Let's say that you play and complete chapter one with Keats - you do not have the option of playing chapter two with Ellen.  In order to play chapter two with Ellen, you need to go back and replay chapter one with her first.  There are minor differences in the how the same chapters plays out with two different characters (different Folk abilities, some different items and abilities, different views of the storyline), but in practice things are very much the same.After figuring out how things worked, I decided that playing every level through twice in a row is for suckers - I chose Ellen and decided to play through the entire game as her.  Maybe I'd miss part of the story, but hey, that's how things go.  If I ever decide to pick up the game and play it again in five years I'll play as Keats and get a different view on things.Everything was going according to plan until I hit a chapter and realized that I needed Keats to be up to the same level as Emily in order to continue with the game.  This meant putting on the breaks and replaying the entire games with Keats.  The idea of stopping at (or towards) the climax of a game in order to replay the entire thing took all of the wind out of Folklore's sails for me.  I guess this was a way to turn a six hour game into a twelve hour game?  I don't really know, but it turned an awesome gaming experience for me into a terrible one.  As much as I got out of the game, I just never went back to it.  I just don't have enough time to play video games these days, and I definitely don't want to spend that time replaying something that I just played.  What a bummer.With all of that being said, I can't wait for Folklore 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B006P5RW3M","description":"","reviewerName":"C. Weaver","summary":"This One Grabs You...","reviewText":"I got both this game and The witcher both at the same time. I spent a bit of time iinstalling them and downloading and installing the patches without problems. (I like the automated patch downloads and installs from the Witcher Launcher menu. It make getting the updates much easier.) Anyway, since I run Win 7 32-bit on a P4 3.0 gig CPU, 4 gigs RAM, HIS HD-4670 I gig video memory, I wondered if I'd have any problems running this game. I shouldn't have worried. The game ran right off the bat after being completely updated.The first thing I noted was the ease of use of the my X360 gamepad. You have to change the controls to the gamepad as it's set up for KB/Mouse as a default but this was not a problem. After getting that set up, I played thru the tutorial and the only place where I really had trouble was when you have to go deep into the menus to select an item. Must of this depends on selecting the RT button and then moving the L stick to select what you want. This proved to be a bit hard at times as the selections of items to get are controlled by the Left stick and it can take a bit to get it to stay on an item.  These things could really give you a problem in combat and you want to use a potion, etc. I got somewhat adjusted to get after a bit. Graphic are great, even on my system, and they seem smooth with not stuttering. Sound was good too. I like the way the story was told and how you can easily move around. I found myself liking the game even as I struggled with the menu items on the gamepad. I was well able to get into the action and story without having to many things get in my way.  I didn't realize I have spent 2 hours in the game till I happened to glance up at the clock! This game is well worth getting. I really good buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2014"}

It's not perfect though, the system runs very hot, and has an extreme heat output, so make sure it has PLENTY of room around it to better circulate the air. The systems new, so I have no idea how well it is going to be able to manage that kind of heat output. To be fair, high amount of heat was expected due to the sheer power of the system.I also don't like that the power and eject buttons are so tiny! They are hard to see, and it took me a good 4 minutes just to figure out how to turn the thing on. Once it was on, and I began playing games, I noticed some games discs run louder than others(CoD:Ghosts runs almost silently, Battlefield 4 sounds a bit noisy)Next, the control while very similar to previous dual shock controllers, is still very different feeling. It just doesn't have the same feel as it rests in my palm. I'm also not completely fond of the &#34;Options&#34; and &#34;Share&#34; buttons positioning. It's awkward to get to, and to click on, at least for me and my fat fingers.However, even aside from the flaws, it's an exceptional system and currently my favorite console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2013"}

The year is 2035 and Soma Cruz is about to witness the first solar eclipse of the 21st century when he suddenly blacks out - only to awaken inside a mysterious castle. As Soma, you must navigate the castle's labyrinths while confronting perilous monsters at every turn. But beware, you must escape before evil consumes you!Collect the souls of enemies to learn their abilitiesExchange souls with your friends using the Game Link CableCollect and wield multiple weapons - each with their own attacksStunning animated characters and huge monsters intensify the action","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"The third Castlevania game for the GBA","reviewText":"Konami was on a roll with the Castlevania games for the Game Boy Advance. With Circle of the Moon and Harmony of Dissonance each having good reviews and sold well, they decided to make the third game for the GBA. Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow came out in 2003 and was the last Castlevania game to be released for that system. It balanced the best qualities of the first two games, mixed with the story of the third game, making it a winning combination for gamers.Set in the year 2035 (the first for a Castlevania game), you control Soma Cruz, a man who witnesses a solar eclipse with some of his friends. Then, he passes out and wakes up to the realization that he is inside a strange castle. Not knowing why he is there or how he got there to begin with, he sets out to find out these answers. It's a new game so that means a new castle, new and familiar enemies greet you inside, multiple weapons and items are waiting for you to collect and the rpg-ish system returns to help you level up your character. New to this game is the ability to collect souls from fallen enemies. These souls give you unique abilities; some help you maneuver around the castle, some help you inflict more damage to enemies and some rare ones help you unlock secret areas. There are over 100 souls to collect so doing that alone will keep you busy. Saving your progress is not a problem once you find and use any of the save rooms scattered throughout the castle.The PROS: Everything in this game mixes well. Addressing the music issue with the last game and featuring great graphics that surpasses both titles before this one, Aria of Sorrow is the best Castlevania game to hit the GBA. The game play is both new and familiar to fans of 2D Castlevania games so you will have no problems exploring the new castle and getting used to how it plays and controls. It will keep you busy for a long while and as always, beating the game will unlock bonus modes as well as a new playable character.The CONS: None.Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow ends the trilogy of games released for the Game Boy Advance. I recommend this game for Castlevania fans and anyone that is thinking of playing a Castlevania game. This game, like the previous ones, is kind of tricky to find so grab a copy when you see the opportunity. The series would once again continue on the Nintendo DS so grab those games too if you like Aria of Sorrow.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001D7T2XK","reviewerName":"Jim \"Pimmy\"","summary":"It should have juts played like the Smackdown games!","reviewText":"I'm sad to say that Legends of WrestleMania just doesn't have a lot going for it. There's too many buttons to memorize even to do basic moves. The controls on the Smackdown games were much easier. Some of the roster choices don't even make sense either. I mean Michael Hayes didn't even appear in the WWE until he retired as a wrestler. While Arn Anderson was at a WM but with Tully Blanchard in a team called the Brainbusters but Blanchard isn't in it. So it hardly makes sense that Arn is even though I was a fan of his.It would have made sense if Randy Savage and Ricky Steamboat were included instead since their WM 3 match is considered a classic. It's babyish though that Savage wasn't included just because Vince doesn't like him. While I have no idea why Steamboat was left out. I was looking forward to having take on Flair and Rick Rude.But it's not like it's fun reliving feuds anyway. I still at least thought I'd have fun playing as the people that are in the game. That's not the case though. The game feels rushed. I admit that the recent Smackdown games have had their share of flaws but this game has a lot more. It bugged me in the Smackdown games how the big guys can be man handled. This game is like that too. It's also very hard to kick out once an opponent goes for a pin. It's basically over the first time they go for one. I should also mention one of the biggest flaws. In create mode where you give the wrestlers moves, the special moves are all under false names.  Basic moves like HHH's flying knee to the face are under finisher names, like that knee is called the Pedigree under special. While the Rock's punch to the face is called the People's Elbow. That just proves my point that this game was rushed.Sadly the game is about as fun as the Legend of Wrestling games that were released a few years back and that's not a good thing. I wouldn't mind a 2nd game to get the bad taste out of my mouth. That is if they put more of an effort into it. It should control like Smackdown vs Raw, be hard to lift the big guys or cause damage to them and not leave out Legends that Vince doesn't like! But hell, to get the bad taste out my mouth, I think they need to have the option for players to add the roster from this game to the next Smackdown vs Raw! That would be cool and would put the roster on this game to good use at least.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2009"}

If you want to check my review of the game itself, do so in the standart Halo 2 game page.Anyways, if you became a fan of the first game, I'm sure you bought this Special Edition. For extra five bucks, you could get a beautiful metal case and a Bonus DVD.The metal case is indeed beautiful, I would say it's the most beautiful cover for any game in history. The logo in front and Master Chief in the back, couldn't be better. It's also better than usual DVD cases.The bonus DVD will provide you atleast 2+ hours of fun. They say you shoulnd't watch the DVD before beating the game, but I disagree. The Halo 2 making-of makes the game look even greater. Watching these guys work in the game for years, nights without sleep, months without seeing the sunlight, it makes the game very special to think behind every single pixel in there, someone worked very hard to make it top notch. It's basically everything you wanted to know about the game. You can also check out a featurette about the multiplayer/Xbox Live experience, a very fun audio test and some other featurettes showing what they couldn't include in the game, what had to be cut out.Overall, gamers, this is one of the best game I've played in years, undoubtedly the best of 2004.

{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"MAL","summary":"Metroid Prime Asylum","reviewText":"Ok, so Metroid Prime Asylum does not have the same ring to it as Metroidvania but this game is to the Metroid Prime series as any 2D Castlevania game is to 2D Metroid games after Symphony of the Night.  Most of the time while playing this game, with the exception of the stealthy elements and third person perspective, I felt like I was playing a Metroid game, which was fine by me.  There is tons of backtracking where areas only become available after obtaining a particular item and there was a need for constantly scanning the environment like in the Metroid Prime games.  Loading times are cleverly disguised with with slow opening doors such as in the Prime series.This might possibly be the best Batman/Superhero game.  Batman Arkham Asylum is a must buy if you grew up a fan of Batman: The Animated Series, it features the same writer and voice actors from the 90's tv series.  Would not recommend it for a younger audience due to the strong language and violence in the game.Batman Arkham Asylum is a solid game that I loved playing but there were a few issues that kept if from being a great game.  The 2D map in this 3D game with multiple levels and corridors was frustrating at times, this is one aspect that I wished would have been borrowed from the Metroid Prime series; partly due to this, you will end up playing the entire game in Detective Mode which makes you look at Arkham through florescent x-ray goggles.  The other major complaint about the game is the receptive uninspired boss battles.  Most of the boss battles consist of a super villain perched up out of reach directing a bunch of henchman at you, I hope this changes in the upcoming sequel, Batman: Arkham City.A few technical gripes about the game: the saved data in this and the newer Game of the Year version are incompatible.  I replaced my Xbox 360 with the newer slim version and my Xbox 360 has trouble reading this game making the disc spin faster which causes a loud rattling sound; I contact Microsoft about this and they said it was normal.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"You're Batman!!!","reviewText":"The GOOD news:  This game actually makes you feel like you really are Batman.The BAD news:  You're Batman on the worst possible day... ever!Concept: 10/10Batman becomes trapped in Arkham Asylum with his worst enemies and an army of criminally insane psychopaths.To borrow a line from Rorschach, \"He's not trapped in there with them.  They're trapped in there with him!\"Story:  10/10The story was written by Paul Dini, who worked on Batman the Animated Series.  It's a perfect blend of creepy moments, dark humor, and a complex plot.  Most of the voice actors from the animated series are in this game and they're all great.  This could be the best portrayal of Batman and his enemies... EVER!  This is a Batman fan's dream.Gameplay:  9/10All three types of gameplay really make you feel like you're the Dark Knight himself!Free Flowing Fist Fighting Combat against hordes of enemies:  The hand to hand combat is really smooth and fast.  You get an attack button, a dodge, and a parry.  You're usually surrounded by bad guys and you can attack them in any direction.  Just point and press attack and Batman will pick the best attack that fits the moment.  If an enemy is far away, Batman will leap at him, if an enemy is behind you, Batman delivers a spinning back kick right across the jaw.  It's fast and really smooth.  When an enemy is about to attack, you can intercept the attack with a generously timed parry and automatically counter.  Some attacks need to be dodged and Batman can dive out of the way.  Later on, you can unlock special moves like a throw and a takedown.  The good news is that you don't get a ridiculous list of XXYYXYYBAXXY combos to memorize like many other action games.  However, the combat is on the simple side, so if you're really into games that challenge you (Ninja Gaiden), this might seem too easy, even on the harder difficulties.  Once you start taking down 10 thugs at at time you really feel like Batman!Stealth Combat:  Batman uses gadgets and stealth to take out armed enemies.  At any time, Batman can use X-Ray vision to see through walls and track the enemies.  You can take them out in a number of ways.  Sneak up behind them and choke them out, dive down from above and snatch them, use exploding gel or batarangs to stun them.  The stealth combat is really fun.  In these situations, you're usually trapped in a room with a set number of armed guards.  If one sees you, he alerts the others and they all start firing.  You can escape by using a grappling hook or the environment to quickly get away from them.  This isn't an over punishing game like Metal Gear where one guy sees you and an infinite number of guys rush you.  You just have to take out the maniacs in the room with you.  Batman's gadgets, the environments, and the enemies all fit together nicely like a puzzle.  When you're taking out enemies, you feel stealthy and clever... like Batman!Exploration:  Throught Arkham, the Riddler has hidden clues and you can explore the areas to find them.  You get hints and maps to help you out.  I've never been a fan of collecting items in games, but works really well in Arkham Asylum.  Collect items to unlock Stealth or Combat Challenge Maps in the Challenge Mode, Trophies, and Detailed Information Cards of all of the characters in the Batman Universe!  This could be the most rewarding collection system of all time.  And if you know your Batman Trivia, the Riddles are easy to solve.  Finding collectibles and using the environment to take out your enemies, really makes you feel clever... like Batman!Graphics:  9/10This isn't the best looking game of all time, but everything that needs to look great, looks great.  Arkham Asylum is perfectly creepy.  Batman looks better than ever and the villains are actually scary.Sound:  9/10The dialogue, sound effects, and music bring the adventure to life.  At times it feels exciting, suspenseful, and epic.  All great stuff.Replay Value:  6/10There isn't much replay value in Batman, aside from the game is so fun, you'll probably play it twice.  There are some optional challenge modes where you can practice your combat and stealth for medals.  But other than that, there isn't much.  The game is about 12-15 hours long, depending on how much you search for the Riddler's clues.Maturity:The game is rated T for Teen.  There're fist fights and bad guys shoot at Batman, but it's not overly violent by any means.  There's no foul language.  The only warning is that the game is much scarier than the Animated Series and kids 10 and under might have nightmares of the Killer Croc under their bed or the Joker in their closet.  If you're a teenager, you'll probably dream about Harley Quinn in your bed and Poison Ivy in your shower because they're... sexy!Overall:  9.5/10If you want to feel like Batman, this is it!  You're a crime fighting, intelligent, detective, with amazing gadgets.  The creepy atmosphere grabs you the second you power up the game and keeps you enthralled until you finish it.  The story, atmosphere, and gameplay all work together to make you feel like you're Batman!Buy it if you love Batman, especially Batman the Animated Series.  This is a contender for Action Game of the Year, and proudly deserves to sit on the shelf of any serious gamer.Rent it if you think you have 12 hours to finish it, you're not into collectibles, or you like games with really difficult and complex combat systems.Avoid it if you prefer the Joel Schumacher Batman Movie, or you prefer open world games like Prototype or GTA.  This game would be too gothic for you.If you love this game, you should also play Bioshock!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2009"}

I didn't have a PSP, this game came out, I bought a PSP to play it, I am extremely happy with my decision.

{"product_name":"B00000IFRI","reviewerName":"ajnrules \"ajnrules\"","summary":"The Best Game of 1999!","reviewText":"Yeah. So the story is very weak. Things are often like that for multiplayer-centered games. At least Mario Party had actually TRIED to spice things up with a story. Where's the story for Super Smash Bros.? Where's the story for Mario Kart 64? I didn't think so. As weak as the Mario Party story is, the story isn't important for a game...the gameplay is. Some games with great stories have fallen flat because of poor gameplay. Other games with NO story succeed with great gameplay. Mario Party is definitely in the latter category. You can hate the Mario Party series for its excellent \"Land Before Time\" impression. You can be among the groups of people that prefer Mario Party 2 and Mario Party 3. Yet there is one thing that you must admit. Mario Party was DARNED fun back in 1999! Sure, people said to NEVER play with one person, but playing all four characters as one person can be a blast as well.Anticipation may have been the first board-game video game for Nintendo, but it wasn't exactly successful, and had relatively primative gameplay. So people now associate Mario Party with the introduction of board-game video game, and it's definitely more like a board game than any other game before it. I mean, you \"roll a dice\" and move around the board encountering various pitfalls and experiencing different events. Although most of the boards are well-designed, I have realized that the majority of the \"board-game\" aspect is text or movement, and somebody watching a tape with only footage the \"board-game\" aspect would likely get very bored very fast. But what makes Mario Party the gem that it is are...the mini-games! Yes, Mario Party has 56 mini games to entertain all souls from all walks of life. Sure, not all mini-games are perfect, but you know what? Even with all of the blisters, broken glasses, and white powder appearing on the N64 controller, the mini-games are still worth it! Especially Mushroom Mix-Up and Running of the Bulb. Oh yeah. Those are great games. Mushroom Mix-Up provided tons of frantic fun and Running of the Bulb was hectic but exciting. 4-player teamwork games really need to make a comeback.Being a title developed by a third party (yes, Hudson is a 3rd party developer), the graphics in Mario Party are not exactly polished. Most of the textures are just simple polygons. And as was stated, the water is in the Bombs Away game is extremely pixelated. These graphics are not the ones that are so grand that you can't help but go \"Uah,\" but why bother with visual aesthetics when the game is already filled with gameplay finesse. At least the graphics don't hurt your eyes. I can't say that about a game that game out 3-4 months after Mario Party...I'm sure you all know what it is. Sound. Sound effects are amusing, but not exactly something special. Voice acting is good, but I finally found out (after five years) that much of the voice samples were lifted directly from the Japanese version of Mario Kart 64. The music? It is fantastic! There's a hint of Super Mario Bros. mixed in with the rest. It's great to listen to, even if it is all just MIDIs. Okay, a lot of this is probably due to nostalgia. I can write a paper on nostalgia and Mario Party, but I'll leave it at this. The bottom line is, even though Mario Party isn't one of the technologically advanced games on the N64, it sure makes up for it with its incredible gameplay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2004"}

However, over time I told myself, how I must have been mistaken. How could the game be as bad as I remember it, when everyone in the gaming community loved this game to pieces! Clearly, I was mistaken! Years have passed, and I never broke it out again, until now!First, let me just say, that for an early PS2 game release, the graphics are astounding! It&#8217;s has lens flares, and isn&#8217;t even very choppy, which is unusual for a PS2 game as well. Overall, in terms of graphics, this game was incredible! True, the models weren&#8217;t that great, but they were passable.The sound was great! How could it not be? Tobey Maguire and Willem Dafoe lend their voice talents to the game, to help give it that authentic spidey movie feel. Then, as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, they tossed in Bruce Campbell as the Narrator/tour guide, just to bump the game up to cult status. The music and sound effects were brilliant, and quite realistic. However, it was slightly dated, but again, I can&#8217;t stress this enough: It&#8217;s from the PS2 and is 10 years old!That was the good stuff.The controls were just as bad as I remember. I mean horrible! However, it should be noted, that most games released during that video game era had horrible controls. Still, this is worse than most of those. It could have been a much smoother experience, especially since the PS2 controller is virtually identical to the PS3 controller. I see no reason, why they couldn&#8217;t take the time to make a smooth control scheme like games have today!In terms of difficulty, it wasn&#8217;t as hard as I remember it being, however the game is by no means a cakewalk. It is difficult, and at time frustratingly so, although I feel a lot of that has to do with the controls. I can&#8217;t begin to tell you how many times I would find myself stuck to a wall, clinging there, while being shot at.Still, the game has some level of fun factor, especially if you are an avid spidey fan, and with the new spider-man reboot being out, it might be fun to flash back to the original.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2013"}

I could go into more detail but I would just end up rambling and possibly spoiling it for others. What everyone must know is that this is a great game for Pikmin fans or newcomers like me.Some people have complained about its length and I do agree it could have been longer, but it is a very high quality game and experience so I can forgive that fact.

Ultimately I think it's a disappointment.  It took 6 years to come out with this when this game is >95% GT4.  It is frustrating to see so few premium cars, and the nice tuner cars in the used lot are 2004 or previous model year cars (aka GT4 cars).  That's one of the biggest letdowns, normally GT brings out some current model real nice tuner cars and supercars from the woodworks.  Not this time.  There's no Zenvo, Noble, or Koenigsegg which is wrong.  Many of the manufacturers or tuners in the game have 1 or 2 cars, which is disappointing.  The graphics are sometimes great in this game, and sometimes terrible.  It depends on the tracks and whether or not the cars are premium or not.  I don't regret getting this but I expected more, I expected something the level of GT3 A-Spec and got something that is just flat.  The 6 years off might have made GT a dead franchise, it will depend on what and to what extent the updates in GT5 do for the future of GT to make GT5 a better game because as is it is lacking.On the plus side the opening intro movie to GT5 is the coolest game intro I've ever seen.  The music might be the worst in the last few generations of game systems.  I installed the game but the load times take too long, but that's probably more a PS3 issue than GT's fault since most PS3 games take too long to load.It's nice to unlock things and make money in B-Spec, but B-Spec like most of this game has bad with the good.  They don't want you making loads of money so the B-Spec races are twice as many laps and therefore take twice as long.  You can issue your driver instructions, but you only have a minimal effect because your driver is more or less clueless.  Nothing like giving him a faster car with 100 or more HP than his rivals and watching him sit behind refusing to pass on tight tracks when you are non-stop ordering him to overtake the leaders.  He'll stay in his place because he's just driving the AI line like the other drivers.  Or he'll be half a lap ahead and spin out randomly.The AI drivers in this game it must be said are pitifully bad.  They have no concept of where you are, they just drive their driving line.  They will spin you out or push you off the track when you are passing them if their driving line dictates it is time for them to move over.  This is a big problem in the game as is (the AI drivers), and needs to be completely overhauled.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2010"}

I have two computers that are far above the minimum requirements for the game but I could not make the game work in one of them no matter how hard I tried. From my research online I guess this is a major issue with many people. I even had trouble with the installation itself (the now famous redundancy error).  I cannot accept that they released a game that doesn't even install correctly.Second the game itself.  It is an incredible step backwards from Sims 2.  We lose the load screens which indeed sucked, but we lose SO much more. The Sims very animation is poor, they always look a bit fat and their heads are too big (actually their faces are too big, their heads are ok). Those faces on the cover were generated on Photoshop, and no way they were a result from the game.The jobs and needs were actually improved, but they are implemented on a game that lacks all that which made the previous ones great. The Sims seem more stupid and reluctant to follow directions. The number of objects is really small and the expressions and body language are the same from Sims 2 but the difference in color and animation only serves to remind you of what you aren't playing.  The greater loses are with the female Sims they never look feminine at all. It is very strange.That and some crashes made me place the game back on the shelf.  In a couple of months I'm sure there will be a patch (or more...) that will reduce the crashes and the number of objects will larger with downloads.

To say there has been some hype surrounding this title would be an understatment. But even now that the game has been out for some time I still can not properly articulate what makes this game what it is. And what it is is great, the whimsy and feeling of the game captures everything that makes video gaming great. You can feel the infulences of every genere and major game title from Mario to Metal Gear Solid. The ability to create, customize and upgrade is simply amazing.Little Big Planet very much feels like a transition game, like the start of a new era. This is the beta of a new style of gaming. That isn't to say that the first person shooters, role playing games and the like will go away, they won't. But this game goes a long way to proof the concept that a game can be more than a collection of challenges or gun fights.I do not understand exactly who this game is designed to appeal too, since I've seen fans across the spectrum. From the hardcore gamer to the casual, everyone I have introduced to this game has loved it. It is easy to pick up and play but offers a huge amount of complexity and depth for those willing to commit the time. The variety and polish of some of the stages showing up online are amazing, and if they are any indication this game with be making waves for a long time to come.I think if you give Little Big Planet a chance you won't be disappointed. More so you may find that your concept of what a game is and what is possible may start to change. It is amazing when media of any sort can inspire that sort of change.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"One of the Best Games of the Year","reviewText":"Pros:+Nice art style+Intricately designed levels+Design and play your own levels+Great learning curve+Fantastic SoundtrackCons:-A couple of networking issuesTime and time again we've talked more about the potential of the PS3 than about the quality games on the system itself.  When we begin to talk about the PS3 years later, one game will stand out as being among the best in the library: Little Big Planet.  The platformer genre seems like a dying breed.  Little Big Planet makes platforming fun again.  It's a big expansive game that anyone can pick up and play.  Best of all, it can be customized in almost every way.In Little Big Planet you take control of a Sack Boy (or girl).  Little Big Planet doesn't have a story.  But it does have some very intricately designed levels.  Throughout each level you'll find yourself running and jumping and taking down enemies.  On occasion you'll control of vehicles and other contraptions, usually that must be done by taking hold of a switch and flipping it in one direction or another.  You'll also find yourself having to grab hold of other objects to get to your destination.  Each level is filled with complex puzzles and paths to go down.  As you go you'll be able to find items you can use to dress up your Sack Boy in, or to use in level creation.The main campaign isn't too long.  It'll keep you busy for probably 8-10 hours at best.  Just because you've completed the main story, however, doesn't mean it's over.  The biggest attraction to Little Big Planet is without a doubt its customization.  As mentioned earlier, you'll collect items throughout the main campaign that you can use to create your own levels.  What makes the level editor unique is that anything that was used within the game can be used in the level editor.  This gives creative minds a chance to really let go and do whatever they want.  Just the same, there are literally millions of levels put online by users already and even they are filled with other items you can use as well.  There are always new and exciting levels to play through and so there are so many ways to make them.  The main campaign will eventually grow old, but playing through newly created levels never does.Along with creating your own levels you can also customize your own Sack Boy by giving him different clothes to wear, different hair styles, facial hair etc.  The amount of customization is almost limitless.  Even more than that is what your Sack Boy can do.  You can make him smile laugh or frown and cry.  You can make him angry or worried.  You can even take control of his arms and flail them around.Another great thing about Little Big Planet is that you don't have to go at it alone.  Up to four people can play through Little Big Planet at a time and they can do it either locally or online.  It's really fun to let a bunch of friends customize their own Sack Boy.  Not to mention that when flailing your arms you can hit them.Little Big Planet isn't the most difficult game around, but it can give you trouble in certain areas.  Some of the user created levels can be brutal but during the main campaign, your mileage will vary.  Luckily, there are plenty of checkpoints scattered throughout each and ever level regardless of how long or short they are.  In some cases there may be too many checkpoints.  Sometimes you'll run by one only to run by a second one just a few short steps later--sometimes not even encountering a single enemy, pitfall or trap in between.  In spite of that, you may appreciate the number of checkpoints given the challenge of some of the games more intricate puzzles.Visually, Little Big Planet is unique.  It's a side-scroller at heart but it makes excellent use of the Playstation 3's capabilities.  Each and every level is vastly decorated.  The game also has a very unique art style.  There's also a lot of humor found within the game.  From the humble narrator who provides you with all the tutorials, to some of the games more unique level designs.  The physics are also very well done.Without a doubt, however, the best part of Little Big Planet's productions is the soundtrack.  It has some of the best music of any video game.  There are some incredibly catchy tunes here as well as some authentic sound effects.  Video games have rarely sounded this good.If there was any problem with Little Big Planet it would be that it has a couple of networking issues.  Some levels have so much in them that they lag while some people have experienced problems even just uploading, not to mention that some levels will be taken down without any warning from developers.In spite of the networking issues, Little Big Planet is an astonishingly original game.  Regardless of who you are, you've more than likely never played anything like it.  Every PS3 owner should, at the very least, give Little Big Planet a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}

{"product_name":"B001BX6JUA","reviewerName":"Lucas Black","summary":"Fantastic","reviewText":"Okay, I never played the original \"Guitar Hero\" that started this whole guitar peripheral band game thing.  But I played the second at friends' houses and borrowed it once.  Thought it was pretty great and lots of fun.  But the first I owned was Rock Band with Guitar Hero 3.  And Rock Band really did it for me.  The blaring colors of Guitar Hero were replaced by mellower tones that focused more on the music.  And rather than generic rockers you could make your own guy, which I had fun with.  What finally got me to quit playing it so much was... I started to run out of songs.  I still had some favorites I'd play: Welcome Home, Reptilia, The Hand That Feeds, Afterlife (downloaded), Black Hole Sun.  But other than that there wasn't much left to do.  Other than go through on the drums (boring) or five-star everything on Expert (not interested).And then here's Rock Band 2.  Basically it's the same thing, but without any of the problems from the first one.  There's new songs and quite a lot of them.  You can make all the characters in your band and play through tour mode with a single player.  Some album information is even given when selecting songs from the list.  And it's still the same great fake guitar playing I loved.But what really clinched Rock Band for me (and the Guitar Hero games as well) was that it opened up to me so much music...  So many artists that I'd heard of or had heard a few seconds' worth of songs from, but ones I never could give a chance.  A lot of good music is represented here, forcing me to expand my horizons and really get into some stuff I should have liked already.To sum it up, if you liked the original Rock Band or any of the Guitar Hero games, this is a given.  If you're new to the franchises, this is a fine place to start.(But you may want to use a Guitar Hero controller if possible.  The puff of the strummer on the Rock Band model doesn't have a very good return spring, so you kind of have to hammer it on those faster songs.  The Guitar Hero controller has a more noticeable click and a fast response so I prefer it.  Some people may think differently, however.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2009"}

I had initial doubts about yet another attempt at an Aliens VS predator game and was wondering if it could bring back the fond memories of the Jag version in next gen clothing. I have to admit, my fears of rubbish have disappeared. Aliens VS predator should please all fans of the series. I spent the most time with the Alien and Marine campaigns, didn't do much with Predator yet except for the initial training mission.Basically this is the best representation of the series I have ever seen in years. It feels like a 360 version of the original Aliens VS Predator on the Atari Jaguar. I'm SOOOO glad that Rebellion thankfully choose to keep the faith of the original films and forget about the recent movies in the last few years. The game is dark, very dark, especially on the marine missions. I didn't notice any real graphical hiccups like people have mentioned on the multiplayer. Terrific atmosphere, awesome weapons, incredible sound, and with the ability to play as a marine, Aliens and Predator, this game has serious replay value. I had the most trouble controlling the Alien. The marine was pretty straight forward and I really enjoyed the missions. The alien campaign was the most frustrating for me, The ability to walk on walls and ceilings at any given time will take some serious practice in perfecting your kills.(my only minor nitpick is the lack of any maps, the game relies on you basically following an arrow to your next checkpoint. Feels a bit linear, but overall it's not as bad as it seems on paper. I'd still like a map though, it's kind of easy to get disoriented, especially in pitch black environments)If anyone likes the movies and wants to play as an alien, Marine or Predator, Rebellion came through on the hype. Doesn't do anything jawdropping, but a good fun time for fans. Definitely consider this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2010"}

Archery isn't that great with two moves, my back hurted using two moves.All the other sports games are very accurate as well, the less fun is table tennis in my opion (this is just me), I prefer more Disk Golf and Bocce.The motion system as a whole is great, has great potential for hardcore games and for me, is a winner already.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}

It just didn't resonate with me the way the original did.  It's highly polished, gorgeous, and plays well.  Using your Nano Suit's powers can also be very satisfying in a lot of situations.  The story isn't anything to write home about, but it does what it sets out to do and keeps the ball rolling for the most part.  The game is what I would describe as \"openly linear\" meaning you can choose certain paths to take but you only get about a football field's worth of discretion in these decisions.  I had fun on my play through but, to be honest, by the end of the game I was more than ready for it to end.  I could see myself playing through the game again down the road, but I have no interest in doing that anytime soon.  I spent about ten hours in the multiplayer and wasn't really impressed.  You can have some fun there, but what I experienced was so-so considering the wide variety of games in this genre there are to choose from.  If you're interested I would recommend trying it, just don't expect to be blown away.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2012"}

I played Thief the Dark Project when it first came out and loved it.  It was my favorite first person shooter.  I thought of it like a game that changed everything.  It changed what I thought of as playing a thief in RPGs.  It changed the way I looked at first person shooters in general.  The story was simple too.  You were a thief and you bugled for a living and then one day you stumble on the house of a crazy evil wizard.  Your guild won't help you, the law won't help so you have to get rid of this guy and become the invisible hero of the city.  An unlikely hero and a guy who robbed a now dead evil wizard.Thief two was actually better.  Again you are the unlikely hero trying to take down a crazy priest that is obsessed with merging the mechanical and the flash using magic.  I will not spoil it because the story is just too good.Thief three you just kill a crazy witch.  It does not have a story as good as one or two but still felt like you were in the &#34;Thief&#34; world.(spoiler)This game looked amazing.  The trailer was so uplifting.  It promised so much.  I was so exited about this game I would have purchased a PS4 if it was only a PS4 game.  I'm giving this one star because I am hurt.  It is am emotional response because I have loved the franchise so much.  First off the game plays kinda like tomb raider.  The story is boring.  Garrot does not save the city.  Actually he fails.  Everyone is getting sick and some lunatic burns down half the city because you were obsessed with finding out what happened to your apprentice.  Ok fine Garrot failed, sometimes heroes fail but I think Garrot made some choices in this game the old Garrot would not have that led to the destruction of the city.  Believe it or not saving the city is not the main plot line of the game.  Screw the city!?!  You have to find out what happened to your apprentice who you thought was dead because so looked dead when she fell and died and stuff.  Anyway you find her and she is like a crazy energy ball boss who does not know what he is doing and she dies again the end.You loose the city, your apprentice and you have a lot of money but you can't even blow it on ale drinking yourself to death because the bar is burned down.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2014"}

Then no reviews were out and I was a little hesitant.  Then I read that Bethesda is in charge of when the reviews for their games come out and it was beyond the developer id's control and preordered it.These mad max style games are my favorite.  I read other reviews that said just another apocolyptic shooter and I think there haven't been that many.  I will take a sci fi shooter over a military one any day.  I feel those are the ones that seem to be out more.Anyway, before I got my copy I read a negative review in joystiq site and another one from a nobody review site.  I read some good ones too.Well I have been playing it about 3 nights with 2 hr sessions each night and so far the game is great.The visuals are the best I have seen so far.  I read some reviews that said they look good until you get close.  Well to me they look good far and close.The combat is frentic and fun.  I havent ever played a shooter this fast pased.  The enemies are very smart they go for cover, some rush you, they have patterns that zig and zag when they come at you instead of a straight line, they jump.  Great enemy ai.  I read some reviews that said the enemy ai was not good.  I think it's great.  Also runs at 60fps with no slow down!  And I got to some great bosses too!Also there are different ammo types and you can find recipes to make ammo and things.  Also the sound effects are great as well as the music.  The guns have a real weight to them.  So far these guns are the most fun to shoot of any shooter I have played so far.The cars.  I read some complaints about them being hard to control or not handleing well.  The cars are great they handle well, can go blazingly fast, you can shoot miniguns, and it is all very arcadey and easy to control and great fun.  Think more open world car controls like mercs2 or saints row 2 than borderlands.  Vehicles are much better than borderlands.I also read about the graphics being late to load while you are walking.  Kind of like all the images are not loaded as fast as you get to them.  I haven't seen any of that.  I have to tell you I havent seen one bug in the game yet.  This is probably the most polished game I have played right up there with red dead redemption.I also read where people complained about the missions being fetch quests.  Well the missions are great. In six hrs I have been to many different locations against many different gangs of enemies.  I haven't felt like any of the missions were boring or of little importance.  Especially compared to borderlands missions.  Also the towns and people you meet are great.  Best towns and npc's I have seen.Now I have a theory to why some people do not like this game.  It is hard.  I die and die a lot.  To me it is harder than borderlands which was pretty hard.Anyway, maybe some people just don't like the game.  Everybody likes different things, but if this looks good to you at least rent it because it is a great game to me and sometimes I feel when a game is getting a lot of exposure I think there are always people putting it down just to be different.Also nothing bad against borderlands I liked that game a lot too.  This game is totally different than that game though. This game is more like a military shooter but with a scifi apocolyptic setting.  I say that in part due to the ai style being smarter than the ai in borderlands that was relentless but not very hard to shoot at.Kevinupdate 10/21I have about 11hrs in now and am at the last town.  I still am enjoying the game.  I read where the game kind of losses steam towards the end.  So far this is not true.  The last few missions I had were very exciting.  Also each one took me about 2 hrs to get through.  I know this may vary, but I do not save on my own unless I keep getting killed at a certain spot.  To clarify the save system.  The game autosaves after each mission, but during the mission it will not.  But, you can manually save anytime.  I read complaints about this.  I like it because if you want to be hardcore and try to get through the mission without getting killed you can.  If you want to save every step you can and anywhere in between.Also read where you keep going back to old areas.  I haven't done any side missions so maybe those ones do, but so far in the story missions I have just visited one area 2x and it had different enemies and I think it looked a little different, if not it was so long since I first visited it did not seem that familiar.I still hold that the shooter aspects are very solid and the npc's you encounter are so cool, and the graphics are the best.Also I can't believe 1 star reviews here.  Maybe you cant accept my 5 star review, thats cool it's my opinion.  But a 1 star review would be for a broken game.  This game has had zero bugs so far and is very polished and solid.Kevin","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2011"}

Software after 15 years!","reviewText":"ok I was taken aback at the 8 GB install. after that I was blown away by the Extraordinary graphics. as I began to play it I noticed how Silky Smooth the FPS controls are! and well set up. no confusion here. I am thus far also amazed by the Lack of ANY Glitches so far. the game is just beautiful and the attention to detail is simply impressive. when you shoot an enemy in the arm he flails backward with the arm you shot. you can also shoot the weapons out of their hands and their helmets off lol.the driving portions of the game are Very Arcady. a little more loose then borderlands vehicles. the terrain deformation as you drive over it impresses me as well. again lots of love to the small details. no real lockpicking here (thankfully)Instead you use Lock Grinders to bore a hole through the lock (these Must be crafted) and then grab the goods. the FPS elements are spot on and again silky smooth in movements. the death/revival system is fun and a nice distraction though entirely unecessary. the ability to save game whenever you want is a pleasure to see (especally after the Dead Island Bugs) the game is truly a blast to play i.d. software has produced an excellent game considering being out of the biz for Fifteen Years!Congrats I.D.!Graphics: simply amazing. particle effects are unbelievable. 5 starsSound: Superb and Moody 5 starsGameplay: the wingstick is more a novelty I think but solid gun play overall 4 starsFun: 100% blast to play and I'd recommend it to everyone! 5 stars!Overall: a Very Solid FPS by the creators of the FPS gaming generation with Doom, Quake etc. 4 stars overallLast thoughts:I do love the game, that being said, I think it's cheap that people that buy it usedwill somehow have to Pay for the sewers (377MB worth of new area) that's free in a new copy. my advise, buy new. well that's the end of the review so buy it already!Other game modes Reviewed:CO-OP while this feature is ok and the unlocks are all for your car in MPit does wear thin after a few hours but is a nice cherry on top of this sunday! it's you and a buddy in alternate areas of the story. some hold a few surprises and they're fun other times it feels like a \"Hoard Mode\" and you do your best to survive.Multiplayer:people have mixed feelings on this. me I loved games like Car Wars and the sega game Outlander which has a lot in common with this buggy racer. you progress through glowing checkpoints all the while trying NOT to get shot to pieces. you can choose your vehicles weapons and there are several unlockable vehicles (one very mad max looking car I really Want!!)Afterthoughts: well I have played all the way through and it's too short.about 12 hours. I really wanted more but I guess I'm settling again. could have been a real winner. this would definately remove a star from the rating.still a fantastic shooter by I.D. Software!Buy Rage here new!

{"product_name":"B0050SX0UY","description":"","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"Soulful, Charming, and Utterly Delightful","reviewText":"As a Vita owner, it's been sometimes painful to stick up for the system.  Honestly, considering how dire the system seems at certain points, there are times where I hardly ever touch my Vita, perhaps even for months at a time.  Thankfully, the release of Tearaway is making sure my Vita will be used in the coming weeks. We are miles away from a library of classics for the Vita, but Tearaway is certainly a bright spot in the Vita library so far.  Media Molecule once again has struck something special, and this time it's for Vita owners.  If you had any passing interest in this game beforehand, Tearaway is absolutely worth playing.So what is Tearaway?  Built from the ground up, Tearaway takes advantage of the Vita's many unique capabilities (Rear Touch Pad, Camera, Touchscreen, Microphone, Gyroscope), warping them seamlessly into a truly unique platformer.  Throughout the game's single player mode, you'll use everything at your disposal to navigate through various worlds, alternatively platforming through a brilliantly realized world.  You play as one of two playable characters, off to deliver a message to the player outside of the game, YOU.  Yes, you are one of the stars of the game.  As you (literately) stare down on your messenger, you'll be defeating monsters, helping merge your world with Tearaway's own, creation and your imagination will constantly be on fire.  Rest assured, everything about this game makes it easily one of the best games for the Vita yet.This being a Media Molecule game, I'm pretty sure there is some about how the game succeeds on a visual and audio level, and it's amazingly successful.  True to its theme, Tearaway's paper theme comes into full fruition, as the game uses its theme to construct a brilliantly imaginative world that resembles a children's book come to life.  From the environments, the  to the beings that you come across; it's all heartfelt, and its all Really, you really need to look no further than what has been shown in the media; it's like what happens if the world's most creative elementary school art class was given the tools to create a world that spoke to them. it's a delight to behold, and it would take a hardened soul not to be charmed by it (even my mother loved it, and she hates most video games).Also being of excellent note is the entire universe Media Molecule has crafted with Tearaway.  There isn't much of a story like Littlebigplanet, but much like the aforementioned game there is a certain charm to the characters, locations, and overall mood and aesthetic of Tearaway.  With so many games trying to be \"gritty\", \"realistic\", \"mature\", or otherwise \"darker and edgy\", it's nice to see something as charming as this come along.  By the first ten minutes of the game, I was already in love with it.  Of course, rounding out the package is the great soundtrack, which helps bring the universe to life.  Sound effects follows suit, and the sound design is very effective and fits the game like a glove.Of course, the gameplay here is as much of a draw to the game as much as the imaginative aspects dreamed up by Media Molecule, and once again it's refreshing, imaginative, and quite ingenious.  True to its theme, Tearaway is a platformer that bases its mechanics around Paper itself, with another main gameplay motif being the way your universe is in touch with the universe of Tearaway.  With the use of regular controls and a myriad of special Vita features, you'll be guiding your character throughout the world, defeating monsters, helping friendly figures, and much more; all with some interesting and well implemented controls that take advantage of everything the Vita could offer control wise, even spilling over to the creative aspect of the game as well.  it doesn't run out of surprises or it never fails to keep you wondering what next will be revealed, and it never feel like a chore because everything around you is extremely engaging.Truth to be told, the game is pretty easy from start to finish, as it really isn't a game that provides a traditional gaming challenge.  Instead, I would say Tearaway's spirit lies in games like Journey, The Unfinished Swan, and others in the same vein;  the experience of the game and the player interaction is what truly makes it special. Tearaway's main draw is not much challenge and gameplay depth, but how it uses the Vita to essentially link the two universes together to make the already interesting single player even better.  Whenever one is engaging throughout the game with enemies, friends, kings, the environment, and anything else in between, the true appeal comes from extrapolating the experience yourself and essentially making everything feel as real as possible.  Few games I think of that have made me feel quite a bond between the game, and Tearaway is one of them.Tearaway truly does let you express yourself creatively, which alongside the sheer joy of playing the game is its true strength.  Depending on how artistic you are, you can collect confetti to unlock millions of unique little accessories, camera filters, and other such things to further provide a creative and unique way of manipulating the world so that you desire.  Even better, you can even bring your own works from the game into your own; print out models to construct your own craft-able items.  If you're so inclined and creative enough, you can probably even construct your own Tearaway world.  Rounding it out, the online component let's you share your own creations, as well as view what the community has chose to share as well.faceAll in all though, there is just too many little things that I noticed that made the game for me, not to mention that this is definitely one of those games where you need to I really do think this is one of the most refreshing and joyous games I've played since Journey.  Ultimately, I think that this game is so unique that you simply just need to try it yourself.  Rest assured, the experience is absolutely worth taking, and its refreshing from beginning to end.As a Vita owner, I can safely say that this game has made me all the more interested in my Vita.  For me personally, Tearaway easily is the best handheld game I've played all this year, and overall a big bolster for the Vita's overall library regardless of personal preference.  The Vita still needs a ton of work until it can be called a viable platform (sadly), but Tearaway assuredly is sending the Vita's library in the right direction; more developers need to follow suit and see what a talented developer can do with a system like the Vita.  Rest assured, if you were interested in this game and you own a Vita (both of those), pick it up.  You won't regret purchasing it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}

There seem some mixed opinions here but for me it was an awesome story. After waiting to see what would happen with Isaac next the anticipation was killing me, and I found to very satisfying to be playing him again and continuing this saga. And what a wrap up! The visuals were terrific as usual with this series and the morphs were horrifying to behold as usual. Relentless this time too, the morphs were just all the f*** over you! Made for some tense, scary moments. But the hold your breath and wait for it horror is there too, not just in your face horror. Hell, despite some differences I give this a 5 because at it's core it IS a D.S. game, feels like D.S. game, plays like one, and made me want to pee my pants like one. The game's handling is refined, better than the last 2 games. I barely even saw many small glitches, so given the fun time this game offers I feel confidient giving it this 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2013"}

This game says it offers co-op on the back panel, but there is a caveat.  It only offers co-op on Doom and Doom 2, NOT on Doom 3!Also, if you install the game to the Xbox 360 hard drive you'll find that it will not allow you to play Doom or Doom 2 unless you uninstall it.  What a huge pain in the butt!I'm barely past the first stage and I already want to trade this in.  At best this is a $20 game, definitely not worth $40.  While they have made significant improvements in the frame rate, they've done nothing to increase the polygon counts on anything.  Sadly this makes the game's age become overwhelmingly apparent.  So what if it's running at 1080p, it still looks crappy when you see a soda can which is made up of 8 total polygons!  Even the FMV sequences weren't rehashed for the higher resolution.  This means that even videos that should be obscenely crisp are actually greatly artifacted by poor compression.I did notice some issues with imagery being removed from Doom, but I don't care.  It still feels like the same game to be.  To be honest, after finding the lack of co-op in Doom 3, my friends and I spent more time playing the original Doom than anything, but I still don't feel good about how much I paid for this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}

This is (basically) a repackage of that with a bunch of extras and upgraded visuals (to some extent).You get doom 1, doom 2, and doom 3 with all (assumed) of the \"extended\" packs of play.  Doom 3 is upgraded visually and appears to be reworked to a degree (based on my memory); some things however don't appear to be upgraded (some of the graphics such as the information stations didn't receive a visual upgrade).  Altogether it looks very good and plays very well for a well aged game.  Some of the mechanics (especially on doom 1 and doom 2) seem very primitive but the gameplay is still there and most importantly authentic to the originals.Altogether, if you've played doom 3 and the expansion packs (I never did purchase those) this is great package for older \"shooter\" fans.  It plays as good as it looks (and it looks fantastic) and they've hit the sweet spot on the price (around 20 bucks or less).  Great package and doesn't require xbox live to play.

I've never tried crack but if it's addicting as everyone says, then Minecraft PS3 Edition is probably running a close race with it in the addiction department. It's near impossible to get my kids to stop playing it; only threats of hiding the PS3 work :) Usually this isn't my type of game because I don't care much for retro looking games, but prefer the big graphically sprawling mega-verses of RPG's and FPS's. However, once I started playing this with my kids I found out how addicting and fun it is. It's actually caused me to stay up late(way past bedtime) when I should have been sleeping.This game is challenging but in a fun way. By that, I mean it challenges your mind and more than likely(I hope) increases brain power and function. Maybe best of all is it's a great way to spend time with your family; even my wife digs this game and she's not a gamer(the nerve of her!). Don't let the 1980's graphics deter you, this is an immensely addictive and rewarding game that I think any age group will thoroughly enjoy.

Lohrke","summary":"A game, a canvas, and a connection with your children.","reviewText":"There seem to be plenty of adults who simply don't get Minecraft.  It's not too difficult to understand.  After all, what's so great about placing blocks?  Not much, you might think.  However, with Minecraft the only limit is your imagination.  It's as much a canvas as it is a game.  And that's the genius of this game.  No rules.  Just imagination.  You can build anything, and I mean anything.  There are so many tools at your disposal that you can be a digital Michelangelo or DaVinci if you wish.  It lets the dreamers become doers. Hey, you DID build that.But for me there's even a better reason to buy this game.  Namely, it's a fantastic way to connect with your son/daughter, niece/nephew, younger sibling(s), etc.  My nephew is about turn nine years old.  He lives in Manhattan.  I live in Utah.  A couple of times a month we hop on our PS3s (we both have the digital version) and just goof around.  We mostly hang out in creative mode (we occasionally take on mobs and trade with villagers in survival  mode), building our world which so far includes three huge houses, an airport complete with runway and air traffic control tower, a restaurant, two towers with a skybridge, a huge swimming pool and a race track that runs through all of it.  And we made it all together.The PS3 version, unfortunately, has a lot of limits when compared to the PC version.  No mods, limited skins (so far), etc, but you can play split screen, which is a huge plus for spending some quality time with your kid(s).  I've found the PS3 multiplayer far easier to navigate than the PC version, too.If you don't know really where to start, ask your Minecraft fan to craft you some armor.  After that ask him/her about Creepers, Herobrine, Ender Dragons, Red Stone, and diamond armor.  And then listen.  Watch that kid's face light up as they explain to you the in's and out's of Minecraft.  And then pick up a controller and dive in.

Even if the story is a bit lacking, or play is unimaginative or repetitious.  Or worse, game play is so complicated that you spend 60 hours acclimatizing to the system for twenty hours of play.  So it is with some pleasure that what is probably the only major release in this genre in 2005 also happens to be an excellent game.  Not because it is blindingly original, but because it is a good story in a large and interesting world with a solid play system.A scepter is stolen from a castle vault and the evil creature within it overwhelms the thief and pursues it's own agenda - the destruction of the heirs of those sages who originally bound it in the scepter and its return to this world as god and ruler.  The only survivors of this theft are you as a member of the guard, and King Trode and Princess Medea, who have been changed into an ugly troll and a not so ugly horse.  This m&eacute;nage a trios sets out to track down Dhoulmagus and get him to release the curse.  But, as time goes by, and the rest of the companions are recruited it becomes obvious that the story is much more complex and more is at stake than undoing a curse.None of the characters is especially heroic in demeanor.  The hero is low key, since he is supposed to be you; Yangus is a disreputable ex-thief who has become attached to the hero.  Jessica is a good girl trying to avenge her brother and go bad at the same time, and Angelo is a reject from the Knights Templar.  Trode is pompous to a fault, although one can sympathize with someone who is green with warts in a world where monsters are experience fodder.  Medea, of course, is perfect - just what you would expect from the primary love interest who happens to also pull carts.  This naturalness in the characters lends the story it light, humorous touch.  Dragon Quest VIII is not one of those dire and woeful fantasies that have become fashionable.Game play is a relief after trying to cope with something like Xenosaga.  You can even preset character battle behavior if you want to, but you are rarely more than three clicks from getting each character in order, and battles don't offer insane challenges.  If you are sensible and mind your character building you will have little reason to become frustrated or fail.  There is a large selection of monsters and bosses and fighting only becomes tedious late in the game where you have to remember to sprinkle holy water to avoid wasting time with the pushovers.Graphics are three-dimensional cartoonish - fairly well detailed and interesting.  The music is probably the weakest part of the mix.  In fact, if they hadn't included the Final Fantasy XII preview in the same box thing would be just wonderful.  Unfortunately, even 15 minutes of playing FF XII makes any other game pale by comparison.  The solution, of course is to not play the demo until you have finished Dragon Quest VIII.  I liked DQ8 enough to go hunting to some of the earlier games in this series, and that's about the best recommendation I can give any game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A precious gem that raises the bar for an outstanding series","reviewText":"It seems that every established series in video games always has \"that one game\" that really stands out among the others. An entry that is loved and embraced not only by the series' niche audience, but shines as a beacon to attract even more people than usual; a game that has all of the defining facets previous entries had, but expands them to new heights and combines them in such a way that really makes the overall experience shine in ways that elevates the quality of the entire series. With this game, Intelligent Systems and Nintendo has done such a thing for the Fire Emblem series, one that has always been known for amazing quality. It would be hard to really extrapolate on what makes FE:A so great because honestly, everything about the game is of the highest caliber. Everything the series is beloved for is intact and refined and expanded to previously unseen levels here. Fire Emblem: Awakening, is not only the best Fire Emblem game, it is arguably the best 3DS game to date. It is that good.At its core, Awakening is a tough-as-nails SRPG that appeals to the hardcore tactical role playing fan above all others. The stakes are high, the battles are tough, and death is death. This is the way Fire Emblem games have always been. There's no hand-holding. If you make a mistake that costs you the life of one of your most beloved characters, there is no spell or salve that can save them, and the only way to get them back is to restart the game and redo the battle, hopefully with wiser strategy than your previous attempt. Fire Emblem as a series has been around for over twenty years, and in that time, Intelligent Systems has refined and expanded the mechanics to perfection, and this is definitely evident while playing Awakening. There are various rock-paper-scissor strength-weakness strains to keep in mind, dozens of classes to upgrade your characters to that all have their own benefits and stat-growth differences, and of course the pairing system is deeply incorporated into the game.Speaking of which, the pairing system in particular is one series' defining aspect  that Awakening takes to new heights. Having two characters battle side by side results in their bond level growing. The more their level grows, the more they boost each others' stats in future battles and once you reach certain milestones in their bond level, they can have incredibly well-written and localized conversations that are greatly entertaining and result in deeper development for each character in the story. Men and women can even reach a fourth bond level in which they marry. This results in the ultimate boosts in their pairing up, obviously, but also affects their children. Time travel is a part of the plot, and the adult children of married couples you have in the game can and will meet up and join with you as you play. It's an awesome expansion to a system that was always great in past FE games. I love the pair-up system in Awakening.If you're wondering how much content is in Awakening and if it's enough to justify a purchase, don't worry. I played the game for forty hours and wasn't even half-way through the story. I took it slow and really dug deep into the game as I went along, not to mention times I had to restart after losing a comrade in battle. It's just such a fun game to play, and it's got a TON of content that will scratch your SRPG needs for as long as you need it to. This could easily become a 100+ hour game if you wanted it to. I also must praise the game for its DLC options. The DLC in this game doesn't feel like slapped-together, half-hearted attempts to milk the player of more money, and it also doesn't feel like content that should have been in the game from the beginning. In my opinion, the DLC in FE:A is what DLC should be, enjoyable content that adds to the overall experience in a substantial way, and one that delivers faithfully on the price you pay for it. Bravo Nintendo!It's worth noting that Intelligent Systems has given the player a plethora of options to customize how their game will play. One of the main characters is entirely customized by the player, which is always a treat to see in a game. You can select whether you want the brutal, difficult \"classic\" style of play, or a more \"casual\" mode, where death merely means losing a character for the duration of that battle. It's a wise move and really opens up some options that makes playing the game much more inviting to those who wince at the thought of losing a character for good. There are also several different difficulty options that makes the game appealing to a plethora of gamers of differing backgrounds and constitutions. You can pretty much customize anything you can think of with this game, ranging from important aspects such as difficulty down to seemingly trivial parts such as animation speeds. You name it, it's probably an option. Very nice.The art direction and graphical style in this game is just stunning. Past Fire Emblem titles had a more old-school anime look going on, but Awakening definitely bespeaks a more modern style, with tons of detail, color, and more maturity. Character art that shows up during dialogue is incredibly pleasing to take-in. It's all so detailed and the characters are so expressive in conversations, and every one is very unique. I really can't praise Intelligent Systems enough for their attention to detail in literally every single area with regards to the graphics in this game, and how incredibly well they implemented the 3-D. During battles, you'll notice things like rain drops or snow flakes falling, god-beams shining down onto the field, birds and bats flying over the field and under your view, fish swimming under the beautifully rendered waves of an ocean or river. I mean, every single detail is just astounding.  Battle animations have so much style and impact to them, and you can select several different angles to view them from, including first-person, which can be very surreal. If you get a critical hit in battle, a super stylish graphical flourish will flash across the screen, along with a very memorable quote from your character. Changing the class of your character will change their in-game model's appearance greatly, as will equipping them with different weapons. I really can't praise the presentation of the game enough. The 3-D is not essential to the gameplay, but it definitely enhances the overall experience by leaps and bounds. This is no cheap layered 3-D, but actual depth that really impressed me and I'd say playing with 3-D at max is essential.I also must mention the audio. All of the characters' voices are very appropriately cast, and although dialogue is silent for the most part, the small little Zeldaesque expressions they make while talking really fleshes out each characters' personality. The soundtrack in this game is simply astounding. I even went so far as to import itsOriginal Soundtrack from Japan,it's that good. The thematic unity throughout the whole soundtrack is quite amazing to take in and every track is memorable. Some tracks are absolutely beautiful, and it's all quite emotive. Great work by Hiroki Morishita (who has always done fantastic work on Fire Emblem) and Rei Kondoh (who also contributed much toOkami's brilliant soundtrack as well).Lastly, there's the writing/story in this game. It should come as no surprise by now for you to hear me say that the story, dialogue, characterization is all simply top-notch. The plot itself is intriguing and thrilling from start to finish. I'll refrain from sharing any spoilers here. Just know that political intrigue abounds, and world saving ensues, and it is all quite a ride. There are even parts in the story that brought tears to my eyes and left me breathless. I am honest when I say that it is only the rarest and highest quality of games can do that to me. People who say Nintendo doesn't make mature games needs to play this and face some of the truly dark and sorrowful moments this game has in store. Events are surprising and no one is truly safe, and that is when you know you've got a great story on your hands. This is a genuinely compelling game. Some pivotal story events play out in incredibly well-crafted cutscenes that will knock your socks off. These moments are too few and far between in my opinion, but they definitely enhance the story when they show up. The story is top-quality in Awakening from writing to presentation, to be sure.The characters, of which there are roughly 40, are all unique and genuinely lovable. The numerous pair-up conversations are always enjoyable and range from being hilarious to downright moving. Many of the romantic pairings really develops the characters well. Each pair has a unique story together that is elaborated upon as you unlock a new bond link between them over the course of the game, and it's awesome. These practically innumerable character relationship stories feel like sub-plots unto themselves, and gives Awakening a wonderful dating/social simulation feeling to it. Most of the \"S Rank\" marriage proposal conversations has such sweet, touching dialogue that it just melts your heart and makes you feel warm and fuzzy inside. I literally feel like a better person while playing this game and that is entirely thanks to reading some of the conversations you can unlock in here. You really come to love the characters over the time you spend with them. This game is such a precious gem, and I really can't praise its writing and fantastic localization enough. Intelligent Systems hit it out of the park.Fire Emblem: Awakening is one of those games where everything, down to the tiniest detail, comes together to create a truly special experience. Literally everything in this game impresses me, and every time I play it, another meticulously crafted detail pops out at me and just makes me marvel at how amazing and well thought-out of a game Intelligent Systems has made here. They're a fantastic developer in general, but they really out-did themselves with this one and I really hope they make a direct sequel someday. I know this review is long and gushing and I'm sorry for dragging it out, but this game seriously deserves it. This is easily on my shortlist for game of the year, and I'm confident to say this is most definitely in the top three 3DS games you can buy right now, alongsideSuper Mario 3D LandandThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D. It definitely deserves all of the praise it has gotten, and I give it my highest recommendation. So go out and buy this immediately, get lost in the countless hours of SRPG perfection, and become enraptured by the wonderful experience of Fire Emblem: Awakening.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2013"}

I give props to EA for a great graphics game to be ran on a average $500 laptop windows 7 2011 unlike Fable 3 as it ran choppy for me and it wasn't all that on graphics.....So yeah this game picks up where 1 left off at. I think the character acting is a lot better this time around and the story has lots of twists.  I just find it crazy how he keeps ending back up in space. Maybe the next sequel they take things to a planet(I guess that couldn't actually happen since it's called \"dead space\" eh)but yeah they've pretty much did everything they could do with space in this game. Not so many gravity missions this time around maybe like 3 and they last about 5 mins each.As I said above the characters are pretty good and all the violence keep you on the edge waiting for the next thing to happen. One chick got her eye stabbed out lolllll but that didn't stop her I was like wow really. The enemies are pretty unique not that many new ones. Can't stand that one that jumps from wall to wall with his attennas up spraying acid at you he really sucks. I think that's about it with this game. So yeah you'll enjoy this game for sure.

Players who are experienced with previous games in the series will probably find that the general play style feels very similar to those games.Casual gamers will be happy to hear that this similarity applies to their experience with Civilization as well.  If you just want a few hours of doing something *just* difficult enough to keep your mind busy, but not have to expend a lot of mental energy, you'll do just fine with Civilization IV.  While many games stick to easy, medium, and difficult modes (with some throwing in \"god\" modes), this one throws in a long list of difficulty levels that will allow you to fine tune the experience to be exactly right for you both in your first game, and as you naturally improve over time.  It also retains the ability to select which paths to victory will be treated as valid (I don't know about anybody else, but for some reason I've always just found the space race victory to be obnoxious, so I keep it turned off).There are changes that have an impact on gameplay, naturally.  The addition of religion is one of the bigger ones.  In some ways you can largely ignore it, if you prefer (at least at the lower difficulty levels, naturally as you move up the ladder you have to start taking every possible advantage).  One of the big places where it affects your play in a way that you can't ignore is that other nations will adjust their opinion of you based on whether you share their state religion (in the case that you have one, in the later eras of the game \"free religion\" becomes an available civic setting and selecting that eliminates state religion).The biggest change to the game in general is in the visuals.  The user interface is much more visually appealing than prior games in the series.  The main game screen works very well, though I sometimes find the interface to manipulate cities in detail somewhat awkward.  Fortunately, unless you're playing on the higher levels where you'd have more need to micromanage, you don't have to enter the city screens very often.What you absolutely must do when you play this game, above all, is install the patches.  The early releases appeared to have memory leaks (that means the game needs more and more RAM the longer you leave it running, because it isn't properly keeping track of what it's using).  In bad cases, I would find that after a couple of hours the game would become progressively less responsive.  The most obvious sign that this effect was happening was actually watching the water move up and down along the shores.  After a while, instead of a smooth up and down motion it would start jumping from place to place.  Installing the patches to update to the latest version fixed that, which was a big help because without them I found the need for periodic restarts to be extremely annoying.One small complaint about the way patches are handled: to install the patches from inside the game you have to go through the advanced menu from the main screen.  Patches to a game, repairing bugs and fixing performance issues, can be so vital to having fun.  Since \"advanced\" is usually a tag put on features that no one should touch unless they know EXACTLY what they're doing, because they could otherwise cause problems, it just doesn't seem like an appropriate place to put a function that ALL players (even the ones who aren't very confident with computers!) will be needing to use.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2007"}

MacMahon","summary":"CoD: Black Ops Singleplayer PC Review","reviewText":"When people talk about Call of Duty, at least the last few installments, they often focus almost solely on the multiplayer.  As a long-time singleplayer FPS gamer on the PC however I still enjoy Call of Duty for its singleplayer content.  The original game was one of the greatest FPS games of all time if you ask me and the original Modern Warfare was another spectacular singleplayer experience.  How does Black Ops measure up based solely on singleplayer?  Poorly.First off Black Ops continues the trend of shorter and shorter singleplayer campaigns.  I would put it at about 5 hours on the harder difficulty, probably 4 or less if you play it on an easier setting.  Some people may take longer if they spend a lot of time looking around or replaying segments but overall it's not a long game.  Worse than this though is the simple fact that you have played this game before, many times, and it's starting to get a little tired.  When Modern Warfare 2 came out I felt a little creak as I started playing; it was already what I would consider an old formula and it was already time for a change.  Black Ops is not that change, Black Ops is exactly the same game with slightly different visuals.  At least World At War was a different looking time period and location with Japan in WW2, but Black Ops, despite being set in the 1960's, looks and plays exactly like Modern Warfare.  It is in essence the third Modern Warfare game in 3 years and that makes you feel every rotting piece of old gameplay with brute force.The graphics are alright, nothing amazing but pretty good on high settings.  It comes on one DVD compared to 2 DVDs for the last game but I didn't notice any drop in texture quality as a result.  Sound is pretty standard, you know what you're getting... the music used in the Vietnam sections is as cliche as possible and comes off kind of silly rather than emotional.  To be honest there isn't really much point in going over anything here because it's all the same... it's Modern Warfare, a third time, with maybe slightly less polish.  Sometimes you will get stuck on things and often times the scripting, like the AI waiting for you to reach a spot before doing something, is much more obvious.  Modern Warfare 1 and 2 hid the game's basic mechanics better is what I guess I am trying to say.  All in all though it's the same exact game, and the cobwebs are showing.PC port is decent.  All the usual control options are there and lean is back, which is nice, though honestly I am so used to \"E\" being my activate button now I just ignored lean and mapped it that way anyway.  Unlike the last few CoD games Anisotropic Filtering didn't seem to be on by default so I forced it on through my GPU's control panel, which worked fine.  Performance was a little worse than the last few CoD games due mostly to more being put on the CPU, a sign of poor optimization from the console versions.  Patches have supposedly fixed this but I haven't noticed much difference.  The DRM is Steamworks, which requires a one-time online activation at install and ties the game to an account to prohibit lending or selling.  It's lame and pointless on an open platform as the game will be pirated anyway, but what else is new from these clueless publishers.All in all this review is kind of superfluous.  Did you like Modern Warfare 2?  Do you want another game EXACTLY like that, only a bit rougher around the edges?  Then get this game when it hits the dollar amount you think 5 hours of that is worth.  If not, don't.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

Gamers won't need to be obsessive about winning all the  quests, but there are some challenges that must be completed if you  wish to reach the final showdown. The game begins as players choose  either a male or female lead character while a map displays the new  lands within the world of Fa'Diel. In each of these lands, players will  find items and clues they can use in other lands. The fragmented nature  of the game can be disorienting for gamers looking for quick  gratification.

It has a lot of depth to it. Starting from character creation, you first pick either boy or girl, second you choose one of (I think it's 10) 10 weapons to start with, and then choose the area of the world you want to live in. THEN you place your house somewhere in that area. Already things are interesting. The game world is shaped by the player's imagination, as you recieve artifacts containing dungeons, roads, towns, towers, forests etc. Once the artifact is used, that place appears. At the character's home, there is a garden that grows fruits and vegitables to feed the monsters at your, monster ranch, where you raise monsters to come with you and help you fight. Lastly there are workshops that allow you to create weapons/armor and musical instruments (which give you magical powers). It's actually a lot of fun. Game play and control are good too. The reason it's only 4 stars is that it has very little to do with the original secret of mana.

Beautiful graphics. Fully rotatable view with zoom allows you to get into the middle of the fight. Environments that really can be destroyed. Great use of cover and buildings. This reminds me ofClose Combat: Invasion Normandywith way more options and better graphics. The music and small arms fire is deafening and immersive. I really enjoyed the ability to pick up enemy weapons and even to split units like when an infantry team of 6 troops picks up a heavy MG that requires only 3. If only the troop's history and experience followed the Close Combat system in campaigns. The cut scenes are well written with vivid animations. The base game has one single player campaign where you play as the Americans starting at the Normandy invasion at Omaha Beach (my least favorite mission). The campaign has 15 missions which concludes with closing the Falaise Pocket at Chambois. The missions are enjoyable and varied with most representing an actual historical battle. You will only be able to play as the Americans in the single player campaign; however, the expansionsCompany Of Heroes: Opposing FrontsandCompany of Heroes: Tales of Valorallow you to play as the Germans and British as well as more single player campaigns. Don't worry about taking a long time to learn the controls. COH comes with an excellent tutorial which gets you ready for the fight.My Favorite Mission: Holding Carentan against German counterattack.There are some things I don't like. Line of sight and weapon range are unrealistically short. It would have been better if they had used something like the Close Combat line of sight system which gives limited information for things that are far away. But you would still notice someone running by in the distance. The range of tank weapons is extremely short. However, this has been play balanced by giving tanks excessive durability. COH does not attempt to simulate realistic combat, but it is enjoyable none the less.There is a lot of vulgarity used by the troops in the game. It combines with the general background and responses of the units to create a humorous contrast to the frenzied combat. I did not have a problem with it, but it is noticeable especially by bystanders (i.e. my girlfriend).Multiplayer takes it to a whole new level. Speed in taking positions and being able to manage the battlefield are the deciding factor in head to head action. You barely have time to breath when the s*** hits the fan. There is an online ranking system where you play head to head against other players of similar skill. You can also setup special games with multiple players on each side or even play cooperatively against the computer in skirmishes. Online or in Skirmish mode you can play as the Germans, but you will need the expansions to access the British and Panzer Elite armies. You can also save replays so you can watch your exploits or embarrassing defeats at your leisure. It still has a little of Warcraft or Starcraft feel since it does not attempt to be historical (unlimited ammo and ability to build new units), but it is still a lot of fun.Some notes on patches: I'm using patched version 2.6.0.1. It took 15 separate patches to get it from version 1.0 to current version. The early patches are also becoming difficult to find. Though once you get to 2.1.0.1 the game will download them from inside the game which is better than searching the internet and after version 2.4.0.0 it downloads multiple patches at one time. I would recommend getting Company of Heroes Gold or other later releases for this reason alone. The amount of patches do show you that Relic is committed to their games and responds to play balance issues. One nice thing is that you don't need the DVD in the drive to play. I read in the December 2010 issue of PC Gamer that they are releasing an online platform. I believe you can even download the game and play for free online.Stability: I found the game to be very stable. I did encounter a couple of crashes, but this was extremely rare. I would still recommend saving occasionally in single player mode just in case. I am running a quad Intel with Vista, 8GB RAM, and 1GB NVidia card","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2010"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Jeffrey R. Tilley Jr. \"goatman_1\"","summary":"The reason to buy a Gamecube.","reviewText":"Ok, I am probably the biggest nerd in the universe, I own all three console systems in addition to my PC.  You might say I like games... a lot.  Maybe too much.  It seems like I waste a lot of money on mediocre games that make me wonder why I even bother.Then I buy a game like Rogue Leader and I remember.Next to Halo, Rogue Leader is probably the greatest console game on the market, and possibly one of the best ever made.  The graphics are pristine, the gameplay is excellent and it captures the Star Wars atmosphere perfectly.  While I wasn't a big fan of the first Rogue Squadron because it sometimes degenerated into arcade-like silliness, the sequel seems to have the best elements of an arcade style shooter combined with some of the features of the X-Wing games for the PC.  The result is an immersive, compelling game with lots of twists and turns.It's not all flowers and sunshine, unfortunately, and there are a couple of small missteps that keep me from giving this game that fifth star it deserves on the single player missions alone.  The biggest flaw and one that is slowly becoming the death of more and more games out there is the lack of a multiplayer element.  Obviously this limits replayability, but what really bothers me is the fact that this could have been the \"Halo\" of the Gamecube.  Unfortunately, without utilising those three other joystick inputs, Rogue Leader doesn't live up to it's full potential.Rogue Leader could have had better music at times as well.  It seems to rely on midi-type music that makes John Williams incredible score sound thin and computerised.  The only other flaw, a small one, is that I think the game could have used some additional point of views and customizeable controls.  People used to the X-Wing games on the PC might have an easier time mastering the game.I know this soudns like a lot of complaints, but considering the strengths, they're really small potatos.  The missions, dog-fights, maps, backgrounds, and all the visual elements are almost flawless.  There are lots of unlockable missions like navigating the Millenium Falcon through the asteroid field, that will compell you to play a mission over and over to get them right.  The gameplay is far more challenging than your usual batch of arcade shooters and the variety of vehicles keeps them from getting tedius.  If you're a Star Wars fan, you'll probably be hooked the first time you fly along the surface of the Death Star or take out an AT-AT with your tow-cables.

In fact, Galaxy was so good that when I heard that a direct sequel would be coming a mere 2  years later, I had my doubts as to how the game would be a worthy successor without simply rehashing everything that made the first game so great. But while Galaxy 2 is great for almost all the same reasons as the first game was, it still stands out from its predecessor in many ways and stakes its claim as one of the greatest video games ever made.Galaxy 2's plot is no more or less recycled and predictable as the story from the first game. It's not as though anyone can watch the opening cutscene and think, \"Why is that giant turtle thing trying to kidnap the princess?!?\" There are no surprises here, except perhaps the fact that this time around, Bowser is absolutely huge. But the beauty of it all is that it shows that Nintendo knows that they don't need an amazing story to make an amazing game. While it might have been nice to see something different, it's hard to ignore the fact that even if Galaxy 2 had a marvelous plot, the rest of the game's strengths would still overwhelmingly overshadow it.Even in the midst of watching the same exact story kick off again, though, Galaxy 2 immediately states its intentions by starting off with a sidescrolling stage. Yes, Galaxy 2 is indeed a 3-D Mario game, but perhaps its greatest strength is in how it blends together the linearity and very format of many 2-D Mario titles with the open worlds of 3-D Mario games. Most of the galaxies are in full 3-D, but there is a surprising number of sidescrolling stages as well. These 2-D sections aren't just great because they resemble 2-D Mario, but what makes them stand out is how well all of Galaxy's elements translate to a 2-D format. It all works so well that it makes the 2-D areas simply fantastic.Both the 2-D and 3-D levels alike feature phenomenal level design. The Galaxy team has produced over 50 galaxies for this game, almost all of which manage to bring something new to the table as far as design goes. There are a few new power-ups, including Rock Mario, which allows Mario to roll around at high speeds, and Cloud Mario, which gives Mario the ability to generate cloud platforms underneath himself in the air. These, coupled with most of the power-ups from the first game, offer plenty of creative design features that manage to twist the proven Galaxy formula of planet hopping and gravity-based puzzles in fresh, exciting ways.But perhaps the most significant addition to Galaxy 2 is Yoshi. In past Mario games, Yoshi's playable appearances have always been in 2-D games, and his playtime is usually disappointingly brief. Galaxy 2, though, puts the creative opportunities that Yoshi presents to use in more ways than ever before. Yoshi can swing on floating flowers and eat enemies, and that's all good fun, but the best thing about Yoshi is that he can also get power-ups from special fruits. A red pepper will make him run at exhilarating speed, a shiny yellow fruit will make him glow and reveal invisible floors and platforms, and a yellow berry will make him float like a balloon. None of this may sound all that original but these power-ups aren't great merely because of the concept they present, but how they are put to use and how the level design forces players to get creative with how to utilize these abilities, and that is what makes Galaxy 2's level design shine.As I mentioned earlier, Galaxy 2 hosts over 50 galaxies, which is loads more than its predecessor. There is a bit of a trade-off though, in that the galaxies have a maximum of three stars each. Most galaxies offer one main mission and two prankster comet challenges, which are unlocked by finding the comet medal in the galaxy. Those who favor the sprawling open worlds of previous 3-D Mario titles might not view this trade-off as a good thing as it makes the levels more linear, but in my opinion it is a positive change as it opened up a lot more opportunities for the game developers to make more levels and let their ingenuity shine. And this change also reflects the idea that Galaxy 2 is more in the format of a 2-D Mario game than the traditional style of the 3-D titles, and the linearity of the levels reflects the style of the 2-D games. It all works together to make a 3-D Mario title as much like a 2-D Mario game without making it entirely in 2-D; I think it's an clever and profitable touch to an excellent game.Galaxy 2 has made significant improvements in longevity as well. In the first game, collecting all 120 stars allowed completionists to play through the game a second time as Luigi. Galaxy 2 throws this out the window, though, by making Luigi playable at random points in the game and permanently unlocked after Bowser is defeated for the last time. And once the 120th power star is collected, 120 green stars appear dispersed throughout the game's galaxies, doubling the number of stars in each galaxy and thereby doubling the number of stars in the game. These are not mission-based, though; finding the green stars is basically a massive scavenger hunt, as they are hidden within each level. The green star quest substantially extends the game's length and forces players to utilize every last inch of Mario or Luigi's jumping heights, and the best part is that players are often required to get creative with the level design and figure out how to outsmart it. It's quite challenging at times, but still very entertaining.From a technical standpoint Galaxy 2 is still the Wii's finest. The animation is sharp and vibrant, transforming the TV screen into a constant visual treat. The frame rate is smooth as can be, and everything is simply a pleasure to look at. The graphics are essentially the same as in the first game, but there really wasn't much, if anything, that needed improvement to begin with. The game also shines with its sound, with great sound effects that are true to the theme and franchise, and even better yet, the soundtrack is simply phenomenal. It does an even better job than the first Galaxy score in bringing classic Mario tunes to life in new ways while also adding in plenty of new themes. It all sounds simply fantastic, mixing the old with the new just as the rest of the game so masterfully does.So what's wrong with Galaxy 2? Is there a single flaw? I could definitely say that it's slightly disappointing that all three Bowser battles are essentially the same thing. I could also say that the final galaxy, the Grandmaster Galaxy, was too hard to be much fun and didn't feature any new creative twists. And yes, the story is the same old Bowser kidnaps Peach narrative we've watched over and over again. But to count those things against the game as major flaws would be extremely nitpicky. Yes, these ever so slight shortcomings are there, but they are so insignificant compared to the rest of the game's quality that it's hard to even consider them as detracting from the overall experience.So no, Galaxy 2 isn't perfect. But since when has any game achieved perfection? God alone is perfect; nothing humans make can ever be truly perfect. But it's for games like Super Mario Galaxy 2 that \"perfect\" scores exist: games that are so excellent and so well crafted that they deserve top honors among their peers. And so that is why this game receives a 10 out of 10 from me. Not because it's perfect, but because it's as good as games get. So is Galaxy 2 perfect? No. Is it one of the greatest games ever to hit consoles? Why yes, I'm glad you asked. Now I highly recommend that you go pick up a copy and enjoy it for the excellent piece of entertainment it is.Positive:+ Fantastic blend of the best of 2-D and 3-D Mario+ Phenomenal level design still twists the Galaxy formula+ Yoshi adds a surprising amount of fun to the game+ 242 stars makes a massive and expansive game+ Graphics are every bit as good as before+ Even better soundtrackNegative:- Those few slight shortcomings I mentioned10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

Posey","summary":"First Impressions - Final Fantasy: Four Heroes of Light","reviewText":"Final Fantasy: Four Heroes of Light is the most recent installment into the Final Fantasy handheld market.  While it's not a full fledge sequel to a numbered Final Fantasy game, it still contains a lot of the little nuances that we have all come to love from the series.  Does this game deliver a profound handheld experience on the Nintendo DS or is the cutesy art more at home with a younger crowd?  Read on to find out how I felt after a couple hours with the game.The first thing you may notice when looking at the gameplay for Final Fantasy: Four Heroes of Light (FF4H from here on out) is that the artwork is very...different.  Some may not like it, I know I didn't when I first saw it.  I thought it looked a little childish.  Don't be put off by it though.  For starters, it grows on you and you will learn to appreciate the time and effort the artists no doubt put into making the art.  Secondly, it's deceiving.  You would think a game with graphics like this would be easy or child friendly.  Wow, this couldn't be further from the truth.  FF4H is one of the toughest handheld games I have played in a wild.  It's not because the game is unfair, it's just old school.  If you played Final Fantasy games back in the NES days and Super NES days, you'll know that something exists called \"grinding.\"  Grinding is the art of killing enemy after enemy with no direction only to gain levels.  This is something you absolutely must do in this game and do it a lot you will.The game begins with no tutorial.  You wake up in your house as a 14 year old boy name Brandt (you can change the name) and are instructed to go to the castle to present yourself to the king, since today is your birthday and it's the day you become a man in the Kingdom's eyes.  After making your way to the castle, you find out the princess was stolen by a witch and you much track her down and rescue her.  With a sword and a smile, you set off to her lair to reclaim the princess for the King.  And with that, the story begins.  You are given a general direction to go and the lair isn't hard to find, but after your first fight you'll realize the game doesn't F' around.The fights are tough and require you to constantly have a fresh supply of potions.  Unlike in previous games though you can only carry 15 items on any character at any given time.  With 4 max controllable characters, each with their own set of armor that counts as a spot, a weapon, accessory, and non stackable items...this becomes a bit of a meta-game.  You are going to constantly be checking your inventory to make sure you only have the bare necessities for survival.  You can drop off extra items at a range of \"shops\" across the land that hold your excess items.  Think of these as ATMs for your items.Fights are actually handled a little different as well in FF4H.  Instead of mana, you are given 5 AP orbs.  You begin with 1 filled in the beginning of the game and each turn you take awards you one more.  Basic attacks use up 1 AP orb while magic usually takes 2.  If you only have one orb and want to use magic, you can use the boost option which will give you an extra AP (along with the AP you get from the end of a turn) to give you 3 for the next turn.  It sounds a lot more confusing than it is so if you are getting hung up on this don't.  It's no biggie.  The next way it's different is that you can't pick who to fight.  You hit attack and the computer automatically picks an enemy to attack.  It's a little odd that this happens but it speeds things up a bit and the computer usually does a good job of prioritizing enemies.  This really helps with grinding too since you can just keep spamming attack and not worry about who to hit...the game will do that for you.  The system is new, but it's not bad.  It just takes a little time to get used to it.One of the main new additions to the game is the way the game handles jobs.  Instead of picking a class (like a thief, mage, etc.) you pick hats that you acquire over the course of the game.  You begin with no hats but after defeating the witch you get your first.  Each hat grants powers and stat benefits and can be upgraded using gems you find off of enemies.  Think of the hats as a way to change your party on the go without having to go back to a town.  You always have the hats on you and switching is as easy as going into a menu.  As you upgrade, new abilities become available, but they aren't shared with other members.  Each hat for each person must be upgraded separately.  From what I can see, the system works fine with the non transferable upgrades being the only issue I have.  But, it makes sense though.  The person who is your white mage will probably also be your other magic classes in order to keep the equipment with one magic user.  Switching to the warrior class doesn't make much sense since they don't have the weapons or armor.The game is old school in style and technique and as such random battles are the norm.  These used to be all we had back in the day so if you are like me and got spoiled by seeing enemies on the battlefield, you might be taken back by this.  It's not so bad though and you'll be in your groove in no time.The graphics, as mentioned earlier, is something that you will either like or not like.  Hell, you may be like me and hate it to begin with but grow accustomed to it and even begin to appreciate it.  The graphics are pretty good too for a DS game.  Don't let this be a reason you don't try the game out if RPGs are your thing.The only gripe with the game so far would be the difficulty.  At times, it's frustratingly hard.  The first boss I came to (the aforementioned witch) kicked my butt in a couple hits and sent me back to the town.  I killed her the next time I saw her because I was better prepared and used fire spells, but I was taught a lesson...the game won't hold your hand.  Another gripe is that the game never tells you where you need to go.  This got so bad that I had to go out the next night after getting the game and buy the strategy guide.  Remembering back to my youth and playing FF1 on the NES, I had my mother there to help me - holding a Nintendo Power as I traversed the world map.  In almost the same fashion, here I am today with the TV of old now in the palm of my hands and that old Nintendo power held by my mom a strategy guide resting on my dog's back as he begs for attention.Final thoughts on the game - if you are an RPG fan at heart and love a challenge and don't mind grinding, you'll really appreciate this game.  It's a little short in the story department so far but most of these types of games are.  They are meant to be simplistic.  If, on the other hand, you don't like tough games or spending a lot of time grinding to increase your level to just survive the next boss battle, look elsewhere, because you will find a less than forgiving game in Final Fantasy: Four Heroes of Light.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2010"}

Shooting several mutants in a row without missing or taking damage increases your score multiplier until you earn a Goregasm...and then the points really start racking up.This game is NOT for the kiddies because of the violence, and also the language. The Wii version set a record for having 189 uses of the F-word (and I don't mean Fahrvergn&uuml;gen), and since there are 2 additional levels in the PS3 version, there's definitely more cussin' to be heard here.Kill those mutants any way you can; whether you throw a grenade, blast a shotgun, or drop a chandelier on them!!!PROS:+ Simply put, I never got tired of shooting mutants in this game. Whether with one Move controller or two, it's so much fun to play through, even if you're not trying to earn trophies or high scores.+ Each chapter felt like its own grindhouse film. From the cheesy acting to the hammy dialogue to the scratch marks on the cutscenes, we feel like we're saving the world a laPlanet Terror.Whether you play as the scorching hot Varla Guns or those testosterone death machines Agent G/Isaac Washington, you'll have a great old time.+ There are a few upgrades from the Wii version - In addition to Director's Cut mode, there's a mode where all the mutants can only die from headshots, a mode where you can only bring along a partially-upgraded Magnum, and my personal favorite, a mode called Shoot the Sh*t, where you have to shoot out all the naughty words at the bottom of the screen during each cutscene.Since it's easier to earn money in the PS3 version (really...MUCH EASIER), purchasing and upgrading guns is a simpler task. Plus, there are more weapons that weren't available in the Wii version.+ I will also add that the gameplay balances well with the dialogue. I keep chuckling at the foul-mouthed banter between Agent G and Isaac, and the 2 additional levels with Varla Guns and Candi Stryper are a welcome addition. Shooting mutants is fun, but if you skip the cutscenes, you're missing out on some comedic gold.+ The Online Leaderboards are another incentive to keep getting better at the game. You can try to beat your own score, or beat the scores of other people across the vast reaches of the intertubez.- CONS:- In the Wii version of House of the Dead: Overkill, each boss had clearly marked weak points. During battle, those weak points were surrounded by a red circle. In the Playstation version, we get a brief drawing of their weak points before the fight, but that's it.Sometimes the drawing doesn't mention the best weak points, such as the Lobber boss on \"The Fetid Waters\" level.- In planning this review, I went back and played through the Wii version again. By doing so, I noticed that quite a few scenes of extreme violence were toned DOWN when this game got ported over to the Playstation 3. For example: in the basement of Papa's Palace of Pain, mutants are putting a human corpse into a wood chipper, and twitching legs are shown in the Wii version, but this is censored in the PS3 version. During the \"Jailhouse Judgement\" level, a human police officer is hung from the jailhouse tiers, but this is not present in the PS3 version.I will agree that the PS3 version has more blood and more strippers, but not necessarily more gore than the Wii version.- I noticed that the minigun, while a fantastic weapon, had a problem with \"Move Drift\". The crosshairs drifted to the right or left of the screen if I held down the trigger for more than 2 continuous seconds. I turned off the magnetic sensor in the XMB settings and this helped a little, but I found the best solution was to simply fire short bursts with the Move controller and there was much less drift.Pressing the select button returns the crosshairs to the center of the screen, but this isn't always possible in the middle of a firefight.TROPHIES:There are 39 trophies to earn. Most of the basic trophies are earned by beating each stage, collecting and unlocking hidden items throughout the stages, purchasing all weapons, etc. Once Director's Cut mode is unlocked, each stage offers 7 additional challenges and these trophies are harder to earn. With practice and skill, you'll become a better shot. Enjoy your blood-soaked bullet-fest quest for the Platinum trophy!!!FINAL THOUGHTS:This was a very fun game to play, and I'm not the biggest fan of rail-shooters! I played it through multiple times with the Playstation Move and I didn't even THINK about using the DualShock controller.The calibration process was simple, the action was non-stop, the dialogue was hilarious, and the \"Missing Reel\" being restored for this version was the icing on the cake. Even though there was some gore missing and the Move wasn't perfectly calibrated, I could overlook those issues.If you're a fan of rail shooters, this game should definitely be in your library. Highly recommended!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2012"}

WIth the fine legacy left by the Sega Saturn trilogy and hot off the heals of the fantastic PD Saga, I expected PDO to turn out at least on par with what the Saturn versions had to offer.  Instead, we get gameplay very reminscient of the early PD games, basically linear excursions through graphically impressive levels, with mind numbingly lengthy boss battles.  The desire to replay the stages just isn't there and when they constantly throw boss battles that take up to 10 minutes to complete (I'm not exaggerating here..there's a timer counting down your boss battles), PDO just gets old and stale rather quickly.Yeah, yeah...Sega threw in a host of challenges and unlockables in teh Pandora's Box including the full version of PD1, but I didn't buy an XBOX to play 8 year old Sega Saturn games I've already played to death.THe story is rather bizarre and the mini-games you play in the Pandora's Box at first seem to have no connection whatsoever to the main game (it gets clearer as you go on), but the trial and error nature of these challenges will turn off MANy gamers.  Instead of turning out to be an epic game on the XBOX..one that would be talked about for years like the Saturn games, PDO has basically become one of those games that only the hardcore players will flock to and has quickly fallen out of sight and has rarely been mentioned since.IF this is what Sega has become today, then I'll be very wary of any new releases from them in the future!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2003"}

And it holds its own in a world dominated by more visually stunning shooters such as Call Of Duty. The campaign is great and the multi-player is the same kind of addictive that the N64 version was. My only advice would be to use the Classic Controller. Some people apparently prefer the Wii Remote, but I don't see how. I have to believe that anyone who didn't love this game was either a stickler for graphics or didn't have access to a Classic Controller. My only minor complaint is with the blur which happens when you reload. Despite what others have said, it doesn't prevent you from lining up your next shot and it is the sort of thing you'd expect of any shooter hoping to maintain a level of realism. Still this doesn't even begin to keep me from loving this game. I'd gladly pay full price for it again (and I normally only buy used games).

{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"anonymous rogue","summary":"Whip it good!","reviewText":"A classic game that deserves to be part of anyone who calls themselves a gamers library.

Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"A Small Packaged PS2.","reviewText":"The New designed PS2 is just under 9in Long, about 6in Wide, and barely over 1 in Thick. It's just a little bigger than a VHS tape. It has a top loading system,the door pops up . The hole in your game disk clicks into place.Just like a portable CD walkman.It's much ,much ,smaller than the first design. I love the small design. The only negative is no memory card is supplied. The main reason to own a PS2 is ,simply , There's just more games than other consoles. I also own an Xbox . Which of course is the best of all consoles graphics wise ,plus its internal hard-drive. But you need to buy a dvd remote to play dvd's on the xbox.The PS2 plays dvd's  right out of the box.So both consoles,have there little trick to squeeze a little more cash out of your pocket . If you wanna improve graphics on your PS2 ,I strongly suggest you get either an \"S\" cable, Or a component cable. First look at the back your TV ,if you have a black input that's kinda funky looking,thats an \"S\" video input and underneath will be red and white for audio input. If you see any blue input than that means you have also component input which is the best video input for graphics. There mostly on expensive tv's. But most TV'S have an \"S\" cable input which is better graphics than the supplied RCA plugs ,red,white,yellow ,that come with the PS2. You'll notice a difference in clearer graphics with the \" S\" cable ,or even better the \"component\" cable. Sony makes a good \"S\" cable,about $29.00. Ive tried the monster cable's ,but I had some problems with my cable. I'd stick to the SONY brand \"S\"cable.But Iv'e heard that madcatz \"S\"cable at walmart for $10.00 is just as good.With so many good games coming out on the XBOX . It's hard for me to say the new PS2 is a good buy ,not because of quality,but because of price,But $149.99 aint bad and I got a memory card for $19.99 at Circuit City. The PS2 has tons of games .Much more than the XBOX. Maybe wait until there's a good ps2 bundle .But the the new PS2 design rocks.It's highly portable.I have both systems xbox,and ps2. I like PS2 cause it has more games. I like the Xbox because it has better quality graphics,almost computer quality. If I was forced to own just one system. I'd probably go with PS2 ,because there's more games for that console,and it's very small now,and portable,It would easily fit in a backpack. But with HALO2 coming out I must keep my Xbox which is my personal \"favourite\" console system. But the PS2 \"controller\" is the best designed. All in all the new designed PS2 gets my thumbs up for quality and design.Get it if you can afford it. All three consoles have there pro's and cons.

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone.

New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"What happened to my Resident Evil?","reviewText":"After finishing Resident Evil 5, I couldn't help but feel a little bit cheated.  I think most people who were around to play the first Resident Evil when it was new will probably agree with me.  While Resident Evil 5 looks great, has good controls, and lasts over 10 hours (for most people), it is a serious departure from the RE games before it.  And not in a good way.As others have mentioned, this game is indeed an action packed experience that gives you little chance to breathe.  The game starts off slowly, but picks up momentum quickly, and maintains interesting set pieces and graphics that really flow nicely.  What bugged me most about it was its complete lack of suspense.  Every RE game before this one made an effort to build a mood and tone that kept you on your toes.  Not so here.  The most effective scene in this game is the very first one where Chris and Sheva are walking through the town, and all the townsfolk are glaring back through dark, yellow eyes.  It's creepy, and a very good way to start.  Unfortunately, the rest of the game features countless dudes running from around corners acting as shotgun fodder.  There is very little challenge in this game, and the A.I. is completely dumb.  And where the hell are the zombies??  Aren't zombies what Resident Evil is about?  I've never been a fan of the \"zombies\" that run around corners and use weapons to attack.  When someone is running at you with a chainsaw and a bag over his head, he ceases to be a zombie; he is a crazy motherf'er with a chainsaw and a bag over his head.  Big difference.  Zombies are slow, meandering lumps of flesh that have no means to attack you other than their dead meathooks.  I guess I blame the film 28 Days Later for the newer and improved zombie, but I prefer the classic George Romero zombie.But again, there is no suspense at all in this game, it's all about shooting as many people as you can.  Which can be fine, but in a RE game it is not acceptable.  And when did Chris Redfield start lifting weights?  He looks like some ahole who just stumbled out of the fitness club.  His pumped up meathead look seemed to be an attempt to make this installment a war game only, skimping on the horror.Which leads me to my next gripe.  The story in this game is AWFUL.  I mean, really bad.  And the cliches were absolutely astounding.  When are game developers going to stop resting on their laurels and deliver a well-written game?  After playing games like Metal Gear Solid 4, the story in Resident Evil 5 is insulting to my intelligence.  Lines like \"welcome to the party\", or \"so glad you could make it\", or \"I will destroy you!\", or \"this is for our fallen comrades!\", or.....I could go on and on here, and Resident Evil 5 has them all.  The story and dialog is laughable to say the least.But, I suspect people find the true value of this game in its online content.  I don't really play online, so I'm leaving my review to the one player experience only.Despite these gripes, the game is still a playable experience.  I finished the game which says I enjoyed it enough to stick through it.  But only barely.  Honestly, there is nothing wrong with the gameplay of RE5, but fundamentally this game misses the mark.  To me, Resident Evil 5 is akin to taking the Final Fantasy series and turning it into a first person shooter game.  Capcom took the things we all love about the RE series and erased them with bits of other action games.I would not recommend this game to people who love the RE series.  They skimp on the horror, and beef up the action.  And with 360 games out there like Gears Of War and Halo 3, you can buy much better action games than this.  I really hope Capcom goes back to what made Resident Evil good in the first place....SURVIVAL HORROR.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001AWBYNE","reviewerName":"Chris Longhurst","summary":"World War II in hi-def.","reviewText":"COD-WAW - the latest installment of the Call Of Duty series is set in the closing stages of WWII. As with most COD games, you alternate between two characters. In this case a Russian advancing on Berlin, and an American GI clearing out the Japanese islands.ControlsAs you'd expect, COD-WAW is a first-person run-and-gun game. You can sneak (and on some maps you have to) but for the most part it's shoot or be shot at. The controls are pretty good for this. Left stick moves you, right stick adjusts where you're looking. Various buttons crouch, jump, reload and fire. It's fairly intuitive to pick up and the controls are identical to the hugely playable COD4.GraphicsThe graphics in COD5 are excellent. The environments are detailed and the map size is up on COD4 with some truly sprawling levels this time around. The Berlin levels leading to the Reichstag are simply incredible with brilliant artwork and modelling that truly represents the bombed-out city at the end of the War. The amount of popup (where items suddenly pop in to view) is lessened compared to COD4 but it's still very noticable, especially when approaching the windows of a building to look out. As with COD4, to start with you won't notice it, but once it catches your eye, you'll see it everywhere. The smoke and particle effects have been heavily modified this time around and are much improved. The smoke grenades in particular do not stress the PS3 anywhere near as much as they did in the previous game. There are specular highlights and bump maps used where you'd expect them to be used to pretty good effect. One of the neatest effects is the visual distortion you get around the muzzle of a gun during gunfire, or around an exploding grenade. Nice touch.New in COD5 is \"graphic\" content, by which I mean mutilated bodies. With the advent of the flamethrower - a truly terrible weapon - you will be presented with burned, mutilated bodies as a result. In multiplayer mode, your character takes damage now too - step on a landmine and in the instant replay you'll see your leg blown off with nothing but a bloody stump remaining. For the parents or squeamish, these effects can all be turned off though.SoundThe audio on COD-WAW is also improved somewhat on the previous game. There's good stereo separation at the front and excellent use of the rear channels. Often you'll be able to hear someone behind you giving you more reaction time to do something about it. The weapons effects are OK and they use the subwoofer to good effect. Again there's noticable differences in weapons types, with and without suppressors, but I suppose only a classic gun nut would be able to tell you if they're right.Single playerSingle player mode is a good intro to World At War. The maps are varied and as I said in the intro, the missions are split between US and Russian troops. Each mission is a mission-on-rails in that you really can't deviate much from what the developers want you to do. Go from A to B. Kill everything. Collect item. It's a tired formula but I guess it still works. The game is mercifully short on cut-scenes so there isn't a lot of interruption. The cut scenes that do exist are a split between pre-rendered and game-engine scenes. As with all COD games, one level stands out head and shoulders above the rest, and this time around, for me it was the fleet defence mission. You find yourself as a gunner in a US flying boat trying to defend part of the US fleet against Japanese attack. The aircraft in question has 4 guns - left and right waist, nose and tail. The brilliant thing is that you can swap to the different guns, and when you do, rather than simply cut to the new position, you run through the aircraft, past other crew members to the new gunnery station. The first time I played this level it was an unexpected gem in the otherwise ground-based game. Having said that, the three maps leading to the toppling of the Reichstag in Berlin are also worthy of note because of the sheer scale and detail.One fun addition is the Nazi Zombies level. Once you finish the single player game once, there is a one-off level that you can play where you are locked in an abandoned house. Nazi zombies swarm the house and your job is to kill as many as you can before being overwhelmed. You can rebuild window barricades as they are pulled down by the attacking horde but it takes time - time you don't often have. There are extra sections of the house that can be unlocked once you have enough points. The advantage is that more powerful weapons exist elsewhere in the house, but then so do more doors and windows for the zombies to get in. There are a couple of awards - instant kill, nuke, and 2x points. Ultimately you'll be mauled to death by a hideous Michael-Jackson-Thriller-like zombie with glowing eyes, but how many can you take down before it happens. This is actually a surprisingly fun level to play and re-play although it's not obvious why it was included in World At War.OnlineOnline gameplay is where COD-WAW really shines in terms of fun factor. As with COD4, there's a load-balancing system so newbies don't drop into maps with 8 year old Korean kids who can snipe them through glitches in the map. The experience points (XP) system is present and correct as are the commensurate unlocks and and challenges. The more kills you get, the more matches you play, the more experience points you get. These unlock the challenges and the ability to make your own weapons load (instead of choosing one of the predetermined ones) as well as perks. Perks are things like the ability to carry three grenades instead of one.There are a bunch of different online modes ranging from the usual capture the flags (Domination, straight from Halo), to headquarters, search-and-destroy and outright free-for-all and deathmatch. Team Tactical is a neat mode where each time only has three players, so the games become a lot more tactical. That mode also relies on headset chat otherwise you'll be running around completely uncoordinated. A new addition to World At War is the \"War\" multiplayer mode which is similar to Domination except that it's a proper staged battle across a map. The teams start either side and have to push towards the other team's base camp by capturing the flags as they go. The more you capture, and the more kills you get, the more 'momentum' your team builds. More momentum means quicker flag captures and respawns, which in effect rewards you for teamplay. The better you play as a team, the easier it becomes for you to overwhelm the opposing team with force.In addition, there are now vehicles in some multiplayer maps - typically tanks. They have two positions - driver/gunner and machinegunner, so up to two players can get in and roam around the map reaping destruction. There are vehicle challenges to go with this new feature - miles driven, most people killed with the main gun etc., and there are also anti-tank weapons and sticky mines so that foot-soldiers stand some chance of taking out the armour. This is a nice touch but I can't help but wonder if it was put in in an effort to compete with the Battlefield series of games.As with COD4 there are instant rewards in multiplayer. Three kills and you get aerial reconaissance, meaning you can see the other team's locations on your map. Five in a row and you get artillery. Seven in a row and you get to call in the dogs. Opinion is split on the dogs. Some people preferred the helicopter in COD4, but I sort of like the dogs idea. If you're quick, you can actually defend yourself against a dog attack. With the helicopter, you had no choice but to hide.New to World at War is cooperative gameplay. This is where you can play with other players instead of against them. For example having 4 of you locked in the nazi zombie level, or trying to complete campaign missions with 3 other players instead of the computer-controlled AI characters. This is a nice addition and it has all its own awards and challenges to be completed too.The biggest drawback of the online play is that the code still isn't distributed. This means that one person's machine is hosting the game. If they get annoyed at losing a battle, or being shot too many times, they can cancel the entire match, resulting in a \"host ended session\" message for everyone else. This is really nasty. In World At War, they do seem to have tried to implement code that migrates the host but it doesn't seem to work. Worse still, the send-you-to-the-same-game bug is still very prominent. If you're playing online and you decide you want out of the game, you can quit and go back to the multiplayer lobby. The problem is that if you then try to find another game, it will invariably dump you right back into the one you just left. Worse still, they still haven't solved the issue where it dumps you into games that have either just ended, or are within a couple of points of ending. This means you spend a considerable amount of time being shuttled from host to host just trying to find a game that is about to start. This and this alone is why I took a star off the review for this game. It was bad in COD4 and it should have been fixed. The fact that these problems still exist is inexcusable.TrophiesWorld At War supports the PS3's new trophy system. There are dozens to collect both in single player, multiplayer online and co-op modes.Four stars or five?Very few games deserve 5-star rating at this point. Developers are still learning how best to get everything they can out of the PS3. Giving a game 5 stars implies the developers have nowhere left to turn for future improvements. This happens rarely although because of the improvements over COD4 I was willing to go the 5-star route. The improvements in the game engine, the sound effects, the smoke and explosion effects, and the engaging gameplay all help to raise the bar, but as I said above, the fact that it still suffers the abominable problems with multiplayer hosting are reason enough to bring the rating down again.It's quick to pick up and the online play, despite the server glitches, still has a high X-factor. As with COD4 it's hard to say what makes the game so much fun but it has that certain something that will probably keep you coming back. In the end, that's what it's all about. You can have all the hype and fanfare you like, but if your game has spectacular graphics, a long and twisting storyline but no fun factor, people won't play it. COD-WAW has good graphics, good sound, mercifully little storyline and it's fun to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2008"}

Nintendo sought out to add a coin gimmick of collecting coins which itself is nothing new as every newer Mario game just adds more and more coins.

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"DJ hero is here!","reviewText":"As a big fan of the dj and electronic music scene I was stoked to get my hands on DJ hero. Out of the box you know you've got something special due to the ruggedness of the controller; it feels strong and well made and if it wasn't for the three buttons on top it might fool you into thinking it was a real direct-drive turntable. It spins freely 360 degrees and is obviously balanced on some impressive bearings. Everything is nicely laid out too. On the top left is a small flap and underneath it are full controller buttons - D pad, X box 360 button with appropriate green leds, and abxy buttons along with a controller sync button. Beneath that is the euphoria button and effects knob. Below that is the fader and on the actual turntable are the three action buttons. You place your right hand on the turntable's buttons and your left controls the slider for fading and effects.Gameplay it's fairly standard Guitar Hero stuff. You hit the appropriate button as designated by the on-screen icons which fall from the upper part of the screen. The slight bend on the graphics indicating a vinyl record that's playing is a nice touch. If you see a right angle in the lane then you slide the fade in that direction. Sometimes you'll see a zigzag icon and you hold the appropriate button and 'scratch' the record for that duration. It all works beautifully and once you're in a rhythm you really feel like you're commanding the action.By far though the star of the show are the tunes. Each track is actually a composite of two popular songs which you control with the fader - I wasn't expecting such incredibly intricate and well done remixes of songs you just wouldn't think would work together and they're a joy to listen to. Superb stuff.There's several modes of play as well as online MP. Turntable vs guitar is also an option adding a new dimension to the game. In all DJ Hero exceeded my expectations and I look forward to many online battles (or indeed a battle with some friends on their guitars).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00008DHNL","reviewerName":"caleb","summary":"This game is truly awful.  Don't buy and don't rent.","reviewText":"My high expectations for this game were shattered after I played it.  This game does not boast any positive aspects that I can think of, therefore I will mention the cons.  First off, the car physics are atrocious.  Or better yet I should deduce that there are no car physics.  It seems like the developers spent no time trying to make this feel realistic.  Taking corners doesn't have a solid or natural feel.  The car usually turns too sharply.  The fighting is equally lack luster and repetitive.  When I say repetive, people that are reading this and have played the game are nodding their heads in agreement, because repetitive is the perfect word to describe the fighting.  You'll press a couple buttons, maybe you'll have a gun at times, but it never induces a feeling of fun.  I found myself randomly pressing buttons just waiting for the adversaries to die.  When you want the game to end after a half hour of playing, it means it's time to hand the control to some unsuspecting victim and get away while you can.  Luckily I played this game at my friend's house.  And he was borrowing it from another friend, so neither of us had any money deficits to complain about.  Dropping $50 on a game like this would be unfortunate.  I truthfully cannot recommend this game to anyone.  I would not even recommend it to my worst enemies because playing this game is too harsh of a punishment.  If you want to see how bad it is you are free to rent it, just be aware of how much fun you are not going to have.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2004"}
{"product_name":"B003L51GW2","description":"","reviewerName":"The Voice Of Treason","summary":"God of War: Ghost of Sparta","reviewText":"Well I pre-ordered this with the entertainment pack but I foolishly wrote a review for the entertainment pack before I finished the game, now I've finished the game and I don't want to rewrite my other review to include this bit about the game so I figure I'll just type one up on the games page it's self since I think that would be more helpful.This is the story of why Kratos went so ballistic between the games God of War and God of War 2 and caused Zeus to want to take him down a peg, however they don't actually get into that part, you play as a still very mortal Kratos with his regular, \"grr I'm so angry about something\" attitude and blades of Athena that he receives at the end of God of War. The story takes it's self a while to really get going and explain to you exactly what and why you're doing it but there's plenty of action and gameplay to keep you interested until the story starts to unfold.The graphics and gameplay in Ghost of Sparta just puts Chains of Olympus to shame in every way shape and form, this really is a beautiful little game that borrows a lot of mechanics and elements from GOW3 as opposed to the game it directly follows, GOW. I liked how they focused on the Blades as a primary weapon and only give you the secondary weapon, The Arms of Sparta, which consists of a Spartan shield and spear very similar to what you would see in the film \"300,\" but it doesn't replace the Blades and make you not want to use them but The Arms of Sparta offer a different style of play a more defensively minded offensive strategy but I felt that style slowed down the action too much and I just stuck to the Blades of Athena mostly. I can not tell you how much I miss the Icarus Wings in this game, I've gotten so used to them that Kratos just really feels like he's missing something in the games without them, but that's really just a pet peeve, I realize due to the constraints of the story they couldn't be included but something similar would have been nice. Borrowed from GOW3 are elements such as reusable locales, interaction in-game with huge NPC's (that's Non-Playable Character for anyone not in the know), an ability that is finite in use but infinitely reusable, like the bottom meter in GOW3 for the bow and other special items but in this game it just adds a fire element to the Blades and causes burn and explosive damage, takes a few secs to recharge but then he's all ready to slice and burn all over again. The magic attacks were hit and miss they had one REALLY useless magic and one REALLY useful one and the extra was just, well \"extra.\" The game it's self isn't very long I believe my final save was at 6 hours and 30 minutes but since they have the battle arena mode and challenges of the Gods it makes the makes the game really playable even after finishing the story mode and all the red orbs you collect can be used towards special rewards in yet another bonus section of the game called the Temple of Zeus.As for the story here's where I think the game suffers the most and I'll tell you why I think that.I like what all five directors involved with the GOW franchise so far have done to reinvent the super hero, because lets face facts Kratos is a superhero. We don't know much about him other then that when he shows up big things are going to happen and I think the game diminished that a bit by trying to make him a bit more human and forcing us to go along on the journey of self discovery and personal revelation with him. It doesn't really add anything to the characters ultimate pathos or shed any new light on him. Yes there's a few quickie, \"oh yeah this is where he got the scar on his eye,\" moments but other wise it just doesn't really say anything. Yes in the final moments of the game it explains why Kratos was so blood drunk at the beginning of GOW2 but other wise the story it's self is a throw away in the whole mythos of God of War. The addition of Kratos' brother Deimos into GOW lore was somewhat refreshing although it was kinda upsetting to see Deimos, a guy whose been in captivity since he was a small boy somehow over power and pummel Kratos similar to what Kratos did to Hercules in GOW3. I wish we could have gotten to know Deimos a bit better and I won't post any spoilers but you really only see him for the last 15 minutes of a six hour game, everything else is a flashback of when he and Kratos were children. That's another thing, I never needed to see Kratos as a skinny little boy it ruined a bit of the mystique about the character but I understand some people or maybe most people, are interested in where their heroes came from, I'm not.The stories to GOW have always been simple and straightforward with Kratos wanting to achieve a goal and then doing that and while this story eventually comes to that point it starts off very meandering and is probably the most wandering story in the entire franchise, and I'm not saying that's a bad thing. One of my other favorite game franchises is the Metal Gear franchise and anyone familiar with that series knows exactly how contrived and juxtaposed a still captivating story can be. I just think such story telling techniques have no place in the GOW series.But anyways, if you're looking for bar-none one the best action platforming games available for your PSP this is the one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Almost too little, too late","reviewText":"Halo 2 is considered to be one of the best games ever made for Microsoft's original XBox, and became a smash hit back in 2004.  Now, after numerous delays, Halo 2 has finally made it to the PC for Windows Vista, and it's nearly identical to Bungie's original game.  However, this is both good and bad, and if you've never played Halo 2 before, playing it now may make you wonder what all the fuss was about.  First off, Halo 2 on the XBox is what helped make XBox Live what it is today thanks to it's fantastic multiplayer options.  Halo 2 for Vista shines in this department, offering great multiplayer variety and a welcome map editor to allow players to get creative with the battlegrounds.  The 23 included maps are a smash as well.  The single player mode was the console version's biggest flaw, and not much has changed in the translation to Vista.  The single player campaign is incredibly short and concludes on a hair pulling cliffhanger and features a storyline that, looking back on it now, is rather lackluster.  Not to mention that the visuals, while still good, have been outshined by more modern PC shooters to come out in recent memory as well.  The game also features support for the XBox 360 controller as well as the standard mouse and keyboard, which can lead to some unbalanced moments of advantage in multiplayer as well.  All the flaws aside though, Halo 2 for Vista is a more than solid shooter for the PC that manages to deliver most of the goods that it did so notably three years ago on the original XBox.  However, if you've played at great length any recent shooters like Stalker or Half-Life 2: Episode One, you may be left wondering what all the fuss over Halo 2 was about in the first place.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2007"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature.

Rise had an AI partner, some breath taking cinematics, and a cool story.  I got this one hoping for more of the same, but with fewer bugs.  I was somewhat disappointed, but still had a lot of fun.Mark of Kri only has you playing as one character, Rau the barbarian.  The graphics aren't PS3 level, but for the time they came out they're quite good.  It's sort of a cartoon animation to it that kind of looks like a Disney film.  Where Rise had flowing drawings (and freezes during them), Mark has more stable pictures that look really good and fade into the actual game.  The combat has an interesting twist, you use the right analog stick to \"paint\" the enemies, then a button appears over their head.  Pressing that button lets you attack the character(s) even if you aren't facing them or they aren't on screen.  It's a great idea in principle, but can cause problems when a lot of enemies are on screen and you can't pain them all, and thus cannot attack them all, or when the game suddenly decides to remove the button from the enemy on its own; this happens more frequently on weapons that can target more than one enemy with the same button.  I didn't find this until after I'd finished the game, but if you want to \"un-paint\" the enemies, you can press the R3 button (push down on right analog stick).  The other downside of the combat system is that since it assigns the buttons to an enemy it necessarily reduces a lot of your attacks to just mashing one button per enemy.There are a few problems with the execution.  Until the last level, the game is mostly about stealth.  You sneak in, kill guards before they can call their brothers to them, and take out enemies like archers that will otherwise hinder your ability to fight.  The stealth in general is just ridiculous.  You have your arrows and cool stealth kill moves to take out enemies if you can sneak up behind them, but it's only a couple different animations and you'll see them over and over and over again.  While you aren't technically defeated if an enemy sees you, in many cases you might as well be.  You'll fairly often get caught with a bunch of guys coming at you and archer support cutting you down; if they're armored you can't even strike back at them if they're up high.  This can be a big problem when somebody who shouldn't have seen you suddenly sounds an alarm and when that one guy sees you his partners immediately know you're there.  I noticed this with sentries that carry horns.  If the sentry is alerted to you, but you stop him from blowing his horn by attacking him.  Suddenly the troops just come rushing out just because he saw you.  How does that work?  At the same time, patrolling guards ignore dead bodies laying on the ground and usually even somebody dying right next to them.Even with its issues though, the game has a lot to like.  One of the most interesting touches is your bird which can act as both your eyes and sometimes as a switch flipper so you can progress.  As I mentioned, the graphics look really good.  There's also something really fun about pulling off stealth kills to take out the guards.  Usually guards have fairly short paths they follow so you don't have to wait a long time for another chance if you miss them as they go by.Combat is also fun, especially after you get the battle axe and start chopping people in two.  You can pull off some pretty gruesome kills on the enemies.  Your bow and arrow are done very well.  You get a mark above the enemies head that will tell you if it's going to be a one shot kill.  The bow also tracks along with the enemy pretty well.  Save scrolls are pretty well dispersed through the level, so if you use them wisely you don't have to replay huge portions of levels over if you die.  I finished the game without any freezing, which is a lot more than I can say for Rise of the Kasai.In the end, if you can tolerate a stealth system that could be better, a sometimes annoying combat system, and you don't mind that the engrossing story is cut way to short, then you should really give this one a try.  On the other hand, there are only really six levels, so if you want a game that will take you more than eight hours to finish, you'd best look elsewhere.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2010"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael R. Abraham \"Abe\"","summary":"A feeling in the heart that grows even stronger over time.....","reviewText":"***Note: This is my first review in over two years!!! Enjoy***Opening Statement...Well well well, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time. If you're reading this I will automatically think you are a Zelda fan as well as I am. I have to say this game was the only reason I bought a Nintendo 3ds. I had high very very high expectations for this game system and this game. So let's just jump right into the breakdown of what I would say for me at least the most anticipated game of the year for me.Presentation/Graphics...Well for starters when you are playing a game that is a remake of a N64 game you have to be wondering well how is it going to look. Are they going to revamp the graphics or stay true to the N64 fanboys? Well if it is possible they did both and blew it out of the water it is amazing. They stayed true to the N64 graphics while improving them. Much more colors sharper picture great transitions and the character models are awesome. The characters look more defined and there are no more blotched hands hahaha we all remember that. The temples are all redone and look so awesome if you are going from the N64 version to this one. So my verdict on the Presentation I rate it a 5/5Audio/Sound/Music...Well here is a department that I was really waiting to test out. I mean playing on the N64 it sounded good, but I wanted to see if there was a difference. There was and I was impressed. All the original music was in the game, it wasn't upgraded and it wasn't added too. It was the same music only cleaned up to sound good, so it was the N64 music just cleaned up. All the towns, temples, and ocarina music was nice a clean and sounded great. The sounds of Link himself and the other friends/enemies sounded all good. Once again all the noises the people make are cleaned up and it sounds better. Meaning not scratching noises or none of the out of place noises it's nice and clean. I rate this 5/5Gameplay...Here was another area I was intrigued to see how they were going to make it work. You were going from a classic N64 controller to a new handheld device with different buttons. However, I found it to be easier to play the game with the handheld device. Using the stylus and having 2 screens so you literally never have to press start unless you want to save your progress. The gameplay is smooth the transitions are smooth. The battles are nice and easy I was very impressed with the gameplay of this game. I give this category 5/5Story...Well the story is the same as the original game on the N64 however when you complete it on the first go around you unlocked the much anticipated Masterquest which was never released in the states. It is the same game but there are some differences. So if you are an experienced Legend of Zelda fanboy playing the Masterquest will add that little bit of difference you are looking for. This is a 5/5Final Thought...Well after breaking down every major part of the game for you I come to the wrap up. After playing this game I realize that the replay factor of this game is still very high for me, I will be playing this over and over just like the old one. I highly recommend that if you are a Zelda fan you NEED to get this game it is a must for anyone who likes The Legend of Zelda games. Even if you don't know what Zelda is I also highly recommend this game for the reason that it is a great adventure game and it will suck you in and won't let go until have finished the game. Then you will wanna press the start button and start all over again. I couldn't recommend this game any more highly then I am right now. This game is the best on the Nintendo 3ds and the Best game of all time. In my opinion obviously. My final rating for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is an 11/10***That's right I mean if IGN.com rated the first Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time for the N64 a 10/10 I believe this game only adds onto the greatness that the Ocarina of time gives the players. This is why I rate it so highly. This game is a must!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2012"}

I picked this up to hold me over for the later more polished shooters coming out, but was impressed with what it DID bring to the table.

Needless to say I was extremely hyped for this game. It is definitely not as good as the previous two installments in the Ezio Trilogy (AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations), but that still makes it an above average game. Constantinople (Istanbul) is the setting and I can't recall it being nearly as memorable as the other two. There are also some smaller locations. A certain extremely impressive locale that I won't mention in case it would spoil the game for those, but was probably the best of the series albeit a short part of the overall game. Going back to Altair was indeed refreshing as his story seemed to need much more explaining. Combat was indeed the best although I wasn't a fan of the new bomb crafting.The game's biggest downfall is that it is short. To be honest, I was a little taken aback when the credits began to roll. Next, I won't delve too deep into the implemented tower defense initiative that was tacked on since that is universally regarded as a pitfall of the game. While the game did offer more detail into the paranormal nature of the series, I was still disappointed with the \"revelations\" as implied in the title. There wasn't too much revealed that was already known. I was let down by this. I was waiting for a huge twist and there was none. Anyone that has played one of Ubisoft's other franchises, Prince of Persia, will immediately see its influence on a certain side mission series in this game. I found it to be quite irritating to be honest. Lastly, Desmond's story continues to be boring and the implemented little game was pretty pointless.Overall, it was fun and added some much needed detail to the story, but not worth the full price of $60.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2012"}

Over the past couple years, Yuke's and THQ's Smackdown Series has been by far the best wrestling games on any platform/console. Last year, Smackdown HCTP was no exception, and gamers today expect Smackdown to be as good or even better than its predecessors. Well, the Smackdown series has gone through a name change, hence WWE Smackdown! vs. Raw, and to be frank, I am both amazed and yet a bit disappointed with Yuke's and THQ's efforts in their newest wrestling installment, though I think its still the best wrestling game on the market today! The gameplay will remind you a lot of HCTP (Smackdown! Here Comes The Pain), which brough an innovative grappling engine to wrestling video games. if you are not familiar with the grappling system, you can hit the grappling button (on your PS2 controler) and use the D Pad (press up, down, left, right) to execute certain moves. A few tweaks have been added, including some \"side games\" such as a shoving contest, a strength contest, etc. this makes the game feel more like matches you now see on the RAW and Smackdown shows. O, and don't forget the clean and dirty meters (depending if your character is a heel or a face), if you do dirty moves or clean moves, the meter increases and when it maxes out you can be utterly invincible (clean meter), or lay down a devastating \"low\" blow (dirty meter). I really think Yukes and THQ did a great job keeping the grappling engine and adding the tweaks to make each match feel more realistic, including adding old superstars such as Andre the Giant and Bret the Hitman Hart (including their own entrances), but what about the AI. Since ripping the plastic off my Smackdown! vs. RAW game a couple hours ago, I have been very disappointed with the AI system. Sometimes, they go crazy, grabbing a steel chair and knocking me out senseless, but what does Edge do after that? He just stands and does nothing! I hope that Yuke's will be able to fix up the AI in their next installment, because a more realistic AI = more realistic match/game. My second problem with the game is where are all the undercard wrestlers? Yes, of coure you will see the Rock, Undertaker, Kane, Triple H, Chris Beniot, Booker T, Eddie Guerrero, etc. but how about some of the undercard wrestlers? Perhaps, they shortened the roster due to all the voice overs (which will be pointed out later), but more wrestlers less time getting bored fighting the same wrestlers usually a more in depth and overall funner game to play. And of course, last but not least, online play is a major letdown, I mean, you can only playing single matches, whats up with that? Hopefully Yuke's will improve upon online play (maybe Royal Rumble match? or a Cage Tornado Tag match? etc. who knows). The graphics and sound of WWE S vs.R is great. The wrestling models are almost perfectly done down to the last pixel, you can tell without a second glance that the wrestler you are pitted against is \"Y2J\" Chris Jericho in a Hell in a Cell match or taking on the \"Legend Killer\" Randy Orton in a TLC match and the Divas...well, they also look stunningly good. The arena looks like an arena, the crowd looks like people and not just a continous blob, all in all, the graphics are superb. The voice overs gives the game life, and although your main character can't speak (while playing through a season), every other wrestler can, including the Divas. The entrances are great and are fabulously done (in my mind), the atmosphere while playing the game will feel like you're there in the arena. Again, this just adds two thumbs way up to the presentation of Smackdown vs. Raw and makes the game so much better to play. From a wrestling fan and a gamer's point of view, I thought Smackdown vs. Raw was great. Although it might feel like HCTP, the tweaks that Yuke's implimented, including making the CAW even more in depth, giving gamers a chance to create their own ppv/title belt, etc. makes me feel that S vs. R is heading in the right direction. Without a doubt, if you are a wrestling fan, or a gamer looking for a good wrestling game, look no further than WWE Smackdown vs. Raw, it will not disappoint.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2004"}

As a teenage girl named Heather, players must explore and unravel the mysterious connection between the god-forsaken town and her inner fears. The game features enhanced graphical detail, a more complex storyline, and even more grotesque monsters than the previous games.","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"The silence is unnerving","reviewText":"If there is a game series that is actually capable of sending a shiver up my spine by its name alone its Silent Hill. I remember being so creeped out by the original that I had to set it down only to pick it up a year or so later to finish it, and as pathetic as I may seem I still have nightmares from the original game, and while the second wasn't as creepy now I have the third to leave emotional scars on me, and for that I must say thank you Konami!As an avid horror fanatic I am always looking forward to new horror games, especially those with the titles that are known to be good. I must admit that both Resident Evil 0 and Silent Hill 2 were mildly disappointing for me as neither generated the kind of lasting scares that their predecessors achieved. When I first saw Silent Hill 3 my first reaction was \"wow.\" Not only did it seem almost on par with the Xbox Silent Hill 2: Restless Dreams, but it had surpassed Resident Evil on the art style side. I became so excited that I was starting to have nightmares again.Finally Silent Hill 3 hit shelves, this is the first installment of the series that I didn't get used, or as a \"greatest hits\" title, and I'm very broke at the moment. It was well worth the money.Silent Hill 3 doesn't quite reach the levels of creepy that the original had, but it comes pretty close, and with its superb graphics it surpasses the original in many ways. The game's story is a lot less convoluted than the second, not that the story of Restless Dreams was bad, far from it, but it was confusing at times. This time around it seems that the story was a major focus, and therefore is much clearer. One moment I liked was when Heather went to pull an object out of a dirty toilet then had an offside to the \"audience\" about how sick and wrong that is and how she wouldn't do it, poking fun of Silent Hill 2's wallet in the toilet. The game ties together the first two games (finally) and the overall story of this evil town is starting to come to light. I won't go into details, but lets just say that I am very eager for a fourth game, there's a lot more to be done, I think.There are a few areas that need improvement however. This game looks great for a PS2 title, however the Xbox Silent Hill 2, and the GameCube Resident Evils still look better over all from a technical standpoint, mostly in that the images are more stable, less grainy, and feature a much higher resolution. However, this game does surpass the aforementioned titles stylistically. I only wish that this had been made for Xbox. Granted it made me glad I have a PS 2 for a change, but with as good as it looks it bugs me thinking about how much better it could have been on a more powerful machine. The PS2 controller is perfect for this type of game, however. Another area that needs to be improved is the camera. Survival horror games have been plagued with tank like movement for a long time. SH2 was one of the few to at least offer a \"2D\" option for those of us who like to run away with ease. However the often-awkward camera movement doesn't do the best job tracking Heather in the \"2D\" mode. That's not saying that the \"3D\" tank movement is an acceptable alternative. I'd much rather have Konami focus on improve the camera tracking for future installments. I also still miss the shadow babies and the demon children of the original. It seems that Silent Hill's only main stay is the demon nurses, as the fog of the previous installments seems to have cleared up some.Two things I'd like to see with this series, 1st better camera tracking and an engine geared to moving in the direction you press rather than the pivoting press up to move of yore, and a remake of the original with at least SH 3 quality graphics. While 2 was decent, 3 brought us back to the thoroughly grotesque images that haunted us for months (and in my case years) after playing through the original. Like the original I have had to play with the lights on, and my nightlight keeps me warm while I hide under the covers after playing.Horror fans everywhere, drop what you're doing and get this game now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2003"}

It is an intense and realistic game.  Expect cursing left and right(Don't be a wimp about it, Marines and Soldiers cure alot).  The sound and graphics are top notch in 1080P and if you have a good group of friends you play shooters with and you're a team player that likes intense combat with combined arms in mind.  This game is for you.  If you're a lone wolf sniper that tries to get your Sniper kills go play something else, this isn't your game.  Snipers 90% of the time in BFBC2 are a cancer that actually cause more trouble than they're worth.The single player was good but the music didn't really make it seem as desperate as it was.  Multiplayer is why you pay 60 bucks for this game.  I got over 200 hours on this game a 2.25 w/l and 2.04 KDR.DICE did everything right with BFBC2 but they're selling out the BFBC1 and BF2 fans for all the COD players.  COD players hate vehicles, large scale maps and like corners cut for them.  I worry that the future of BF games will be compromised by DICE trying to cashcow BF fans in favor of casuals.  The maps for the most part were small and narrow.  Even Arica Harbor and Port Valdez were almost completely bottlenecked.You can tell they got plans for the BF franchise and if you're a diehard BFBC2 player like me, you won't like it.Overall though, there isn't much to say, if you like good war games with intense combat, cursing, explosions, destruction and more.  Buy this.  Destruction does get old though.  It got old for me back in BFBC1 but you realize later on how tactical the destruction is.  Blow open houses, cut down trees to stop ambushes etc.There isn't really any debate.  Just buy this if you like good war games.GT: WARFIGHTER989","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}

It's Civilization, how bad can it be?\"  After playing it for a week, I realized it's like the game is half finished.Yes the new distance attack feature is cool, cities defending themselves is neat, but it's SO SLOW (1.5 minutes per turn?!) and the Workers are SO DUMB!  Instead of building Farms, Mines, and roads, they just SPAM Trade Posts across the continent.  So you're forced to manually fix each plot or end up with a city that is very wealthy but unproductive. Maybe if you could set a function to tell your workers to build or NOT to builder certain things.  For example, I HATE TRADING POSTS.  I typically only build Farms and Mines, allowing the added population to enhance my bottom line through taxation.  Why not have a simple button that says, \"Worker build Farms\"  or \"Worker, build Mines\"  NO!  INSTEAD all they have is the IDIOT AI that Spams Trading Posts and EVEN destroys Farmland to do it causing city starvation!Instead of being more complex and interesting than Civ IV it's...childish.  It's like the game wasn't even made for US users, and maybe that's the big secret?I went on the online Mod forum, I figured, \"Hey, it's been MONTHS.  If users haven't created content, AT LEAST Sid Meir's company will have updated some of the old Mods to play on the new game.\"  WRONG.  There are only a few Mods and the ones that are available are often glitchy because Civilization is not a stable platform.  Why is it that Microsoft can create a system like Halo FROM SCRATCH where you can literally make the physics effects blast a WartHog so far up that it can't be seen and not have it affect the game performance, but the makers of Civilization who are on SEQUEL NUMBER FIVE cannot make the game properly and easily modable.  I gave ONE extra star because they have Modability.Bottom Line, the company has lost their way.  We're living in an Open-Source Sci-Fi world and they're still stuck in History-Teacher mode.  At the very LEAST if they had their own different mods that shipped with the game.  I hate to say it, but Civilization has become like Windows, with each version getting WORSE than the previous one.UPDATE: After trying to play this to get my money's worth, I've found that even on quick game mode the game becomes unstable after Turn 250!  Tried this with multiple map sizes with graphics set to LOW.  Every time Turn 250 or beyond *crash!*If you're a CIV Fan please don't buy this waste of money, it's slow, frustrating, and the anger you feel will be more directed at yourself for blowing $60 on a game that more closely resembles work your boss assigned for you to take home than it does any actual fun you'll get from it.Maybe they should just reboot the franchise with a re-release of Alpha Centauri?

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"\"fillandros\"","summary":"Great game","reviewText":"This is a very great game, but not for insane kids who could snap at any moment, but anyway.

The characters are more detailed, there are more FX, and the environments are HUGE, which usually translates to EPIC!Gameplay:  9/10The gameplay is very well paced where you trade off from infantry battles, vehicle battles, air battles, etc.  Many of the encounters give you great weapons AND vehicles and it's up to you to complete it any way you want.  This works exceptionally well with their Co-Op system.  Halo 4 also includes 4 difficulty levels and their Skulls System, which allows you to Turn On specific difficulty features.  For example:  Enemies have more Health, Enemies drop less Ammo, Enemies are more resistant to some damage, and less resistant to others...  There are so many options to play through the campaign.Multiplayer: 10/10It's Halo Multiplayer with everything that you'd expect from the franchise.  You have the campaign options, Spartan Ops, which are missions designed for Co-op Play, and a ton of Competitive Modes.  It's just about everything that you'd want.Replay Value:  10/10With so many ways to play through the Campaign and a variety of Multiplayer Modes, you could play Halo 4 for months.  Play with your friends, play against your enemies, play on different difficulties with skulls turned on to test your skills...Maturity:  TeensThe Halo Franchise is always rated M because when Halo 1 came out, congress was freaking out about sniping in games and head shots.  This is just a sci-fi adventure where you kill aliens with laser guns.  There's no sex or swearing...  There are a few cinematic deaths, but it's no more violent than the stuff on TV.  If this was a movie, it would be PG-13.Overall:  10/10This may be my favorite Halo game.  With a human story, beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay, and epic missions, it's definitely a GREAT addition to the franchise.  This is a must buy for fans of the series or fans of the FPS genre.  If you shop around, you can get it for $39.99, too.Buy it if you love Halo.Buy it if you love FPS games.Buy it if you love Epic Sci-Fi.Buy it if you will play the Multiplayer Modes.Rent it if you just want to blow through the 8 hour campaign and play through the story.Avoid this game if...  umm...  I can't think of a reason other than not liking the genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2013"}

The graphics look great and the ease at which one is able to pick up gameplay makes it uber accessible to just about any age of player.  There are also a variety of characters to play as (they all pretty much do the same thing, but that's beside the point) and, even without having access to the challanges (I don't play with online access - kind of a purist that way), there is a lot to do, so it's not one of those beat it in a day or two type of things.  Honestly, you can lose days on this thing if you're not careful.I sat down with this game thinking I'd play a half hour and then get on with my day, but then I couldn't stop playing since I kept unlocking levels, characters, and other things.  Next thing I knew it was supper time.  The unlockable content includes characters, creatures that give you Lums, and throwback levels that I was unfamiliar with, this being my first entry into the series.  Man I wish I had been playing this for ages.  Rayman Legends is one of those games that is just about worth the initial price, but all the better if you can get it cheap.  Also this is the type of platformer that doesn't alienate your friends who aren't gamers.  They'll definitely want to play with you since multi-player is an option.

Also, for me playing a game as a \"super spy,\" going stealth was sometimes a pain to pull off during some missions because the enemies are usually there just waiting for me to \"go around that corner\" or \"open that door\" so that they can get me. The music, character models, hand to hand combat, and shooting mechanics though, were all incredibly well done. The opening theme song sung by Mya was the best thing I liked about the game.

Players are free to choose your own fighting style by customizing Dante to your advantage.","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"Better than the last one, not as good as the original","reviewText":"It's a large step up from the second Devil May Cry, but a far cry from the first one.  Most people have given the game nothing but praise, so I'll start out with the bad.Similar to #2, the gameplay is a bit stiff.  In the first one, it seemed like as long as your reflexes were good enough, you could dodge just about anything.  In this one, once you start attacking, you pretty much commit yourself to being entirely unable to dodge for a length of time.They were trying to push the \"difficult\" aspect of this game, and I can't deny that it's a hard game.  It's not the good kind of difficult though, its the kind that takes advantage of the games own weaknesses.  You're constantly fighting the camera, while most enemy's AI routine consists of \"get off camera, and repeatedly do ranged attacks or long-distance melee charge\".  That's right, off-camera, not behind you, to the side of you, etc.  Just where the camera won't let you see them.  This gets frustrating, especially since sometimes it takes you multiple seconds to recover from those kinds of attacks.  The enemies when alone are fairly easy, it's just the swarm tactics and trying to constantly dodge things you can't see before they happen (since the controls are sticky, you actually do have to know you're going to dodge a second ahead of time so you can get out of a combo).And finally, I know they were trying to portray a more immature Dante, but he gets annoying, fast.  The acting in the game has a few suprisingly well-done parts, but is substandard for the most part.Now, the Good.The game isn't all bad.  It's still got a lot of action, some badass moments, and a cool arsenal of weaponry.  The style system is so-so.  I like the additional moves plenty, but I hate the strategy aspect of having to pick one and stick with it until the next level or god of time statue (same thing with weapons).If anything, the game is addictive.  I've put about 30 hours into  (grinding my teeth the whole time).  I wish I would have waited till the price went down a little to buy, but the game is good at making the hours fly by once you're willing to accept its flaws.If they ever make a DMC4, I hope they realize what made the game great.  Faster, more responsive control, and enemies that were fun and challenging to fight, even in small groups.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Mass Effect","reviewText":"To start off this review, I'd like to mention my love of the original Knights Of The Old Republic game on the XBox. I've played through at least 4 times. The second game was good too, but the story was lacking a bit in my opinion... Plus the boss battles at the end of the game were BAD.Scroll forward a few years and we have Mass Effect on the XBox 360. Now instead of chosing a dialogue line that you wouldn't hear your character say, you get a dialogue tree as I like to call it. You use the left analogue stick to choose the line you wish your character to express. This was at first touted as being a fantastic new advancement, and in ways it is. The circle of dialogue shows a shortened version of what your character should say, and depending on whether you decide to level up your character's \"Charm\" and \"Intimidate\" skills, you can unlock more options.My first run through, I created my character and was pretty disappointed in how slim the options were in many cases. The choice of hairstyles is piss poor and you are expected to choose styles ranging from \"bald\" to \"not-bald-but-pretty-damn-short\".My character was known in his past as being merciless and doing whatever it takes to get a job done, including many, many lives, and this was noted by alot of NPC characters I met along my travels across galaxies.You set out on a pretty boring tutorial mission on a sparse planet... It will be important in the long run, but once you get to the citedel Space Station, you will really start to get a feel for the game, and realise that the dialogue parts can be among the most fun you've had in a game. Nothing beats intimidating people to pay you extra for an illegal job that you just carried out.Anyone that played KOTOR will no-doubt remember the amount of bugs that were in the game. Here you can certainly tell that this game was made by the same Developer. There are many texture pop-in problems and this can become quite annoying throughout the more you notice it. I also noticed slowdown during a boss battle and also during a large-scale on, where the frame rate dropped to under 10 fps, which is pretty abysmal in my book.Other than these glitches, the game looks beautiful. The variety in species is stunning, and players that want to go into detail on them can do just that by listening to the Codex entries that you unlock as you go.Side missions usually have the same formula on different planets, get to point \"x\" and kill everyone. Make it into base. Kill everyone. Find out reason for being there. Leave. Next planet of your choice.I did a decent few side quests, and still beat the game in just over twenty hours. This disappoints me, as maybe it's just me being old fashioned, but I expect an RPG to be over 30 hours. The first time I beat KOTOR, it took over 40 hours.Overall, the game has quite a few bugs, just like KOTOR, but also like KOTOR it is a magnificent game, and I can't wait for the sequel.9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Bryan \"BMG\"","summary":"Good graphics, but not enough weapons or multiplayer options","reviewText":"This game is pretty good, but I don't find myself really playing it too often. The graphics are the best I've seen yet. But that doesn't mean they're totally superior to other games. The graphics are just a bit better than other games, there's not a large gap but a small gap between this game and other games, such as Halo: Reach. I don't base graphics on cut-scenes because games could just play clips from a blu-ray movie or something. But the actual game looks good. I only played a little bit of the single-player mode, just to test out the controls. It was fun enough, like every other game I played, but I wanted to review the multiplayer mode that I'm more interested in.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------There are 3 main things I look for in multiplayer games.1. One is if there is a variety of maps to play on.Yes, this game has lots of maps that look different. There is a dark city, a tropical beach, even a stadium, and much more. And they all look fairly beautiful too.2. The second is if there are interesting weapons and equipment that handle well.This game to me doesn't have enough weapons. You start out with a main gun, pistol, shotgun, and bomb. You get a slower but still fast riffle type gun and 2 machine gun type guns to choose as your main weapon in the beginning. In this game it takes longer to kill someone, so it's best to work as a team, like Halo. These guns get boring after awhile. There are also guns around the map to pick up, they are interesting but harder to use, and still there are only like 5 guns around the map. The bombs are creative but sort of lame too. You only start out with one smoke bomb, and it doesn't really kill anyone, it's like a decoy thing. There is an ink bomb that doesn't really kill anyone either. There's also a fire bomb and maybe a regular bomb, but these are harder to find for me, or aren't in every map. So grenades aren't as important in this game, apparently.The shotguns are stupid and almost ruin the whole game, and is reason for me to almost give this game 2 stars. Since it takes a long time to kill someone with a machine gun, people just slowly walk up to you and shoot you with a shotgun. And with the shotgun (sawed-off choice), its one shot and your dead. Currently there is a mode that's called \"me and my rifle\" or something like that, where you don't get a shotgun, this is what I play sometimes.So to sum up this section, the weapons are sort of lame. I like that this game is similar to Halo than COD, where you have to shoot people for while, but there's not enough weapons.3. The third is game types for the multiplayer mode.This game doesn't have enough game types to keep me playing it for long.It has a survival mode that is more like Halo's than COD. It's sort of too easy and not challenging for me, so it's sort of boring. I never played it too much, because I'm afraid that I'll be stuck in it for hours, because I don't know how long it last or when it ends, and I don't like quieting in the middle of it and ruining other's plans. In it you can even buy back your life if you die, making it even easier.There is no regular 'capture the flag' because it has 'capture the leader' instead. This changes the whole game-play. Instead of just causally guarding your base, you have to run around protecting another player. Because your flag is actually another player that can shot and everything. So it feels more like a regular old death-match to me.There is  a regular territory mode too, that people should be used to by now. There is a mode where you can only die once, a \"no respawning mode\" or whatever too. There is no free-for-all death-match. There is team death-match, but it has limited respawning too. I like team modes anyways.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Another dislike is that you have to pay real money for skins for your gun, unlike COD where it costs fake game money. This seems sort of sleazy but is sort of interesting too. I can't totally blame this game because Microsoft's Xbox points are a ripoff mainly because of Microsoft.So this game is fun, but because of the limited weapons and game modes it gets boring too quickly. The sawed-off shotgun sort of ruins the game, but if you hang around some teammates they might get revenge with their shotguns, maybe. I get tired of modern weapons like the AK-47, so I like these weapons, but these weapons are still assault riffle types that shoot bullets, instead of lasers or whatever. But anyways, there aren't enough game modes either. I'm probably spoiled because I play fantastic games like 007 and Halo that have many very interesting options for multiplayer. But nowadays that is the main feature I look for. I mostly play multiplayer, and having different modes within it makes it more interesting.***********************************************Update---------I decided to give this game 2 stars after all. I wasted my money buying it and it's not fun.This game has a 3rd person view, so it's good to take cover and use your machine gun or rifle, but in this game it takes too many bullets to kill someone, but they can shoot you with 1 shot with the sawed off shotgun (that you can start out with) and you're dead, which is better played in a 1st person view. So this game sucks. You shoot at some guy running up to you with his shotgun, but he doesn't die, but you die in one shot. I see this all the time, its not just me, I don't die either when someone is shooting right in my face with a machine gun for a long time. So this game is useless to me. And of course, as I said before, there isn't enough weapons or game-modes.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2011"}

Well, I guess they couldn't help that after Nemesis, but still.I say this is where Resident Evil started to go down hill. That doesn't mean this is a bad game, but this doesn't feel as fresh as the others before it, who still play great in 2009. I'd recommend this as it is better than Resident Evil Zero, 4 and much better than 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001GGO1GG","reviewerName":"J. Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"\"Godfather II\" is a Worthy Sequel","reviewText":"In playing \"Godfather II\" I quickly realized it was like a movie skin applied to \"Grand Theft Auto 4\" but that was not a bad thing at all. Even the controls reminded me of GTA4. That said, \"Godfather 2\" loosely follows the real movie and is quite an enjoyable game.The graphics are of the quality of GTA4, but at times they are nothing special, with some cutscenes looking to be the quality of a PS2 game, but with better textures on the clothing. The vehicles and character models are pretty good, but as with most of these games--they degrade in the darker settings.The sound is great and it has some cues from \"The Godfather\" and actually has pretty good voice acting, including the actual Robert Duvall.I found the weapon wheel to be pretty useful and easy but the cycling through the weapons using the cross pad was not so quick and easy. The weapons are plentiful, but you'll find yourself just going through weapon after weapon that has ammo. Some are automatically upgraded but I really didn't notice much difference.The gimmick of the game is a Monopoly-styled board where you get to see the businesses you own and your competing mob families own. You can direct your soldiers and made men from the \"Don's view\" screen and have them bomb or attempt takeover of competing businesses. It's interesting at first but after awhile it is more distracting and works better as just a map.Being able to enlist and customize your \"made-men\" is interesting, but I noticed that no matter how you upgrade they basically fight and interact the same. I found myself spending money on generic guards to guard places I took over and then occasionally sending one of my made men to help out.The game takes place in several locations like New York, Florida and even Cuba. You have to take on about 5-6 rival familes and they have a similar structure with the Don at the top, followed by other higher ranks right down to the lowest made men, which are still better than the average soldier. You basically just go to a rival place, kill all of the rival soldiers and then find the owner of the business. This is the neat part as you get to figure out their weakness (i.e. some are afraid of guns pointed at them, others afraid of punches, etc.). When you get them to their breaking point, you can take over the business, but don't push too much or they will refuse.Another interesting gameplay device is talking to citizens and getting clues as to the locations of rival made men and how you have to kill them (i.e. throwing them off a roof, etc.) and working your way through another families' tree. The goal is to eliminate all made men to make attacking their family compound easier. The catch is you really don't have to and it isn't that difficult to attack and destroy a compound with all of the made men alive. In order to attack the compound you must take over all of that family's businesses.Overall, the game plays like GTA4 but has some features that sets it apart. It's basically a 15+ hour game and has replayability and multiplayer. If you like GTA4 type games, give this one a try.4/5 starsPros:*15+ hrs. of gameplay.*Good graphics for the character models and levels.*Involving storyline that expands the world of \"Godfather II\" movie.*The 3 different locations are solidly constructed and fun to drive and walk around.*Controls are pretty solid.*Enemy AI is good.*Sound is good--particularly the inclusion of Robert Duvall.*Plenty of customizations for your character and made men.Cons:*Repetitive gameplay, much like that in GTA4.*Enemy AI is not consistent. Sometimes it is too easy and sometimes too hard.*The Monopoly-styled map is a bit gimmicky.*Unless you do side quests and actually go after rival made men, the game can be shorter than 15+ hours.*Some of the graphics in the cutscenes are not that good.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003C1I06U","reviewerName":"R. J. Gutt \"Tigercat\"","summary":"The Greatest Detective","reviewText":"I enjoyed this game. Batman is very cool. He has a lot of gadgets to use.First of all, Batman has the capability to go places other ground-pounders have trouble to get to. This is important since many areas of Arkham Asylum are locked. I spent hours trying to get to the next area. This was a little boring, but it is within the style of Batman.Combat occurs every so often. In my opnion, combat is a little scarce since most of the time Batman is in Detective mode and trying to get to a locked area or solve a puzzle. Combat is fun, however. Batman only has one basic move, the 'square' button, but with enough combos in a row he can unleash one of two special moves. One is automatic takedown, which I was not able to pull off, and the other is throw a henchman, which I did twice. He also has an unlocked move to string up a henchman below a gargoyle. I suggest purchasing of this move early as it helps in some situations and is otherwise rare to use; I was able to use it once. Batman also has armor upgrades and upgrades to his many gadgets.This is not Captain America - Batman's Batarang ranged attack is only good enough to knock down opponents, not take them out. Still, the Batarang has its uses. I won't spoil the other gadgets since they unlock throughout the game.Detective mode is great. It allows Batman to see opponents through walls. This is very useful. Batman will also track key opponents and kidnapped victums with Detective mode. It also helps him move through hard to get through areas. Unfortunately, when in Detective mode, you can't see the very nice high quality graphics.The boss fights are very good, and there are a goodly number of Batman Villians to take on. Other than bosses, there are only a few different opponents, each needing to be handled differently. Henchmen, Armed Henchmen, Henchmen with stun batons,  Henchmen with knives, and Snipers and Lunatics make up the various non-boss opponents. There are also deformed henchmen called Titans, and these are mini-bosses.Batman: Arkham Asylum is a high quality game, with great moments and good video and combat fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0088MVOES","description":"","reviewerName":"Ashley F \"Ms. Finny\"","summary":"Most extensive Lego game to date","reviewText":"I think this may be one of my favorite Lego games (up there with Harry Potter) so far! TT has added more to this game making it much more time consuming (aka, worth my money) and detailed, which is great! My husband loves Lord of the Rings, so he decided to play this one with me. Even with the co-op it is taking us quite a few hours to finish the game. And just an FYI, We are 24 and 32, so I think it's fair to say this game is fun for adults as well.One of the things they've added in this game are the fetch quests. Throughout Middle Earth are people that ask you to find items for them. Some of these items are found in the levels (you get a mithril brick reward for this, like gold bricks in the previous games) and the rest are mithril items, which you have to forge after you find the plans for them. The plans are found throughout Middle Earth and the levels (you get a red brick reward, which you must buy, for those). To forge those mithril items, you must use the mithril bricks you have been picking up.As with the last Lego game, this one also has a map to help you find all of the necessary items to get to 100%. The map includes fetch quests (marked by a ?), mithril bricks, purchasable characters, red bricks (if you didn't buy them when you unlocked them), levels, other map stones, the bonus level, and bag end. The map can be opened up from anywhere by pressing \"select\" or at the map stones. In the map you can also select items and set them as your destination. Ghost studs appear leading you to the item. So far I've only found one brick that it doesn't lead you to (it's actually in a cave BELOW where the studs lead you to).One of the things I didn't like with the more recent Lego games was the dynamic split screen in co-op. While my husband was messing around in the options trying to invert the y-axis (which we never found) I noticed you could turn the dynamic split screen off in this game! I don't know if that option was available in other more recent games, but it's definitely available in this one! We did have to turn it back on a couple of times so Legolas could target items a little further away from him, but overall we liked the fixed vertical split much better.Not only has it been fun for myself and my husband, but my six year old son has really enjoyed it as well. He hasn't run in to any parts he can't beat (yet), but I'm sure some of the jumping tasks that are needed to collect mithril bricks (to get 100%) are probably going to be too difficult for him. Fortunately that doesn't prevent him from completing the story line :)I can't wait to see what Lego game TT comes out with next!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2013"}

The graphics are good (although I think they could be a little better) and the sound is good as well. The real winner here is the many technical moves and combos you can pull off with the characters. The shaolin monk and the drunk are the coolest characters to ever enter the fighting genre (with the exception of Lei from Tekken) The main problem I had with the game and the reason I only gave it 3 stars. (actually more like 3 1/2) is the button config./combo system. This is a real pain in... The fact that you have to hit an actual button to guard (instead of just holding back) is more of a pain than you can possibly imagine. And the combo system is very very very complicated and annoying.So, if you can get past the annoying and complicated button config. then you got a fun game to play.

For example,the music, although not excellent throughout, is pretty good. My favorites are the Volcano, Boss, and Gale Mountain themes. The Boss theme is ESPECIALLY good,though, one of the best I've heard. I know that many of you complain, &quot;Oh, I don't like the random battles.&quot; Well let me ask you this: Would you prefer 10 (TEN) MANDATORY battles on the world map before you can go on to the next area? I didn't think so. The dungeons and caves are a different story, though, as you can avoid most enemies (they appear onscreen)--unless you're going down a one-way tunnel. So the battles are a mixed bag, as you can see. Next, being a very early SNES title, the graphics and story are very bland--compared to later Squaresoft titles. Amazingly enough, I'm GLAD that Squaresoft made this game. Yes, GLAD. Why? Because when a system first comes out, companies aren't too sure what the full potential of that system is. Wouldn't it be dreadful if Squaresoft tried to put their BEST storyline, characters, music, gameplay, you name it, into this first game--only to realized that the SNES can't handle it, or that they could have done better later on? So I guess you could call this an EXPERIMENTAL Squaresoft game, just a way of sticking one's toe in the water.

Rpg's are known for their heavy reliance on story and character relationships, but few ever really do anything about it. Xenogears is the RPG that does not follow the curve, but instead breaks it and reshapes it.I've only played one other series that compares in theme and storytelling, Metal Gear Solid. The thing that sets them both apart is the value the developer's placed in creating a rich history and backbone to support the gaming world built on top of it. The story in this game touches on everything from philosophy and the meaning of life, to racism and the ongoing desire of humanity to view the world as group of seperate nations instead of seeing as what it really is, the same planet we all live on and try to survive on. The psychological figure that is the main hero, Fei Fong Wong, is something that only FFVII has tried to do with a chracter. The story is mostly about his torn identity. It is played out over the stage of the world and has more to do with the rest of humanity than he seems to realize. Does that mean he's the only character with real, human prodblems? Absolutelly not. His love interest is just as mentally fragile, as are all of the characters that take this amazing journey with him. This story is set against the backdrop of religion and the effect our actions will and do have on the planet we live on, which in turn effects all of our famalies for generations to come. Does this sound like an impossible task to take, trying to sum up all of these themes and stories in a piece of software that will only last about 40-50 hours? In most cases, it is, but not in the case of Xenogears.The gameplay does not take a backseat to any of this, however. The battle system was, and still is, unique and invigorating. It is a unique blend of turn-based combat and combo-driven mechanic's that always keep you on your toes. The graphics and music were about as high quality as you could get at the time. There is enough gameplay to keep you playing this game for upwards of 70 hours on your first playthru. There are cutscenes that show the war of nations played out through the use of giant robots and battleships that stir the senses. I can't overplay how much qaulity was put into this game's gameplay, and never at the expense of the bigger picture.If you never play this game, you're only hurting yourself by not having had one of the most incredibly rich gaming experiences of all time. This game should be emulated by all, but its pretty damn hard to follow such a class act.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2009"}

Now, before you all jump on me because I don't own one yet, I used to feel the same way, i.e. why bother to write about something you don't even have yet, etc, and used to berate people for that myself, until someone on here made (what I think to be) an excellent point--this is a review of your experience with the item and opionion on it, so if you have USED it for a time, you are entitled to give your view, even if you don't have one in your house yet. I still stand by my previous disdian of people that \"review\" things but have never actually seen or used them  though :0)Also I want to say again I'm NOT a \"fanboy\" I own, and like equally, a PS2, a 360 and an original XBOX. Truth be told when I have time to play games, I probably spend most of my time, still on the PS2, and quite a bit on the 360 (just got a bunch of new games for it) but I have a big XBOX library too. As a PS2 gamer I was very excited to see the new system, because I know I will buy one, eventually; I just needed to decide if it was going to be NOW.So, there's my ususal boring intro-as for the \"review\" I was able to spend a few hours on various demo units and really liked a lot of what the system has to offer. I like the fact it will play many of the games I already own. I like the fact that they didn't change the controller radically as far as shape or layout, but the \"motion movement\" or whatever it's called, and the missing rumble are hard to get used to. The graphics look great, but, I don't have an HDTV and don't really see a reason to get one right now, so as with my 360, games will look good, but not like on a HDTV. An HDTV is another thing I want, eventaully, but its a matter of do I NEED it now? No.A lot of people make a big deal that there are only a few PS3 format games out; that's always the case with new systems. In 6 months there will be plenty. I only got my 360 in August (so I could play Saint's Row, lol) and in the months that passed since the 36o was launched several good things happened (1) there was a dependable supply so it was easy to pick one up (2) there were many more games in the format available (3) you didnt have to worry about getting shot, lol. Besides as many have pointed out, gaming is only one function of the PS3; it can be used as a HD DVD player, media hub, etc, so you will get a lot of use from it until GTA4 is out.I didn't like the interface. I didn't like the fact that the PS3 can not read the old memory units. (it can use almost any other kind of card or stick though, at least the 60gb version can anyway-it has a multi card reader) I can't see this console, right now, coming anywhere close to the on line experience the 360 has, in both ease of use and varied content, although, over time of course they will probably be more similar, and, Sony's service is free-XBOX live is subscription based. I think both the 360 interface and on line are much better, though. The last thing I didn't like was, it is very big and bulky, for a console. I already have a 360 an XBOX and a PS2 (the old fat version from 2000 not the one they have now), so I am already tight for room I have to unhook, say my PS2 to hook up the 360 when I want to use it. There's no room on my desk for the PS3. Wish they made it smaller. But I guess when I get my HDTV I'll get one of those big TV racks.To finish up, if you have an HDTV I would recommend the PS3, but I would still wait about 6 months until the supply issues have been hopefully improved. If you don't have HDTV it's really not worth the money. HD DVD's do have WOW factor, but they aren't mass market yet. And lastly you should NOT in my opinion pay one penny over retail. That's just insane.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2006"}

Metal Gear Solid 4 is that game.  Simply put, this game is amazing.  It's indescribable.  It's unlike any other gaming experience ever, and the entire time you're playing it, you're constantly awed, jaw hanging open, and completely filled with disbelief that what you're seeing has actually been accomplished.The gameplay is unbelievably fluid.  You'll be amazed how easy it is to move Snake around, to adjust the camera and to take down enemies.  Nothing is clumsy here.  I was stupefied when I saw the game go from cutscene to gameplay seamlessly and without a change in graphics.  The cutscenes are truly the most cinematic ever seen in a video game.  You can easily visualize this playing out in your local movie theater.  The surround sound rivals most Blu-ray movies in existence.Story-wise, it's about what you'd expect of Hideo Kojima.  This is the final story of Solid Snake, and the closing chapter of everything you've been introduced to in the other games, including the prequel MGS3.  If you haven't played the other games first, I'd highly recommend you do so before starting this one.  In fact, Konami put a very convenient Metal Gear Solid: The Essential Collection out there for this very purpose.  Metal Gear Solid 4 does a decent job of explaining all the backstory, but to truly grasp the impact of some of the characters (such as Big Mama), you need to have played the others.  Your experience will be all the more enriched by it.  By the time you reach the end, rest assured all your questions will have been answered...from the fate of Big Boss, to Foxdie, to the identity of the Patriots.Yes, the cutscenes are many.  During acts 4 and 5, you'll find the cutscenes far outnumber the gameplay, but at this point you're so wrapped up in the story that you really don't care.  The ending is enormously long (so plan accordingly), but by the time the final credits roll you'll want to just start the game over again.  The game literally has no shortcomings.  It's a perfect game.This is truly the Game of the Year.

Note that this was my first time playing it Saturday and I enjoyed it so, but I really couldn't get the hang of it with a Wii-mote alone. Don't even get me started on trying to turn and drift at the same time. Can't get used to it!And I'd imagine it'd be tough for young users to play this game with a Wii-mote, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe if they are good at this game, they can dominate just like the best of them.I'm usually really good at all of the Mario Karts but I'm just not that great with the Wii-mote.But enough of the blab.This game starts out with about 12 characters, and has 24 or so in total (including King Boo who is heavy, but cool otherwise). The racing levels range from new, and mostly exciting ones, to older ones giving you a feeling of nostalgia, to totally horrible tracks like Rainbow Road. Yes, in general, that's usually a hard level, but this one is RIDICULOUS in its difficulty. There are so many unnecessary loops and turns it's quite disheartening for nearly anyone. Congrats to anyone who can dominate on this track.This game is the first to add bikes (which I don't really use) and tricks which are fun to pull off. You do tricks and you get boosts, but they are only done off ramps, or like tree roots.On a side and seemingly unrelated note, I loved Smash Bros. Melee on the GameCube. One of my favorite games on the system. Then the Wii comes along with Super Smash Bros. Brawl and Mario Kart Wii.Which is the better of the two? For me, it was Mario Kart Wii. Although both are fun.Is this game better than the SNES one? Yes, to me.Is it better than the Nintendo 64 version? Well, it looks better and doesn't have any glitches in it, so on that note, yes. But I didn't play battle in this one so I can't speak on that. We'll just say that it's at least on par with Mario Kart 64.Is it better than Double Dash on GameCube? Yes, yes, yes!4 stars.end note: I wouldn't get this game for single player though. Hopefully you plan to play with at least one friend. Or online.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0000A0MDV","reviewerName":"Matthieu P. Raillard","summary":"Terrific, but I expected more...","reviewText":"Let me get this out of the way: I LOVE the Gran Turismo series.  I am not a fanboy of any console or game, I just like fun games.  Some titles have achieved such fame or notoriety that it's impossible to write about them in a neutral way.  Well, here is my attempt!I loved Gran Turismo 3 because it was the deepest, most realistic racing game I'd ever played.  The graphics were great, the handling was true, and the career mode was insanely deep.All those things are true about GT 4.  The graphics are even better, to the point that I had to do a double take and make sure that these pretty pictures were coming from my PS2 and not my Xbox!  The same depth is here, with literally hundreds of cars to unlock, and a career mode that rivals RPG's in depth and time to complete.  The new \"photography\" mode is cool, at least for a little while, and the ability to download the pix you create is ingenious.Now for the disappointment, aka: the reason this game didn't get 5 stars.  This is basically THE SAME GAME as Gran Turismo 3.  There are some tweaks (mainly graphical), more cars, but nothing really new or innovative.  There is no online mode, which means that in many ways this game is behind last year's Project Gotham Racing 2, and this year's Forza Motorsport (which, by the by, has the Ferrari and Lamborghini license GT4 lacks).  The Uber-annoying licensing tests are back, which means you can expect to slog through hours of tutorial-level gameplay before being able to race... some crappy underpowered import on a lame track.  I know this game is deep, but you really have to have patience to make it to the fun cars.  At least you can transfer up to 100k of your GT3 credits and A/B licenses over from a GT3 savegame, which is nice.There is nothing \"wrong\" with this game, but it's just that it feels a bit bland and personality-less.  It's technically perfect, the graphics are gorgeous, but it's missing something.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"Raul Duke \"Gonzo HST\"","summary":"some of the best the genre has to offer.","reviewText":"Blue Dragon brings back a lot of good memories of classic RPGs ive played over the years. While not groundbreaking in any way, Blue Dragon takes all the eastern rpg conventions to near-perfection.This may come off as a kids game when you see the childlike characters and cartoony animation style, but for every time you see some cute animals dancing you hear someone yell \"that bastard!\" or you encounter some ridiculously challenging boss. even the hardcore RPGer will find a challenge in some of these bosses.The music is always fitting and usually quite beautiful. when you have the composer of FF I-V would you expect any less? i gotta say though, the boss battle theme feels a bit out of place. the total cheezemetal wouldnt be as bad without the vocals, and i know Ian Gillan (Deep Purple) is capable of much better. the voice work was all done exceptionally well though, with the main character Shu being voiced by the same actor as Izzy from the original cast of digimon. very recognizeable voice. i hadnt seen that show in at leased 5 years and i knew who it was right away. thats kind of pointless info, but i thought it was cool.The main thing that drew me toward this game was the job system. If you've played Final Fantasy V you'll feel right at home with this job system. you select a class (sword master, black mage, ect) for each character. you can freely change class when not in battle, and as you grow in each class you learn the skills and abilities associated with that class. as your characters grow in level you can unlock new classes for them, although there are only 9 classes total, which i found a little disappointing; however, the job system is still my favorite aspect of the game. character growth and trying to balance the right mixes of classes for each is done better in this game than most others ive played. its simple yet very effective, like most aspects of this game.Graphically, i think this game looks great. the world is full of unique and beautiful environments. from the characters to the environments and buildings, this is Akira Toriyama art all the way. this is one of the most cinematic games i have ever played. impressive pixar quality cutscenes and animations abound.Blue Dragon plays out in the standard turn based style, however, there are no random encounters. you see your enemies walk around the areas as you explore. making contact with them will start the battle. when the battle starts you have a list of commands (attack, defend, spell, ect) and you choose one for each character. i feel a much stronger sense of strategy in this than any other game like this ive played. there is a list at the top of the screen showing you the next 4-10 turns. certain skills can be charged to increase power. the more you strengthen the attack, the more turns you have to wait for it to actualy happen. the charging is done with a mini game similar to the 3 click swing of golf games. little things like this add some extra depth to the combat.the story itself doesnt shatter any conventions by any means. if you've played Japanese RPGs before you know the idea. evil being trying to overthrow the world/ragtag group of young heros set out to stop him and meet new friends along the way. its just that, like the gameplay, the characters and their underlying stories are done so well. i find myself actually caring what fate is in store for these characters. nearly everyone in this story has such a strong sense of charm and perseverance that you cant help but root for them.The experience offered by Blue Dragon will make the seasoned RPG player remember exactly what got them into these games in the first place. For those who havent played one of the many Japanese RPGs over the last 20 years, this is one of the best places to start.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2007"}

The single-player campaign was very interesting and the heists that were included really added some new mechanics! It was always a treat to complete a heist after going through boatloads of missions. The campaign in general has a wonderful storyline and was fun to complete. Finished with the campaign? There is a whole world to explore and the fun is limited to your imagination in this sandbox of sorts!Well, even then, it can be boring going around Los Santos alone and causing havoc. If you got a buddy or two, hop on to GTA V Online and do missions or free-roam together! I personally like that this game has an online feature that tries to resemble an RPG. The more you level up, the more stuff you can do. Of course, there is the usual hacker, but lately Rockstar has been cracking down on glitches and stuff. They also constantly add updates to continue the mayhemI highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of GTA V and/or likes open world/sandbox style games!

{"product_name":"B000HE9LL8","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Only worth it if you are desperate for a rhythm game on your DS","reviewText":"The Good: Wacky stories, decent selection of songs, fun mechanics when you get used to itThe Bad: High learning curve, songs are cover songs, low audio quality, only 19 songs, lacks modesThe DS doesn't have enough good rhythm games, but Elite Beat Agents helps fill that void with a campy off the wall style that any fan of the genre will enjoy. You play as three Charlie's Angels esque agents (men instead of women) with crazy hairstyles who go out helping people do impossible tasks that break real world rules. Various stages include helping a pirate find treasure, help a taxi driver deliver a pregnant woman to a hospital after a cop tells him to not speed ever again, or a movie director make successful movies. These are told in comic style frames and they are quick and funny to watch. You play about 30 seconds of a song then you watch the rest of the wacky story unfold, and how good you were at that segment determines whether or not they succeed in their goal or fail.The game play is different from most rhythm games in a sense that you don't follow colored blocks that fall into place and you hit it at the right time. The game uses solely the touch screen, but I couldn't really dig the way the rhythm mechanic was designed. You hit numbered circles, and depending on the beat, an outer circle will close in, but once it gets even with the numbered circle you tap it. The numbers tell you what order to hit it, but you must follow the colored group. Various other \"notes\" range from following a ball with your stylus, double tapping, triple tapping, or using a spinner to fill a meter. These are weird for rhythm games and helps add to the random crazy feeling of the stories, but it is really hard to master because timing is hard when trying to line up circles within circles.Later on the songs get harder so there are all these circles floating around and you can get confused and lost on the tiny screen and the game has little room for error. Keeping your meter in the Yes is important because if you are in the No after the segment you fail that part of the story. My issue is that the meter is constantly running down and you are keeping it up, so failing a lot in slow sections makes you fail faster. Once you get the hang of it you start having fun, but younger people may get frustrated quick due to the high learning curve.A rhythm game isn't complete without good songs and EBA is lacking here as well. There are famous songs here such as Village People's \"YMCA\" or Avril Lavigne's \"Sk8ter Boi\" but that's just it, it's a hodge-podge of random artists and these are just cover songs (remade by someone else). Not only that, but the audio is very low quality and tinny so it feels like a half-baked rhythm game. I like some of the songs here, but there should have been more consistency and less random pickings, plus there are only 19 songs so you can finish this in one or two sittings. The game also lacks any type of modes besides multiplayer, so you will get bored after a few sittings with this game.EBA has a great sense of humor, funny stories, and a decent selection of songs, but it feels like its missing something and the high learning curve will turn anyone away except the hardcore rhythm fans. This is a great weekend rental or something you can pick up in your bargain bin if you are craving rhythm action on your DS.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2012"}

Big, but not as big or powerful as a Big Rig, Monster Trucks are surprisingly fast for their size and are able to roll over most other classes of vehicle and virtually any vegetation they encounter.The game's list of playable tracks has also been doubled to 16 and are categorized along the lines of the elements and the different environmental zones are found on the island. These zones are:The Air Zone- Tracks high up in the mountain and featuring lots of big jumps.The Fire Zone- Track oozing with new land and pools of lava that come from the island's resident volcano.The Water Zone- Here players will find courses laid out along the the beaches and other water sources of the island.The Earth Zone- The typical rough, rocky mud-filled off-road courses similar to the tracks found in the original game.Multiplayer ModesIn addition to the wild, anything goes singleplayer festival mode players of the originalMotorstormgame will remember and relish,Motorstorm Pacific Riftalso provides addictive multiplayer modes for both online and local play. These include the same rampaging, music injected, 12-player online support as the first game, as well as multiplayer options for local action up to four players.

The game comes with a thumping 40 song soundtrack and players will also have the ability to pipe in their own playlists saved to their PS3 the ability to access others saved on your PS3's Hard drive. In addition for players who want to relive their moments tearing across the island, the game also features PlayStation 3 XrossMediaBar (XMB) functionality and Photo Mode.

It was one of the pioneers in physics based racing. With every track having lots of branching path, every branch suitable for a different class of vehicles.Here they have taken it to the next level. Races are much bigger. Apart from mud you also have other obstacles for individual vehicles classes. Small vehicles will get stuck in plants and other terrestrial hazards. This time it is lot more than physics. Some people are complaining that vehicles slide more than the first one, it is intentional as it forces you to use hand brakes for a  faster drift turn. Overall sense of speed has drastically gone up.This game is still Motorstorm at heart. They have added tonnes and tonnes of extras to the game to make it feel very fresh. Things like lava tracks, water jets for faster cooling, high air jumps all add extra strategy. It is not just driving fast. You have to try out all the alternative paths and choose right one based on  boost and cooling requirements.So many behind the scene changes- Explosions will destroy the guys next to you. You can do kamikaze on cliff edges.- If you are small vehicle you can lap behind a big one to clear off the vegetation and pull off at the last second.- Water shower is available only in paths that have more terrestrial danger for balancing. Either it is a rocky path or volcanic eruption.More and more I play, I keep finding lot more interesting tweaks.AI is also vastly improved. If you truly race well you will win. There isn't much of rubber necking. I also think the physics respond much better compared to the first one. Jumps and slides feel lot more natural. Graphics seem to be better than the demo. I think they have tweaked the xdr lighting. Every thing looks very polished. I havent seen any crashes or hangs.There is twice as many race tracks as the original one. There is also an extra eliminator mode. Speed events are my favorite, it is like slalom race. Where the flags appear only after you cross the current one. So it requires lot more agility than just boosting the way through. It is like the old ATV games.After play thing for an hour or so, when I tried MS1 it was a night and day difference. The new game also loads much much faster than the old one. The vehicle selection screen is lot more slicker and avoids the double loading screen. I love the fact they have added split screen. There is nothing more fun than pushing your buddy off the cliff. Using L1/R1 as action buttons makes the game much more fun.Hope they keep us busy with more DLCs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Treese \"Jack\"","summary":"BioShock Infinite is a True Gaming Masterpiece","reviewText":"BioShock was the first video game I actually played on a current-gen console, in that case the Xbox 360.  I was blown away by the graphics, the realism, and more importantly the story.  Roaming through Rapture was both beautiful and tense at the same time.  And of course, the \"Would you kindly?\" twist made me change the way I looked at storytelling in video games, and to this day I still enjoy it.I couldn't truly imagine a sequel for that game, but that was accomplished with BioShock 2.  While it was an enjoyable shooter, it didn't feel like the BioShock game I wanted it to be.  So when I knew BioShock Infinite was coming soon, I had to go for it immediately upon launch.  Not only has BioShock Infinite proven to be an impressive first-person shooter with all the spirit of the original, it has far surpassed my already-huge expectations for the game, and makes me question whether I like this more than the thoroughly impressive BioShock from 2007.As you well know by now, this installment actually turns back the dial to 1912, and gives us an adventure through an airborne city called Columbia, which is like an of-the-time postcard--beautiful patriotic scenery, barbershop-style quartets, and lively citizens bring the city to life right before your eyes, which is quite the opposite of what we witnessed in the previous game's environment, Rapture.The main character is Booker DeWiit, an investigator hired to travel to Columbia and bring back a girl known as Elizabeth.  What starts out as essentially a rescue mission turns into one heck of a fight.  Columbia is at the brink of its own civil war, between the Founders--the judge, jury and executioners of Columbia--and the Vox Populi, a rebellion of sorts that uses violence as their means to get their message out.  Making matters worse is the fact that Elizabeth is guarded by a mysterious and fierce creature only known as Songbird.Like the original BioShock, Infinite makes the player think about what they're doing, along with certain moral dilemmas.  Without spoiling anything, there's a harsh decision to make well within your first half-hour of walking around that can alter your course for the remainder of the game.  The choices you make will determine how the ending plays out, which gives it the same replay value we've come to expect from BioShock.While Infinite ditches the ADAM and the plasmids, we instead get our super-power fix through vials called Vigors.  There are many varieties to be found, like my personal favorite the Bucking Bronco, which sends enemies flying in the air so you can do some skeet shooting, only with enemies.  Other Vigors allow you to get machines on your side and make electrical traps.  It's a lot of fun to experiment with different Vigors, and even combine a couple's effects.  My favorite is sending out Murder of Crows and zapping them.Despite what another certain gaming news source has said, I didn't notice any padding at all during the game.  Each part flowed seamlessly into another, and I was constantly ready for whatever was next.  My only true complaint is something a few critics have pointed out, and I have to agree with; Songbird was extremely under-utilized in my opinion.  I understood why it was there, but I felt a sense like I didn't really get how it came about, or where it came from.  It's all trivial by the conclusion though, so that's good news at least.Other than that... no complaints.  There is a twist, and unlike the first game I'm glad to report that the ending feels extremely significant this time around.  The final battle is one of epic proportions, and to tell anymore would be giving a huge part of the experience away.BioShock Infinite truly is Game of the Year material, and now I'm prepared for every other game that comes out this year to be a slight disappointment in comparison.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

I've been playing FF games since I could walk. While most kids played Mario as their first game, my first gaming experience was FFI for the Nes, I was 3-4 years old just button mashing and doing crap, but there began my journey lol. I have played and beaten all the FF games except for the ones on the ps3, which I wouldn't buy anyway. I am used to FF games that use ATB (attack turned based) gameplay, obviously, so every time Square Enix introduces a new battle type system I get pissed off. They have been tampering and messing with the gameplay since FFXI and it's just gotten worse over time. Had it remained an ATB game, I doubt they'd have had this much terrible feedback. Anyways, I get that fans rather the old style, as do I, but to me this gimmick is the first that I actually like. It's unique on it's own and I think that's awesome. It didn't feel like all the other times when they were just implementing new crappy ideas just to be able to say \"we did something new\" regardless of how undeniably lame it was. It was a Wii game, so that's exactly what they did, utilize the motion controls.Crystal Chronicles is a spin off as well so you can't expect it to have the ATB system anyway, and while people complain about the way they created this one, I'm just glad it didn't take the styles of FFXII and FFXIII. Square obviously put in work in this game, and it shows throughout. The graphics are super gorgeous, the music is always great no matter where you are in the game and suits the environment well. The characters were designed very well, and the voice acting and humor is awesome, the story is interesting. I don't get what \"learning curve\" people refer to when they talk about learning the control scheme in this game. Maybe I'm just an above average gamer with more ability than others, but to me there wasn't a learning curve and the game was easy to get a grip on. If you're a closed minded individual or the type to dislike something just because it requires a bit of effort, you may not like this game though.Because of all the negative reviews here I never bought this game. Funny how my girlfriend got this for me for Christmas and it turns out I love it. You can't always rely on reviews, sometimes you gotta try it yourself. The battles are surely different. Lifting and tossing enemies, dragging them in and using their abilities, picking up near by objects like motor cycles with your psychic abilities and crushing your foes with it. I honestly don't get what's so terrible about this game. I am proud to say that in my opinion between the Wii and PS3, the console that got the better FF deal for the first time was clearly Nintendo. I make that comparison between this game and FFXIII though, not XIII-2 as I've never played XIII-2","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2012"}

So far I've been nothing short of blown away. Looking at this as a jump from a 360 it's a HUGE leap. The design is simplistic and sleek. The Kinect, controller, and console look right at home together as they should. The controller is one of the biggest improvements. It's more ergonomically fit for hands and seems to do better at keeping your hands and fingers comfortable during long periods of gameplay. The thing I find best about it is that the response time compared to a 360 controller is much, much faster. And if you purchased a charge and play kit, plugging the controller in will actually turn off the wireless signal and then treat the controller as if it's a wired one. Very good that MS did that so that people who play competitively don't have to have two controllers for different types of gaming.The Kinect is the next HUGE HUGE HUGE(I cannot stress this enough) improvement. The voice recognition and response time is the best you will find among motion/voice sensors right now, period. It makes it much easier to get around your dashboard and do things like put in those tedious 25 digit codes for online content. Instead, you can ask the Kinect to use a code, scan the code in front of the sensor, and it's done. Truly helpful.Then there's the console itself. This thing. It's been running without a hitch so far and running beautifully at that. It really shows how much of an upgrade this is by it's speed and power. There are bound to be false reviews(especially against Xbox One) saying it may have less graphics/less performance-this simply isn't true. The console itself does not decide how well a game performs, optimization by the developers does, and so far the games I've played on it are nothing short of astounding. Quick load times where there are load times, impressive graphics(this is coming from a PC gamer, mind you), and very steady frames. Overall I'm super impressed.Don't be fooled by some of the lesser reviews here, I can tell just by 5 minutes of browsing them that a lot of people are going to be writing false reviews to give this a low score. Let them have their &#34;console war&#34; and hear this: If you're in the market for a good, solid next gen console, you won't be disappointed with this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0009SQF0C","reviewerName":"A. Benoit","summary":"Bully the Bullies","reviewText":"Bully is a pretty fun video game. The playing format is similar toGrand Theft Auto IIIand those after it. Your character is pretty much free-roaming in between missions, there are a certain number of missions until you complete the storyline, there are side missions and collectibles in order to achieve 100% completion, and you have to complete certain missions in order to open new areas of the game.The main premise is that you play a tough kid named Jimmy Hopkins who has been dumped at Bullworth Academy by his mom and brand new (rich) step-dad while they go on their honeymoon...for a year. While at Bullworth, you quickly discover that there are very divisive cliques throughout the school. You have the jocks, the preps, the nerds, the greasers, and the townies. You just want to get on the good side of all of them and get them all to stop fighting so your school experience goes smoother. All of this while trying to pass your classes and not get kicked out of the school.This objective is somewhat hard to complete, however, because of sociopathic nut job named Gary. Gary's sole mission is to improve his standing in society and to piss on everybody else. It's his opinion that nobody is smarter than him and nobody is better than him. Everybody is there simply for his amusement, like chess pieces on a playing board.So your ultimate goal is truly to defeat Gary. Once you defeat Gary and make nice with the leaders of the major cliques, your time at Bullworth is much simpler.I haven't hit 100% completion yet, but I did complete the storyline at about 76% completion. Now I'm finishing all the bike and go cart races, and I'm trying to find the last of the G&G; cards, rubber bands, and lawn gnomes. This can get a little tedious once you've passed all the classes and completed the storyline, so I would suggest getting a walkthrough that lists the locations of collectibles so you can make sure you collect them all in between missions. If you want 100% completion, that's the best way to get it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2008"}

Oh How the Gods Tremble...","reviewText":"The God of War: Collection contains God of War and God of War II.  Both games have been remastered in 720p HD and given full trophy support on the PS3.  Both of these titles were PS2 classics and must have titles for anyone into the Action/Adventure games with a mythological twist.  With two powerhouse titles remastered on one disk, for those who wish to revisit and enhanced the memories of the PS2 versions, or those who never got to play God of War/God of War II this is a perfect collection to own.GAMEPLAYGod of War / God of War II  in fact, all God of War games follow the same formula in essence.  Kratos gets mad about something and essentially destroys everything in his path.  You do not mess with Kratos.  The gameplay revolves around taking Kratos through levels which are fairly linear; but this is linear done \"right\" I think.  As you adventure you will find various hidden chests to increase your maximum health or magic (and in GoW II, ability bar as well using Minotaur horns).  The gameplay alternates between having to battle enemies, battle enemies arena style and various forms of platforming and puzzle solving.  The platforming segments are not harsh at all, but with a static camera angle it has been God of War's weakness from day one.  Sometimes you get a really bad angle on jumps or during combat.  This isn't a catastrophic problem though as checkpoints are very generous and once the camera gets you, odds are it won't get you again since you are prepared for it now.Puzzles are fairly simple, usually involving timed levers for doors, pressure sensitive switches, pushing blocks around and timed platforming.  They are not overly elaborate, and serve to change up the mood of the game.  It gives you some downtime to relax after that major battle you just fought against 3 cyclopes.  Combat itself is handled excellently.  As you gain powers/magic it will get mapped to a controller button, and weapons you acquire also will get mapped.  Switching between spells or weapons is fairly easy and only gets easier as the series evolved.  Kratos always gets some pretty nice upgrades which tie into the Greek Mythology.Besides fun and fluid combat mechanics with some well thought out platforming/puzzles, what amazed me the first time through God of War was how they managed to take a Linear structure and hide it so well you had no idea you traveled a straight line TWICE.  The game always feels new yet circles in on itself multiple times.  Pandora's Temple blew my mind, back in 2005, at how the temple essentially was a giant puzzle.  It starts locked and as you begin to solve puzzles, fight mobs and access areas the Temple begins to circle in on itself.  You revisit some parts two or three times, just able to get that extra inch forward due to a new power.  This style is repeated over and over in God of War games and works wonders.  Seeing familiar places slowly evolving as you inch closer to your goal is very satisfying and shows just how much effort was put into level design.GRAPHICSFor those who played the original titles on PS2 this is the category that makes or breaks the purchase (especially if you still own a PS2 like myself, or a backwards compatible PS3).  The graphics upgrade to the game is amazing, in my opinion.  While God of War still looks dated and rough, it runs exceptionally smooth in 720p and the cut-scenes look much better this time around.  God of War II got the most out of the HD upgrade, with graphics definitely crisping up on all levels.  The sharpness of color is improved on both games but the real big plus here is that both games run at a much more stable FPS on top of having the visual upgrades.  The gameplay and visuals feel much more fluid with more subtle detail behind them.SOUND/STORYVoice acting in the two games is great.  A lot of effort was put into the quality of the voice acting, and the storyline for each game was well written.  There is clear direction being set by both games which merge seamlessly with gameplay.  Each cut-scene and dialogue segment adds to the story rather than just feeling thrown in.  In terms of the storyline and dialogue content, nothing was changed in the remastering, so there is nothing really new to be learned here.REPLAY/LENGTHThe original God of War actually has a trophy for beating it in under 3 hours.  The game itself can take 2.5 - 4 hrs on Normal/Hard  but I was easily able to complete the game in under 2hrs 20mins of game time.  God of War is the shortest of the games, especially once you know how to solve the puzzles and master the combat mechanics.  God of War II clocks in much longer, at around 7-12 hrs depending on difficulty.  Of course doing a speed run on a second playthrough with infinite magic and health you can plow through the game in under 4 hours.  Replay value is tough to judge. Both games contain Challenge of the Gods; set trials to test your skills.  God of War replay allows you to select new costumes to make gameplay easier a second time through, where as God of War II allows you to flat out cheat by using the hidden Artifacts you find during your quest(this disables trophies however).OVERALL 91% (9.1 / A-)Two premium PS2 titles... remastered in 720p for the asking price of about $10-$15 per game on average (as of 11/6/2011). That's a steal considering you are getting two classic titles from the days of the PS2 given a full remastering in 720p.  This is the best these games have ever looked and played.  If you are a fan of the God of War series then this is a great collection to have to give some visual upgrades to the games + trophy support.  For someone new to the franchise, you won't be disappointed.  While both games show their age visually (especially God of War), they make up for it with incredible gameplay and a very interesting take on Greek Mythology.  As long as you love Action/Adventure style games and don't mind some puzzles you will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2011"}

Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well.

MGS2:SOL has been anticipated by gamers and fans alike as the first MGS was one of the best action/stealth/adventure games on the original PlayStation. First off, the graphics and environments are absolutley astonishing. You'd have to awfully hard-pressed not to be in awe with how beautiful this game looks. Character models are highly detailed, right down to the emotion of their faces and how they react to different situations. Weapons are also very detailed and are very accurate to their real-life counterparts. Explosions, rain effects, water effects, anything we take for granted in real life looks amazing on here. Voice acting is superb as David Hayter once again returns as the voice of Solid Snake. The other voice actors are also very good. Music is easily the best the series or any game could possibly have. Composed by Harry Gregson-Williams of The Rock and Armageddon fame, is a treat for the ears. Especially the title sequence and opening movie, the music shines. End credits also feature a pretty good song, althought to me, it sounds a little like a Bond song in a way. Controls are simple yet complex. Most of the controls consist of pressure sensitive. For example, while aiming your pistol, pressing Square fires, but let go of Square lightly, you'll holster your gun. Also when you aquire a machine gun, pushing Square in fires, but hold it lightly and you'll be able to aim. The list goes on and on. The level of level interaction is also incredible. Shoot out a light, and the pieces of the bulb fall to the ground. Shoot a pipe and steam comes out. Also, depending on where you shoot a guard, he also reacts realistically. The story, while confusing and will require you to take a course in politics and the like, is great as always. Now, with all the praise I'm lavishing on this, I did have a few minor but one major complaint. One is the confusing part of the story, Codec transmissions cut in every time and could have been done in real time instead of talking heads, and Raiden. While I didn't really care if he was in the game, what annoyed me is that he took over a good portion of the game and that you practically have to hold his hand to do anything. The idea that Hideo Kojima had for Raiden sounded good on paper, but he's just a pretty boy and nothing else. Thankfully, on MSG3:Snake Eater( which i plan to get), you get to play as Snake(albeit Big Boss with a Snake codename). Also, the bosses weren't quite as good as the ones on the first Metal Gear Solid. Solidus Snake is cool, but I really didn't care much for Vamp, Fatman, or Fortune(although Fatman's pretty funny) and the thing involving Liquid Snake in Revolver Ocelot's arm is pretty ludicrous. But overall, its still a awesome game and once you get over having to play as Raiden, it's still offers great stealth action and loads of interacting with the backgrounds. I give it my highest recommendation. A 5 out of 5.P.S.For those of you that do like my reviews, I plan to get Snake Eater in the coming month, so watch for it then. In the meanwhile, check out my other reviews.Semper Fi, Carry On!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2004"}

Take the two kings of the genre, \"Resident Evil\" and \"Silent Hill\". Both work tirelessly to build up atmosphere, and while battling monsters can turn up the speed a little, these games are meant to scare people through psychological manipulation, whether it's cheap scare-tactics (\"Resident Evil\") or eerie surroundings (\"Silent Hill\"). Is there a game that involves the supernatural but also has a much-needed sense of action and speed? Thankfully, there is, and it is called \"Devil May Cry\".Don't get me wrong; probably the last thing \"Devil May Cry\" wants to do is scare the player. On the contrary, what this game demands the player do is take an arsenal of melee and long-range weapons and beat the living hell out of...well, Hell. And if this sounds intriguing, you can't be further from the truth. It's not intriguing; it's enticing!You play Dante, a half-human, half-demon who gets a kick out of life by hunting demons. One day, a mysterious woman called Trish crashes into his life - and through his front door - and asks for his help in defeating the Underworld. Yes, the Underworld. Forget single, lone-wolf demons; Dante will take on all of Hell by himself. But is Dante scared? Hell, no! He's ready to kick major demon-backside and demand an encore just for a laugh!The gameplay of \"Devil May Cry\" plays like a typical 2D platformer brought into the 3D world. Moving Dante is as simple as pushing the left analog stick in the desired direction. Granted, the game has \"cinematic camera angles\" that change suddenly when Dante moves into a certain spot, and this can cause a player to wonder which direction he's facing. Thankfully, in the heat of a battle, Dante locks onto the nearest opponent, so he's not at a disadvantage, although shooting an enemy off-camera can take some getting used to.Speaking of shooting, Dante's attack set-up is flawless. The demon-hunter can use either a sword or guns, and interchanging between weapons is as simple as pressing a different face button. And the game also has the added feature of rating your attacks. Perform simple shoot-outs or boring sword slashes and you get a \"Dull\" rating. Perform cooler tricks, like slashing an enemy into the air and keeping him there by constantly firing your guns, and your attacks are rated higher, the highest being \"Stylish\". And higher ratings mean the enemy leaves behind more orbs, which can increase health or be used to buy cooler attacks and tricks.There are also several modes in the game. The easiest is when the game performs the stylish tricks for you, which is a great option for beginners in the game. More advanced players will want to choose the mode where they do the tricks themselves. Add to this several difficulty settings, and \"Devil May Cry\" can make you cry if you aren't careful.Storywise, don't expect an Academy Award nomination here. The story is cheesy, and the voice-overs are even cheesier. Don't believe me? Try and not wince when Dante utters \"Let's rock, baby\" during the brief sequence before the start menu. Thankfully, the voice acting is acceptable, and it actually gives the game that B-movie tinge. Luckily, this B-movie has some good special effects.Graphically, you'll be hard-pressed to find a lot of PS2 games better-looking than \"Devil May Cry\". The environments are some of the most detailed ever seen in gaming. Unlike \"Silent Hill 2\", the colors aren't drab or gloomy to set a creepy atmosphere; they're vibrant and eye-pleasing yet dark and moody at the same time. The architecture is enough to render the setting of the game as a work of art, and the characters and enemies seem like living, breathing entities. The only con is a slight problem with jaggies, which is found persistently in many PS2 games, but thankfully they're not an eye-sore and are easily overlooked.Soundwise, the soundtrack is a mixture of dark, depressing downbeats and furious hard rock instrumentals. The slow, moody downbeats are played when Dante is searching the castle, but when he runs into enemies, cue the gothic hard rock! Overall, the music does fit the nature of the game pretty well, although it's sometimes used to an extent that a player can't hear the cheesy dialogue of characters as well as they'd like to.Overall, \"Devil May Cry\" is a fast-paced, pure-action gorefest that is not to be missed by any action fan. Some might argue that the game is a little short, but most people might not even realize this until they're halfway through the game on the highest difficulty level. But be warned: \"Devil May Cry\" is a mature game, and although it doesn't live up to its M-rating like \"Twisted Metal: Black\" or \"Grand Theft Auto III\", it is still mature enough to warrant caution to parents and anyone who can't stand R-rated movies. But with that said, \"Devil May Cry\" is undoubtedly one of the Playstation2's must-have titles.Trust me, you've have a devil of a good time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2002"}

But in many ways, technical isn't deemed superior to simplistic. Now with games of Metal Gear Solid and even Tenchu: Stealth Assassins, fights are recommended to be avoided, stealth is now your friend, and numerous tactics are provided: sliding against walls, crawling past guards even the cardboard box method in MGS1.To die hard action fans such as myself though, you can't beat the sense and overall feel of straight forward fights, no hiding, and no running. You put up your fist, your sword and now your infinite ammunition hand-guns and you break through anything in your path. And it's the sheer feel of action, that isn't contained, but in fact over the top and out of control that gives Devil May Cry new life in the decaying genre of action games that are intended to play as a classic 2D action game in 3D worlds.From Capcom, you necessarily wouldn't expect this type of game. Now there is certainly no denying Capcom knows a thing or two about fighting games, but lately that as well as survival horror has been the main titles on their release list. Of course Devil May Cry contains multiple factors easily reminiscent of the Resident Evil and Onimusha engines. It's not a combination of the two however; it does create an entirely new feeling of its own.You control the demon-warrior Dante, a sword wielding mercenary who packs two handguns (each with their own names!) with a sole mission of cleaning the floor with the demons of the 21st century. After acquiring certain weapons and abilities, raging combos and powers ranging from lightning attacks discharged from Dante's hands to tossing your sword like a boomerang will be at your disposal. Some will even be required to progress through levels (hence the double jump). Special skills are earned by collecting red orbs and then exchanged at an idol where items can also be found. Once a certain sword is equipped a \"Devil Trigger\" meter is given. Connected hits on enemies will charge it and once filled; Dante can unleash powerful attacks by turning into his Devil form virtually making him indestructible.Battle is simplified to three controls, attack with sword, attack with guns and jump. Combination moves play an important role during DMC being ranks can be achieved during battle ranging from \"Dull, Awesome and the elusive Stylish\", stacking up Stylish combo's will most likely guarantee an A ranking after levels, unless it is a time based objective. Sadly for the fighting system, there is no block button which can be very frustrating at time when dozens of enemies are attacking at once, instead the jump button can also be used as a dodge method which salvages this fault a little, but in a game requiring sword attacks and where enemies can defend themselves, I see no reason why you shouldn't be able to. Luckily the range of attacks can hit almost every enemy within a 180 degree section. That's a good thing being there is no lock on feature, and you will be facing up to eight enemies at once nearly every battle.The environments are all cantered on a rusted castle, from dark chambers, underground water passages and gardens. The detail fit into these areas are no joke, everything is animated incredibly, there is a lavish fight in an area of waist deep grass and trees that left me in trance at the detail put into the surroundings. And much as Resident Evil and Onimusha, the lighting effects are top-notch. Dante is walking down a hallway during a thunder storm in the middle of the night, lightning flashing through the windows and crevices temporarily giving him a glimpse of the darkened hall ahead. Of course these little effects come to no surprise given Capcom's past creations. Fantasy touches, yes, but once again multiple areas are revisited again and again. Back tracking becomes very unattractive in games such as this being it begins to give a sense of complete repetition through non-playable terms. You'd think with 128-bit systems these days, companies could give more variety to gamers.The game is broken up into 23 missions, which is a first for survival horror genre. The games course runs from 5 to 2 hours depending on how deeply you will delve into finding hidden items. After each mission red orbs are awarded for you combo rankings and time taken. Certain objectives are assigned to each level, some involving puzzles that are incredibly simple and hardly take any thought whatsoever. Some may enjoy the frequent breaks during game play, but the missions aren't needed being how short of time is taken for some, an example is the traditional get from point A to point B before time runs out, the only mildly disturbing factor is that it can be done in less that 60 seconds.So what is the upside from the preceding glitches? The amazing thing is Devil May Cry is the first game since the birth of the 3D gaming engine to revive the classic action found in the old dynasties of Streets of Rage and Strider. Once again out of control action is unleashed into glorious 128-bit graphical power as it should be. It's pure kinetic energy, non-stop adventure that's like a geyser just waiting to burst once enemies appear on screen. Capcom pulls out what so many companies have failed with recently, in a simple phrase I can deem it a go for broke action packed extravaganza.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2002"}

{"product_name":"B004X56PWK","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"A Spindash Towards The Top","reviewText":"Sonic has fallen from grace and risen from the ashes more time than perhaps any video game character. Sonic Team graced us with two fantastic entries on the Dreamcast with Sonic Adventure 1&2, then burdened us with the mediocre Sonic Heroes and the god-awful Shadow the Hedgehog. Things were improved by the fantastic Sonic Rush titles, only to fall to the pits again with the notorious Sonic The Hedgehog (2006) and the middling Wii entries. However, a consistent pattern in likability reminiscent of Sonic's Genesis days has been taken up in recent years with the past two or three games. Sonic Generations continues this steady progression towards greatness, while simultaneously putting to bed something Sonic fans have begged for over the past decade: bringing back old-school Sonic gameplay.The plot is simple enough, and voiced with perfection by the new voice cast Sega brought in with last year's excellent Sonic Colors. Sonic's friends get sucked into a sort of time vortex by an ominous enemy known as the Time Eater. In order to get them back and defeat the new villain, Sonic must travel back through some of his past adventures, teaming up with his younger (and more portly) self from the Genesis games. Nothing too deep, sure, but it's an excuse to travel back and see the best of Sonic's levels put into glorious HD.And glorious is the best word to describe the makeover these levels have gotten. Sega didn't skimp on the budget this time around, obviously hellbent on making their mascot relevant again. Each level is filled with vibrant colors that suck you right into the cartoonish world that the blue hedgehog and company inhabit, making for a more immersive experience than past entries. This is the best-looking Sonic game in years, and the visual spectacle alone is worth the price of admission.But looks aren't everything, which is why Sega didn't neglect the gameplay aspect of things. In order to tackle a Zone, a player must utilize both Modern and Classic Sonic in one Act each. Both Sonics control with an entirely different moveset that suits what area of the franchise they're representing.Modern Sonic controls much like the ever-evolving character he's been since Sonic Adventure in 1999. Complete with sliding, griding, and homing attacks, this version of the hedgehog is an incredibly versatile character who seamlessly nails both 2D and 3D gameplay. This is the most refined gameplay to come out of the franchise in quite some time, and Sonic Team should be proud of the work which went into this part of the game.What I didn't like so much, however, was Classic Sonic. I'm a sucker for the old Sonic games, I'll admit, but the inclusion of the retro controls in a new game feels done out of obligation and not out of genuine concern of whether it feels natural or not. It would be a bold-faced lie to say that these levels are bad, because they are, in fact, quite fun. It's a blast revisiting Genesis-era levels with the control scheme that they are made for, and seeing 3D levels done with 2D in mind is an interesting treat.However, these levels never really reach the level of raw energy and speed exuded by the Modern Sonic levels. While I do acknowledge that the point of these stages was to capture the more steady pacing of the older titles, it made me want to actually play the old Sonic games instead of seeing their gameplay shoved into a new entry. Perhaps this will dispel the notion from people's heads that they want more Retro Sonic, and remind them that if the new Sonic has excellent gameplay, they won't need to sit around and wish for the \"good old days\" to return. Still, the notion of putting these levels in was still a nice gesture from Sega, and a good trip down memory lane for longtime fans.Even with my gripes, Generations still stands as a great entry in the Sonic franchise, and brings together the best of both worlds from the hedgehog. Sega's commitment to restoring their flagship franchise to it's former glory is admirable, and is beginning to be what fans always wanted Sonic in 3D to be: fast, inventive, edgy, but most of all, fun. And at the end of the day, you can't find much fault in that.Story: B+Gameplay: B+Graphics: A-Sound: A-Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CPK","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"An experience than a game but what one it is","reviewText":"There's an interview floating with Suda 51, the main man behind one of 4 formally Gamecube Capcom games(the other 3 being PN.03 which is only Gamecube so far, Viewtiful Joe which is multisystem now and Resident Evil 4 which has a PS2 version soon). The game was called Killer 7 and Suda answered a question about the gameplay: \"I don't know yet\". It was built from the ground up with the story/presentation and the gameplay came last, which is a big no-no in game development. May not be a typical game but boy is it something to be seen.Story: This is near Evangelion confusing, people(maybe less so). Basically in the year 2003, nuclear energy is banned, missiles destroyed and radioactive materials are disposed of. It's a time of peace but a group called the Heaven's Smiles are here to stop it. Freaky looking monsters roam the cities and they actually explode, making kamikaze-like soldiers. In comes Harlan Smith, a man in a wheelchair who has the ability to physically conjure up his 7 personalities(think the movie Identity) who have special abilities. So Harlan must battle the Heaven's Smiles and it's leader.Graphics: Outside of the game's great anime cutscenes, the graphics almost look poor compared to Capcom's Resident Evil 4. Hell even Viewtiful Joe. But it has a look on its own, going for a cel-shaded look but a bit less polished. Best way to describe them is stylish, not stunning on a \"wow\" scale but more on a unique one.Sound/Music: The music in the game is basically ambience-like with some more ambitious ones thrown in. The voice acting is really superb, on par with the Metal Gear Solid games, it's just the repetitiveness might drive you nuts. Every critical hit(details on that below) and the character does a catch phrase. While it's cool to hear them going \"hurts, doesn't it?\" or the soon-to-be fan favorite \"you're ****ed\", they say EVERY time you get a hit. Also the laughter has the creepiness to it but not in a flesh crawling way, more in an impending doom way.Gameplay: The gameplay in this game, among other things, is going to have some big debate soon. Best way to describe it is an exploration rail shooter. Basically you have a map and you walk around this map, however only on predetermined paths. Meaning you can't go anywhere, only certain areas. You press A to walk forward, if you hit a junction where you can go left or right, click which way you want and you go that way. Pressing B turns you around.While advancing, you might hear laughter. That's your cue to stop, press R to go into first-person and press L which'll \"scan\" in front of you, revealing the enemy(ies). Some have distinct ways on killing them. For example you have to shoot one in the arms so he'll turn and his back'll have the weak point allowing you to kill it. Others have heavy armor requiring the big character. They all have certain areas which'll net instant kills, giving you blood which comes in thick or thin, thin being more for health recovery and special move meter while thick is a \"levelling up\" method.All this talk and I don't mention the 7 characters, how silly of me. There's Garcian Smith, who can resurrect your dead party members but beware, if he dies, game over. Dan Smith can use powered up bullets for that extra kick. Kaede Smith, the only female, probably has the weirdest ability. She slits her wrists and can break down barriers or reveal secrets. She comes in handy as her gun as a scope, allowing for snipe kills. Con Smith is incredibly fast and can fit in areas the others can't, also he's blind but he has a Daredevil-like ability to find proper and hidden paths.Coyote Smith is a former thief so he's great at picking locks. Not to mention he's an incredible jumper, reaching incredibly high areas. Kevin Smith(no, not the Mallrats director) can turn invisible and throws knives. And finally Mask de Smith, a big pro wrestler who wields grenade launchers and break down walls and obstacles.One last thing before I close, this is NOT a game for kids. Violence and gore, sexual themes and swearing are very prevalent in this.After Grand Theft Auto came out, there was a lot of free-roam games that came out like Destroy All Humans. Halo came out and all of a sudden we're getting those commando-like games where you're with your own army/group. Killer 7 is probably the most unique game I've seen in quite awhile. Don't let the weirdness fool you. You have to try this. At least.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2005"}

You play Monkey, a wandering nomad captured by Pyrmaid slavers. After crashing aboard ship, you are forced via a slaver headband to help Trip, a girl kidnapped from a distant town to get home, traveling through a jungle like apocalyptic hellscape called \"New York City,\" which is filled with predatory mechs.Graphics and sound are above average, though some of the gameplay effects, namely the color coding ability you can get for hand to hand combat render the mechs overdrawn and bizzare to look at. Environments are nice, though climbable and non climbable objects are hard to tell apart on the fly, especially in the more open areas. Otherwise, this game is very pretty to look at, and the voice acting is superb, with good, well thought out dialogue that has a good balance of drama and comedy, and they manage to work the Monkey Kings abilities in so subtly that you'd not know it if you were not familiar with the story.Gameplay is fairly basic hand to hand, with climbing and navigating puzzles sprinkled throughout. Similar to Ico, you must protect Trip from all the encountered bad guys, but Trip can at least provide distractions to help Monkey get into better position. There are even a few stealth puzzles, those these're quickly abandoned in favor of monotonous, slogging combat. After a while it becomes more an annoyance than anything else, as unkless you're jumped upon by 4 mechs simultaneously, you'll never experience any real challenge outside of boss fights, and those are bizzare in they're all run around until you're told what to do sequences, rather than dropping you into the mire and left to fend for yourself.Overall, this game is good, with a well made if left field ending, good environments and a few decent puzzles and good acting. At just under 6 hours though.... don't waste your money. A two day rental on a weekend, and you're done.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2010"}

The voice acting is also extremely good, and the animation is easily the best I've ever seen in a video game.  The play control is quite crisp and concise as well, and the story is outstanding.  And finally, the action is tense and gripping.  I really could gush on and on about how awesome this game is, but I did find a couple of faults.First of all, it's just too dang short.  I'm not sure what effect making it longer would have, though, because it tied up so nicely at the end.  The other aspect I disliked was the repition, but it doesn't outdo itself.  It seemed like every time I was just getting tired of a certain scene, the scene would end.Overall, this game is just not quite like anything I've played before.  It's a very linear story, but that's where a generalized description pretty much ends.  I'd say the game is worth 9 out of 10 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002CHJ8C","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Great Tekken Game","reviewText":"All the Tekken games are great, but they've always been missing something. The thing was, you could play Tekken for hours and get no reward other than self-satisfaction. Now, you get money. You can play arcade matches for days and get money to buy things to put on characters while increasing the rank of your favorites and, as the manual says, learning new skills. I haven't confirmed this new skill buisness, but I haven't reached legend rank yet. About the money: while you can't make characters have insane things on them, it is interesting to see different variations on your favorites. You can make Kazuya look really cool with glasses, iron shoulder pads, and a gun on his belt. You can rig out King with a bamboo stick. You can give Nina a katana for her back. While of course you can't use these weapons and objects, it is cool to see your favorite characters carrying them around.The game has more characters than tekken 4, and about the same amount as tekken tag. Alot of old favorites are there such as baek, anna, and roger. There are also 4 new ones. The main boss is cheap beyond belief. He has this one ground stomp attack that knocks you off balance for at least 3 seconds. His flame strike thing takes away half your health. He can cast his flame thing two times in a row, meaning it's really hard to dodge. I figure most pros will consider him to be too cheap to play and, without saying anything, agree to not use him. Raven is a really cool ninja with some interesting combos where he flips around and stuff. Asuka is a replacement for Jun. Feng is a Chinese dude who has really powerful punches and kicks.The story mode is basically the same as Tekken 4. Now, around match 4 and 7, you will see two cinematics in which your character confronts two of their enemies. There are some interesting things to see now. If you lose against Paul with Law, you will see a short cinematic. If you lose against Raven with Yoshimitsu, you will see a goofy cinematic in which Raven tries to teach Yoshimitsu something new. Little things like this will make the story mode more interesting. My only complaint is that nothing is really resolved. Throughout the Tekken series, no rivalries have been resolved at all. Most of the time, the creators seem to get bored and spark new rivalries, yet they never resolve old ones.There is a new mode that's like tekken force, only it's for Jin alone. I haven't tried it yet, but there is a save feature, meaning that it is probably somewhat longer than the normal tekken force.The last new thing in the game is the voice acting. Some characters, like Nina, sound exactly like they should. Some characters, like Paul, could sound better. Yet, some characters, like Law, sound nothing like what they should. It's laughable that Law speaks fluent English, yet two seconds later he is making fighting grunts like Bruce Lee. Once you hear him speak, you will be confused as well. Some character voices have been changed. Steve now has a strong British accent. While I don't mind British accents, this is not what he sounded like in Tekken 4. In Tekken 4 he didn't speak alot, but he did say some things at the end of matches and at the last cinematic. Now, he has this very thick British accent which I can't imagine getting use to. Christie's voice has been changed as well, yet it sounds fine.I love this new Tekken. The creators tried to increase the replayability, while respecting fans of the game. They accomplished that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2005"}

After purchasing two other games here on amazon, I had some change left over on my credit card and thought \"hey why not?\". So I bought it, and at $7.00 I didn't care if it turned out to be lame or not cuz it was cheap as hell. You should know up front that games like these make me feel to throw up and I hate them all. I'm also a hardcore RPG gamer so games without a solid story hardly ever appeal to me. Games that thrive on killing such as Tenhcu etc make me feel upset to the stomach, and I even vomited once, so I knew what I could be in for with this one. Surprisingly, I haven't thrown up yet, or even felt like it, an this makes the murders in Tenchu look like kids pushing each other down in the sandbox. It's horrific yet, it doesn't bother me. It's absurd yet, I don't mind. It's out right ridiculously disgusting and for some reason I can't put this thing down! I dunno what's happening to me but either I'm changing or this game is so radically unique that even a guy like me can't get enough. It's only 7 dollars, you got nothing to lose.

Everything not great about the game though.","reviewText":"So keep in mind I played this game for the first time shortly after Mass Effect 3 came out. So I'm reviewing this game on face value and not taking into account how this game has aged or how it may have compared to games back when this was released. As always my video game reviews revolve around 3 things. Story, Gameplay, and characters with order of importance in that order. For reference I played this game on Steam.Story: 7/10The story was great. As usual Bioware does a good job on the story and the progression. It kept me interested all the way through. The difficult decisions without the knowledge of how it would impact my future was greatly appreciated and provided another level intensity. The constant irritation with political motives versus what is good for the galaxy kept things interesting all the way through. There really isn't anything to criticize about the story. It wasn't completely epic or anything but just a good overall story. Like I said it kept my interest. Was it the best story ever? No but it was good.Gameplay: 5.5/10This may be the weakest portion of the game. It's possibly because this section has not aged well but there are several weaknesses to the game. The mining for minerals portion of this game was rather boring and really was just a giant time suck. The number of items you picked up in this game was ridiculous. You were constantly picking up weapons and armors and upgrades to the point where they just became way too much to deal with and you were tempted to just sell everything to clear room. While the weapon system wasn't too bad, the ammo system was awful. You had to constantly switch back and forth between different types of ammo depending on what type of enemy (synthetic vs. organic) you were fighting. And when you have 50 different ammos..it can be rather difficult to swim through all of them to find what you want. Overall the gameplay wasn't awful and for the timing of the release it may have been really good...but after a while some of the elements of the gameplay just became taxing and distractingCharacters: 7/10The characters weren't overly bad but weren't overly good either. My favorite characters were easily Wrex and Tali with Garrus being pretty good as well. However, the human characters, with shephard included, were just overly boring. Williams was the best of the three but to a larger degree all three playable humans were just stale. Shephard was almost robotic as far as emotions at some points. Character development was average. Some characters had really interesting backgrounds while some were snooze fests. Some characters were so boring an uninteresting that I couldn't force myself to care about their backstory (here's looking at you alenko). The supportive characters were pretty good..namely joker. Overall the characters weren't awful but weren't really noteworthy either.Overall: 6.5/10Overall this game was pretty good. If you can get through it before some of the gameplay elements start to really tax you, this game is rather enjoyable. If you are a fan of RPG's and well developed stories, do yourself a favor and give it a shot. Play it on steam though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2012"}

However, now that Playstation 2 and Grand Theft Auto 3 have been released, there is literally no reason to bother with this game.  The graphics look bad, even for PS1.

There are many annoying glitches as well, like falling through the street for no reason (game over), and cops that smash your car over or through walls and buildings, trapping your vehicle in them.  Also, the vehicles seem to drive VERY SLOWLY on the streets.  pedestrians run from your car to avoid being hit, and if your car does hit them, they pass through the vehicle as if through thin air.I will give some credit to this game-- the &quot;take a ride&quot; feature allows you to drive freely through very realistic renderings of Chicago, Havana, Las Vegas and Rio.

If you like military squad based games, this is definately for you.  The graphics (when it came out) were pretty top-notch and had some extremely fun multiplayer gametypes.  I actually didn't start playing this game until Island Thunder was already out (which I played like crazy!) and it still held up as a great game.  The sounds in the game really made it seem realistic, like you were actually there on the battlefield.  I mean, looking back at it today, the game doesn't hold up in terms of graphics and presentation, but the gameplay is still one the best shooters there has been.  Everything worked in it, it wasn't that hard to pick up and play, and the fact that it actually played like a tactical shooter made it stand out from the rest.Okay, let's now talk about it's Xbox Live play.  In simple terms, \"it was fantastic.\"  There were plenty of maps available, all with different environments.  You could choose what class you wanted to play as, Rifleman, Snipers, Support, and Demolition, and then pick your gun kit, which there were also plenty to choose from.  You could play the multiplayer portion of this game for hours on end and not get bored, something that's hard to come by these days (except GRAW, hehe).Presentation:One big gripe about the presentation of this game was that the menus were kinda difficult to navigate through (kinda like GR2).  This drove me nuts a bit, but this was fixed by the time Island Thunder came out.Graphics:In it's day, Ghost Recon for the Xbox had some pretty sweet graphics, unlike other games on the market back then.  It seemed pretty realistic and along with the sound made a great gaming experience.Sound:The sound in this game was pretty fantastic when it was released.  Everything seemed very realistic and gave the gamer a great gaming experience.  Explosions, bullets firing...exerything was great!Gameplay:This was probably my favorite aspect of this game.  It played like a great military squad based shooter and was very tactical, unlike the run and gun games we find on the market today.  The gameplay is truly what gave this game it's kick.Lasting Appeal:With it's great multiplayer aspects and Live capabilities, this game had great lasting appeal.  People played it up to and through GRIT, and some even played till GR2 came out.  Talk about lasting appeal...this game definatley had some!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2006"}

Having played just about all the top shooters, this one falls short of the standards of most I have played. Controls are ok, visuals are solid, but there is no intro to the story at all, so you have no idea what is going on. Plus, the aiming reticule/zooming is very limited. The time control feature, which is supposedly the single most unique thing about this game, is almost a direct rip-off from Max Payne's bullet time, and you are forced to use it in order to survive the waves of same enemies. In short, this game is not really worth your time if you are looking for a solid shooter.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00C7103DO","description":"Batman: Arkham Origins features an expanded Gotham City and introduces an original prequel storyline set several years before the events of Batman: Arkham Asylum and Batman: Arkham City, the first two critically acclaimed games of the franchise; Taking place before the rise of Gotham City's most dangerous criminals, the game showcases a young and unrefined Batman as he faces a defining moment in his early career as a crime fighter that sets his path to becoming the Dark Knight; As the story unfolds, players will meet many important characters for the first time and forge key relationships","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"Origins is a Copy and Paste but Still Fun None the Less","reviewText":"Introduction:Batman Arkham Asylum was one of the first games I purchased after purchasing my PS3.  What a fantastic game.  The free-flowing full-force combat.  The engrossing story.  The amazing different gadgets.  The fantastic level design.  The puzzles, the challenges, the back-tracking for the Riddler trophies.  The fantastic details and love for the Batman universe hiding in every nook and cranny.  Above all, the game made you feel like you WERE Batman.  Two years later, Batman Arkham: City gave us a sequel that gave more, was bigger and in many ways better by freeing Batman into a huge open section of the city of Gotham--and still managed to be a very integrate level design.  So the expectations riding on Batman: Arkham Origins were high.  How could this game deliver?  It had an entirely different developer and what was important to many fans: it had huge changes in voice-acting.  So how does this game do?  Well it does a lot of copying and pasting.  But when you're copying and pasting from games that are that amazing games how bad could it be?Story:It's not so much an origin story for Batman but more of \"year two\".  In any way, it sets up Batman piror to having run into the Riddler, Joker and various other Batman villains.  This could be handled well, but doesn't pan out as well as you might have expected.  Example: while investigating a crime scene, Batman, having only heard of the Joker makes a quip about how the Joker operates and yet tells Alfred that he doesn't know anything about the Joker.  It seems Warner Brothers had just totally fumbled how Batman met the Joker and found out about how the Joker operates and how extreme the Joker is compared to Black Mask, Penguin, etc.  The assassin set up on Christmas eve sounds amazing but the way it plays out is kind of disappointing.  I thought you'd set out looking for Black Mask (the guy who put the 50 million bounty on your head).  Instead you start by looking for the Penguin (in search of info on the Black Mask), then you end up looking for the Joker, and Assassins just kind of find you at set points throughout the game.Presentation (Graphics & Sound):The graphics look good especially when out in the open city of Gotham (though occasionally there's huge frame-rate dips).  The first impression of the game is that the graphics are softer and not as crisp as the Black Gate prison has boring corridors and the lighting gives Batman a funny soft glow that makes the graphics look sub-par by comparison to Arkham City.  Once you get out into Gotham City and have the chance to explore you realize the graphics are as good as City or Asylum. The menus are uninspired compared to the first two Arkham games.  The voice acting is overall spot on and everything fits into the Arkham Game universe.  The music is good just like from the previous Arkham games and fits the overall Batman universe quite well.  The sound effects get the job done and you feel like you're in an Arkham game.Gameplay:If you've played either Asylum or especially City you know what to expect from Origins.  In fact, a large part of the map of Origins is almost literally a copy and paste from Arkham City.  You upgrade your armor and weapons via XP from beating up thugs, discovering new areas, completing objectives, etc.  You're graded how well you do in combat situations which seems to affect your XP.  This game does not lack for things for you to do.  You will be on your way to a story objective and get distracted by a crime in progress only to get distracted by a riddle only to get distracted by a symbol you have to scan only to then get distracted by a radio tower you need to unlock and then get distracted by one of Riddler's informants you need to interrogate.  That's how Arkham City worked also but it feels more extenuated here--because the love and care that Rocksteady put into the previous games you felt like you were discovering everything for the first time.  In Origins you sense the copy & paste--therefore everything feels like it is just there to serve the formula system.  There are Riddler informants (just like City) and these data-packs (aka Riddler Trophies), there are towers to unlock (unlocking fast travel just like Far Cry 3), there are Riddler puzzles and even the Assassins are spaced out to fulfill the system's need for periodic boss battles. There's no doubt that these formulas were tons of fun in the first two games and are still fun here, but they've lost a bit of the magic.  On top of that there are things that just don't work quite as well.  The fast-grapple while flying doesn't lock onto some towers (even though there are more points to grapple from) and sometimes Batman doesn't go where you tell him and that feels frustrating, sometimes I found myself not being able to jump a simple wall or being blocked by an area where there was an invisible wall.  The level design doesn't feel as good and the building layout also feels copy and pasted and the integrate level of detail clearly isn't as strong here.Conclusion:Should you buy Batman Arkham Origins?  That depends.  If you haven't played Arkham Asylum or Arkham City then go pick those up instead as they're the superior Batman games in story, game design, sound and graphics.  If you played those two games already and love Batman and are craving more Batman then by all means pick this game up.  I think it's just important to realize it's a copy & paste from the previous games.  But much like with the Assassins Creed or Uncharted games, when games are this good a copy & paste isn't a bad thing if you're craving more Batman action.  Batman Origins will ultimately be a forgettable game because it fails to rise out from the shadows of Arkham Asylum or Arkham City.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}

One of the first and greatest games I've ever played all the way through was the original Knights of the Old Republic. As a life long Star Wars devotee, all I wanted was another game like that, great RPG elements fused with the world of Star Wars and things I already knew about and loved. This is what took me so long to get into playing the Mass Effect games. I know Bioware has done some excellent games in their time (including KOTOR) but I was hesitant to enter a new universe of people and races and conflicts I wasn't already familiar with.I finally made the jump after needing something new to play and I was not disappointed. I think ME2 is the best game in the series. There are elements from the third game that I wish had been implemented in the second one but the storytelling and worlds of the second game were up there with the best of them. I also think the sequel has one of the best final segments in all of video games. The weapons and the combat system are excellent, all the characters are diverse and crucial to the overall story. Traveling the different planets contributes to the sense that you are very far from earth. The musical was also instrumental in playing to the deep science fiction feeling the game gives.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}

I disagree with some reviewers that said this game is a button masher. Most of the enemies can be defeated in simple commands, as long as you time them right. One movement that is essential to beating this game is the Counter move. Wait for the right moment and it is a one hit one kill move.- Graphics are very good and level design is excellent. Ubisoft managed to create a world and while this is - by no means - as deep as Oblivion's, it is quite impressive for this type of game.The bad:- The thing I had a problem with though, is with the assassinations themselves. I wish you would have been given more freedom in executing them. They all go down the same way. Basically they do not start until you sit in a specific spot and that spot is almost always in front of the guards - meaning you will have to fight everybody, to get to your target. If you are looking for a deep or varied gameplay, then Oblivion would be a better choice. AC is an Action game and there are no Hitman / Thief type of missions.- Second bad thing - the ending! I guess I was hoping you will get the hidden blade in real life and use it to escape the lab. As it was - the ending was way too dry.The ugly:- This game desperately needs a Difficulty rating. It starts very easy and then it becomes insanely difficult with the Assassination #9. I would guess that most casual gamers will get stuck in the end and give up in frustration. A difficulty rating would also provide some replayability ... well, not to the people that complained about the repetitiveness, but the rest.Overall: For $40, this game is definitely a buy. It will keep you busy for 20-40 hours (depending on how many flags you want to get). However - at $60 - this may be a bit too expensive for what it is.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2007"}

Ok well if you play this game you'll get a great story with side stories to add a twist to the main story. I didn't have a problem understanding what was the mission, it's pretty simple. good guy turned bad guy that betrayed everyone for evil powers, now you must stop him type of story. I also think to enjoy this game you cant stop and play another game then return this is a game you have to play all the way to the end because you really bond with the characters. Oh the leveling is perfect. At times you feel like the baddest tree in the forest but then you have your moments when some rare enemy comes along and demolish you.

Instead we got a headache induced, glitchy, uneven, and unbalanced mess. The game's graphics are hardly next-gen with constant texture pop-up, framerate dropping in the single digits, and jerky animations. The game's difficulty is widely unbalanced (even on easy) and the achievements are hardly a chore.Instead of being a one-man-army in the military you are a one-man-army civilian who gets caught up in WWII, but the game has a twist. Making up characters and creating an original story (well trying) it makes things more interesting. All your WWII weapons are here plus some we've never seen like the MP50. The game has a grapple system where you can use the Nazis as human shields, kill them instantly, or use environmental kills. While this is fun and new it doesn't really change the game play (melee kills were just fine before). You can shimmy across poles (maybe a handful of times through the WHOLE game) and this also isn't very exciting. Bottom line is TP:FoL is a WWII shooter that was released during it's testing stages.

Now, everyone's saying that capcom did this to destroy the used game market and in essence they have with this title in particular. However, I don't foresee them doing this with future releases because this game is different. Mercenaries is simply minigames that have no story and consist of individual levels which should still be available even after you beat the game. What I'm saying is that, they did this because they knew people were going to buy this game and play through it a couple of times in one day and then sell it, which in turn would not leave much room for the market of new games. I'm definitely not siding with capcom on this, because it is their fault to begin with for making a game that consist of only minigames that should've been included on the upcoming revelations game. I didn't purchase this title, but was going to buy it used in a few weeks, however, I'm never buying this and will probably never buy another capcom title again.

{"product_name":"SteelSeries Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"William Grose \"Tzu Crazy\"","summary":"Decent, but very expensive.","reviewText":"I must be honest. I haven't had the *best* experience with SteelSeries mice in the past. Some dodgy build construction and software left me wanting, so when a mouse comes along costing as much as the Sensei Wireless Laser Gaming Mouse does, it had better be good.Pros:1.) Simple as anything (anything simple!) to set up. Plug the included (braided) micro USB cable into mouse (for wired), or dock (for wireless) usage.2.) The dock is a very solid affair, by far the nicest part of the package.3.) Excellent response times. Feels easily as good as my Logitech G700s in terms of latency, - perhaps even a tad better... It can't be overstated how well this mouse responds wirelessly.4.) Software is simple to configure, on an application-basis or just a system-wide configuration.5.) Very quiet scroll wheel.6.) While the light-show from the mouse and dock is pretty cool, they can both be disabled *mostly* completely (I can't seem to disable the light in the scroll wheel, which pulses). On a side-note, it's pretty cool that the mouse has some kind of sensor that knows when your hand is on it, and can shut the light off at that point. Neat!7.) Surprisingly light considering it has a battery - and a long-lasting one at that.8.) Easy-to-clean scroll wheel. My Logitech G700s accumulates all kinds of grit in the tiny grooves in the wheel that are a nuisance to remove, so this is a nice change.Cons:1.) Not very portable. You have to use the dock as the wireless receiver, so if you need to take your mouse somewhere and want to be wireless, the dock has to come, too. Or at the very least the cable it came with so you can use the mouse wired.2.) If your mouse battery runs out of juice, you'll need to unplug the cable from the dock and plug it into the Sensei Wireless itself. Normally I'd say just keep an extra micro USB cable lying around, but they won't fit due to the exceptionally narrow cable plastic to plug it in. I have plenty of extra micro USB cables lying around, and none fit!3.) The scroll wheel doesn't click left or right, which in this day and age of gaming mice seems like an oversight.4.) Ambidextrous mice tend to mean they don't really fit anyone all that well. The Sensei Wireless is comfortable, but not as comfortable as a G700s.5.) The DPI button on the top is a pain to press, so you'll need to contort your index finger to get to it when you need to.6.) The left and right mouse buttons are spread just a tad too far apart, with a fairly large plastic area in the middle. Compared to my Logitech G700s, this means I need to keep my fingers spread just a little further apart than I'd like. I wish SteelSeries had taken the G700s approach, with the left/right mouse buttons wrapping more closely around the scroll wheel.7.) If you're right-handed, the right-side custom buttons will be utterly useless to you (and vice versa if you're left-handed). This really means that for actual gaming the easily accessible buttons you'll have access to are left click/right click/scroll-wheel-click and the two left-side buttons. That's not a whole lot of buttons - for a whole lot of money.8.) Slightly questionable coating on the docking station. I have a few areas where the mouse sits that light is bleeding through a little.9.) The software can be a little finicky. While it works fine when it works, I've already had to re-install it once in Windows 7 because the application refused to open. One other review mentioned this, and I can confirm it happened to me.10.) The scroll-wheel, while really quiet, is a tad stiffer than I'd like, especially by comparison to the G700s. It can also get \"caught\" between the ratchet points, which feels weird when it happens.11.) The side parts are glossy plastic, which I don't care for. Just feels slimy...12.) The top surface, while a matte finish, does tend to pick up grease/fingerprints all too easily. The G700s does none of these things.13.) You may find the G700s more comfortable. I know I do. There's a small issue with the way the Sensei mouse buttons are designed. On the G700s, the mouse buttons do not go out to the very edge of the mouse. There's a frame in which the mouse buttons are placed. On the Sensei the buttons do go out to the edge of the mouse (they look like they have a glossy frame, but the glossy frame is actually part of the mouse buttons themselves). The problem with this is that my ring ringer rests on the edge of the mouse, as it should. That means, though, when I right click with my middle finger, the right mouse button rubs against the edge of my ring finger (it's basically trapping my ring finger's skin like catching your finger in a door..). I do find this annoying, and think it's an actual design flaw with the mouse.14.) No way to replace the internal battery.15.) That price.While it sounds like a laundry list of things that are bad about the Sensei, it's a decent mouse. It looks great, feels reasonably nice  in the hand (for an ambi mouse) and the dock is so very convenient to drop the mouse into at the end of a long clicking day.The biggest problem is that the Logitech G700s exists, and is a fraction of the price. Logitech's software isn't great (SteelSeries' is much *cleaner* looking - when it works), but with the G700s you do get a dedicated, more comfortable right-hand setup with easier to access buttons on the left side (and more of them!). And, you can replace the battery!For you lefties out there, though, take a good look at this SteelSeries. If you can get past the price, it's not bad.3.5 out of 5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-29-2014"}

The XB360 version is slightly outdated to its PC counterpart. However, that doesn't mean it is not fun!2. The XB360 version will slowly and slowly part ways from the PC variant, and it sort of has! (With the addition of a new &#34;End&#34; feature which includes bars on the dragon's healing stones, and the dragon's acid breath.3. It was a pain to some people to build servers on the PC version, the XB360 version is just a simple host/join and play. (The choice of online/offline or invite/open can be decided before selecting a map to play) Also, it is only limited to 8 players online!4. The split-screen is what I call the best part of this game. You can play with up to 4 people on one TV and I must say I have never had a better time in one setting than I did with the Xbox 360 variant of Minecraft! However, you will need an HD connection to play MC split-screen. This means no standard definition. You can play single-player and online with standard definition, but sadly no splitscreen.5. Important: Texture packs/resource packs are very limited on the XB360 than on the PC. Also, there are no mods as of this day this review is being written. If mods and texture packs were what made you like the PC version of MC, then I am sorry to say those customizable choices are limited. (This applies to skins as well) But honestly, that doesn't mean it kills the fun!Now, Minecraft is a very awesome and neat game because it fits the needs of all ages. It has no cussing or gore which can be suitable for children. The survival element makes the game fun to play for teenagers and etc. With the addition of multi-player, the fun just goes on.Highly recommend this game to anyone new to MC or to anyone who wants to try out the console variant of the awesome game that originated on PC.Minecraft is a simple game, yet so full of life.

Kim","summary":"To SQURE: TIME FOR A NEW GAME","reviewText":"Final Fantasy 10...  I just finished the game and left with this emptiness, which I do get time to time from finishing typical/average games...First of all, the highest quality of FF10: Graphic.  I'm sure people wouldn't hesitate to pick grphic as the strong point of FF10.  Yes, indeed, it is excellent, just excellent.  However, I thought the graphic wasn't THAT great.  What I'm trying to say is that obviously the graphic does stand out, however, it doesn't standout, pulling out \"Ahhh\" or \"Oohh\".  Those movie scenes were excellent, but other than that it was just 'average'.If you want to witness to the one of the best graphic game, try Ico, it will put FF10 to shame.  To put it in detail, it seemed to me that either they didn't integrate 'suitable' graphic for the story or didn't make it 'smooth' enough for gamers to feel comfortable with graphic.  I always got this 'uneasy' feeling about graphic, of course, it was really minor thing, but felt like something wasn't match wholeheartedly.I couldn't help myself from wanting to play FF7 as I was playing FF10.  Of course, graphic texture-wise, FF10 is better than FF7, but hey, FF7 was on PSOne.  Whenever I summoned Aeons, I couldn't help myself from thinking about summoning from FF7.  Just simple presentation of summoning in FF7 was way better than FF10.  For instance, Behemoth (I probably spelled it wrong) in FF10.. the execution and presentation were so messy..  it didn't give me that same feeling I had from summoning Behemoth from FF7, I still remember clearly how it used to be SO Awesome and So cool..  I didn't get bored watching same scene again and again, not only because the Behemoth evoloved in FF7, but also the summoning scene was simple yet just beautiful, just beautiful.Story line is probably the strong asset of FF series, and I was just disappointed.  Of course, trying to evolve the story around the relationship between father and son was a fresh idea, however, it wasn't good enough to really convey the full effect.  I didn't think voice acting for Tidus was good enough, in fact, destroying the story line with sort of 'childish', 'immature' voice.  Of course, Tidus acts immaturally time to time, but it was just way out of line.  I thought the other voice actings were pretty good.Story line of FF series has been the main reason for me to play FF series, and I have to admit that FF has lost its magic, the magic it once used to enchant people to be immersed into story..not there anymore.I would say music was what people would've expected from FF series.  I mean, it does an excellent job on creating suitable atmosphere, however, it doesn't live up to the legacy the FF series used to have.  FF10 contains excellent music time to time,(ex: the scene where Tidus and Yuna plays at the lake) but didn't mesmerized me with it.May be the only thing I liked about FF10 is the incorporating strategy element to the game, that was fresh enough, THE element for me to finish the game.  Not only they succeed in creating some fresh concept for battle system, but also they made it much more difficult, so you wouldn't just do button-smashing to get the battle over with.I read an interview of the either producer or the director of the game, and he mentioned about Sphere, where you can customize your character, according to his/her needs and ability.  Personally, the sphere wasn't something, which it does let you customize your character EASILY.  Of course, it does give you control to level up your character, however, the Sphere system was with its own flaws as well.  Of course, I know, creating this kind of game, especially when the title of the game you are about to produce is Final Fantasy, I'm sure tremendous pressure is there.Alrite, I better stop typing, almost sensing flying stones here and there..  To sum of the review, Final Fantasy is overdue for..I don't know, you tell me.  I hope they make FINAL Final Fantasy, where it really contains every wonderful element of the FF series, and make it really long and into a masterpiece.  I just can't imagine Final Fantasy 24 or even Final Fantasy 14.I would've given this game at least 4 Stars, but had no choice but to make comparision with previous FF games, and thus there's 3 Stars.Ok.. now you can throw your stones-","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2002"}

Also, like the Tony Hawk games,The Simsis a very addictive game.Players micromanage the lives of a family of virtual people and influence the outcome of their lives, be it success or something akin to a nervous breakdown. The bestselling PC version of the game has, in recent years, been upgraded with elements like parties, pets, and vacations, but this iteration is closer to the basic formula.You start the game living with Mom in a one-story suburban house. You are immediately presented with certain life tasks, such as fixing the TV and making lunch, which are aligned with the skills you'll need for the game's main challenge--keeping your sims in balance on eight conflicting categories. For example, eating will have an impact on your sim's hunger rating, but it will also impact his bladder rating. You'll have to make sure that he keeps himself and the house clean, that he sleeps to restore his energy, and that he also has time to keep himself entertained. The free will option lets your sims coast a bit, and you can also save time by stacking tasks together. Time passes at the rate of about one minute per second in the game, but you can fast-forward sim time when you need to, such as when they're sleeping.The controls are justifiably complex, but adjusting to them is not difficult. You see your sims from an overhead perspective that you can both rotate and zoom. You direct their actions by moving a line cursor to where you want them to go or to what object or person with which you want them to interact.The game is surprisingly funny. Neglect your sims and they'll shout and wave their arms to get your attention. Allow one's energy to get too low and he or she will likely collapse and sleep right where they were standing.

But I always had some issues, that and the game had a chain of very slick, very logical expansions.However, for me, the game moved way too quickly and often because an act of tedium rather than a fun experience.I purchased the PS2 game for a number of reasons, the tweaked progression scales, a mixture of items from all of the expansions (I never got any of the expansions myself), a host of neat original PS2 items, a fun mission mode, competitive mini-games, and open ended co-op.Plus I had bought way too many PC games as of late, and needed something for the ol' consoles to play into the wee hours if I became entranced...again.I had some worries and doubts, and while I disagree with some things Maxis and EoR did with the conversion, I have to say this is a heck of a good game, is faithful to the PC version, adds a ton of goodies, and the game isn't nearly as tedious to play, oddly enough controls like a dream and most importantly:The co-op is INCREDIBLY well pulled off. Simply great co-op, since I grabbed the game, I've sunk about 10-12 hours with a pal into it in crazy night long plays. Establishing house by house a dual-neighborhood full of neat characters is too much fun and offers so much play time it's scary, and I've just scratched the surface.The co-op neghborhood set-up takes from the insanely miniscule ammount of things that Animal Crossing did right (I'm not comparing the two titles, however, it can't be done) it allowing the importing and exporting of characters and even houses.But really, the co-op in The Sims is just hard to explain why it's so darn fun, ..., it's like miniscule Sims online without the massive lameness OF the Sims Online, or even the original PC game faults.It just clicks, working together to accomplish goals, dividing out tasks, establishing relationships and throwing parties, great fun.The Get a Life mode is pretty darn slick as well, hosting 8 missions (the later ones being QUITE long and offering good challenge) and offers a nice levy of unlockable features (mini-games, items, the neighborhood mode itself) it's been pulled off a lot better than I expected.The classic free play is just as good. Building houses with the PS2 controller also works really well (I cannot stress how sweet the controls are on this compared to the PC, they just work so well)The 3D visuals are pretty good, it's fun to see all the old 2D PC game objects in 3D. The game is decently detailed, can fit a lot of characters on screen and has a good sense of charm to it. It runs smooth and the camera panning is SUCH a nice feature comparied to the...fixed rotations of the PC title.The music...well, The Sims never really relied on music, The Sims probably has by far the greatest sound effects and voice acting ever, but if you snag a stereo there is some entertaining stuff, all sung in Simish of course. Nothing beats Sim rap, hilarious stuff.In the end, a lot may like it more than the PC edition, others may not, I love it myself, and to say the least it's a fun value packed version of The Sims that erases a lot of the tedium and flaws presented in the original.I love my co-op.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"The Rev \"one chill guy\"","summary":"Still as good as I remember","reviewText":"Ahh.. Halo CE and it's nostalgia, the first video game that I was ever allowed to buy which is what got me to buy my first Xbox. First played this at my friends house way back in middle school and then at my other friends houses for lan mp parties, and I still remember playing the beginning on \"The Silent Cartographer\", Covenant blood dripping walls, then the Jenkins cutscene, and of course, playing The most epic level still to date, the ending run on the \"The Maw\".I didn't buy the game just for reliving the nostalgia (though I did a bit I admit (but yes, it was still as good as it was before)), I bought the game for my favorite game character the Master Chief, his sidekick Cortana, and Still one best stories in video games. This game brought it all back, the exact same gameplay, and exactly the same levels, same voice acting, same story. Some of the new features includes, skulls (if you've never played a Halo, you can find these skulls hidden throughout the campaign and they do certain things like \"turning off your HUD\", \"inf. ammo\", etc), Terminals (machines that you can walk up to that give a cutscene of types that give you background info to the game), and the ability to switch between the new and old Xbox graphics (the difference will literally jaw drop you, I was astounded by the diff). The terminals  was one of my most favorite things in the game, not only did I watch them for the hints on Halo 4, it told a really deep interesting story of Guilty Spark 343 (an interesting character you'll meet in the game), and Installation 04, i.e. Halo.Does have its downsides though, graphics were really pretty, but once or twice I would see a graphic glitch. Couple of the skulls are too hard to get. The last negative to the game was the levels, I totally forgot how repetitive they were going through the same room/area after another, and then going back through a little of them again later in the game, but difference in objectives and enemies later alleviates the latter.Overall, an excellent game, I'm not a fanboy of Halo, but if you want to play a new game that actually has a good story, a really great climactic story line that gets even more exciting level after level and ends in one of the most memorable and absolutely epic levels, and that leads into a series that has an even better story and mp that take days away from you cause it's so fun, no copy n paste campaign/mp, etc bs, PLAY, THIS, GAME. (though I would recommend playing Reach first so you understand it better, and so you can be one of the few to do that since we weren't able to) This has the best story in all of video games, and honestly, I have no idea why people don't love this game cause of the awesome gameplay and story. I often hear from people who know good movies, that they loved the story in this game. What's even better is the price, the starting price is already a bargain for an amazing full game that if this was the original, it would've been $60.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00009MVJ7","description":"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliancetook co-operative action role-playing to new heights on the Playstation 2 console. Alone, or with a friend, you could tackle giant rats, undead monsters, dark elves, and even a white dragon, as you uncovered a plot against the good city of Baldur's Gate. But the ending indicated there was more adventure to come. Fans were worried that the sequel wouldn't live up to original's promise when the original design team jumped ship to work on Sony'sChampions of Norrath: Realms of EverQuest. They need not have worried;Dark Alliance 2is a worthy successor, retaining the weapons, monsters, Dungeons and Dragons action and rules, sharp graphics, responsive controls, and high adventure of its predecessor.The plot is a bit darker this time, but you're given a wider range of character classes to help face the elevated threats. There's the mighty barbarian, a dwarf rogue, a cleric, the monk (a martial artist), and a necromancer. The quest is huge and there are character-class specific side quests you can embark on--an extra incentive to play again as a different character. The level design tends to be a little too maze-like, and there's lots of boring backtracking, but the annoying jumping puzzles from the first game are gone.The biggest problem withDark Alliance 2is that it doesn't measure up to the competition. It's a 2-player game, whileDungeons & Dragons Heroes(on the Xbox) andChampions of Norrath(on the PS2 and Xbox) allow four-player play. Then again if you plan to play solo, or with a single friend, that shouldn't keep you from coming to the city ofBaldur's Gate'said once again.--Andrew Bub","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"Return to Baldur's Gate.","reviewText":"DARK ALLIANCE: BALDUR'S GATE 2 has a plot that begins fairly soon after the end of the original BALDUR'S GATE video game. At the end of the original BALDUR'S GATE the three heroes found themselves surrounded by giant black creatures after jumping through the \"last\" remaining gateway portal. The game begins with your character on the outskirts of a village being asked to help a group of travelers who were attacked by orcs. The first stage of the game is more of a prologue and it takes a little while before actually reaching the city of Baldur's Gate. Visiting an inn (one different from the first game), your character is able to talk to some people and begin going on certain quests. Ultimately, your character is to rescue the three adventurers from the first game and defeat the vampire lord.I really enjoyed playing DARK ALLIANCE. I like action-adventure type of games and tend to play them more because of the story rather than their difficulty. I found DARK ALLIANCE to be a bit more difficult than BALDUR'S GATE. There are a couple of really tough bosses (especially the octopus-face lady in the caves beneath the one castle) which require some critical thinking and strategy to defeat.There are a few changes in DARK ALLIANCE from BALDUR'S GATE. The player has 5 characters to choose from instead of 3. Though the game is pretty much the same no matter which character you choose, there are side quests that only each character can partake. There are also some characters in the game who won't talk to certain characters.  Like the first game, each of the five characters has their own special skills and talents. Personally I liked the dwarf rogue the best because he's able to carry the most loot and has this nifty ability of being able to automatically able to disarm all traps. Another change in the game is the ability to modify weapons into special magical weapons, but it costs a lot of money and jewels to make anything really worthwhile.  Another difference is that characters who shoot arrows don't have to constantly buy those arrows; once you have a bow, it remains armed all the time. This saves on both money and the amount of weight being carried around. Some of the levels are the same as in BALDUR'S GATE, but there are many more new ones. The game also takes much longer to beat. Once beating the game, an extreme mode opens up in which you can take your character from the end of your first game and start over at the beginning of the game, but with everything being extremely difficult to kill. If you choose to play extreme mode, your character keeps his experience and levels, but looses all possessions. It's fun to try, but very hard to beat some of the bosses in this mode.Overall, I found DARK ALLIANCE to be a fun game and a good sequel to BALDUR'S GATE. Expert gamers will be bored by it, but most anyone else who likes action-adventure/role play games will probably enjoy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2005"}

I am working with the Samsung PN50C490 50-Inch 720p Plasma 3D HDTV. For the cost it seemed like a great bargain to test out the new technology so no regrets on this end.One of the main motivators for me to make the plunge was the promise of more 3D gaming and when I found out that COD was making the leap into the fold well for me that was the tipping point of investment.How did it pan out? ****ing awesome!!! It's the best way to play the game IMO and delivers on the promise of a more immersible experience. I am also using the Turtle Beach X41's as my headgear so while I may look silly in my glasses and headset I am being blown away by what I am seeing and hearing in front of me.The 3D is not over bearing where it becomes a distraction but really amps the level of putting you into the game. While I am throughly enjoying the single player mode I can also say safely that this is a slight advantage in multiplayer.There is obviously a graphical drop in frame rate due to the stereoscopic image splitting up the pixels but not enough to take away from the enjoyment of the game or make it unplayable. It's a lot of fun.The tech is only at the start and while there are plenty who are opposed to it please be mindful that eventually all TVs will have a 3D option. Much like the way captions are a part of TVs now. It's going to improve greatly as they expand the technology and I don't foresee it becoming a forced option as much as an additional benefit so no need to bash it since you're not forced to use it.It's obvious that there are those who find it gimmicky and I respect that opinion. And yes it is true in some cases it creates a health issue with it making a person nauseous or possible eye strain which is why anyone considering making the plunge should test one out first.Anyway there you have it.Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
