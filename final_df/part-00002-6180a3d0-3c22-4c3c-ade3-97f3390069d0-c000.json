With a never before seen sense of movement and perspective, you will be drawn into Faith&#x2019;s world. A world that is visceral, immediate, and very dangerous. Live or die? Soar or plummet? One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"S. Melvin","summary":"Free running gone wild","reviewText":"Come to find out, even my virtual-self has no balance. This game is designed to allow the player to navigate through the zones using similar techniques shown in free running videos.  Any wall, surface, or jump point can be used to get from point A to point B.  The game makes it a bit more convenient by marking the items you can use red, but that doesn't make the game easy by any stretch of the imagination (at least not for this gamer).Unlike most first person shooters (FPS), this game is designed to avoid the fight.  Sure you can disable, knockdown, and if needed, even fire at the bad guys, but the main goal is to avoid the fight and get from the start to the finish of any particular puzzle using your wits, your speed, and your uncanny ability to balance (and time jumps).That's where my stability comes in.  If you playthis on the PS3, you balance your character with the PS3 remote, by holding it steady and moving it slightly left/right to keep yourself upright on narrow beams.  That being said - I may need to get checked out, because of all the puzzles in this game, balancing on the beam seems to be my weakness.  Shoot at me?  No problem?  Have me jump 50 feet between buildings w/a tuck and roll thrown in for fun?  No problem?  Have me walk across a 6in wide beam approximately 10-15ft long...holy cow am I in for a world of hurt (and likely a fall or three).Overall, Mirror's Edge redefines what a fun FPS type game can be like.  Not everything is about invincible powers and unlimited ammo.  Sometimes it is about doing what man has been innately programmed to do - flee.  Graphics are nice enough and the storyline is well scripted.  As stated - the red &#34;hint&#34; markers on items you can jump on/off is fairly helpful, but you'll eventually become a pro at picking things to use as you progress, not relying solely on the red markers.  If you can pick this up at a reasonable rate, I'd say go for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVXG","description":"NES Game","reviewerName":"John. N","summary":"Only hardcore Mega Man fans should invest in the original","reviewText":"The original. It's needless to say that every video game series has to start somewhere. For Mega Man, the beginning was in December of 1987 on the Nintendo Entertainment System. As easy as it is for one to slap down a date and call it a starting point, when did Mega Man become a household name, when did it really take off? Look no further than Mega Man II and Mega Man III.Why am talking about the immediate sequels when it's the original that's on the table here? When dissecting a game, it's good to start with a dose of reality. Most people (Capcom included) would probably have a hard time saying that the original Mega Man was a complete success. In fact, the creation of the superior Mega Man II was considered a \"rogue effort\" by the developers involved, a project that was far from being on the front burner. So in going from one game that almost never had a sequel to a game that now has nine, where does the original Mega Man fit in beyond being a point of origin?To get to the bottom of that question, one has to at least focus on the first three games. As odd as this may sound in this day and age, Mega Man's initial adventure was undoubtedly unique. I'm not talking about things like having six bosses instead of the standard eight or the lack of energy tanks, but the impersonal, industrial feel the stages. Other elements, like gun turret traps, the drab color palette, uneven difficulty and lack of support characters fueled the feeling that you were truly alone, that you were charged with terminating six humanoid robots with little to no explanation. All you knew was that they had to be destroyed.This begs the question: what is the original Mega Man known for? It's collection of robot masters? It's insane crash damage when fighting the Yellow Devil? It's somewhat peculiar and forgettable level design? These are all good answers, but it's only one them - the game's cast of robot masters - that are truly memorable. Obviously, the game's music goes hand and hand with this, but beyond these simplistic yet loveable characters there's nothing here the sequels don't or can't do better.This is why the original Mega Man is for the true-blue Mega Man fan only; casual fans can get by without or have a more engrossing time with one of its sleeker and much more welcoming successors like Mega Man 2 or 6. If anything, a NES cart of Mega Man is more of a trophy than a tangible playing experience, which is not exactly the greatest reason to buy something.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004CDBP9G","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Boundless fun, but glitches abound","reviewText":"I have to say that I bought this game on the basis that the trailer looked so interesting (and I've never played the first one).  Overall, Alice: MR is a great title, albeit with problems that made me go WTF several times.Story: Dark, Tim Burton-esque.  So not like the Disney movie and I mean that in the best possible way.  It is twisted and very deserving of its M rating.Graphics: This is a problem area and the most significant reason for the 1-star removal.  The trailer looked nice (as it had been primarily composed of cutscenes, of course), with lush colors and lifelike texturing.  But the PS3 version (since I got it for the PS3) suffers from glitches galore (surprising considering how much power the PS3 packs), making it -in spots, and a surprising many I might add- look as though it's a previous generation game or at least one of the very first to come out when the PS3 launched (consensus: no bueno).  The cutscenes as previously mentioned are rendered quite nicely, and I especially love the way the picture book-esque manner the theatrical ones have been done.  But the in-game graphics suffer from problems like poor texturing and even areas that don't appear until you get closer.  Seriously, with titles that came out a year ago (ie, Red Dead Redemption) or even ones from awhile ago (ie, Uncharted 2), I expected the developers to do better with a much hyped title in 2011.Gameplay: While very typical for any game of the genre, gameplay was fun.  Occasionally, the camera would pan in the midst of a move and make it extremely hard to figure out what way I was going, therefore the enemy would cut Alice.  Occasionally, the floating needs to be uber-precise or else you fall.  I understood why the developers wanted to reminisce and do one section as a side-strolling one, but that proved the most frustrating because moves have to be precise (ie, jumping at a certain spot at a certain speed, yadda, yadda, yadda...), and yet you couldn't exactly tell whether you were moving right or left.  Overall, good.In the end, Alice: MR is a great game, albeit with a surprising number of glitches that distract from the fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2011"}
{"product_name":"B005THAX5Q","description":"","reviewerName":"Son of Tiamat","summary":"1/3 CoD, 1/3 Left 4 Dead 1/3 dissapointment = ACM","reviewText":"Aliens: Colonial Marines is cool in concept but very run of the mill in execution. While the game certainly lives up to capturing the look and feel of the movie with the enviroments, gun sounds and music, it still plays like an ordinary FPS.Graphics: I'm not one to complain much about graphics since I consider them of only second or third rate importance compared to gameplay, but oh man! The graphics in this game are so dated they're almost embarassing to look at. Textures will constantly pop in and out and even when they are all the way in they don't look very detailed. A while ago I was having fun with Doom 3: BFG edition; I'm not sure if it's because that game is still fresh in my memory but I can't help but think this game's graphics look very much the same....worse, actually. Very poor, laughable graphics all around.Gameplay: Feels a little too much like CoD for my taste. The game comes with the now obligatory XP level up system for unlocking stuff in multi-player (which might be this games only saving grace). It really makes me feel less a part of the Aliens experience when a bar on the top tells me when I've ranked up. There's nothing innovative in the way the game controls, its mostly been ripped from other FPSers. Worst of all, I feel somewhat overpowered when fighting off Xenomorphs and human mercanaries. Yeah, I've died plenty of times but I'm suprised to see how high my kill count is at the end of a level, usually in the sixties. Xenomorphs will run mindlessly around every which way when you're fighting them and occasionally you'll even see a computer controlled fellow marine and an alien run into and clip right through each other. Your comrades aren't very smart either and will sometimes get hung up on a wall or run in the wrong direction. Your comrades also seem to be invincilbe. Not once did I ever worry about them or feel I needed to help, unless the game told me to. The only remotely cool thing is wrestling off a xenomorph when it grabs me and shooting it with my pistol...but even that feels a little silly. Aren't these thing supposed to be strong enough to bust through a steel door?Level design is a least pretty good. The game has many branching corridors that you can sometimes get lost in. Kind of annoying but It would be even more annoying if the game constantly had arrows pointing your way and thus taking out all thought process. One level of particular note is one in which you're unarmed, helpless, and have to sneak your way through a level of blind, motion traking aliens withouth them noticing. This level had me genuinely scared, but I regret that some of the scare factor was taken away when I saw that these aliens kill you by suicide bombing. Obvious Left 4 Dead elements shamelessly ripped. This bit of survival horror is a nice touch but only a small bit of novelty in an unremarkable game.Story: Not much story. You're a Marine sent along with several other Marines to investigate the remains of the Sulaco and later LV-426. Throughout, you'll have to fight off waves of xenomorphs and human mercanaries dispatched by the evil Wayland Yutoni Corp. who are, as ever, hell bent on capturing the xenomorphs to use as biological weapons. This is the plot of all the Alien movies thus far and its getting more than a little old.In all, I'm sorry I went to a midnight opening and bought this game full price. The only thing I can do is try and get as much enjoyment out of it as I can but even then I'll probably still be sorry.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming.

Yet, I never made the time to play it. Finally, when I upgraded my computer, I thought it was finally time to give the game a try. As a Star Wars fan, I couldn't have been happier. Here are a few key points:STORYThe game has a very rich story, far better than most of the Star Wars Expanded Universe. Your character is a Force-sensitive Republic soldier who leads an odd assortment of characters to locate an ancient superweapon controlled by the Sith. However, along the way you face dozens of side quests and have to make decisions in how you respond to challenges. You get to influence the story through your choices and can eventually head down the light or dark path. Thus, decisions have consequences - and it's not just the very final decision in the game, but innumerable small decisions when conversing with characters. I played through once, but it's clear that I could play the game again in its entirety and it would be a very different experience.CHARACTERSThe characters are undoubtedly the best part of the game. KOTOR manages to incorporate a fairly substantial leading characters and dozens of important supporting characters. Many of these have become fan favorites, including Bastila Shan, Canderos Ordo, Darth Malak, and of course Darth Revan. This is because each character has a unique personality and, more importantly, the grow and mature during the course of the game. You end up really caring about them by the time you're done.GRAPHICSThis game was released in 2003, yet the graphics hold up surprisingly well. Certainly better than most of what I'm used to on the Wii. I'd love for BioWare to rerelease KOTOR with improved graphics, but there's really not much to complain about here. Of course, this might depend on how powerful your computer is and whether you're willing to risk smooth performance for better graphics (fortunately, my computer's really powerful, so I got both!).GAMEPLAYI was a bit worried that the RPG-style gameplay would detract from the combat experience. However, it's seamless. Your characters don't pause during turns, but rather keep fighting. If you order your characters to attack and then sit back, it becomes an almost cinematic experience. However, be sure to invest some time learning how the combat system works and about your equipment. After a few hours into the game, you'll find that you have far more items than you'll ever be able to master.DRAWBACKSI kid you not, my only complaint is the ending. After such a dramatic quest, it was a bit of a letdown. I was expecting a 10 minute cinematic denouement chronicling the fates of each character. Oh well...STABILITYI've read a lot of complaints about stability issues. Fortunately, I didn't experience much of this at all. I played through the entire game (around 50 hours) and it only crashed twice. However, I just got a new MacBook Pro, with the highest performance specifications, so my experience probably isn't typical. You will definitely need a powerful computer, but the game is good enough that you'll be able to put up with the occasional stability problem. Just be sure to save frequently.After having played and beaten KOTOR, I'm simply left hungering for more. I'm going to try to get KOTOR II, but there's not much else out there. It's sad that Star Wars video games have only declined since KOTOR.Star Wars: The Force Unleashedwas a big disappointment. Hopefully, the new Old Republic game will bring back the glory days!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2011"}

The latter is my choice, so far...let's see what Final Fantasy X-2, XI deliver in terms of gameplay.I bought this game after following its production for about a year and still had been suspicious of exactly how Bioware and Lucasarts would pull off an RPG of this proportion on a video game console. Simply, they did and in an astonishing way with a universe we love, know, and now find out...didn't know in a lot of respects.Star Wars has been a franchise that like, Star Trek, couldn't produce real good games aside from Jedi Knight series, X-Wing series, and ... for just futuristic racing ala F-Zero \"Podracer\" and X-Wing clone \"Starfighter.\"With all that aside, let me jump into KOTOR. Up front I will tell you that there is a slight problem with framerate which you will see on just about any review you'll look at. It's not a total detractor from the game and happens rarely, but it was to be expected with a game this immense and detailed. Other reviews nitpick the fact that some of the graphics are not up to Halo's standards and that we get to see familiar characters (civilians and other people you'll meet or whatnot) repeated. Well, I guess that shoots a hole in the barrel doesn't it? Not exactly.To understand the graphics and repeat \"lookalike\" characters, you'll have to understand something, this game is huge and very long and deep. Of course there are going to be the glitches (it froze once on me and my XBOX is 4 weeks old, so I know it wasn't the hardware *note: Freezing games has been an annoyance since the old NES) when you have so much inside a story. Most of the graphics can hold well with Halo, especially the back drops and certainly the cutscenes which make your journey worthwhile. Repeating characters, well...this isn't Everquest or a short game where everyone could be drawn from scratch. There's plenty of characters and over 50 voice talents lending 14,000+ spoken dialogue. Also, these worlds are huge and complex, the exploration and interaction alone will give you hours of fun. When you look up, you'll notice you have a long way to go and are probably on the same planet.KOTOR uses everything it can from the XBOX's impressive hardware to bring this story and all the world's to life. There's side-quest's galore and a galaxy including many planets and races. I'm sure you're wondering why I'm not giving away spoilers. Fact is, there's a lot to do depending on what you do. You can balance your light/dark side or follow the extreme on either side of the Force. I don't want to spoil the game because once you start to play it, you'll be in it and also, I hate being told the whole gist of a movie/game/whatever before I get my hands on it or see it.Graphics: 9.8 - Well designed world's, backdrops, character models and feel.Gameplay: 9.8 - It'll take you a bit to get used to the RPG feel (if you are new to it) and there is a learning curve on the real time-turn based fighting system (of all the things, and that's not a typo by the way, it is a well done and satisfying mix between action-adventure and RPG style). The cameras, except for a few occasions, are spot on and the overall feel of the game is impressive. Moving and exploring, meeting people and choosing what you do (as this is not a linear game, although it has a plot) make for a great game.Sound: 10 - New and original music, authentic sounds and the spoken dialogue keep the atmosphere real. My suggestion is that you hook the XBOX to your 5.1 surround stereo or listen with a good set of digital headphones.Overall: I'm leaning towards the \"Game of the Year\" for this and certainly, this is the finest Star Wars title to grace a console system...possible, ever. If you're a deep Warsian fan or an RPG addict, this is one you will play and replay to experience all 3+ ways of playing it (light, dark side, mix). Remember, what you do determines your destiny.\"May the Force be with you...always.\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2003"}

In fact, the thing that irked me the most was the lack of single fire modes for the COD4 weapons. It was always spray and pray, or aimed spray and pray. In R6 Vegas, you can at least select between single, burst, or full-auto and have the ability to suppress most of the weapons.Regarding the plot, it is standard \"bad guys get nukes, try to destroy the world\" fanfare with your character saving the day. They did not disclose the exact date when Lt Price went to Russia to assassinate the arms dealer, but the fact that the enemies had suppressed FN P90's suggests it took place in 1994 at the earliest, when the weapon was first released. However, I am not sure when/if the FN P90 was available to Russian military forces at that time so I would have to assume that COD4 takes place around 5-15 years from now.The character had limited access to vehicles, so this is definitely not the same as Battlefield 2 or Halo.Pros: Great graphics, fun game play, lots of weapons to choose from, cool M203 / explosion effects, plenty of bad guys to take out.Cons: Very linear/limited game play, stupid dogs can take out SAS or USMC if you don't press the MELEE attack button at the right time.Overall: 3/5 stars, it could be better with less linear gameplay and more customizations for weapons.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2008"}

It's fun, challenging and the loot keeps things pretty interesting.  I bought this specifically for the co-op option, there is a good chance I won't be playing this at all on single layer (not to say that wouldn't be fun).  My wife and I had a blast with Baulder's Gate on the PS2 and we've never really been able to find anything that was close enough to that game since then (well, SHE hasn't).The fighting is quick and fluid, the conversations with the villagers are not tedious.  Getting in and out of the leveling menus is easy and.from what I can tell the re-playability on this will be decent because the skill tree looks like it can't be filled in one game.  The game is not an open world style, but there are side quests that you can pick up in the towns you visit and you'll find these items along your path.The game is challenging as well, despite my protests we are playing this first round on easy and I've still died a few times.  But still, I'm not exactly sweating the battles with the big guys either.If I were rating this for a single player I'd probably put it at 4 stars, still a great game but I'd want a little more depth in a single player campaign.Oddly enough the cut scenes remind me of last gen graphics but the game play graphics are beautiful.  One of the first times I've seen something like that happen.I'm actually thinking about getting this game as a gift for someone for Christmas so we can play the three player co-op.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"","summary":"Not new to games.  New to these though.","reviewText":"Well, that's not really true.  You see, I skipped both of these games when they first came out.  I was but a kid at the time, teens if I recall.  The years are getting away with me.  I remember clearly seeing the box at Babbages (now known as GameStop after the assimilation), with a rather corny depiction of a horned kid that looked like something fresh off of Sesame Street (ICO).  I also remember seeing Shadow of the Colossus' cover, which is the same as what it shows here, but the distaste of what they had showed with ICO turned me off.  I walked away, both times.  There were no helpful reviews either, which made things worse.  Back in those days, the best games got a review within a week at the most.  The only exception to that timing wasMagic Knight Rayearth, but I digress.Fast forward a few years.  I work a good job, live independently, and have money to buy my own things.  It is this which has given me a greater appreciation for the games I buy - but the downside is that I'm also quite picky about what games I choose to spend my money on.  They have to grab and keep my attention, because unfortunately I don't have the same time I did as a kid.  Back then it was about beating as many games as possible; now it's about interesting diversions from the boring drone of a long work day.  So at the tail end of the PlayStation 2's life span, I decided to give these games a chance.  By now there were people claiming that both games were sleeper hits that must not be missed by any real gamer, and as skeptical as I was, I figured I would at least try them.  I started with ICO.  This is the PS2 version I'm talking about now).I was confused.  I didn't understand what was going on.  The dialog was sparse, the graphics were decent, but for me, a good solid story is key to my enjoyment of the game.  I'm even forgiving if the game has a story but is poorly told.  In ICO, it felt as though the story were non-existent (which I know is not true, but it's all about perception).  It's my own fault, because I also played the Myst games and walked away with the same perception: that I was not drawn in by the story at all.  Not to be deterred, I moved on to Shadow of the Colossus: maybe it's just ICO's style.  Maybe Shadow will give me more enjoyment.I was confused again.  This time though, it was for a different reason.  I understood what was going on.  The voice told me clearly what my objective was.  I understood all too well what I was supposed to be doing.  The problem is why: I never did understand why I was supposed to do these things.  You lay a girl down without every identifying her, and you go around slaughtering Colossi without ever understanding the reason for it.  You have powers that are never explained.  You are affected by each of the Colossi but never are told why.  The other issue hinged around controls; I could never understand how to attack the Colossi properly.  The voice tried to explain the strategy but I still could not figure it out for the life of me.  Frustrated, I got rid of the game.Fast forward to now.  They have cleaned up the PS2 games and re-released them on the PS3 in 1080p glory.  I read a few reviews, most of them circling around sheer fanboy mentalities and nostalgia about the games that they loved, the bulk of them totally disregarding the need for an alternate delivery: people who never played the originals, or people who hated the originals.  There are a lot of things that have changed with me; I'm no longer anywhere near the gamer I used to be in my younger years.  I have a greater appreciation and skepticism for the games I purchase with my hard earned dollars, and I am quite picky about what games consume what little free time I have.  As such, I managed to get this game for free using some credit card points, and decided to give it one more crack...this time, as a time-hardened worker in his 30's who hasn't touched any of his consoles in roughly 9 months.  Let's start with ICO.{{{} ICO {}}}ICO still confused me.  I've read on the web about what it should be about, and I've even gone so far as to view YouTube videos of the ending sequences.  I still don't fully understand what's going on, but I noticed that this time it wasn't as difficult to at least muddle through parts of it.  I managed to free the girl after some initial frustrations about where to go and what to do, and it was then that I realized that I was thinking too hard about it.  Certain solutions are blatantly obvious, but you would never have thought to try them unless you've played other games that require environment exploration.I also experienced the sheer annoyance of having to drag Yorda around everywhere, though it's just one button to hold down, the real problem is her limitations.  She doesn't climb chains, apparently.  She's extremely slow on ladders.  She can't walk onto broken bricks on the ground.  She's prone to walking directly into the arms of a shadow being.  The beings will generate in an open space, and your first instinct is to attack them and eliminate them before she arrives, but she literally rushes into danger, where she will walk right in the path of one shadow being while you're fighting another.  Then she gets carried off at a rapid pace, and you find yourself desperately trying to pull her out of the shadow abyss.All of this wouldn't be so bad except for what I can only describe as questionable control decisions.  The square button allows you to swing the stick to attack the shadow creatures; the triangle allows you to jump, the circle is how you interact with objects.  Simple, right?  Except that while you're in any of these animations, you can't execute another action.  For example, if you press the square button to swing at a creature, the animation is extensive and you are not able to break your swing or do anything else if you had to save Yorda from a shadow creature at that same moment who generated near her without warning.  You don't have the fluidity to do what you need to do and it gets annoying at times.  Also, when dragging Yorda along, you apparently cannot defend her against shadow beings; you're forced to release your grasp of her in order to properly fight creatures off, which seems rather silly, considering he swings with one arm anyway.Lastly, the camera is quite fickle.  I never really felt fully in control of the camera at any time.  While the right analog stick lets you do some moving of the camera, and you can press one of the triggers to zoom in, there's no fine control.  You're also fighting the default camera which wants to zoom in on ICO himself rather than your objective.  Again, wouldn't be a problem except that this is an objective-based game.  At least in Myst, the first-person view allowed you to focus on what you need to do and where to go, seeing all interactive objects at a glance, rather than having to waste time panning a room around with a camera that is jerky.  I was getting motion sickness just trying to find doors.I must disclose that given all of the above, I cut the game off when I got to a point where there was no door, only a chain, and as I said, she seems incapable of climbing chains.  So I was never able to find a way out, and it was giving me a headache.{{{} Shadow of the Colossus {}}}Shadow was a different beast altogether.  I gained a greater appreciation for the strategy employed in the game.  The graphical improvements didn't impress me anywhere near as well as what ICO had done, but I did appreciate the DTS surround.  I know the words 'Dolby Digital' have been engrained in people's minds as the supposed \"best\" audio quality, but when referring to compressed audio streams, there isn't any better than DTS surround sound on a quality system.  The world felt alive, and at times I was drawn in like I certainly was not before on the PlayStation 2.  Then again, we've come a long way technologically since those days, but still.  I was appreciative of what I experienced this time around.When confronting the first of the Colossi, I was determined to stick with it.  I can't explain why.  And I admit, I was at first frustrated just like I was back when I was a kid.  In fact I died a couple of times (go ahead and laugh at me over that one).  But then it occurred to me what my problem was, actually 4 different problems. First, as with ICO, I was thinking too hard.  In my mind I was attempting to battle, when I should have been attempting to outsmart.  Once I got that into my head, everything fell into place.  The first Colossi died at my hands.  I felt the rush of victory.  It was actually fun.  There was strategy to it, it wasn't a straight brawl.  I had to actually think about (A) holding on to the beast, (B) resting when I got to certain points so I didn't fall off, and (C) timing my stabs around the shakes.  I was hooked.  I kept on going.My second problem, which I didn't realize would be an issue until I had to face the second, was failing to think out of the box.  In other words, each of the Colossi has a different strategy...something that should be obvious to someone who has played quite a few strategic games, but almost escaped me.  I didn't die this time, but I wasted a lot of time trying to figure out what to do.  I was fine when I got it, but at first it was a little frustrating.  Not enough to cause me to quit though.  My third problem was trying too hard to treat the game like an RPG, instead of a strategic adventure game alaSo You Want to Be a Hero, Quest for Glory I.  In other words I expected more out of the game than I should have, and disappointed myself.The fourth problem was probably the most serious, and I didn't realize how bad until I got to the third: the controls.  The default controls are the least intuitive, most confusing set of controls I have ever experienced.  It's likely that this was part of the reason I gave up back as a youngun, lacking the patience that I now rely on to get through days.  Fine controls are key to a game like this, and if it doesn't work the way your brain works, you will get frustrated because you have little control over the situation.  So, I made some adjustments mid-battle...and saw an improvement.  It got easier to attack, it got easier to dodge.  I started to enjoy the battle more than even the previous, even though I haven't yet finished him (had some other things to do).  None of my adjustments fixed the horse controls though.  There were times I felt like killing the horse because it was just so frustrating trying to control him.  Times when you would want him to gallop straight forward, he would turn his head left and right like a schitzo, it was nightmarish running through narrow ravines and watching him bang into walls.  No amount of control adjustments would fix this, and I dare say it's the one thing I really dislike about the game.In short, I am warming up to Shadow.  I'm not sure if it's possible to play a game wrong, but it's clear that I must have been playing it wrong as a kid.  Either that, or it took a level of patience and strategy that I simply lacked back then.That was quite long-winded.  I apologize.  But I wanted to give you a straightforward experience from someone who at least tried the games and couldn't stand them.  What do I say?  I still think ICO is a terrible game.  It's not the developer's fault or anything...I realize they were trying to add some challenge and brain energy into the game, and maybe if I didn't have to yank Yorda around everywhere, or perhaps if she could do what ICO could do (such as climb chains), I wouldn't care as much.  But it just felt way too tedious for me to enjoy.  Shadow of the Colossus, on the other hand, feels like a solid game even by today's standards.  Some of the things you do may feel repetitive, but the strategy does change for each of the Colossi, and it is this change that makes the game quite engaging.  Marred only by a wonky camera and poor horse controls, I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece, but it's rock solid and well worth the play through.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2011"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Not horrible, which is kind of a surprise","reviewText":"Comic book movie adaptations are notorious for having awful tie-in video games, and I had pretty much figured Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters would fall into that category. Instead, the game is surprisingly not horrible, which in itself is pretty surprising. Borrowing elements from games like God of War and Marvel Ultimate Alliance, Green Lantern lets you play as the titular hero and take down hordes and hordes of murderous Manhunters in an effort to save the universe. Film star Ryan Reynolds is here to provide the voice of Hal Jordan, and familiar Lanterns like Sinestro and Kilowog are also along for the ride as well. For the most part, Green Lantern is straight forward, mindless action and button mashing, which is typical for this kind of comic book movie tie-in game. Eventually you'll get bored with it, but it does have a few things going for it. The game looks good and controls well enough, but it is extremely short. With all that being said, Green Lantern: Rise of the Manhunters isn't a bad endeavor one bit, and you'll certainly play worse comic book movie tie-in games.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00432O50W","description":"","reviewerName":"Hunter D","summary":"Decent Game","reviewText":"This game has an interesting fictional world idea. The problem is it's a very shallow linear and corridor shooter game, with little to no replay value. The game's use of Unreal Engine 3 shows its bad side too often. Textures can be muddy and lagging to load up just like in all other games that use it on PS3 like Bioshock, etc.The gameplay is very bland and resembles RE4 much like the left screen blind spot excluding the updated move and shoot control. The AI is lacking on Normal setting and somewhat balanced due to it, because you will struggle with aiming. The aiming shares similarity with games like Dark Sector (also a UE3 game) where your struggles with the last gen TP aiming might frustrate your experience. The bad guys can be very quick at times and your on screen aiming will be too slow to catch up with them when most needed. Making some  encounters last longer than they really would without the control struggle.I like the story concept, just not the overall gameplay. Not much exploring and not on the level of RE4 or even RE5 graphically or gameplay wise. I didn't mind but also didn't appreciate the repeated use of filler segments like the 2D side scroller and stationary target shooting. The game's length is not very long and does not warrant full retail price. A lenghty game for today's standard is Castlevania: LoS. I would only recommend this game at bargain price and only for those interested in this game type and genre.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2011"}

Well, Valve heard us and created Left 4 Dead 2, which stars an all new crew going through the American South. Featuring Ellis, Nick, Rochelle, and Coach, the gang feels much more like human beings from before the apocalypse, compared to L4D1's characters who seemed to be born to murder the living dead.New guns, sidearms, melee weapons (woo! chainsaw!), throwable bombs (who though of bottling puke, anyways?), enhancements, and new alternatives to the med-kits make L4D2 seem less like a giant expansion pack and more like a sequel. The levels are more complex, and less linear. Also new are the new &#34;special infected&#34;, such as the Jockey who jumps on his victims and &#34;rides&#34; them to all kinds of hazards (fire, ledges, etc), and the Spitter who spits pools of acid toward the survivors. In addition, Valve has added a &#34;scavenger&#34; mode, where the survivors race around a small map to find gas cans and carry them back to the generator, while the special infected try to stop them.If you didn't enjoy the first one, there's nothing that will really change your mind here but if you were a fan of the first game, this is a MUST own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"\"gamecubedfreak\"","summary":"Best game on GC yet without question","reviewText":"First of all I wanna start off by saying this is the best Gc game yet and people who have been complaining about not having a top quality lengthy game for their gamecube have finally got what they wanted.

Some of the FMV sequences are cool and the speech/music in the game is some of the best on the console,taking advantage of Dolby ProLogic II. The insanity effects are a very nice touch to the atmosphere and the gameplay and add a whole new element to the game. The gameplay is very deep and the game has a great magic system where you can even come up with your combination of magic attacks. The ability to chop off specific body parts on enemies very entertaining and effective. The game is a lasting challenge and if it is not rushed through or completed using a walkthrough then it should last 20+ hours to most gamers,which is quite long and plus there is meant to be a special ending if u complete it 3 times I hear.Overall this is one of the best games I have ever played and the very positive reviews it received were very well deserved so this game has no reason not to sell amazingly well...SO BUY IT","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2002"}

That being said I believe that it has some limits. These limits are mostly the lack of a variety of games. If you get bored of sports and dancing you may not want to buy one! The games are really fun for short time spans, or occasional parties/ gatherings. Microsoft wanted to integrate the Kinect more in other games, like first person shooters (FPS) but it hasn't been used well as of yet with that. It has potential and is indeed worth buying... maybe not worth $100+ though. If you have smaller kids there are more choices and varieties of games, like Sesame Street type games, Kinectimals and such. This will definitely occupy a kid 12 or under for awhile!

Keep in mind adults make cartoons and they can be just as easily enjoyed by adults. Being a cartoonist myself I find the 2D style refreshing after so many games clinging to realism as tightly as possible. Even people referring to Globox as dumb, yeah that's sort of the idea, watch him when he clings to a wall...with his upper lip. He's the dimwit you're supposed to laugh at.The game works you into the difficulty well enough and the platforming is simply brilliant. If you like Sonic, Commander Keen, Rocket Knight, Kirby the game is on par with them, it's damn good. It's missing multiplayer but the console vers never had online, only local so it's sort of expected.The game gets pretty hard later, especially the hidden level or treasure chest levels.The one thing this game lacks and shares with it's console brother is lack of characters, Rayman, Globox and short wizard dude with different suits, Rayman and Globox also get pallet swaps but another character may have been a good thing to put in, maybe something the Rayman fans hate like one of the Rabbids :P.Overall it's great platformer an if you can get past \"cartoonish kiddy graphics\"/ can not worry about what people think when walking by then it's a fantastic buy.PS seriously can we stop with the \"kiddish cartoon graphics\" it's not Dora the Explorer.

{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"The Game \"B\"","summary":"A classic western shooter made by Rockstar!!!","reviewText":"I went to Gamestop a few weeks ago and picked up this game due to its introduction. I mean, how addicting is this introduction that you find on the back of this game?\"Vast, Rugged, and lawless, as a young man,you were helpless to prevent the slaughterof your family at the hands of bandits,many years later, you live as abounty hunter bringing criminals tojustice, while struggling to unravelthe mystery of your past. You must find those who murdered your family. Then, you will take your revenge\".Just that simple and detailed introduction is what made me pick up this game in a flash, and i can tell you, i defintely do not regret it considering its excellent gameplay, graphics, audio and lots and lots of violence! I mean, what do you expect from Rockstar?The story is great, you basically play Red whos family has died and hes basically avenging their deaths. As you progress through the levels, the story becomes more in depth addicting you even more to the game.Graphics- The graphics in Rockstar's Red Dead Revolver are actually really good, and it was a surprise to considering that their graphics usually arent. But it was different in this game. The character models look great, the background detail is amazing as it takes place in the old Western times, and boy, can you tell that it does. The cutscenes are very well done but the only problem with the graphics in this game that i find is that the blood, much like a lot of other games, lacks in detail and it looks like a big shower of red circles which they could have done a much better job with. But overall, the graphics are probobly one of the better aspects of the game thus making Red Dead Revolver very fun and entertaining, but a little TOO gruesome at times as characters heads can sometimes completely implode and blood goes flying everywhere.Gameplay- The gameplay in Red Dead Revolver is extremely good as well. You are given many options that you can do such as lock on to characters, perform special moves with your western gun, duck and roll and many others. As you progress through the levels, you get the option to buy new guns which make Red Dead Revolver a more rewarding game to beat, as many games now a days aren't at all, you just beat them for the sake of it. Simple and easy controlls to master, and yet such a detailed game, make this game a must play.The only problem that i find with this game is that it can be extremely frustrating at times. For example, i remember that in one level i had to fight of seven sets of four enemies before i finally got to the boss (there are bosses in most of the levels.) The bosses can also be extremely difficult to beat, which make this game more frustrating at times.The multiplayer is also great, up to four players can battle against each other, using practically any weapon they want, once they find it around the map. Very addicting, and highly fun/entertaining to play.But overall, the gameplay of Red Dead Revolver is great, and even if your a little bit of a gaming expertice, this game shouldn't be that difficult to beat.Audio- There isn't much to say about the Audio aspect of the game. Its just old Western music that gives Red Dead Revolver a more of a theme to it, so it doesn't end up being a wannabe western game.Unfortunetely, there is no online play for Red Dead Revolver. I think that they should have made it so that it did, and that 16 players could play at one time. If that were so, i would have given Red Dead Revolver a full 5/5, but for now i'm sticking with 4/5. Still a very fun/entertaining game to play, no matter what the price!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2005"}

I wish I had played it much earlier before playing great games like Morrowind and the Baldur's Gate series.  Then I would be able to appreciate it as the classic that many have claimed it to be.  Anyhow, I found this game very entertaining from start to finish.  It was easy to learn to play, suspenseful, and I didn't notice any bugs (which is a real surprise for games nowadays).I liked a lot of things about this game.  First, it has a great soundtrack, especially once you're in the dungeon.  The voice acting is pretty good and the other sound effects help build atmosphere.  For an eight-year-old game, I think the graphics look pretty good.  There are a lot of really creepy areas and monsters in the game, and they are animated well.  The map overlay was a good idea, since it allows you to play while seeing exactly where you are on the map.Regarding gameplay, most of the time you'll be clicking the mouse to move, attack, pick up things, and open menus.  There is really nothing difficult to learn.  I personally was not bothered by all of the clicking as long as the fights were challenging.  During the first few levels, my figher had no problems even when faced by a mob of enemies.  However, by the 7 or 8 level, I had to fight more strategically since the monsters had become much more difficult to beat.  By the 12th level, you'll have to draw enemies away from their groups and fight them one at a time.  The end fight was appropriately difficult, but not as insanely challenging as the final fights in Baldur's Gate 2.  One really great thing about this game is that each time you start a new game the dungeon levels are redrawn and new monsters, treasure, traps, and other things are generated.  I really can't see playing this game again since there are so many better games out there right now.  However, I like this formula which allows for a tremendous degree of replayability.There were a few things I didn't care for, but they are all together minor.  First, this is not primarily a role-playing game, so it is unfair to criticize it for not being more like Baldur's Gate and other RPGs.  Diablo is mainly an arcade-style action adventure with some limited role-playing possibilities.  You can only choose between 3 classes (fighter, sorceror, or rogue); your stats are preset, although you can control how points are allocated between abilities during the game; and NPC interaction is very limited and more or less restricted to trading and quest-giving.  Also, the town itself is small and static, and your character cannot carry much in his/her inventory (which will ensure many visits to town for supplies).  However, in the dungeon itself, you do get the sense that you are surrounded by evil, and there is a good amount of suspense as you get closer to the end.I am glad that I finally got around to playing this and will definitely be playing Diablo 2 (plus LoD) next.  For anyone who hasn't played Diablo yet, it's definitely worth a look. However, don't expect it to rival games like Baldur's Gate or Neverwinter Nights in complexity, options, gameplay, or anything else.  Again, it's good old hack-and-slay arcade action with a pinch of role-playing thrown in.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2004"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Fluffy Fun","reviewText":"Despite the fact that I really enjoyed Kingdom Hearts 2, I can't get over the fact that it was, when all is said and done, too easy. Don't expect the same level of challenge as any Squaresoft games, despite the inclusion of many Final Fantasy characters. This plays more like a Disney movie tie-in than anything else, and the difficulty curve seems (at the beginning, at least) to be set at pre-teenager level. In my view it's also easier than the first Kingdom Hearts.It sounds like I didn't like the game, but let me assure you that I did. As a gaming experience goes, it's pretty engrossing. No to mention the fact that it's also extremely long...the prologue to the game proper (by which I mean the appearance of Sora) is drawn out into an entire game in it's own right, consisting of exploration, mini-games and travelling around several locations which takes you into multiple hours of gameplay before you've even really started! Having said that, though, the gameplay with Sora soon pitches you into lots of Disney themed worlds that are actually pretty short chapters when viewed individually. I was expecting big, explorable areas like the first game, but I usually finished a whole \"world\" in a single sitting, which is a bit of a shame. The worlds are quite compact, and the ones that appeared in the first game such as Halloween Town are now disappointingly small. There isn't even a nice big hub town like Traverse Town with all those hard to reach secret areas any more. But there's always plenty to do.So what's going on then? Well I have to say you may be hard pushed to work out the plot a lot of the time, but it seemed to involve Sora, Donald and Goofy fighting famous Disney bad guys and activating (or unlocking) a keyhole in each world they visit, while all the time being observed/hindered by a shadowy sect known as \"Organisation XIII\". Along the way there are sub quests and optional arena battles, as in the first game, and even if you struggle with some of the more obscure parts of the plot, you'll (nearly) always know who's good and who's bad.Fighting is a breeze, in fact I'm sure they have simplified it, because there aren't many battles, even boss fights, where you have to do much more than run up to the enemy and whack the X button as many times as you can. This is a shame in the boss battles in particular, as you will very often miss out on a lot of the character of each boss fight because you are primarily concerned with bashing one button as fast as you can, since that's simply the most effective way of winning, regardless of what a boss's signature moves or spectacular special attack is. The menu also offers a whole host of tempting battle abilities to be assigned to Sora, but in practise it only means that mashing the X button even more times leads to better, longer lasting attacks. Using magic is also very much a secondary thing in battle. The access to the magic shortcut involves just too much finger fiddling for me and I don't think I ever used it except for some curing in the very end boss fights.There is, however, some fun to be had in the new \"Reaction Commands\" function, in which a special battle option pops up in cases of clever positioning or successful parrying. In these cases, a swift bash of the triangle button gives you a special scripted move which can really turn the tide of battle in your favour. Although you don't have to worry about this too much, it's easy to use (there's a huge prompt on screen when the command is available), and fun to test your reflexes too, as the windows of opportunity for the command can be very small.But for the main bulk of the story, things never get too difficult. I scarcely broke into a sweat on any bosses, time-attack fights or mini-games. And whilst on the subject of mini games, let me warn you now - the optional stuff can be scarcely above pre-schooler level. Tapping out rhythms along with the Little Mermaid, or flying through the air and avoiding obstacles with Winnie the Pooh had me in serious boredom territory. This is for 5 year olds, the kind of stuff that comes with those educational games that generously reward the barest challenge...OK, maybe it's me, maybe I'm too old.However, I will say that as you move into the final stages, some stiffer challenges do start to come up. The toughest fights of all really have to be searched for, though, like the Hades Arena battles that open up MUCH later on, but finishing the game story is not too much of a struggle. I will say though that they really do save the hardest for last, with the final battle being pretty long and quite meaty. It also looks fantastic, and, like the castle in the first game, you have an impressive celestial stronghold to ascend before you reach this showdown. In fact, I would go as far as to say that the last few hours of playing time, from the entry to The World That Never Was onwards, to be quite spectacular. With this ending taken into account, I can't really complain about the easiness too much.What I can complain about, though, is the Gummi Ships. Once again, the Gummi Ship creation mode is totally indecipherable. I was told this had been improved since the first game, but I got absolutely nowhere with creating new ships, as the menu and instructions are the most bewildering thing I have ever seen...just like the first game. Thank goodness it was all optional. That said, the actual flights in the ship through battles in space were much better this time around. But I never wanted to do them more than once. Sorry, Chip and Dale, you may be cute, but your Gummi world is beyond my patience and understanding.So I'll stick to the good aspects. There's a lot of fun in the details of this game. A LOT of work has gone into it. In every world you go to, your party (and the little HUD) changes slightly in appearance, from the \"Steamboat Willie\" stage where the three heros appear in black and white, looking like they might have done if drawn in 1928, to the Lion King world, where they appear in the shape of jungle animals!  The worlds are all impressively detailed, with some lovely scenery and distant views - notably in the Lion King world -  although you are quite tightly limited with regard to where you can actually go in all these world, inviting as they look. Another improvement is that the behaviour of your two partners Donald and Goofy has been made much more customiseable this time round, with lots of options to set to your liking. Although they still waste your best items with little regard for economy if you let them. (I was very mean and stopped them having any itmes most of the time!) Sora too, has a very long list of abilities, and although I just turned them all on and hoped for the best, a dedicated player could certainly cusiomise his favourites into some killer combos.To wrap up, this is a game that plays best for the story rather than the challenge. If you enjoy a sightseeing ramble rather than a steep painful hike, then this is the game for you. The characters are still very likeable and not too sugary (except the terminally annoying Winnie The Pooh - if it wasn't for getting the reward items I would have glady seen that 100 Acre Wood burned to the ground!). And there is a lot of comedy to be found, although I didn't find the finale to be as moving as in the first game, its still got a nice ending. All in all, it's a solid, quality game, and adding the fact that playtime can last well past the 30 hour mark makes it worth a purchase.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2006"}

First I will discuss its strengths.  Graphics are AMAZING.  This is the best looking video game that I have ever played, even better than COD4.  Although this game is very linear, it plays like a feature film.  Cut scene graphics are as amazing as in game graphics, the only difference is in the camera angles.  The transition between gameplay and cutscene are nearly seamless.  As you are playing you transition from level to level (or chapter to chapter) smoothly and your game is saved automatically.  Since you transition soothly from level to level, there is a feeling like you are being immersed in this experience rather than the standard video game theme of being shown an area with some challenges--stop--load--video cutscreen--stop--load--play another level.As far as weaknesses, the largest complaint that I have is in the cover and aiming system.  There is no easy way to leave cover.  You either have to walk away, which sometimes the game takes a few seconds to recognize that you're leaving cover rather than shifting position, or you have to press circle again, which has a tendency to jump you into another cover position.  This leads to massive frustration when confronted with multiple enemies as you tend to get caught in cover if you are surrounded.  My other complaint is with the actual enemies.  Their movements are extremely erratic and it takes far too many shots to vital areas to kill them.  It should not take me more than two shots to center mass to put someone down.  It also feels like when I am shot at with a shotgun from far beyond a realistic effective range I get a debilitating blow, yet when I put a round from that same shotgun into an enemy from closer it does them far less damage.On the whole, those shortcomings amount to a minor annoyance in an otherwise brilliant game.  I was torn as to whether to give it a four or a five, but since it is the best game that I have played yet for PS3 (yes, I have GTA IV--I got it at the midnight launch) I had to go with the five.  If Amazon had half stars I'd give 4 1/2 hoping they improve the targeting system on the sequel.Buy this game!  You will not regret it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-07-2008"}

Featuring detailed environments and complicated new battle mechanisms, this game demands a different kind of perspective than the first-person shooters from the original Halo series. You'll need to uncover the hidden strengths and weaknesses of each unit and play them to your tactical advantage, and that's just the beginning.UNSC: Be Part of a Legendary ConflictThe story opens with UNSC forces retaking the planet Harvest from the Covenant. At your disposal -- should you choose to take command of UNSC forces -- will be everything from a corps of highly-trained Marines to the Warthogs, Scorpions, and Hornets you'll need for air and land attacks. You'll take stock of the map and decide between holding your ground or advancing on enemy strongholds, all while trying to navigate the local terrain and outsmart Covenant forces. And when you need something extra to tip the tide in your favor, UNSC leaders can provide you with the ability to mobilize highly specialized units or call the Spirit of Fire vessel for support from above.Covenant: A Capable, Playable Enemy FactionThat's right, Covenant is playable in this corner of the Halo universe. This alliance of alien species has manipulated advanced technology, firepower, and tactical prowess into a powerful force that is engaged in a Genocidal war against human race, having branded humans as heretics. With the ability to play as these tough, alien fighters, you'll have advanced shield technology, the modular Citadel at the heart of Covenant's colonizing power, and, of course, the iconic Scarab attack vehicle at your disposal, adding a whole new dimension to your strategic warfare. The Scarab is a terrifying military vehicle crafted from heavy mining equipment. And with a mining laser that delivers massive damage across battlefields large and small, turrets for taking on air attacks, and the ability to clamber over any terrain, what's not to love about commanding Scarabs instead of fighting against them?Developed Exclusively for Xbox 360Most console RTS games are adapted from existing PC games, which can make their controls bulky or awkward, butHalo Warshas been developed for Xbox 360 from the ground up. This means the controls are sensitive, intuitive, and easy-to-operate in the midst of battle. And the UI is just as intuitive, so whether you're managing a unit of marines or a deadly machine, you can focus on creating a battle strategy instead of worrying about how to overcome a clumsy controller.No matter which faction you choose to play as, you can test your skills against those of other players in online skirmishes that allow up to six players with the New Xbox Experience through Xbox LIVE.","reviewerName":"N.

Another great sequence takes place on a Navajo ranch in the desert, in which a stay for the night while passing through quickly turns into an absorbing mystery in its own right. \"Beyond: Two Souls\" is just that, a collection of moments in Jodie's life, strung together on a timeline but not shown in the order that they actually happen (think \"Pulp Fiction\").

Aiden comes in handy by acting as an extension of Jodie, helping to interact with objects and people within the world.

Following up on footsteps of such giants is never easy. And yet the 5th installment of the series, SKYRIM, still managed to impress and ensnare me.INFINITE. INFINITE IN ALL DIRECTIONS.For SKYRIM, Bethesda will only take up 6GB on your HDD and with that the game designers created a literally endless world, with extremely long drawing distances, high mountains, passing clouds, dark forests, foliage moving to the wind and water trickling in streams. Everything you see in the horizon is actually accessible. Now, compare that to the ...21GBRagetakes up for a much, much more small and visually limited world to realize what was accomplished with SKYRIM. The world is absolutely huge - and it feels real.The graphics are gorgeous, almost realistic. Sure, I could do with somewhat more detailed textures when it comes to clothing (they look much better in the inventory than when worn) as well as a more bold color palette (besides grasses, there are also colorful wildflowers, Bethesda); however, the imaginative design of the items and equipment, the natural movements of the characters and the way light and shadows play with each other all the time more than make up for these shortcomings. The game is as beautiful as it is deep and endless.ALL SCHOOLS OF FIGHTING ARE WELCOMEEach hand has its own menu. You can go with sword and shield or spell and weapon, dual weapons or dual spells (yes, spells can be combined - and the spell effects are very impressive, especially the frost and thermal ones!). Ana always keep in mind: some Words have power beyond any comprehension.The camera is very accommodating and both First-Person and Third-Person views are available. It will take some time before you settle into your own fighting style but once that is done the game mechanics will feel like second nature to you. Yes, the finishing moves reminded me ofFallout 3however, it would not be fair to claim that SKYRIM is the mere cross between FALLOUT 3 and OBLIVION.SKYRIM was much anticipated and its gameplay does not disappoint in any way.USE OR LOSE ITThis is true to all living things and it also true in SKYRIM. In the beginning of the game you only get to choose what your hero looks like. How you then play the game will determine what class and what abilities your hero will acquire.The skills you use the most are the ones you are actually getting better at. You can also increase your skills by skill training and reading a skill book. Leveling up heals your hero (health and magicka) and you can unlock a skill perk and increase one attribute reserve (health, stamina or magicka) by 10 points. Both the enemies you encounter and the loot you find level up with you, however there are areas designed to be almost impossible to lower level heroes. A word of advice: until you are powerful enough, avoid going up into the mountains. I had to learn this the hard way!There are Achievement you earn but this is what I found beautiful: as you progress the game creates constellations corresponding to your skills and perks and, so, you can see your character make its mark, well, in the sky of SKYRIM.KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN. IT PAYSI usually do not pay attention to the sounds of a game. The less I notice them, the more natural they usually are. In SKYRIM both the ambient and action sounds are so well made that they stand out at first. After a while you take them form granted and blend into the background - yet they keep adding greatly to the total immersion. Draw a sword, deflect an arrow with your shield or walk in a narrow corridor and you will see what I mean.Moreover, the background music, whenever cued, is also epic and majestic, like a medieval liturgy choir chanting about your deeds. One name should describe its impact: Jeremy Soule.The towns are alive with people going about their daily chores; however, I have to admit that I foundThe Witcher IIto be much better in this aspect.  Nevertheless, paying attention to what NPCs have to say has its own rewards. Not only can you get lore and valuable information and even quests but you can even gain skill improvements out of this. Care has been taken to create a great number of NPC phrases in order to avoid having to endure the same phrase repeated over and over. Well, although not very pronounced, after some hours of gameplay this has not been avoided entirely. A minor annoyance. I can understand how town talk is much harder to run through the Creation Engine than items and quests.THERE IS STEAM COMING OUT OF YOUR ARMORRecently we have all seen how bad a Digital Distribution system can be ([coughs!] ORIGIN!) so STEAM may seem pretty benign to some by now. Nevertheless, let's not loose perspective. This is still an OnLine DRM scheme. I usually deduct a full star from any game that withholds ownership of our games by tying it to a unique online account. So far I had made a single exception, withShogun II. I decided SKYRIM to be the second.I still have to warn the gamers who are careful what DRM schemes they will allow to their computers since the game does require STEAM to run (yes, even the retail version). An informed decision can now be made. However, I could not bring myself to give this masterpiece anything less than a perfect score.SKYRIM is a game that will draw you in its world, enchant you with its beauty, mesmerize you with its endless horizons, offer you a huge number of ever branching quests and, yet, leave you wanting for more. Each time you play it is unique and the paths not taken will keep bringing you back again and again. Even if they are uphill and narrow.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!___________________________________________________________________________________(*) Divorce and ended relationships not included.

However, there are elements that simultaneously improve and reduce the experience.M2 is usual on-foot/vehicle sandbox fare - main missions can be completed at your leisure and completing side quests offer you bonus artillery/info/ammo that can aid with the main missions.Graphically, well it's sub-par. It has moments of brilliance such as the sun glinting over the sea as you fly around in a chopper, but the graphic pop-up and sparse, bitmap-tiling of the greenery is very evident. Whilst it does the job it sometimes borders on very gamelike Mario-esque looking effects, so there's no real immersion, no sense of you 'in the game'. Does it matter? Not really; it's a 3D platformer/driving game, not Far Cry 2.Sound has problems too. Your main character has the weirdest accent I've heard and this 'Nordic Viking' also tends to say the same thing over and over again. Jump out of a helicopter two feet from the ground and he shouts \"Who neeeeeds a 'chuuuute!\" whilst he's standing next to a landed chopper. Would it have been so hard to code in a test to see how far he's about to fall? Your cohorts also repeat the same dialog far too often. Call in chopper support and you get the same line delivered chosen from maybe three available. The barks your enemies issue are equally inappropriate and repetitive and become tiresome fairly quickly.Gameplay - well this is where M2 shines. It's simply a fun game with lots to do and many ways to do it. You're free to experiment with your current arsenal and free to tackle the task at hand anyway you choose and I love that. My only gripe is the QTE (Quick Time Events) - these are situations where you must complete a series of set button pushes in a small amount of time. For example to hijack a tank, you might have to press B then mash X then hit LT then A. It's all very antiquated and tedious. A next gen game with Dragon's Lair controls? Awful... buuuut - it's also awesome in Co-op.Co-op, is, as I opened with the element that sends M2 into the stratosphere in terms of fun. Your friends can jump in at any time and help out, then leave without impacting your mission. At one point my colleague was attempting to delivery some packages in a truck and was repeatedly being killed so I jumped in, summoned a powerful chopper and destroyed all bad guys in his wake. He completed the mission successfully and I logged off. Marvelous. The QTE events are funny as heck too, especially if your partner simply can't do them. My friend tried to hijack several helicopters only to fail and be thrown two hundred feet over and over again and it was hilarious and never got old (fortunately in M2 you can fall from any height and not die, you just have one bar of health).Of course, co-op comes with a price and that's the sour with the sweet. That price is bugs. The game is already fairly buggy in single player, with you getting stuck under objects, or not getting into vehicles properly etc. When in co-op though things fair much worse, with buggy debris from a recent co-op game being carried back over to my single-player save and other such unforgivable bugs. Save first to a new slot before joining a friend's game!So all in all, nothing ground-breaking, no amazing graphics, and some sometimes amusing bugs. But bloody hell it's a lot of fun, and double so in co-op. M2 is very recommended especially if you know someone who also has it. Go git 'em killer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2008"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Deweese","summary":"In The Zone, Part 3","reviewText":"I've loved playing Killzone since the first game came out on the PS2.  Even back then I found the graphics and gameplay to be top notch.  Plus, the story telling was second to none.  Most of the characters are interesting (except for Rico, I can't stand him) and really drive the story.  Killzone 2 improved on nearly every aspect of its predecessor and was the most brilliant looking game ever made (even rivaling some PC games).  Now that Killzone 3 is here, Guerilla Games have again shown why they are one of the best developers around.  They've given us a game that can be played in more ways than one (Move [with our without the Sharpshooter], 3D, standard).  Plus, it offers some very fun and varied multiplayer options.  If you enjoy shooters, then you must play Killzone 3.The story begins where Killzone 2 left off.  I won't go into details, but it is interesting and keeps you coming back for more.  The Helghast make a great enemy/antagonist and have a very intriguing history.  I do miss some characters from the original Killzone (Jan Templar, Hakkha), but Sev is a good protagonist that most people can relate to.  As I said before, Rico is one of the more annoying characters in video games, and I wish he would just be quiet.  However, his attitude is toned down a bit when compared to Killzone 2.I have not played the game in 3D, but the graphics are still amazing.  Dynamic lighting, particle effects, and shading are terrific.  There is great draw distance with beautiful vistas all around.  The jungle levels have a great color palette.  The character and gun models are very detailed.  Expressions on the characters' faces are actually nuanced and easy to read.Gameplay is literally an assault on the senses.  There is so much going on all around you that you can easily get distracted and overwhelmed.  Explosions, charging troops, flying machines, everything just seems to jump out at you.  Plus, the audio is so bombastic (especially in 5.1 surround sound) you almost feel a part of the battlefield.  I'm using the standard dualshock 3 controller and it works well.  Aiming can be kind of a struggle especially if you're used to playing shooters with a mouse and keyboard.  Several reviewers have stated that the PS Move (with the Sharpshooter peripheral) actually improves aiming and accuracy.  I'm seriously thinking about giving that a try.  Regardless, gameplay is enjoyable.My only complaint about this game is that the single player campaign was over far too quickly.  I think I finished the game in about 6 or 7 hours.  The ending seemed a bit abrupt, but it leaves the door open for Killzone 4.  Multiplayer is serving its purpose in that I keep coming back to play the game, but I'm not a big MP guy.  Suffice it to say I'm still very pleased with my KZ3 experience.  The franchise definitely rivals that of Halo and COD, and it deserves a place in every shooter fan's collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2011"}

The story is exactly what you'd expect it to be, a sequel. It starts off right where part 1 left off, so if you've never played Tales on the NGC, you'll be left in the dark to a story that's actually quite epic with a genius plot. I've seen people complain about the new world map and how it's more linear. Also about a few voice actors changing. Don't let that discourage you. The world map for Final Fantasy Tactics was exactly the same and that never stopped it from being an excellent game, and the same goes for TOS:Dawn Of The New World. The voice actors for one or two characters has changed but it's still very good, and very comical. Graphics are slightly better, still keeping that cell-shaded look, but with better proportions than part 1. It has a more mature feel. Controls are tight and responsive, and the new monster-raising ability adds to the fun. It's like they mixed in a Pokemon element in the game. Training monsters, evolving them, teaching them new moves. It's quite the rush. The game has good length too. Not GREAT, but good. I just started the 2nd-to-last chapter and I've clocked in about 47 hours of gameplay. Judging from how it's playing out, it may have 60 hours worth of gaming time, which is good, especially for a game with a dotted world map. You move from dot to dot to get to areas, but once you've entered them, the areas are quite large. By itself I'd rate this game a 7/10. If you've played the first part and you're transferring your save data to continue the action, it's a solid 9/10. Not being 10/10 because of the world map. Hope that helps! :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

Once completing it as a \"hero\", and once as a \"villain\".The game is set up with the same kind of freedom you have when playing a Grand Theft Auto game. You can choose to go around the city and do nothing, do mini-missions or work on the main goals of the game.If this kind of game play freedom isn't enough for you, you also get to chose how to play the game, as a hero or as a villain. A portion of the missions have alternate endings, where you chose to either do what's considered the right thing, or the self serving option. Other missions are purely choice to do either the hero one or the villain one. As you go along, depending on what path you chose also alters how people in the city react to your presence, how you appear in game play and how the story of the game plays out.You can climb walls, jump from any distance and not die, fly like a super hero and have all kinds of other powers that are given to you through electricity. The city is filled with 3 different gangs, all with their own ways of posing a threat to you. And if you chose to take the path of evil, the city residents won't care much for you either and can pose their own threat.While some of the mini-missions occasionally are the same (might have 2 or 3 of the same kind of mission throughout the 3 burros of the city) most all have unique goals, that take using your powers in which to complete. The end of the game has a twist I didn't see coming, and there is a moment or two also found in the storyline that I definitely wasn't expecting.A great game, and I have it's sequel on pre-order so I can play that one as well!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A masterpiece","reviewText":"More often than not, the PS3 gets knocked for not having enough quality console exclusive titles.  This may be true to a degree, but its safe to say that Infamous can be chalked up as being one of the best titles you'll ever play on the PS3.  Taking place in a completely open-world city, you play as a bike messenger named Cole, who has been granted superpowers after a devestating explosion occurs in Empire City.  Now able to shoot lightning from your fingertips and jump and climb the terrain a la Spider-Man, there are moral choices to make as you take down baddies in the process.  What makes Infamous so good is that it truly makes good on its promise of an open-world environment.  You never really feel any sort of constraints as to where you can go and what you can do, playing like a hybrid of Grand Theft Auto and Spider-Man 2.  Not to mention that the city is vast and detailed, and navigating it is easy as well.  The comic book-style touches throughout Infamous only help make the game's story all the more engrossing, and the moral choices to make as to whether to help or crush the people only add to the game's tone.  If there's any notable drawbacks to Infamous, it's that the game isn't without its share of visual glitches.  Though the game looks good and is fluidly animated, there are some noticable graphical hiccups that occur.  Not to mention that there is a certain degree of repetivity in the game's missions, but this doesn't stop Infamous from being one of the absolute most fun games available on the PS3.  All in all, Infamous is definitely one of the best games to find on the PS3 right now, and if this does indeed form a new franchise for Sony to push, here's hoping that the best is yet to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2009"}

Armed with double-chained blades, as well a selection of new weapons, Kratos must take on mythology's darkest creatures while solving intricate puzzles throughout his merciless quest to destroy Olympus and the mighty Zeus himself.Key Game Features","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"The End has finally Begun","reviewText":"After God of War II's attention grabbing and very teasing cliffhanger ending, we finally get to see what happens with Kratos and the titans as they climb Mt. Olympus and begin their battle against the gods. Let me quickly get this slight complaint out of the way and say that the big battle between the titans and gods didn't go about the way I thought it would; it wasn't as large scale or earth shattering as I was hoping it would be. Regardless, it was still an awesome battle and in the longer run it was an awesome game. The game opens right where God of War II left off and you take control of Kratos as he fights undead warriors atop the tree covered shoulders and back of the titan Gaia. Due to this interesting choice of battleground, the landscape moves and sways as Gaia climbs up Mt. Olympus, but not in a dizzying manner, so don't worry about getting motion sickness. The opening boss battle ensues soon afterwards with Poseidon joining the fray and taking out a couple of titans as he surrounds himself with a sort of giant sized suit of water shaped like himself with his pet horseheaded water serpents acting as his many tentacles to attack the titans. As Gaia grapples with Poseidon, Kratos can attack the tentacle serpents and later Poseidon directly with the Blades of Athena and use the Blade of Olympus to create a swirling tornado as his magic attack. Afterwards, Gaia and Kratos reach the top of Mt. Olympus, only to be blasted off by a lightning bolt from Zeus. Gaia is able to save herself, but Kratos is left to \"fall from grace\" once again into the River Styx, which leads to the underworld lair of Hades.Falling into the river of the dead has the unfortunate but gameplay required effect of depowering Kratos once again by removing his magic, lowering his health, and damaging the Blades of Athena. He also dropped the Blade of Olympus as he fell... this just isn't his day. The ghost of the goddess Athena, whom Kratos accidentally killed at the end of God of War II, appears to inform Kratos of the one thing that can destroy Zeus once and for all, the Flame of Olympus. She then remakes Kratos's damaged blades into the Blades of Exile and Kratos begins his final journey of revenge. Standing in Kratos's way are a bunch of the same kind of mythological beasties that were foolish enough to challenge the Spartan in the previous games, with a lot of them just reimagined or redesigned versions of previous enemies. The only truly different enemies are these big living statues armed with huge clubs. So not a lot in terms of enemy variety in this game. Also, the game appears to throw a smaller number of these creatures at you, which is somewhat disappointing compared to the wide array of enemies the two previous games would send against you at once. The game's story has also lost the storytelling element of its predecessors since Gaia is no longer the narrator but an actual contender in the whole war against the gods, so the cutscenes in the game are more traditional with flashbacks about Kratos's previous exploits and the effects they've had on the world in general. Well, that's it for the very minor negative points of this game, and I'm nitpicking as it is.The gameplay is as incredibly fun and fast paced as ever, and the new mechanic with the weaponry and magic abilities has been redone, so that's one new thing the game brings to the table. Kratos gets four weapons each with their own magic attacks: the Blades of Exile allow Kratos to summon the souls of dead Spartan soldiers that surround Kratos with their shields and spears in 300 fashion, the Claws of Hades allow him to summon the souls of enemies he has defeated such as cyclopses and centaurs, the Nemean Cestus allow him to slam the ground and send out deadly shockwaves, and the Nemesis Whip lets him electrocute his enemies. The Claws of Hades and the Nemesis Whip are actually very similar to the Blades of Exile, but have slightly different attack styles; the Nemean Cestus however offer a rather different style of combat. They're basically large, steel fighting gauntlets with which Kratos can make short work of most enemies by bashing them into submission. Kratos eventually regains possession of the Blade of Olympus and is given access to the Rage of Sparta. This ability allows Kratos to wield the Blade of Olympus for a short period and smite his enemies with it, with the added benefit of increased attack power, durability, and speed, much like the Rage of the Gods and Rage of the Titans in the first two games. In addition, Kratos acquires other weapon items which run on a separate regenerating meter instead of relying on his magic: the Bow of Apollo which can shoot fiery arrows, the Boots of Hermes that allow Kratos to perform high speed dashes and run up and along certain walls, and the Head of Helios which can be used to illuminate pitch black areas and temporarily blind enemies. Kratos also still has the Golden Fleece and Icarus Wings. Also making a return are an impressive array of challenging boss fights, some of them coming in truly \"titanic\" proportions. Of particular note is a boss fight against a mythological figure who I was hoping would appear in this game, and when he did I was as happy as a child at Christmas; Kratos finally does battle with Hercules... definitely one of the high points of the game.Once again, quick time events are used to take out Kratos's enemies, open gates, and please the women in sex mini-games; the sexual themes are even stronger in this game... who knew that was possible, right? The QTEs have actually improved in the way they're implemented. When the button prompts appeared in the first two games, they would appear smack dab in the middle of the screen and kind of distract the player from what Kratos was doing to his enemies (or women). In this game, the prompts appear in the corners of the screen that match the placement of the buttons on the controller and don't obstruct the player's view. For example, when required to press the triangle (top) button, the prompt appears at the top portion of the screen, and when required to press the circle (right) button, the prompt appears at the right side of the screen. That was a cool gameplay element. One last addition to the gameplay are these flying portions where Kratos uses the Icarus Wings to dash through these very cramped tubes and he's forced to dodge countless wooden beams, metal barriers, and balls of fire hurtling towards him. Yes, these sections are as hard as they sound, some MUCH more than others. The puzzles so familiar with the series return as well, although they're not quite as challenging as before. The music is as classically awesome as ever with brand new and familiar orchestral scores. Finally, the graphics... WOW. The in-game graphics are so incredible that they're used for all cutscenes. The detail of the environments and characters, the shadowing effects, everything is top notch. Despite the larger number of very minor problems the game has, they are not nearly enough to detract from the overall greatness of the game. This is still God of War and Kratos is still a rather one dimensional character who's about as sympathetic as a serial killer, but he still manages to be as popular as more well rounded main characters simply because of how dedicated and unstoppable he is. And the ending... well, let's just say it keeps you wondering if it truly is the end or the beginning of something else. Get this game. It's as simple as that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

Enquiring minds want to know!","reviewText":"First things first, Splatterhouse is not a game you should pick up for full price! It would make a great rental or even a used purchase which by the way I'm sure it will be available very shortly and with a more reasonable price tag on the used market. I was fortunate enough to get a really good deal on this game, which was one of the main reasons I took a chance with it. With that being said, this isn't a horrible game by any means, but it's also nothing special.This game has your basic very generic storyline, so keep that in mind if you decide to play it. I know videogames as a whole are expected to have deep and compelling storylines, to keep us intrigued as to what happens next and to help us relate and/or associate with the characters, kind of like an interactive book if you will. Splatterhouse however is not about the story; it's about the carnage, the blood and of course finding the most ridiculously insane way to kill something! I would compare it to the campy horror movies of the 80's. Friday the 13th was never about why Jason was the way he was, rather how he killed as many half naked/buck naked teenagers he could before the credits rolled. In a nutshell it's comparable to watching Friday the 13th with Headbangers ball playing in the background. Many gamers today may not recognize Headbangers Ball but if you're old enough to have played the original Splatterhouse when it was first released you probably will.As with many other games the game play gets very repetitive, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you only like to play the first couple of hours of a game then move on to something different or just want a mindless fun way to help get your aggression out. Honestly I don't really see many people finishing this game, there's just no real reason to. The makers of the game leave parts to naked photos of Rick's girlfriend for you to find, don't ask me why I guess they think by doing so it would entice adolescent boys to finish the game, which seems to be the target audience anyway. I know what does that say for me LOL. The biggest reason and my motivator to finish the game is that you unlock the original three Splatterhouse games.The graphics will not blow you away by any stretch of the imagination; actually they seem more like something you would see on the PS2/Xbox. There is no online feature, so if you're looking for anything other than the single player campaign look elsewhere. There is however some challenge maps that are pretty entertaining but nothing really amazing here either. As I said prior the soundtrack is very much metal, so if that's not your thing then you may want to play with the sound off and if you're into it blast some Justin Bieber while you do your splattering. My only other complaint (as if I haven't complained enough) is the camera; it can be kind of clunky at times and can cause you to get a smack down.Now for some good news, for the most part the auto save feature is pretty reliable with a few hiccups along the way. Meaning there are times you would believe the game would save due to the progress you've made but for some reason doesn't, so if you die you're going back to start of the checkpoint and must make your way back to where you were. But again that's few and far between, most of the time the check points are located in logical and beneficial areas for the player. The mayhem you can cause can also be fun, in short doses of course, it's a good thing the chapters are rather short. The controls are pretty fluid, and the designers did a good job allowing you to chain together combos. The most entertaining element of the game has to be the mask, they did a good job writing smartass comments and of the wall shtick for him.I know based on what I have said above you would think I would rate this game a one star out of five! However believe it or not there are reasons to play this game, but not for full price. There is hours of mindless blood and gore to be had and if you're like me and have played the originals it will bring back memories. Twenty dollars would be a perfect price for this game; thirty would be the highest I would go.MichaelPSN-Xbox Live gamer tags are MikeJMele","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2010"}

Great story and nice RPG in a real cool setting.","reviewText":"Ok, finally an RPG that is an RPG.Built as a first/third person shooter, and based on the Half Life engine, this game delivers a great story in a non linear fashion.At the beginning of the game you can choose between 7 classes of vampires. Each class has a distinct demeanor and different powers. For example, you can choose to be a noble and aristrocratic Ventrue and use mental power to dominate foes. Or you can choose to be a Gangrel, in communion with the animals and with the ability to transform into a beast and shred your enemies to pieces while moving 5 times faster than them.Believe me, in Bloodlines (as in the original White Wolf RPG) there is a Vampire that will just fit your needs and desires.All missions can be completed in various different ways and using different sets of vampiric powers.Game Breakdown:Graphics 8/10: Downtown LA is absolutely awesome and well done. People walk around the roads, talk on their cell phones, chat with each other while smoking a cigarette. Lighting is good, but not even close to Doom 3.Sound 9/10: The soundtrack is awesome and you will find its CD in the game. Voiceovers are good, but not exceptional.Story 9/10: well written and fun. You will be in for a few surprises. Moreover, it has a high degree of non linearity. It modifies based on your gender, your vampire clan and your decisions. This brings awesome replayability.Gameplay 8/10: I think combat in this game is very good, however weapons need to be equilibrated (your plain fists seem to deal more damage than a knife). Spells work awesome, and if you choose certain clans (like the Tremere) you will be able to see how powers and spells are more effective than hand to hand combat.Moreover, you have a good set of skills that enhances your interactions with non playing characters. You will be able to seduce, manipulate, convince, threaten... these options are many times better than just killing somebody to get what you want.I take a star off of what would be a 5 star product for 1 reason:THE GAME IS BUGGY!!!1. Doors are messed up, they open and close really bad.2. Movies and cinematics seem slapped together and the soundtrack doesn't work very well in them.3. You will get stuck in wierd places sometimes and have to reload. Save often!A patch will surely fix all this.Bottom line:I LOVE THIS GAME! And I suggest it as a must buy to any Vampire or White Wolf fan. For all the others, I suggest this game to:1) RPGers who like FPS games.2) People in search for a non linear RPG in a non fantasy setting.3) For big time fans of RPG, this game is nice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2004"}

Castlevania: Curse of Darkness isn't a bad game one bit, in fact, it's probably the best 3-D game in the series.  However, that's not really saying much, and while the game itself looks great, it's ultimately too short, too repetitive, and too easy for long time Castlevania gamers.  The RPG-style level up system is here, and it spices up the gameplay a bit, and it's actually a welcome addition.  The Devil Forgery feature works to a point, but after a while there's not really anything special about it.  The controls are easy enough to get a hold of, helping make the game a breeze to get through, which is the biggest disappointment of all.  Even in it's very first 8-bit incarnation, Castlevania provided challenging gameplay (even somewhat frustrating gameplay as well) that was surprisingly addictive, but ever since the series made it's jump to 3-D, the gameplay has suffered mightily.  What Konami needs to do, is go back to their roots and make a classic style 2-D Castlevania game for the home consoles (or maybe re-release the masterpiece that was Symphony of the Night, which wasn't just the best game in the series, but one of the best PS1 games of all time) like they did with the excellent games released for the DS and GBA.  If you're a longtime Castlevania fan jaded or not by 3-D Castlevania games, Curse of Darkness is still worth a look, but you'll once again be wishing for the series to return to it's former glory.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2006"}

For a thousand years, three opposing forces have waged war for what they believe is true. There can be no room for compromise: their way is the only way. Dubbed The Infinite War, this devastating conflict has taken its toll on a once-peaceful galaxy and has only served to deepen the hatred between the factions.    After centuries of struggle, the battle for supremacy has at last reached a turning point. Under your strategic command and leadership, will your faction will reign supreme? Will you be victorious and elevate your race to domination? Or will you lead them into the hell of defeat and ultimate extinction?","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Total Annihilation Redux","reviewText":"The similarities between this game and the previous Chris Taylor RTS, Total Annihilation, are pervasive. If you've played Total Annihilation, don't even bother with the tutorials or manual- you know how to play already. There are no significant differences between the two games, except that the graphics engine is newer and the maps are larger. Fortunately, TA was such a good game that this isn't really a bad thing; in fact, in many respects Supreme Commander is a lot like the excellent Medieval II: Total War- a graphical redux of a classic strategy title.Graphics are great- about as good as any current RTS games, especially considering the sheer scale of maps and the numbers of units you can deploy. The sound, music, and effects are well done, especially those produced by superweapons and higher tech units. Environments are fully destructible, and you can visually tell where serious fighting has occurred by the burnt-out hulks of destroyed units. One interesting point to note is that this game lacks a dedicated minimap; however, if your units enter battle you can actually hear them shooting even if your focus is nowhere near them. You can also zoom out the standard view until everything becomes, effectively, a minimap with units represented by icons. It's possible to run an entire battle this way, but needless to say you'll be missing out on a lot of the eye candy.As with Total Annihilation, the playstyle heavily favors favor defense. Defensive structures are, generally speaking, cheaper, tougher, and more powerful than mobile units. For example, you can spend a half hour pumping attack bombers out of three air factories. Send them all in, and if the enemy even has four mid-tech anti-air guns (which can be built in about 5 minutes by one engineer) they'll all be trashed in twenty seconds flat. I'm not exaggerating in the least. So how would you break down defenses? Usually by amassing a massive force of high tech level units (preferably backed by artillery of some sort) and simply wearing them down in an extremely bloody war of attrition. One rather sad side-effect of these long-range battles is that it's practically suicide to mount a frontal assault, which means you'll often end up using radar and heavy artillery to shoot at enemies. However, since radar doesn't reveal the fog of war (only unit locations) you'll miss most of the fancy explosions in the process. This really turns the game into a battle of icons, which is unfortunate.Unless your opponent is a complete amateur, you can expect a regular battle to last several hours. Short of sending in your ACU immediately, rushing is a totally ineffective tactic in this game. Even that isn't advisable, since your opponent has one too, which usually results in mutually assured destruction. Later on in the game you can build things like strategic warheads (read: nukes) and experimental units. However, even these are easily countered and they're so slow to build that by the time you get any you're well into your second- if not third- hour of play. In a sense, this really fits the description of the galaxy and the infinite war that's been raging for hundreds of years: it takes so long to level a base that it's really no wonder.The original Supreme Commander campaign has three factions, each with six missions. Forged Alliance adds a fourth faction and another campaign. These missions are very long- the latter ones can easily take you several hours to finish. It's advisable you save often because there are no checkpoints, some objectives are timed or unit-critical (and thus very easy to fail), and restarting a mission from near the finish is something you simply won't want to do. Unfortunately, the campaigns are pretty lackluster in terms of story, structure, and objectives. There's a general story, but it's a pretty canned 'the enemy's everywhere, let's pull out our McGuffin and wipe them out' tale that's been old news since Wing Commander. Your objectives are always to either capture/defend something or wipe out the enemy, there are no secondary objectives, and there is no recourse for failing any of them. When completing objectives the map will often expand, which is a somewhat novel feature that can also be a bit irritating (e.g. you found out you built your defenses on the wrong side of your base, and here comes about 500 enemy units at what you thought was a perfectly safe rear). In every case, expect to engage in a long, grinding battle of attrition that's pretty much the same as a skirmish mode game. Not too brilliant, to say the least, but it does teach you how to play the factions. On the whole, if you're most interested in a single play campaign or game, this will probably be a disappointment. There are a LOT of better single play RTS games out there- in fact, I think pretty much all of them are better. The CPU is decent for skirmish mode, but not exactly brilliant. If you have even a rudimentary grasp of tactics and can successfully micromanage your armies, crushing even multiple AI opponents is a no-brainer. Granted, as noted before, it might take hours to do just because of the time it takes to grind them down, but it won't be hard- just long. This all means that (to absolutely no surprise from Total Annihilation vets) Supreme Commander is really a multiplayer game. Get some friends together that have all day, get some caffeine, and have at it. It's good old fun.In general, the factions are pretty darn identical. This is probably born of necessity due to the difficulty of balancing so many units (each side has, literally, dozens of units and structures). There are very slight differences in form and function for some corresponding roles (e.g. Cybran destroyers can walk on land), but nothing that will make you really consider alternative tactics since mobile units are just so darn weak. About the only units of note are the highest tech-level units, which are supposed to be overpowering but aren't really unless you can build a whole lot of them (which takes, literally, hours- even assuming your opponent doesn't try to stop you). And on that note, aside from some of the more powerful defensive structures, there's no 'nut-cracker' units in this game. Even the most powerful mobile units can easily be destroyed by swarms of lesser, and far cheaper turrets. That, by the way, does apply to your commander as well- which is something you would do well to bear in mind since he (as in Total Annihilation) blows up like a nuke when he dies. Since losing your commander usually results in game over one way or another, you'll find yourself not wanting to risk him in combat. This makes the commander, which is upgradeable and otherwise one of the more powerful and interesting units, essentially a glorified engineer.By now you probably have a good idea if this is your kind of game. Generally speaking, if you like really long, epic battles then you'll like this. If you're one of those people that doesn't like a melee, mission, or skirmish to last more than 20 minutes, you'll hate it. The number and variety of units available- far more than pretty much any other current game- gives you a lot of options in terms of army makeup even if, in the end, it might not matter a great deal. Exploring the various factions and their very unique looking structures and units, and seeing swarms of them engage in vicious battles, is the meat of Supreme Commander.Technically speaking, the game is pretty well done except for one major, glaring flaw. The Achilles' Heel of Supreme Commander is its pathfinding. It is atrocious- the worst I've seen since LucasArts' ill-fated Force Commander. Units will get stuck on each other, on hills, on buildings, and on nothing in particular. Order a cluster of nicely formed land or sea units into battle any significant distance away and half of them will arrive there one at a time, ten seconds apart due to bad pathfinding. You can mitigate this to some degree by ordering them to move in formation, Total War style, but the game's default formations are pretty awkward, can't be changed, and tend to make your units sitting ducks for AOE attacks. That means, of course, that you can expect long-range turrets to chop your whole army to bits unless you babysit them- sometimes literally on an individual basis- all the way there. Even then there's no guarantees: sometimes when you order units to move in a certain direction, they'll get stuck and go in the opposite direction. Sometimes they'll find an alternate path that takes them literally all the way around the map. As a side effect of this, the waypoint system (one of the minor, but potentially useful upgrades from Total Annihilation) is largely useless for anything but air units. I agree that it's nice to have realistic movement and collision detection in pathing, but not at the expense of it just plain not working. The pathfinding is so bad that you'll be seriously tempted to employ only air units, since these are the only ones guaranteed to get where you send them. Needless to say, this only makes the defense-centric focus of the game even more pronounced. It makes attacking unnecessarily more difficult, and makes turtling a snap. Why go through all that effort when you can just sit there shelling your enemies with long-range artillery? Ironically, one of the best and fastest ways to attack an enemy base is to bring up engineers, build a few turrets, and then build artillery within range of it.This might be something you could deal with if this game wasn't an RTS. For an RTS, bad pathing is a game-breaker: it's something that just HAS to work. You have way too much micromanagement to deal with without having to worry about whether your units will actually go where you send them. The sad fact is, it just doesn't function in Supreme Commander, and this ruins what is otherwise a great game. Even in multiplayer, the pathing issues are murderous. It pretty much limits your options to flat land maps that are totally featureless, since you simply won't want to deal with obstacles.On a multiplayer note, SC suffers from the same problem as Total Annihilation: with tons of units on the screen, you can have some serious graphical and network lag. And when you're playing with other people, the game only goes as fast as the slowest guy. That can be pretty darn slow indeed. Generally speaking, you really need everyone on broadband with a fast machine, otherwise the melee's going to take even longer than it already is. In fact, I would say that Supreme Commander is probably the only recent RTS where a local area network is actually recommended for multiplayer.Despite its flaws, which are quite serious and might- in another game- make it not recommendable, Supreme Commander is enough fun that I'd still say its worth playing. Especially for fans of classic TA or those that like RTS games but have never played it (shame on you) it's a real treat.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2009"}

Yes, this game exposes me to words I am unfamiliar with.  The farther along I get, the higher the difficulty level, the more games I unlock.  Words I miss are put back in the queue and I eventually become familiar with the definitions.Some of the games involve speed, rather than knowledge of the correct word.  They may give the same amount of time to spell a long word as a short word, sometimes with not enough time even if I know the answer.  The cereal game, for example, where a definition is given and we have to spell the correct answer from the letters floating in the bowl.I am not sure of the purpose of the falling tiles game.  We have to find the words in order to knock out the tiles, which stack higher and higher.  We have to knock out the blocks so they don't reach the ceiling.  The only thing we learn in that game is recognition of words, but no definitions or anything; and again, it is mostly a game of speed.Some of the games have the risk of motion injury, as I found playing the safe cracker game, where players twist their wrists back and forth and click to pick out the letters of the word that fit the definition given.  My wrists and thumb were eventually very sore.  In that game, I felt a standard game controller would be nice.What I would really like is to hear a voice pronounce the word and see it used in a sentence.  It would be nice to see some of the games involve placing the correct word in a sentence to show true mastery.  In fact, I kept playing and playing hoping one of the new unlocked games would involve something like that.  My hopes were not realized.  I had unlocked everything and no sentences to be seen.I do like the fact that words we miss are presented repeatedly until they are mastered.  It doesn't hurt to be exposed to all the definitions of new words.  I would like them to take it a step further, because if I could hear the words in a sentence, it would help me use them correctly in my daily writing and speech.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2009"}

However, I bought Street Fighter and PilotWings and I didn't feel the 3D effect was nearly as good. I feel satisfied playing these games in 2D mode. The AR Cards are amazing and make up for the lack of 3D games during release. I'll be honest, I bought this in expectation of a summer Zelda release (fingers crossed). While the screens are not as big as the XL, I was kind of glad. I felt the DSiXL made games look blocky and less fluid. In terms of the system, it is light weight and I believe the same dimensions as the DSi. One problem I've run into is some of the older games use both screens as one which does not work as well with a smaller touch screen. For example some of the Mario games and Zelda Phantom Hourglass.I have heard many complaints about the price, but consider that it is the same price the PSP came out at years ago. Considering the increased cost of living I don't believe the price is outrageous. If you are completely satisfied with your DS or DSi I would say wait on the 3DS if you don't see any games your interested in yet. Especially considering the battery life is about half of the older systems. But if you really love 3D, and can stand a little bit of eye strain from long periods of gaming in 3D, I would definitely recommend this system.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}

These controllers are GREAT for keeping your gaming area free of clutter. To start with, the controller is much smaller than the standard XBox controller was.For control items, you start with the standard blue X, yellow Y, red B and green A buttons. There are two thumbsticks, one on the upper left and one in the center right. There is also a directional (d-pad) in the lower left.Next, you have a pair of shoulder buttons at the \"top\" of the unit, up above the other buttons. You also have a pair of triggers below those shoulder buttons.Finally, you have a center X button that can be used to turn the console on and off, plus a \"start\" and \"back\" tiny white buttons on either side of it.The unit has a rechargeable battery unit inside it, the size of two AA batteries. You have to buy a recharger set SEPARATELY that lets you charge up while you play. In essence you plug the charger into the back of the controller - and the other end into the USB port in the front of the XBox 360 unit. So you play with the controller \"wired\" as it charges up. When it's fully charged again, you just pop off the wire and keep playing.The range of the wireless unit is 30', which is probably much further than anybody is really going to even try playing a game at. The wireless is much easier on your hand - no cable holding you down - plus it's a great help in keeping your gaming area organized. You can easily pass the controller from person to person, and visitors can come and go without tripping over wires.The documentation says you can get 40 hours of gameplay between charges, but if you have features such as vibration on, that sucks the time down to maybe 8-10 hours. It's up to you of course - I personally like having vibration on because it is often important for gameplay to get those warning signals.Still, even if I have to plug the cables in every 10 hours or so to give it a juice boost, I still love wireless!! Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2005"}

Japanese cars, tracks.. music.. driving around in common sports cars that you see on the streets but I couldn't afford.. it was perfect..but they didn't make it total arcade like you were driving around on snes in fzero going bezerk speeds..felt real.And then 3 came out... 4... 5... and the menu's got heavier... bulkier.. loading got slower.. tracks stayed the same.. super cars came in and that sort of hurt the franchise for me, now it was way over the top and felt bulky without style or life.. no more could I buy a Alcyone Subaru SVX... or Toyota Altezza..(granted they still have my miata in the game..)Gran Turismo 6 is like a giant DLC of 5.

I'm sooooo glad I did.This is an experience. The game plays out exactly.... repeat... EXACTLY... like an ultra violent action movie. The visuals are part of the gameplay the same way Viewtiful Joe, Madworld and even Heavy Rain incorporate its graphic style to the game. It's gritty, dark, ugly looking but the smooth 60 fps through-out the whole experience and the shaky camera is the icing on the top. The camera gets dirty, wet, sprayed with blood, glitches (like when you violently shake a real camera) and even blurs out headshots to give it a documentary feel. I read about people complaining about the blurring and shaky camera.... but it's part of the game.\"It's a generic shooter that brings nothing new to the table.\" is another complaint. In all honestly, they're dead wrong. No other shooter immerses you in a world this dark (yes, it's darker than Max Payne) and makes you feel like you're RIGHT THERE. Storywise... as I said before, this is like playing an action movie. It's thin and only gives you an excuse to shoot everybody in Shanghai. Control is spot-on and has weight like if you're actually controlling a human and not a robot. Sounds are awesome. Ambient music, echoeing footsteps and lots of loud gunshots. Playing this with a headset is a blast! It's 4-5 hours long and it's the perfect length for a game like this.It's a brutal, fast, violent ride that is absolutely worth the price tag of $- you can get it now (I got it for $2.60).

But once the game is ready to go you'll notice immediately one of those things the Gran Turismo crowd is always going on about, Graphics.This game is stunning, the leather has bumps, the flake is evident in the paint, the digital bugs spatter the paint, the sun is every bit as annoying and gorgeous as it is in real life, and the cars whether matte or wet looking gloss look so real it's like you could reach into the game and touch them expecting to hear the familiar slight screech rubbing noise your fingers make as you slide them across a real car. I do not joke, the graphics here are insanely detailed, and for once in my life I have seen a computer accurately reflect surroundings on the car paint, which adds a whole new level to immersion and detail. The beauty doesn't stop there, the bodies running about before a race are modeled well enough to be believable, the driver fidgets on the steering wheel after long corners and shifting and the tracks and roads in the game are amazingly beautiful. Prague itself is stunning, and something even a critic, a massive bag of cynicism like myself is FORCED to find wonderful. Each track in the game, a smaller number than the previous game, has this spit-shined beauty, this incredible attention to detail, and I found myself drinking it all in at 140 mph as I battled for the lead. The graphics and mannerisms are just wonderful, but its nothing compared to the sound.Forza has always had good sound, but Turn ten has done something truly incredible here with this work, from the spitting fireballs from V6's, 8's, 10's, 12's and flat 6's, 4's to inline 4's and 6's, the sound is bang on and incredible, immersing the player in an exquisite symphony of gasoline and testosterone from the greasy, oil fed monsters of motorsport. It's all set to a high beats per minute orchestral music, a score to keep your blood pumping, and something you'd expect to hear watching the last lap of an epic race where the hero of the movie makes 4 or 5 miraculous passes and emerges the victor. Something else you might imagine is the car chases of old movies like Bullitt or Ronin, just epic, beautiful heart and pure driving set to edge of your seat, tactful and warming, spirited music delivered like only an orchestra can. The game makes you feel in the moment, and simultaneously fun, while issuing a great challenge.Forza hands its challenge out a la carte' like it always has. Yes I'll take a dollop of hard AI with a bit of no traction control and a dessert of a bit of ABS, followed by a swig of the old racing line to wash it down. Allowing you to experience the cars and AI as you're ready and it does it exactly like it did before, no surprises, but how it hand out AI difficulty is vastly different than old generations.Say all you want Drivatar sounds stupid or it's a lost cause, but until you've tried it out there's nothing in the world that could prepare you for what it does for racing. Imagine you are racing and drivers around you seem to want to win, that they jostle for position, that they attack each and every corner with an unmitigated vigor and fight tooth and nail to every foot they can grab, and you'll have a real race in your head. Forza 5 really does bring that to life. It grabs your driving style, your weird quirky stuff and bundles that into an AI file that gets downloaded by other people. Your Drivatar does its best to act like you, unless you just go backwards or spin people out all of the time, then it ignores those. Then the game emulates you in someone else's game. This not only is cool, it makes the AI seem less like AI, it makes the races more interesting, it makes the opponents seem real. It adds a massive amount of immersion to the game, and it makes you a better driver for it. Such a change in AI is so thoughtful and so game changing you'll wonder why it took this long for someone to do it, no internet? Don't fret they programmed plenty of on disc Drivatar AI for you too from their own testers, how do you like that?The physics have been improved greatly, surface physics in particular as well as the \"feel\" for the different types of car layouts. Trust me you can definitely feel differences in FWD vs RWD now, they're completely different animals. No longer will cars behave mostly differently in just the beginning of the race. Power and handling plays a much greater role in racing and driving on the raggedy edge feels better than ever. The menus are more clean and generally more streamlined and I like the ability to customize wile in Forza Vista, a feature showing off cars like Auto Vista from Forza 4 but less personalized from a car standpoint in favor of a blanket for manufacturer, while still allowing all cars to be completely checked out tire tread to hatch cover. But all of this I'm afraid does get tarnished by the rusty body panels bubbling their virus through the otherwise immaculate paint.Deep down though Forza 5 really is Forza 4 with a lick of nice paint and a lot of shiny bits removed, many cars have been slashed to meet the One's launch deadline and the 50 dollar tab to get the car pass to raise that amount 60 more seems unfair to fans that have been with the series since the XBOX, like me. However well the cars look and feel does seem like a big trade off to lose possibly someone's favorite car. Thank fully all my favorites made it back in, but I did miss some of the new cars recently brought in to the series such as the New Fiat Punto. The loss of several tracks bringing the total down to 14 is also sad as well, again sacrificed for the perfect nature of the tracks included. All content is laser scanned and meticulously created, and again I'm so happy about it, but I feel for the people who's favorite cars were slashed for this.But I can't dock the score for it, the money grub, the missing cars and tracks, all of it doesn't matter, its simply a spectacular game, and it's an excellent simulator the game contains an amazing number of races, and will give you your 60 dollars' worth and some, just like Forza 4 before it. When you're done with that the online features carry it further with online racing and other fun stuff.If you enjoy racing games, if you enjoy cars, this game is wondrous to behold and experience and with all of its difficulty mods, it can be enjoyed by anyone who has any passion for racing, it's a hard game to not recommend, even with the shaky financial situation, and the strong drop in tracks and cars from the previous game. Forza 5 really does prove that its quality, not quantity that matters, and it's a 4 star game for me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BWC","reviewerName":"RJ","summary":"Some good... some not so good...","reviewText":"I have played this game through once with a mage, and am now piddling away with a warrior (PC version only).  I had very high hopes for this game - one of my fav games of all time is BGII - and I was hoping this could compete toe for toe.  Some aspects do - but there are a few that do not.Overall, the story/quests of the game is portrayed is very similar to BGII (2D vs. 3D) in that you have points of interest in a broad overland map that bring you to quest locations.  The quests themselves and their varying locations are very good, with some on par with what was offered in BGII.  There is a similar darkness to the theme, the quests portraying a steady dose of demonic possession, dark beasts, and magic gone foul.  You also have the origins story for each toon you make, such as if you make a dwarf (my current toon), you can start as one from the royal house and get a nice 30 minute starting story for your character, or you can start as one of the poverty stricken classless sods and get a similar story.  Each that I have played through are well done and give you some nice background for your character.  The cut scenes are overall pretty well done and (best of all with a second playthrough) you can just skip through them by hitting escape.  The quest zones are well done, the PC graphics very sharp if you have the machine to portray them.There are some aspects, however, which I feel do not really meet the standards set by BG II.The first of these is the character and class system.  You gain levels and with each you gain attribute (3) and skill points (1).  The attribute points are similar to many a RPG (put a point in strength, magic, etc.), but the skill points are where this shines.  You can make a rogue, mage, or warrior.  There are many skill sets - each grouped in a similar area of specialty (two handed weapons, dual wield, death magic, elemental magic, etc.) and each group is four deep (first tier nub skills up to the fourth tier uber skills).  It is fun to level up and get a new talent or spell, one which you can access immediately and put to good use.  It makes you strategize how you will create a build for your toon, which is always fun to do.  Each talent is either use upon clicking on your tool bar when you click the icon, can be a passive talent, or can be a sustained use talent that takes a permanent chunk of your mana/stamina to keep it active.  The only issue with this is that some of the talents - specifically some of the mage talents - seem kinda of crappy up at the higher levels and not worth the experience and leveling to get up to them.  Additionally, there are spell combos that are very powerful, but if you put points in the wrong trees you will not have access to them.  This also makes some trees seem to be inherently less powerful than others.  The melee trees seem fairly decent, but you run out of stamina very fast as you use your abilities.  Additionally, your melee fighters / tanks seem to be much weaker overall than a comparably leveled mage.As you level up, you also gain access to specialties for your class, such as blood mage, assassin, or champion, etc.  You have to discover them as you go.  Some are very very powerful - the blood mage is very nice - and some seem pretty lame - the templar for warriors is junk.The second main issue I have with dragon age is this - it crashes, and crashes, and crashes some more.  You literally need to save every 5 minutes, without fail.  I don't know what the issues are with the code, but it seems to be whenever a new cut scene is played or a loading screen comes up and BAM! blank screen than the ever so familiar 'dragon age: origins has stopped working' appears.  Ho hum, load again and hope you remembered the save.The third main issue I have deals with combat.  You have to build a strategy for on how you deal with each fight (some on the PC can be very challenging - especially if the elite mobs resist your cc spells over and over), but I tended to do the same set of combos over and over.  As the environments changed, the battles tended to stay the same. I found the more I played the game, the more it stayed the same.  The only freshness was on some of the boss battles.  Dragons and some of the large mass battles can be very challenging.Another nit pick is this: if you live at an APO/FPO address, you cannot put the address in the billing section to buy DLC content.  This is rather ridiculous since most companies automatically include these, but alas, dragon age does not.  I do not know if they plan to fix this in the future, but as of right now you cannot purchase the DLC content from these addresses.Overall, I would rate the game as ***Story ****Combat *** (***** for boss battles)Character generation / leveling ***Stability *","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000B43OY4","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Definitely Worth the Money","reviewText":"First of all let me say that I was not a proponent of the Xbox 360 when it first came out. I thought that the hype was way overblown and more importantly there were no blockbuster launch titles. By far the most ridiculous thing about the 360 was the fact that people were paying upwards of $3000 on Ebay for package deals soon after it was released. Much to the dismay of these poor suckers the first generation had bugs and overheating problems and ultimately Microsoft had to make a new generation of systems within a few months of release. Mine is a fourth generation; I haven't had any problems. With that said when I saw the first screenshots of Elder Scrolls IV, I knew that one way or another I would buy that game; which leads me to the reason why I bought the Xbox 360.At $400 for the premium version Microsoft claims to take a loss on every system. That idea isn't so far-fetched when you consider the hardware the Xbox 360 has to offer. With three symetrical 3.2 ghz processors, a 512mb system memory at 700mhz, a specially designed graphics processing unit by ATI, the usual built-in DVD player, a 20 gigabyte hard drive, some various accessories nobody really cares about and the ability to run component HD. Despite the fact that many people think the Xbox 360 is useless without a $2000 plasma or LCD HDTV, I find the picture using an S-video cable extremely sharp on just a standard tube television. This not only rivals some of the best gaming computers, but for the price nothing even comes close. For this reason I decided it better to purchase the Xbox 360 instead of a trumped up desktop computer when I already have a laptop.My favorite feature on the Xbox 360 is the ability to rip music from CDs to the hard drive and play them during any game. The original xbox had the ability to rip the music but couldn't play in hardly any games. System size is considerably smaller than the previous xbox as well as the weight not to mention a lot more time was spent on the actual design of the 360. With an off-white clean look it is reminiscent of Apple hardware. On the premium Xbox 360 you receive one wireless controller. It is phenomenal. The range is amazing and I have no problem playing through mediums. Unlike previous off brands which were wireless, there is absolutely no delay. More importantly you never have to worry about buying one of those ridiculous extensions if you are the person stuck in the back of the room.Now for the cons of the system. Xbox's power consumption must be enormous because the AC adapter is about the size of a carton of cigarettes. I realize electricity bills are not something many think about when you have a stationary electronic device, but for a system this high powered it may be a consideration. My main qualm is not with the system, but with the makers of the games. They raised the prices of the games while simultaneously creating games that nobody wants to play. Yes games are what make the system, however Microsoft can only do so much before the game developers have to come up with popular games. So really one couldn't even say the lack of good games is a problem with the system, but with the developers.Ultimately if you are a gamer it really comes down to which system you will buy, not if you will buy one. I have already listed the positive and negative aspects of the Xbox 360. Some information on the PS3: the base system MSRP will be $500 with a 20 gig HD and the 40 gig HD system will run $600. I will try to be objective as possible. The memory is fairly identical to the 360's, while the processor is a single 3.2 ghz processor with what Sony is calling seven other synergistic processing elements. The GPU is based on one of the Nvidia's current graphics cards used in computers today.The main difference between the two is most obviously the Bluray DVD-rom drive. It allows for using a much greater amount of space to hold high definition games and movies. I have heard it should be able to hold somewhere around 30 gigabytes of information. I believe this is what is driving the cost of the PS3 up and ultimately the price will be the downfall of the playstation. Consider that just over five years ago the playstation 2 was $300 and now Sony decides to jack up the price by $200. The most disturbing thing about Sony is that just recently I heard that Sony has the ability to make the PS3 unable to play used games. If done, this would shrink the PS3 fanbase significantly. Consider how many types of games wouldn't play on the system: PS1, PS2, used games, friends games and how would renting work?What will have people very reluctant to purchase the PS3 will be the reliability of the hardware. Still fresh in my mind is the fact that all of the components eventually went out on my playstation 2. About a year after I purchased it the DVD player stopped working. A year after that I bought a brand new game which would not play at all. One by one each and every one of the games that I owned would not play on the PS2, rendering the system a large black paperweight. In fact, a class action lawsuit was launched against Sony circa 2004. With the original Xbox I never had a single problem playing a game and I've owned it for near three years. In conclusion, I believe the Xbox 360 by itself is a much better buy than any of the next generation systems.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2006"}

The characters are some what deformred....on purpose.  This game is showing things from the past.  You'll be reminded of things from the earlier games.  They have Rufus March (from FF7) playing in the 1st disk and other little things.  The battle system is the same but this time, it's much eaiser than the stupid junction system.  Also, the summons are not as long as they were in FF8, thank GOD!  After a few uses, they just last 1 sec and then they just tell you how much damage it did.  Also, not everyone can use magic.  Some are just physical attackers, and two of them use summons and healing and protective magic and one of them uses offensive magic, like Ice3 and stuff.  Once again, the story is great!

Pushing a button to do execute a force push just can't feel the same as actually doing a pushing motion with your hand and seeing your enemies fly back on the screen. The camera is definitely an issue, a lot of times you will find yourself waving your light saber like a madman at enemies you can't see because the camera is out of position.

{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Take the Vampire Killer in Hand","reviewText":"No matter how you slice it, the original Castlevania on the NES was a milestone for its time.  Great graphics, music and atmosphere made this one of the more popular NES titles to get.  Of course, it suffers in a couple of key areas: particularly the difficulty.  Wii owners now have a chance to download this classic for 500 Wii Points, and no classic controller is needed to enjoy it.Castlevania revolves around the Belmont clan.  You play as Simon Belmont out to stop Dracula, who has been revived and is going to wreck some havoc.  It's the Belmont's job to stop him every time he is revived, and in this game you'll do it as Simon.Castlevania is made up of six levels, and they're not really all that long.  At the end of each level is a boss.  Getting through the levels can prove to be an arduous task, however.  Castlevania, like a lot of great NES classics, is hard.  Very hard.  Along with such classics as Mega Man and Contra, Castlevania ranks as one of the hardest games on the NES, and it's not all due to level design.  Your movements feel a little stiff sometimes, and there are moments when things are just... not fair.  Such as when you jump but you don't see the Medusa head coming at you, and so instead of landing, you get knocked into a pit.  You also can't control your character while he jumps.  If you're jumping to the left, you can't stop yourself from going left while in midair.  Sometimes these small quarks can be a pain, but once you get used to it, the game is really quite fun.As you progress through the levels Simon has the ability to upgrade his whip.  It starts off as just a normal whip, but you can find an upgrade (usually early on in a level) to a morning star, and then a third time into a bigger morning star to extend his range.  There are also subweapons you can use such as knives and axes.  These consume hearts, which are easily replenished by smashing candles or killing enemies.  For a first outing, Castlevania is fantastic.The Castlevania series is known for having some of the greatest music in the video game industry.  Even back 20 years ago, its clear that Castlevania was something else in terms of its music.  Its gothic and dark, and just all around sounds really good.  This is mainly because the music of the game clearly sets the mood.  You won't hear anything light here, and it even gives the game's already dark tone a creepy atmosphere to boot.  Countless tracks have been remixed in later installments.  For an NES game, the music is some of the best you'll hear on the system.Graphically Castlevania would've been considered a powerhouse.  It's extremely colorful, the sprites are extremely detailed and so are your enemies.  There are even things in the background that get some attention.  Castlevania set a bar for the NES.  Throughout all this, the game consistently keeps its dark atmospheric look in tact.  There are times when the game flickers and whatnot, but this is an NES game, it's to be expected.The only thing that really keeps Castlevania down is its unforgiving difficulty.  You get an infinite amount of continues, at least, but those new to Castlevania will probably find themselves frustrated with it.  Even some people who consider themselves gaming experts will have some frustration with this game the first time through.  Thankfully, however, the game is fun, and if you really are getting tortured, just remember it's only for six levels.The Good+Graphically impressive for the time+The music has definitely survived the test of time+Dark, atmospheric look remains consistent and never changes+Even for the first outing, Castlevania had quite a variety added to the gameplayThe Bad-Really difficult game","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2007"}

Each member of the team has unique abilities that give a balanced feel to the game.  Brutus and Tex are heavy gunners, using assault rifles, rocket launchers, and shotguns to mow down enemies.  Flint and Hawk back the team with stealth tactics and sniper rifles.  All team members can use a variety of grenades and mines.While original and fun, Brute Force is not without its problems.  First, the team members' AI is not all that great.  Your team can get themselves killed very quickly if you rush in or if there are snipers present.  Only Brutus and Tex are actually armored enough to last long enough to heal themselves.  In addition, the enemies seem to have flawless accuracy at insane distances.  You can sometimes be shot to pieces by an enemy a mile away before you even see him.  This sometimes leads to alot of steath tactics and, therefore, really long missions spent sneaking around.When all is said and done, the good far outweighs the bad in Brute Force.  The multiplayer, combined with unlockable characters, adds replay value, and you can get additional missions off of Xbox Live.  Recommended for action game fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00006Z7I3","description":"The Getawayoffers shooting and driving action in gigantic London environments, from busy streets to gritty warehouses, that are re-created in obsessive, photorealistic detail. How gigantic? One of the developers boasted that it takes 15 minutes of real time to drive from one end of the city to the other. The game follows the story of an ex-bank robber, a vigilante cop, and their battle against Charlie Jolson, a notorious crime boss of London's East End. This game will inevitably draw comparisons toGrand Theft Auto IIIandMax Payne, but its ambitious scope puts it in a class by itself.","reviewerName":"Pat O'Donnell","summary":"Good game","reviewText":"Well, I finally got to play Getaway(U.K version) and for the most part, am quite pleased. I only played it for about 1 hour, and then took it 'round a friend's house, where we induldged in some serious playing tme with the game. General census after a few hours was that at first it's a bit hard to like, but it does start to grow on you eventually (we played into the very early hours, which is kind of testament to the game's charm). It's neither a GTA clone and doesn't try to be, but it mixes aspects of GTA and SC with driving and stealth.In the game, you're Mark. Mark's wife goes outside their house with son intact and out of nowhere some Landan (which is how it's pronounced in Cockney rhyming-slang) gang try to kidnap the kid. Wife interferes - gets shot). Mark hears the shot and out he goes. The kid's kidnapped and the cars burning off. He stupidly handles the gun used to shoot his wife and hence he is the number one suspect and accused of kidnapping his own kid. Mark tends to his wife, and then jumps in a car and the chace begins. The whole game then revolves around you getting your kid back by working for this gang and doing everything they tell you.The cars actually control quite nice. Framerate's pretty good, but studders in spots. It runs 60fps mostly but dips to 30fps on occasion. Especially when there's too much on screen/or you crash into someone and multiple cars catch fire. The streets are much more populated than the barren streets of GTA Vice for instance, there is alot of traffic, just as there always is in London. There's also a nice little touch where your indicators blink when you need to turn (in relation to your mission) and both flash when you've got to your destination. The city is also rendered very well. If you live in London, you'd be amazed that a game could be designed so cloesly to it's real life structure. The cars are modeled extremely well, with enviroment mapping and impressive physics. All the cars are licensed from real manufactures, unlike GTA. Draw distance is also quite good. In comparison to GTA3/Vice, the Getaway looks ten times better, it really does.Controlling Mark on foot is gonna be where the game gets its criticism by some. Aiming is a bit ropey, along with controlling the camera. Control of Mark on foot is akward at first, but get's a bit easier as you play. For example, the shooting sections of the game, I discovered I'd been using the wrong button to enter shooting mode - I'd been using manual aim rather than auto-aim. With that minor correction, I was silently flitting through the warehouse MGS style, popping up over benches with a shotgun, or firing two guns round doorways. You can only carry one [set of] weapons, and walking over another one will automatically result in Mark picking it up. Whether or not you intented for him to is another matter. Though it must be said there is a nice variety of weapons in the game.The basics of what Mark can do is back up to a wall (peer around). You can point your gun around the corner and take random blasts in hope of hitting someone with the benefit of them not being able to hit you. This usually leads to mass ammo being wasted. You can crouch under small walls (waist height) and strafe around them. Also a nice little tactic is to line yourself up with someone behind the wall and press shoot to point your gun over and fire off a few rounds. Like GTA, you can take any car you want, stealing or otherwise. You can also hold people hostage at gunpoint, if the cops get too close for your liking. Also, you get to play as two different characters in the game, one is Mark, I'll keep the other as a secret. The AI is standard stuff. The cops (when in a vehicle) are lethal in trying to run you off the road when you're wanted, and makes for some pretty exiting police chases, espescially in the crowded London streets. The vehicles do take damage so if you bang up your ride too much, you'll need to ditch it and steal another one. All in all, the missions are fun and are quite varied. They take place both outdoors and indoors. You're probably asking if there is a non linear free rome mode, ala GTA, and the answer is yes, and it's a blast to play. It will definitely take you awhile to completely finish the game, and offers fairly good replay value.The cinematics/voice acting is superb. Some real nice cinematics, and some of the dialogue is L-O-L funny. Some nice product placement going on. Cans of Stella, XXXX, Sony mobile phones and most high-street stores (Burger King, McDonalds, Odeon Cinemas, etc, etc). These is some adult words used here as well, actually alot. All in all, Sony delivered on a very ambitious game and I am quite plesaed with the results. I'd give the game a 9/10 score overall and definitely recommend fans of the genre to pick this game up when it hits the States.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2002"}

The glare, water, damage and other graphical effects are gorgeous.The gameplay is easy to pick up and insanely fun. Both my wife and I had a great time racing (and crashing!) the great variety of cars. The races are challenging, but it's also just a lot of fun tooling around taking down cops and see how fast you can go and how hard you can crash.The music is well-suited to the game. I love how the gamepad works to augment the game experience and provide extra sound to the game.I'd recommend trying different cars for different races -- that's the key to being successful in the game. Also be sure to update the game when you first play it -- I noticed a measurable improvement in the game controls after doing so.Highly recommend to any Wii U owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2014"}

SMB also had the benefit of being very simple to grasp; run, jump, and fire. It was also the first side-sroller as we know it, though Atari's PITFALL set up the concept. Also, it's one of the best.

It improved on 11, and had a steep learning curve.  You actually had to practice because hitting was hard.So what changed for 13?  They made hitting way too easy.  Big leaguers hit probably .265-.270 as a league average, so hitting should be hard.  Plus the ball just flies off your bat, and not in a good way.  Last year there was a trophy for hitting ten homers in a row in home run derby, and I never got it even though I played tons.  In 13 the first time I played hr derby I hit like 15 in a row.  Not good.  The most annoying change is the new 'error meter' when you throw the ball. 90% of plays are so routine for big leaguers there is little chance for error.  Not here.  Here you try to throw the ball around the infield (old habit) and it goes flying into the stands. Lame.Also hitting was harder in 12, but pitching was easier.  In 13 your pitcher doesnt hit his spots as accurately as before, but its not that big a deal.Overall its a good game, not great like 12, but still the best baseball game out there (other than ootp baseball).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","summary":"not the greatest mario game but still a good one","reviewText":"After having to live up to the previous galaxy, 3d land, and new super mario bros wii this game had a lot to live up to. The ones i mentioned were probably the best mario games ever since mario 64 and the originals on the nes. However this one was a bit of a step backwards. My main complaint is that the game *is* pretty much nsbw but on a handheld. The game uses the same music with more Wahs and even though the games graphics are a bit sharper its still pretty much the same. The levels however while simular to the nsbw are diffrent. With all that being said even though its a bit of a step backwards it isnt a huge step backwards as there is still lots of fun and even though its more forgiving then past mario games there is still a few challenging moments as the levels themselves are very well designed just like all the other mario games just dont play it thinking this is gonna change the gaming industry. The one thing it does seperate from mario bros wii is the coin system and the game wants you to collect 1,000,000 coins which is very fun but also kinda broken as you will easily have over 200+ lives by the time you do this. Anyway if you like the other mario games i would recomend it as you will enjoy it expecilly if your not very good at them as this would be a great starter game since its easierpros: its classic styled mariothe raccoon suit makes a return to 2d mariocoin system is more unique and kinda gives it a slow paced sonic gamewith mario feelcons: recycled content on surface it looks just like the previous gamecoin system while unique does kinda break the game with livesto easy","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive.

When word of its getting the video game treatment initially spread, a mixture of excitement and dread hit most aficionados of the classic B-movie. Thankfully, Rockstar Games spared no detail in bringing the The Warriors (Rockstar; PS2) video game to reality, impressively.Game play is intuitive, especially for the millions no doubt familiar with past Rockstar titles like the assortment of Grand Theft Auto games. Players can choose to wreak havoc in Rumble Mode or play in the linear Story mode. You can also bop your way throughout the game while alternately playing as any of the Warriors; steady leader Swan, the brash Ajax, the doomed Cleon, etc. Although the game can be easily finished in a week's time, if not less, the ability to replay levels and various side adventures maximize the games replay value.Besides eventually replaying the events of the original flick, the game provides a nice back story to the origins of the Warriors gang and how they earned their rep on the streets of Coney Island. Late 70's slang is thick with horny gang members freely relaying their desires for some new \"wool\" or calling those unfortunate to be left in their paths \"wimps\". Side adventures like crossing out rival gang's burners are another nice touch along with vintage images of NYC when it was truly the Rotten Apple.With its \"M\" rating this game isn't for the faint of heart (come on, the film was rated R) since what it lacks in gunplay it makes up for in lead pipes, machetes and baseball bats. After 25 plus years, The Warriors, in all its forms, still holds its rep. Come out and play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2006"}

For people having trouble with crashes and bugs, first make sure ALL background programs are disabled/closed.  This includes virus protection and firewalls.  Install the latest patch from the Oblivion download site.  Also, go to the Baldurdash site for the newest \"nonofficial\" patch (about 40 MB so far; it's said to correct about 700 errors, and it's far from completed).  Turn off \"water reflection\" and shadows (as much as possible).

{"product_name":"B002I098JE","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Getting Close to its Experation Date","reviewText":"Activision has had huge success with franchises in the past.  Tony Hawk Pro Skater and Guitar Hero were two must have games for years.  Suddenly, people lost interest.  When you make games that cater to the mass market, you can only do so much with them and after so many games, you exhaust what you can do.  Call of Duty feels like it's nearing that point.  Tony Hawk was about catching air and pulling off skateboard stunts for points, Guitar Hero was about dexterously pressing buttons at a frenzied pace.  Call of Duty is basically a cinematic shooting gallery with assisted aiming.  After so many years, the game will eventually get stale and the fans will want more.Concept:  8/10Take the Call of Duty franchise and add a dog, anti-gravity shootouts like underwater / space, swap out zombies with aliens, add squad support so you can earn street cred with your buddies, add a create a character system for Multiplayer, and swap out a few Multiplayer Modes.Story:  5/10In the future, South America invades North America and attacks the USA using satellite weaponry.  The story revolves around a military family, a father and two sons... and their dog, who become involved in special forces \"Ghost\" missions to defend the USA.  The story is well told through cut scenes and mission objectives, but the story is pretty far-fetched.  I actually prefer the original Call of Duty approach to storytelling, where less is more.  Personally, I couldn't get into the story and it made the levels feel less exciting because I didn't care about the characters.Campaign:  6/10For the most part, it's Call of Duty.  It's a very exciting shooting gallery.  You blast away at enemies amid mass destruction!  There are some new and exciting levels and the gameplay is what you would expect from Call of Duty, but I had a few issues with the game.  Throughout the entire campaign, other characters are telling me what to do, when to do it, where to go, and the screen tells me to press X now!  There is so much hand holding that you spend the entire war following people.  If you try to get ahead of them, there are always locked doors or invisible walls to keep you in your place.  It gets frustrating and you really feel boxed in through most of the game.  There are also some recycled levels from past games, which really makes the game feel like an expansion pack, rather than a new game.  Some of the new levels are exciting and there is a good deal of variety to them, but at the end of the day, you still feel like you're on a rail shooter.Multiplayer:  UnplayableI guess I'll start off with the good.  There are plenty of modes to choose from and the new create a soldier system is good.  This Call of Duty game features the most customization, weapons, and perks in multiplayer and was a huge step in the right direction.  However the maps are pretty huge and there's some really bad lag which destroys the game.  Here are some personal experiences:  I'm running across a rooftop and hear Ka-Tink.  I died.  The Kill Cam shows me that a sniper shot me from 200 meters away and the crosshairs were about 1 meter away from my body.  OK...  So, I'm in a building and I hear gunfire around a corner.  Ka-Tink.  I died.  The Kill Cam shows me that an enemy flanked me and fired 9 shots with his pistol... but on my console, I was insta-killed by 1 bullet.  Enemies and allies also rubberband around the maps and it feels like they can all teleport like Nightcrawler from the X-men.  To make matters worse, my level 5 character kept getting matched against level 60 characters who are like wraiths with insta-kill shotguns.  Just one of them can run into a room and kill 4 of my teammates in about 2 seconds.  Of course, I hear Ka-tink!  And die.  The Kill Cam shows me the shotgun blast.  Machine gun shootouts with enemies are also similar... Ka-Tink!  I fired half a clip at an enemy and he insta killed me.  The Kill Cam showed me that I barely aimed my gun and the enemy killed me with a 5-6 round burst to the chest.  I didn't have any fun.  Eventually, I became a camper and just sniped.The Dog:  8/10If Riley, the Dog, is with you, you can press the LB button and he'll take down an enemy attack dog style.  Riley can get knocked down in combat, but he is pretty close to invincible.  There are some stealth missions where you remote control Riley.  You can bark to lure enemies, hide in tall grass, and stealth kill them with your jaws.  I guess you could say that this game features the best and only attack dog Simulator of all Time!Graphics:  9/10The levels, lighting, effects are all top notch and it's what you would expect from Call of Duty.  The game feels immersive...  until you remember that you are being hand held on your way to the next area.  Take Note:  Some of the levels or large parts of them have been used in previous CoD games.  The same is true with the animations.  If you notice these things, you will feel a bit ripped off.Sound:  9/10The sound effects are great and the voice acting is very well done.Maturity:  MThere's some swearing, some violence, some adult situations, and some blood.  It's a war game, so it is what you'd expect.Replay Value:  6/10The Campaign is about 6-7 hours long and if you like CoD campaigns, you should enjoy this one, too.  The game also features a mini-game called Extinction, where you and some friends must destroy alien hives with a roto-rooter type drill.  While the drill is in progress, you must defend the area as a team.  Survive as long as you can.  You can also plant turrets, use explosives, and upgrade your gear on the spot.  When you complete a level, you earn XP to level up.  In addition to the Campaign and Extinction is Multiplayer.  I had a horrible time with Multiplayer, but it's there, too.Overall:  6/10At this point, I feel like Call of Duty is on its way out.  The series needs some serious re-vamping for the next-gen consoles or they're going to lose a lot of their fans.Buy it... but get a deal on it... if you love Call of Duty games.Buy it if you will take advantage of the Squad and Multiplayer features, but beware of the lag.Rent it (like I did) if you just want to blow through the Campaign in 6 hours and try out the other features.Avoid it if you're getting tired of the Call of Duty formula.Note:  If you rent this from Redbox, there are two disks.  There is a gameplay disk and an install disk.  You must rent them both!  However, you can return the install disk as soon as you install the contents onto your hard drive.  That way you only have to keep the gameplay disk and pay for 1 disk a day.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Mario Mania, Twisted","reviewText":"It is just so hard to come by with any other video game icon other than Mario these days. Still, it has been a long voyage that really never seems to end, although it has lasted only 20 years and thensome. From his beginnings with Donkey Kong, and all the way to the spin-offs that don't have anything to do with anything outside of action. Still, every which way Nintendo has gone with another conjured Mario game, it just keeps getting better and better. Still, it was a very big surprise not to release a Mario game as the debut of Nintendo's Gamecube, a similiar move just like the old days of video games in the 1980's. Still, there always can be more than meets the eye with Mario.Super Mario Sunshine, is a whole bit similar than Super Mario 64 back in 1996. Unlike the previous game, Mario is a little bit complicated to control, but it has a lot of the same effects and moves that Mario had before, except the twists with the Fludd waterpack. The game is around Mario being accused of destroying the landscape around Delfino Plaza, and all the other sevral worlds. It really isn't Mario, it is a shadow demon, who looks like Mario. The game evoloves around much fewer worlds as the successor, to Super Mario 64. It is worth the challenge, but does fall back a little bit as being as strong, and challenging. The game does also feature some other feels, including cleaning, and shooting critters and other things with the water cannon. The game does take a whole lot of time to get used to, especially when it comes to trying to make all those camera angles accurate, which also hurts in the forward motion. However, the graphics and the feel of the game is much the same and a little bolder than Mario 64. The game does feature new challenges, but can be a little bit compliacted at first, including a pachinko machine mini-game, and extreme bosses including Petey Piranha and the infamous King Boo, from Luigi's Mansion.Although many people may not enjoy this game as much as Super Mario 64, it is a lot more challenging than meets the eye, and could've had a few more worlds to arrange around it. Arguably, Super Mario Sunshine has a whole lot more to offer, but a little bit easier move would be to offer more worlds around. If you have the Gamecube, this has to be one of the few must-haves for the system. Try it, and be a plumber-mania buff like Mario.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2004"}

'open world' style game meets rpg.","reviewText":"A lot of people might say: 'It's not really an RPG!'.  This is precisely why I like it.  I have played a few in my time though they are not my favorite. The only ones that I've finished are Mass Effect 1 & 2 (which are more shooters in my eyes), Skies of Arcadia (original), and FF3 (DS version) (all also excellent). I saw my girlfriend playing this thing like an addict for days and days.  I thought it was dumb.....until I gave it a try.  I was hooked.  It has everything that every open world game has with more complex experience and alignment systems.  She was surprised as I was that I liked it so much.  RPG is usually a dirty word to me (unless one means the secondary weapon in COD games). I am someone that cannot stand Dragon Age or Fallout as much as I wanted to like them. I'd say that this game is more like GTA4 than either of those.  This is not a serious game at all.  That helps make it more enjoyable in my book.The game is older and is a great buy at current price. It has great graphics, sound, voice acting, story, humor, etc.  The open world elements: minigames, real estate, human interaction, etc. are all top notch as well. It also has a lot of replay value.  There are framerate problems which I've seen my girlfriend experience with part 3 as well.

The white colored PSP isn't that shiny and also has a glitter like effect in the paint. The screen has a black shiny border around with the letters PSP at the very bottom. The screen is liquid clear and looks amazing. To me, it's a decent size and I haven't experience any problems with seeing anything on the screen. The system also has 2 gels like strips at the back of the system to stop it from slipping on a table. The joystick is still firm and requires a lot more pressure to move than a normal PS3 controller. The triangle, square, circle and x buttons are smaller than the PSP fat and PSP Slim. The L and R buttons are placed in an awkward position behind the screen making it somewhat difficult to use. The big reason why I chose the PSP Go instead of the PSP 3000 was because it's Bluetooth capabilities. I hate the PSP 3000 and Go's controls but since the Go has Bluetooth, I can connect my Dual shock 3 and use that to play my games which is the best feature I've ever seen. I close the PSP Go and use my Dual shock 3 and haven't had any problem not even lag since. I download all my PSP demos and games through my PS3 and transfer them to the PSP. The Go has very slow Wi-Fi and I can get 3 or 4 downloads on my PS3 while the PSP would still be doing one. I highly recommend this system for anyone on the \"Go\" and who doesn't want to have to carry games along with their system. I'm a grab and \"Go\" kind of person.

Infamous will get a lot of challenge this year from the likes of Mario Kart U and Smash Bros U, along with possibly Destiny and Watch Dogs.

{"product_name":"B00178631E","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Amazing moments of gameplay buried under mountains of cut scenes","reviewText":"Max Payne 3 sees the return of the titular hero after a break of nine years. Remedy Entertainment, who made the first two games in the series, have moved on with their Alan Wake series of games, leaving Rockstar (best-known for the Grand Theft Auto series) to carry on their work. Whilst fans of the earlier games were dubious of this move, it was actually reasonably logical. Rockstar games often feature damaged protagonists trying to live better lives but being drawn back into a life of violence by circumstances, which is a perfect fit for Payne.The game acts as a reboot of the series. References to the events of the first two games are minimal and, aside from a couple of flashback missions set in New York, the game is set in a different city in a different country with a very different culture (not to mention a different and un-translated language). The only constants are Max himself and, of course, his ability to slow down time to engage in combat.Max Payne 3 is overwhelmingly impressive from a production values standpoint. The graphics are fantastic, with the game employing a vivid visual style. Keywords from conversations flash onto the screen and sometimes the action dissolves into line breaks and the colour desaturates, almost like you're watching the action on an old 1980s TV that is about to expire. The game's colour palette tends towards the bright and colourful, but there is a dark hue to everything. Sections set in crumbling warehouses or an abandoned hotel contrast the light and dark elements of the game's style. Animation is astonishing, with Max storing his weapons on his person and moving them around naturally to swap guns or take painkillers. The game feels like it's had a million dollars spent on every single minute of it (in sharp contrast to the low-budget feel of the first game, with its amateur cut scene actors).The game's centerpiece is action and gunfights, and the title impresses in these areas. Combat is hard, fast and furious, with effective use of bullet time necessary to proceed. The game also employs a cover system, one of the more tiresome elements of modern action gaming, but the use of bullet time and headshots makes it mostly an optional feature with only a few moments where its use is necessary to proceed. More satisfyingly, the ludicrous modern gaming concept of 'regenerating health' has been thrown out of the window and replaced by Max's more familiar use of painkillers, adding a great deal of tension to the action sequences and requiring the player to plan attacks more intelligently than just charging in, knowing you can hide behind a box to get your health back. Unfortunately, bullet time has been gimped since the second game. There's only one level of bullet time (you don't get additional slowdowns when you shoot more people) and, ridiculously, it doesn't regenerate when you make kills. Given it is fairly slow to regenerate, a fair amount of combat has to take place without the use of the game's central mechanic and main selling-point, which seems strange.The writing is okay, though Dan Houser's script is notably less funny, knowing or introspective than Sam Lake's work on the first two games. But it's reasonable and House deserves some props for moving Max on in his life, continuing his character arc and trajectory from the first two games. The other characters in the game are somewhat less successful, with no memorable equivalent to say Vladimir Lem or Mona Sax, but they do their job well enough. The change of setting is far more successful, with So Paulo (or, rather, the criminal underworld that is the main setting) presented as a dark, threatening city which is a perfect match for the semi-noir stylings of the series. This is backed up by the soundtrack (by American band Health), which is excellent.So the game is well-made, with amazing production values, a decent story, some good characterisation and great action (if not quite as well-executed as the first two games). But there is a major problem. You see, the game doesn't actually like you playing it very much. For every minute you spend actually playing the game, it demands that you spend at least another watching it play itself, through intrusive use of lengthy, unskippable (as they hide loading sequences) and non-interactive cut scenes. Cut scenes are not just present at the start and end of each level with maybe a few reserved for major moments mid-level (the sort of structure the first two games employed), but they take place near-continuously. Frequently, opening a door will trigger a cut scene showing Max going through the door and taking cover before letting you resume control. This even happens if you've already flown through the door in shootdodge mode, resulting in frustrating (and continuity-breaking) moments where you could have wiped out a dozen bad guys in five seconds in bullet time but the game demands that you hide behind a counter instead and fire from cover. Cut scenes often kick in after you've dispatched the last bad guy in an area, taking you to a new area with no opportunity to loot the enemies for ammo (which is in fairly short supply throughout most of the game). There are also too many moments when the game has Max doing some really cool things (like diving between moving trains or jumping from an exploding rooftop onto a helicopter) when you don't have control.Max Payne 3 is, of course, a linear action game and railroading is to be expected. Certainly the first two games had a lot of cut scenes and moments where player choice was taken away, but generally it was in areas where it made sense. They were also infrequent compared to the amount of time the player had control. Max Payne 3 actually seems to resent you doing anything other than what it wants you to, and punishes you if you try. During a shoot-out near a plane taking off, any attempt to jump onto the plane will result in a cut scene where a bad guy kills Max with a grenade, with Max standing there and unable to do anything. During a battle on a river dock, falling in the water will result in Max's instantaneous death, despite him being able to swim in a cut scene a minute later. Despite Max's ability to slow down time in gameplay, in a cut scene he runs into a room where a friend is being held hostage and is powerless to stop them being executed, despite the fact that if you had control you could wipe out everyone there in moments. The game also employs a checkpoint system rather than allowing quicksaves, resulting in the player sometimes having to repeat 10-15-minute long sequences if they are killed, which is simply unacceptable.When it actually lets you play it, Max Payne 3 (***) features some intense and engrossing action sequences. However, the game makes the classic mistake of placing itself and its story (which is decent but nothing special) ahead of the enjoyment of the player. As a visual experience, Max Payne 3 is impressive and intermittently even brilliant, but as a game it's a frustrating let-down compared to the first two titles in the series.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2012"}

That absolutely has shown so brilliantly with the status of the Nintendo Wii, and the sales to prove it. But what has also shown well, was the launch of Wii Sports that came with the Wii, as a fantastic launch title, but also as a strong influence for the way we now play video games through the feats of Nintendo. With the gamplay of bowling, golf, baseball, boxing, and tennis, Wii Sports delivered it all. While it was a sampling game, there is a new Wii Sports game that is sure to even bring more excitement to your everyday needs.Wii Sports Resort for the Nintendo Wii, brings in a dozen new games and the way we play them as a whole to a new generation of gamers. That goes well as you master your way through 12 exciting challenges from firing arrows and scoring bulls-eyes with archery, to shooting hoops right on the basketball court, to exciting dueling swordplay that is sure to knock your socks off. There are a few returning games from Wii Sports & Wii play that also are adding to the challenge including a updated golf course, table tennis action that is sure to please you better than it did in Wii Play, and a new bowling alley that includes newer challenges and gameplay. The graphics look great, but it is the gameplay that comes with it that takes a bit to get used to, from the new Wii MotionPlus connector that comes with the game. It is easy to connect to the bottom of your Wii-mote, and definitely adds on to your gameplay. But be very careful not to overjerk, because you could easily miss your shots if your not too cautious. But with time, you'll be able to get used to the addictive gameplay. Sadly though, I was honestly expecting more additions to the game. Nevertheless, it absolutely is fun & entertaining to play whether you are by your self while having some personal time to yourself, or with your friends and family at home.All in all, Wii Sports Resort is definitely a must have if you're a hard core fan of what Wii Sports had brought to the plate when the Wii was launched a few years ago. I thought the challenges brought in more fun than I had expected, and it really is a great game. With families staying at home more than ever, they'll want much more to be entertained with their video games, and Wii Sports Resort handles the trick well, as a must have to your video game library.Graphics: B+Sound: B+Control: BFun & Enjoyment: BOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2009"}

As a matter of fact, that might be my biggest complaint about the second sequel.  Except for improved graphics, there really wasn't much of a change between parts two and three.  Sure, the trading and espionage system was altered, the wonders changed a little and diplomacy was improved, but if you played Civ 2 as much as I did, you should have no problem diving right into Civ 3.  I might have used the in-game Civilopedia for a grand total of fifteen minutes, otherwise it was as if I hadn't even left Civ 2.  I still had some classic Civ fun but it didn't last long.  I spent more time with strategy games that were nowhere near as good as Civ 3 only because they offered something fresh. Now, if you've never had the pleasure to play a Civilization game, quickly pick the latest edition up because it might be the most addictive strategy game ever.  Even to this day, I occasionally find myself reinstalling the game and spending an entire Saturday conquering the world.  If you're a Civ fanatic or Civ rookie, I'm sure you'll enjoy the newest addition but for the rest of the PC gaming community, you might want to wait until Civ 3 and all its expansions are packaged together into an economy deluxe edition only so you'll get a chance to play more new content in the sequel.  One warning for all gamers: On giant maps with the max amount of civilizations, this game can go slow, ESPECIALLY in later years when the continent is saturated with cities.  Civ 3 boasts the best AI of the entire series but I'm not sure a smarter computer opponent was worth the grueling decision making time for the CPU.  The game still captures the classic Civ magic we all love but I've played the first two games so often I'd rather see a remake of Alpha Centauri or Colonization which have yet to see a sequel.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2004"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Good in some ways, problematic in others","reviewText":"There is so much to like about Castlevania-Lords of Shadow.  It's a game that sold me from the start on its trailer, especially the musical score that accompanied it (as in my opinion that can make or break a good trailer).  It started out fun, got a little tedious and confusing after a couple chapters in, nearly elicited an angry old fashioned beat down in one particular boss (Lord of the Lycans, I'm looking at you) and subsequently picked back up right after I bought a new controller after the aforementioned Lycan frustrated beatdown.  In short, Lords of Shadow is a totally immersing, at times confusing, but mostly epic action/adventure title that has much to offer fans of the genre and those who didn't jump on the Castlevania boat before (I'm looking at myself for this one).First off, the graphics in this game are quite impressive.  They're not as polished as, say, God of War 3's or a soft looking as, say, Lost Planet 2's (both of which were some of my favorite games from 2010); but they're good nonetheless.  Like some reviewers have pointed out, I was slightly caught off guard from the look of the opening cut scene since some elements were rendered beautifully while others (notably hair, facial animations) were slightly less than spectacular.  But the forest level that followed shortly thereafter truly put any doubts in my mind to a rest.  Overall, it's one of the best looking games around and presents some of the most varied levels (in terms of scenery) that I've seen in a game (much more so, in my opinion, than God of War 3).The voice acting is topnotch and it's easy to tell how far above a slew of its competitors because it was done with a professional cast.  Gabriel is convincing, powerful, but also timid in a sense, a lover whose loss of his wife has haunted him since the moment it happened.  Patrick Stewart is the most instantly recognizable voice as Gabriel's companion and fellow Brotherhood member, but the highlighted performance -in my opinion- was Claudia and Marie.  This is probably the biggest aspect of Lords of Shadow that sets it apart from most other titles in the action/adventure genre; hands down, it rocks it here.The sound of Lords of Shadow is immense.  It has a lovely score and accompanying soundtrack that really draws the emotional side of the game out, especially since *spoiled alert* the ending ends how it does.  It's eerie, creepy, foreboding, dark, epic, orchestral...all of these things.  Sometimes a score helps a good game become better and that's what Castlevania-Lords of Shadow's does.  One word: epic.Unfortunately, game play was where I found this title to be most lacking.  First off, I noticed how \"harsh\" Gabriel moves (hell, even the way he walks and sprints is awkward and at times downright humorous, like a baby with a full diaper), especially in the midst of button-mashing galore when you're battling enemy.  Unlike, say, God of War's fluid motion and perfectly executed take-downs (that possess an almost graceful arc), Lords of Shadow's feel clunky and outdated, like the developers failed to fine-tune them before release.  I also found occasional aspects that annoyed me more than anything else, like not being able to tell precisely where I'd grapple next while platforming because the grab-on piece blended too perfectly in with the environment at times (and unlike Uncharted you don't get a camera position to orientate you eventually).  In one particular boss fight (Cornell, Lord of the Lycans), I also found this to ring true to critic reviews that this was the hardest boss of the game; I mean, seriously, I died so many times trying to take this bastard down right as I was about to that I can't even tell you how long it took me to get past it - and then, part 2-3, I breezed through this in under 10 minutes.  My recommendation: USE WEAPON UPGRADES.  This, too, proved annoying since I wasn't made aware of the upgrade option since it's not completely clear.Overall, Castlevania-Lords of Shadow is all one could hope for in an action/adventure title.  It plays on the longer end (15+ hours...not many games can achieve that nowadays) and it's immersing and epic.  That being said, it isn't perfect, but it's almost there and is a must have for fans of the genre and newcomers to the Castlevania series alike.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2011"}

Definite 'Game of the Year' contender!","reviewText":"This game is a 1st person shooter with multiple upgrades to weapons, skills and abilities (reminiscent of 'Deus ex' & 'System Shock').With the right hardware, this is an amazing game; without it, I can imagine the frustration some people are feeling.  For me, the game ran without a hitch on 'Vista' with a Dual Core processor, 2 GBs of RAM and a 8800 nVidia video card.There were many positives about the game (and a couple negatives as well)...for instance1.)Wonderful graphics, audio and game play; probably the best I've ever seen. The game is able to take advantage of the new Dx10 (as an option) if you have a system that runs 'Vista'.2.)There is a map; indicating where you are and sometimes showing where your present goal is located.3.)Three levels of difficulty that are changeable at ANYTIME (very useful if your taking a continual beating); The degrees of difficulty could be described as...easy (very much so), medium (a definite challenge) and hard (brutal) It was difficult to stay alive on 'hard'.4.)Movement and firing are handled with the mouse, while weapon/ammo changes are done effectively with the keyboard (this is a useful blend of controls  when the action gets hectic).5.)Anytime, anywhere saves and loads with F8 and F9 respectively.6.)A helpful guidance arrow to help you travel at certain times.(travel can be confusing at times) [see Cons: 3.) below]7.)An emotional storyline and plot; the little girls will tug at your heartstrings.8.)Some degree of replayability...you could try a 'different' attitude in your handling of the little girls and also you could focus on different weapons and 'skills'.9.)Non-linear game play; although you have to complete specific goals on each level, you are able to move about unrestricted and explore anywhere.The Cons:1.)The game must be activated via an internet link; I'm not sure if this means you can sell your game or not after your through with it.2.)Very high end hardware is needed to get this game to run smoothly.3.)I found the mapping system a little confusing, at times, e.g. when I changed rooms or went up or down stairs. (really a minor complaint, but you'll understand what I mean once you start playing)Conclusion:This game will (IMO) be very high in the running for single player 'Game of the Year' honors* as it ushers in a new era of improved standards in the field of computer gaming. You will need a powerful system to appreciate this game (and others soon to come) in the way the developers had intended. Simply a joy to play. 5 Stars.* other nominees of single player 'Game of the Year' might be 'Call of Duty 4' and Half Life 2 episode 2, with 'Timeshift' and 'STALKER-Chernobyl' close behind. Crysis would be a more distant runner up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0087OZ5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"E. Luna \"FPS Connoisseur\"","summary":"Excellent Headset","reviewText":"I've only ever bought two headsets for my PS3, and both were the official ones. The previous headset was a superbly designed piece of hardware that really elevated my gaming experience. I was very pleased with it. I really had no intention on upgrading my headset, since I was so pleased with it. But, as I read up more and more on this headset, I decided it would be worth the upgrade. Add this to the fact that I had a friend who was pretty adamant on buying my old headset, and well things just aligned. I got this headset on Tuesday, October 2nd. I've put it through quite a few tests in terms of varied content. I've played Heavy Rain, Gran Turismo 5, and seen more than my fair share of movies with this headset. I also decided to try them out with my phone to listen to my music. Every single time, I was very impressed with the quality of the sound. Make no mistake, these cans are not a gimmick or a money grab by Sony. They are very well built, and offer great sound at a reasonable price. As of this moment, I really have no complaints about this headset, and I found it quite easy to operate regardless of the fact that there are quite a few settings to mess around with.I'm still not too sure about the Bassimpact feature, though. When I first used it I thought it was overbearing and a little bothersome. This may have just been me getting used to it. Since then, (at the right levels) the bassimpact has actually added a completely new experience to my movie and gaming experiences. Playing GT 5 with Bassimpact on gave me a good idea as to where the opponent AI was in relation to my position on the track. I have yet to play a shooter with this headset on, but I will do so soon. I can only imagine that their performance will be just as good, if not better, than my previous headset.All in all, I am very impressed with this headset. It's also very attractively built. I wouldn't mind taking these out and using them on my day to day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2012"}

Mullins","summary":"a wasted idea","reviewText":"I waited for months to play this game, I played to demo to death and picked it up as soon as it came out on the 8th.  And was severely disappointed. This game had so much possibility but its execution was terrible. Originally you were to be given three days in a zombie filled mall to play as you please, take missions if you want, save people or let them die, etc. You could just sit on the roof and wait for the helicopter to come get you three days later. I wish ever so much that they would have left it like that. Instead they replaced a three day stay in a zombie filled mall, with unlimited potential, with a linear and annoying story. But even that could have been salvage, what ruined the game for me were the insane time limits. Instead of getting your necrocide on in the middle of the mall with any weapon imaginable, you are running from one idiotic boss battle to the next and watching the clock the entire time. Because if you miss completing a mission in the required time limit its game over. Add to that the ridicules save system that only allows you to save one game and what could have been the greatest zombie escapade ever became an annoying and repetitive kill joy. This game does have some really neat qualities to be sure. Almost anything can be used as a weapon, which is great because they last all of ten seconds or so. So when you are in the middle of a hundred zombies (also very impressive) you end up going through every weapon you can carry in your limited inventory. Of course you have to carry you health regenerators in the same inventory. So one second you are swinging a lead pipe into a zombie head and the next you are sipping some OJ as the horde closes in and devours you. I bought this game in the hopes of a Grand Theft Auto style mall adventure with zombies and ended up with a very difficult, unfun and annoying waste of sixty dollars. I should have just bought the Dawn of the Dead DVD and spend the rest on beer instead of wasting my hard earned money on this miserable buzz kill.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2006"}

However, playing this game make me very frustrated; it might be only me but the gameplay sucks. Character movement is sluggish and slow. The chartecter runs like a lady in high heels shoe. I know they were trying to make it realistic due to weight of armor he has on, but I think crysis 2 & 3 did a better job.Gun fights are just super frustrating especially at the end of the game, which you need to break the enemies&#8217; armor before killing them. Switching from gun mod to armor destroyer takes 2 seconds, and in the middle of a fight that you die with 5-6 bullets. Another thing is for some reason, every time I clear an area and about to kill the last guy, there is always one enemy behind me and kills me with melee ( it&#8217;s just my bad luck I think ).As I said the game play is not like KZ 2 & 3. I loved KZ 2 and loved KZ3 for multiplayer. But this one is just a golden garbage! Golden because it&#8217;s just beautiful and it has the best graphic I have ever seen. Garbage because it has the most frustrating gameplay that I have ever seen in my 20 years of gaming. I even broke my headphones due to this game; I throw it so hard to the wall&#8230; I don&#8217;t get angry at games, but this one is just crazy! You get killed over & over & over & &#8230;. Due to glitches and bad gameplay. Enemies can shoot you even if one pixel of your body is out of cover; AIs are accurate but dumb at the same time. They charge you when they shouldn&#8217;t, and they just stand there when you are charging them.Most of the time, I did&#8217;t know where the hell I&#8217;m supposed to go or even what to do. You need to press the up button like 100 times in every chapter to show you the point that you need to go. How you get there is the mystery that you need to figure out.The beginning of the game didn&#8217;t catch my attention at all. You start as a little kid, and just run around for almost 5-6 minutes; that&#8217;s how the game starts. No intense action or anything. At some point I just wanted to turn my PS4 off and never play the game.Story: I really didn&#8217;t get it. But ending was surprising.Graphic: I give it 10/10Sound & music: 10/10Controls: 4/10Gameplay: 5/10Over all, this game needs lots of time & patience. It&#8217;s a hard game, even when I played it on Normal difficulty. You can&#8217;t rush through the game at all. It&#8217;s not like KZ 2 & 3. I had more fun even with Killzone Mercenary on small ps-vita screen. Makers of this game focused so much on the graphics, they totally forgot about the fun factor and gameplay. ( watch Angry joe show on Utube, he explains everything for you about this game)Multiplayer: I spent almost 4 hours on it. So far I like it.

The addictiveness of the game is so intense that it will hook pretty much anybody, perhaps even those that haven't been interested in puzzle games before. But there are so many versions of Tetris, and on every single system, too. Which one should you get? Tetris DS is the answer.Good GOD there's so much to do in Tetris DS! Let's cut to the chase on what the game has to offer:First, we have the Standard mode. Even this thing comes with multiple variations, including a Marathon. What is totally awesome about Marathon mode is that while you're playing Tetris, there's gameplay footage of an old NES game atop. If it's Super Mario Bros, or SMB3, the said games' camera scrolls whenever you clear lines! Awesome!!!Then, there's a Touch mode, making use of the DS stylus. There are bunches of blocks piled as a tower. What you gotta do is rotate and move the blocks to clear lines. The result is a great new spin on an old formula.The game's Zelda-themed Mission mode gives players specific things to do as they play. For example, you may have to clear lines with a certain block, or maybe you have to clear lines at a certain height. Does it harm the formula? Nope. Once again, it's enhanced!A Catch mode in a Tetris game? Well, it actually turned out to be just fine! You guide a block, and you must catch other falling blocks. In order for you to shrink in size, you must form a cube out of the stray blocks and yourself. How the heck do they pull this stuff of so flawlessly?There's also a Push mode. It's a battle against the CPU, and you must clear lines to push the CPU to its doom!Think it's all covered yet? Nope. We still have one more game mode here, and it is perhaps the most faithful to another puzzle game that the mode's theme is based off of: Yoshi's Cookie. Already a great puzzler, have it fused with Tetris, and it results to you manually having to choose which blocks you can use to clear all of the lines. It is all based on logic, so you have to plan it all carefully.All of these game modes are extremely fun, and they are all as majorly awesome as the original Tetris game. But considering there's a lot of playtime to go with each of these game modes, this game will stay in your DS for a loooong time.FURTHERMORE, there's an ONLINE MODE! Yeah! You can actually play against other people across the globe! Whether it's facing against a lone other player normally, or facing against 3 others by using items Mario Kart-style, this alone would be the reason why to buy this DS cartridge! This is definitely the best DS puzzler, as well as perhaps one of the best puzzle games PERIOD. It's NES theme only makes it all the more better.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Posey","summary":"Infamous 2 - First Impressions","reviewText":"The first Infamous game was one that I hold very near and dear. I spent countless hours just scouring the city for any collectible I could find and loved every minute of it. So, it was a no brainer when the time came to pick up Infamous 2. I had been waiting quite a while for the release and I couldn't have been more excited. The following are some initial impressions I have of the game after putting in a solid 8 hours or so across a few days. If you're interested in the game or just want to see how it's being received by people, read on.The first thing I noticed about the game was the fact that it felt a lot like the first (which is a good thing).  Depending on how much of the first game you completed, your trophy data will unlock different features in the sequel.  The game begins shortly after the first game and the Beast has come to wreak havoc on the world.  It is your destiny as Cole to end this creatures existence, but in your first attempt you fail.  Badly beaten by the Beast, you flee with your entourage to New Marais, a city that closely resembles New Orleans.  It is here that your special agent contact has told you meet with a scientist who can increase your powers, making you able to confront the Beast and actually have a chance to defeat him.  Over the course of the game, you will meet new characters and join forces with either the evil or good side of the spectrum and work towards your ultimate goal of defeating the Beast.The story really does a nice job of giving you a goal to complete in the game.  You always know that the Beast is hot on your trail because the map of the US in the pause menu specifically tells you where he is and how far from New Marais he currently is.  But time is a strange beast in New Marais.  Don't feel like you have to do everything at once.  Hell, for the first couple hours of the game I collected blast shards to upgrade my character.  Just as addictive as it was in the first game, collecting blast shards and upgrading your powers almost becomes a sort of meta-game in and of itself.  You'll have to fight your \"just one more\" instincts to pry yourself from the tv to go to bed at night.  I don't know what crack feels like, but I'm sure it's similar to the feelings I get while searching for these shards.Since Infamous 2 is a sequel and the first Infamous was an origin story for Cole as a superhero, they had to get around the power aspect.  Cole was a wimp in the beginning of Infamous 1 but by the end, he was pretty badass.  They had two options to go with the second.  Either do a God of War and strip him of his powers or make him crazy powerful in the sequel.  Thankfully, they went with the latter.  You begin the game with most of the powers from the first game.  Over the course of the game you will continue to unlock more and more powers almost making Cole a super super hero with some of his abilities.  It's an awesome feeling to truly feel crazy powerful in a game and then watch as you just become more and more powerful over the course of the game.The story was always a major selling point for me in Infamous 1.  Origin stories are always fun and give you a sense of wonder as you learn about how the characters grow and evolve into the hero (or villain) they are to become.  In the sequel, Cole gets some friends to help him along the way.  There's both a good character and a sudo evil character for both sides of the spectrum.  This adds a lot of depth to the story and I found myself caring for them a lot more than Cole's actual story.  You get a feeling of relief when they show up on the field of battle to help you, just like I assume a superhero would when his side kick enters the fray.  The story never really gets dry (up to the point I played) and you are always pushing forward to see what will happen next.  The tyrant of the town, an old man named Bertrand who controls a militia, is a fitting enemy who seems to have a lot of secrets around his motives.  I'm looking forward to playing more to find out where the story goes.The major draw of the game is most definitely the gameplay though.  Being able to climb walls, shoot electricity from your fingertips, and stalk enemies from the rooftops never looses it's appeal and you'll have plenty of time to mix things up.  The way to complete a mission is never set in stone and you are left with a variety of ways to go about your mission.  If you are going good, you need to always worry about pedestrians getting hurt in the line of fire while evil characters would revel in such an act.  The choice is yours and you truly do feel powerful after making it.If you played the first and enjoyed the game, it's a no brainer that you should pick up the second.  If you were on the fence about the first though, you might not find anything new here to change your mind.  People new to the series should pick up the first game first though since the second assumes that you have played it.  There's some recap, but in all honesty, you'd be missing a lot.  Infamous 2 is one of the best games of the year so far and you owe it to yourself to pick it up if you enjoy these types of games.  I hope this first impression has helped clear up any questions you may have and if there are any others, post in the comments section below.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004NRN5EO","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"challenging hack-and-slash gameplay","reviewText":"The spiritual sequel to the cult hit \"Demon's Souls\", \"Dark Souls\" combines the challenging hack-and-slash gameplay of its predecessor with a more open world and greater difficulty.\"Dark Souls\" is a third-person action-RPG set in a grim fantasy world. Those who have played its predecessor, \"Demon's Souls\", will find that almost all of the basic mechanics are the same. As a refresher for those who haven't, Dark Souls' gameplay involves defeating enemies by dodging their attacks with blocking and rolling, then countering with sword slashes, bow shots, or magic spells. Unlike most RPGs, Dark Souls is an action game first and foremost - closer to games like the Legend of Zelda than most other RPGs. Defeating enemies provides the player with Souls, a currency used to upgrade the player-character's abilities or purchase items. The game's main defining trait is its difficulty; death comes quickly, and dying takes all of your currently-held souls (i.e. those not spent on upgrades or items). The game's tagline is \"Prepare to Die\", and if a player goes into the game expecting a cakewalk they are in for a rude surprise.The main difference between Demon's Souls and Dark Souls is the nature of the world. In Demon's Souls, the player began in a Nexus that allowed them to teleport to different worlds to defeat bosses. In Dark Souls, the whole world is one big connected map in a manner akin to games like Metroid or Castlevania. Therefore, exploration is far more important, whether it's to find the next area or to find shortcuts back to previous ones. The world of Dark Souls is littered with \"bonfires\", safe areas that restore health and allow you to manage your experience, inventory, magic, and so on. These bonfires are also the only way to fill your \"Estus flasks\", one of the only means of healing available in the game, so conserving resources is more important than in Demon's Souls. This adds to the difficulty mostly because using a bonfire respawns all enemies in the world, so it's possible to run out of healing supplies before you've reached a boss and be forced to go all the way back and try again. The amount of Estus a bonfire provides can be increased by feeding it \"humanity\", a resource that can be acquired by defeating enemies or helping other players in co-op play, but there's an upper limit to how much Estus can be carried.While exploration and a certain amount of freedom does exist in the game, there's also some things that must be done in a linear fashion (or at least mostly linear). Bosses, for example, will often block hallways that cannot be passed until the boss is defeated. This can be frustrating if you're having trouble with the first few bosses, but after about the first hour of play the world opens up a bit more and allows you to always have somewhere else to explore to improve your character and your weaponry. In some ways it's more linear than Demon's Souls, because you HAVE to defeat certain bosses to progress (whereas in Demon's Souls it was possible to skip entire worlds as long as you got the bare minimum necessary to face the final boss), but in other ways it's more open by allowing you to explore areas that you never even NEED to go.The game's combat is similar to Demon's Souls, but a bit more developed. The enemies are definitely tougher and more aggressive, even at the beginning of the game. Two new additions to the player's melee arsenal are the ability to kick (useful for knocking an enemy back) and do a jumping slash (useful for covering ground more quickly). In general, though, it's the same basic concepts of dodge, block, attack. The bosses are a bit less diverse than Demon's Souls' bosses, and more frustrating as well. One particular frustration is the fact that both the character's weapons and most enemy weapons will bounce back if they hit walls, meaning that slashing in a narrow corridor is a bad idea and stabbing weapons will have an advantage. However, certain bosses (and one boss in particular) don't play by those rules, meaning that fights against those bosses are mostly a guessing game as to whether a particular hit is going to connect or not. On the other hand, there are some boss fights that are so well-done and exciting that they make up for the bad ones. One boss fight killed me three or four times, but was so enjoyable to fight that I didn't mind having to go all the way back to it. The game's difficulty means that overcoming a fair boss can be exhilarating, but having to put up with a poorly-designed boss can simply be frustrating.The multiplayer aspect of the game is similar to previous games, and comes in both cooperative and competitive modes. The cooperative mode is achieved by summoning players (or being summoned), allowing multiple characters to fight through one player's campaign. The competitive element is the option of invading another player's world. Players can only summon other players, or be invaded by other players, while in \"human\" form (and being able to summon or be invaded is the only benefit of being in human form), so if you don't want to be invaded it's perfectly possible to just never turn human. Complicating the multiplayer relationship is the \"Covenant\" system. Covenants can be joined by finding certain NPCs in the game world, and each covenant has different objectives. One covenant randomly invades those who are marked as criminals in the game's system (i.e. those who invade other players or break their own covenants). Another covenant exists to invade the worlds of players who enter a specific forest in the game world. The \"basic\" covenant, the Way of White, makes it easier to find friendly players and harder to be invaded.The game's graphics and designs are as impressive as Demon's Souls' were. The designs are grounded but still fantastic, and the scale of the game is amazing. The whole world is interconnected, and it's easy to see this wherever you are. From the highest towers, you can see all the way to the lowest ravines, and the areas are huge to begin with. In many cases it's easy to figure out where you should go next just by looking around in the game world. Like in Demon's Souls, the game's music is limited to boss fights, making the \"exploring the world\" part of the game more quiet and dramatic and the \"combat\" parts more intense.Overall, Dark Souls is a worthy successor to Demon's Souls, and any fan of Demon's Souls should check it out. The main things that might limit its appeal is its difficulty; while most players view it as being \"hard but fair\", it's easy to imagine the average player becoming frustrated at their repeated deaths and having to play through sections over again. If you're not up for a challenge, Dark Souls is more annoying than it's worth, but if you ARE, it's a fantastic game that can be well worth the effort it requires. 9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

Mass Effect 3  though good with less development time than the previous games you can tell it was rushed. Some things that after playing that told me the game was rushed.1.Scripted dialogue: Where in the previous mass effect games you talked to someone and the dialog wheel would come up so you could have a conversation, most of the ones in ME3 were pre scripted, you couldn't choose a response.2:Lack of exploration: You had the Normandy and Citadel to explore and that was about it.3:Most of the choices from the previous games were given little more than lip service or really didn't live up to the promises Bioware made.The Rachni were a good example if you killed the queen in ME1 they were still there in ME3, if you let the queen live and by conversation in ME2 thought they would be a big part in helping you in ME3, they did nothing, it was pretty disappointing.4.Getting war assests was nothing more than going to a system and scanning and seeing a little thing pop up you gained them,and never seen them in action at the end.5.Getting missions to get the aformentioned war assests were mainly you eavesdropping on a conversation some random NPC was having, which was pretty lame.6.If you kept your Ashley or Liara romance Bioware promised something big, they might have had something planned, but it was pretty much the same as the last two games, nothing special.7.The ending, I believe the stories that the two lead writers came up with it at the last minute with no input from anyone else on the writing team, you can tell.Some other disappointing things in the game were the crew choices, you had none of the new crew from ME2 even after doing all those loyalty missions, and if your romanced someone in ME2 it came to nothing in ME3 since they couldn't join you on the Normandy.Why did most of the game have you fighting Cerberus? I thought the Reapers were the main threat, they really should have broke it up to Mass Effect 3 and 4, have you fight Cerberus in ME3 and unite the galaxy for the incoming Reaper threat, with an indoctrinated Illusive man unwitting helping the Reapers by fighting Shepards attempts. And a Mass Effect 4 that had the Reapers big attack.There were some great aspects of the game though, the Genophage and Quarian parts were well written and great, and other aspects of the game with the crew were also fun.In Summary Mass Effect 3 is a good game, just not what it could have been, and is the weakest part of the series, it was like Return of the Jedi or The Dark Knight Rises, Both were not as great as Empire or The Dark Knight and ME3 was a step down from ME2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2014"}

All of the games work just as well as the originals and I feel they work best on the PS2 controller over the other consoles. All of the games are untouched letting the experience be as it was when they came out. It even has the PSOne version of X3 with better quality music, which is a big bonus since X3 is incredibly rare and expensive alone.This has every game in the series up to X6, the quality of the games are mostly high though that's mostly up to personal taste. I honestly didn't care for X3 or X6 but the rest of the games are top-notch platforming with some of the best soundtracks in the genre.There are some forgettable extras, a few bits of concept art, music, nothing you can't find online. Honestly the reason to get this is strictly the games which are 100% worth it.The one big gripe I have with this collection is if you play it on PS2 through an component, it will NOT work, the games will not display though the menus will. I'm not sure why this is since I've played Sonic Mega Collection on the same set up and I've had no problems.The collection does work on compatible PS3's via HDMI there's very slight controller delay which can be hard to take in a 2D platformer. However this can vary as I understand between monitors & set ups.However with that problem it's still a solid collection as a lot of these games are hard to get and they are emulated really really well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2009"}

The control stick on the Nunchuk controls player movement (on stages that allow player movement), while aiming the Wii Zapper moves the targeting reticule on the screen. The Zapper comes withLink's Crossbow Training, which helps to familiarize the player with the Zapper in a shooting gallery style game.Link's Crossbow Trainingcontains three game styles: target shooting, defender and ranger.Features:Target Shooting: In target-shooting rounds, players shoot bull's-eyes as they pop up on the screen. In early stages, targets are stationary. As the game difficulty increases in later levels, the targets move. Hitting the center of the bull's-eye nets more points, and hitting targets in succession without missing earns combo multipliers. Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately","reviewerName":"Kevin FitzPatrick \"eeble\"","summary":"Fun, Useful, and Inexpensive Package","reviewText":"Sure, Link's training could have been a deeper experience, but for 20$ the game with Zapper is a fantastic value.Link's Crossbow Training is a shooter with different level types. Some feature Link in a fixed position, others actually require you to move around. The game is good, but shallow - you can clear it in about an hour. The biggest negative thing I would say is that there is no co-operative 2 player mode. The great Twilight Princess locations are the basis of the levels and it will really make you want to go back and playLegend of Zelda: Twilight Princess.The Zapper itself is comfortable to use and despite some older Wii games that cannot function well with it (Call Of Duty 3among others do not work with the Zapper), others likeElebitsbecome much easier to control. Also some of the new shooter games likeResident Evil: The Umbrella ChroniclesandGhost Squadhave special Zapper settings.Sure, ultimately you are buying a piece of plastic to shove the controller into, but I would certainly prefer to use the Zapper with any compatible game.

Having played tons of games over the past years, I can say that B2 ranks very high on my list of all-time favorites. I can only think of a handful of games that keeps me wanting to play all day long and keeps me thinking about playing even after shutting it off.This game is by no means perfect, and does not introduce anything revolutionary, but refines just about every aspect of B1 and makes them better.Positives+ Very polished graphics and improved level design. The levels are huge and do not reload midstream which is a technical achievement in itself. Maps are varied for the most part.+ Voice work is fantastic. The writing is absolutely hilarious.+ Controls are spot-on as before in B1. No big surprises here.+ Weapons look super cool even if they don't always perform as well as you like. Every gun does have a unique look and feel, although the performance specs can sometimes be very similar to other guns you have already seen.+ Skill tree seems more varied than B1. The \"Badass\" point system encourages you to tackle tons of challenges to earn additional bonuses if you choose to do so. This is a nice add-on.+ Enemy AI is very impressive. They dive for cover, dodge, bob and weave, and even dive for cover to avoid your gunfire. Variety of enemy types if also impressive.Negatives- Driving mechanics still a bit touchy. Not a big deal since you can do fast-travel once it's unlocked.- Re-tracing of maps for some missions can get tedious because some of the maps are absolutely huge, and you at times end up fighting the same enemies you have already killed before. Also, fast-travel doesn't always take you where you want to go.-/+ This is not necessarily a negative, but 95% of the guns you get are poor, but I know this is by design so that when you DO finally find that one awesome gun, you actually appreciate it!Overall, having played B1 for a number of hours, I thought I knew what to expect from B2, but the improvements all met or exceeded my high expectations.

It's a shame because he was my favorite actor in the original movies, and to be honest they could have had anyone play him in the game and I wouldn't have noticed.I think that people gave this game such good reviews because they were so excited by the idea of the game that they were able to overlook the boring monotony of actually playing it.In summation: the brevity of this game combined with the repetitive gameplay, eliminates replay value, so I'd have to recommend renting this one....sorry","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2009"}

This game explains the reason why and the reason why he looks like a depressing vampire.  Cause before this happened, he looked howt!  Not hot, but howt!  Though my fav character off of FFVII is Sephiroth but Vincent is awesome too!  I'm highly horrible at shoot - up games, but this is for me is in between easy and not so easy...expecially when you go against the boss battles, yeesh!  But anywho, the game itself is highly good but the grafics are like playing Devil May Cry 3 or FFX.  Not saying the grafics are bas but...uh...needs a bit of some work.  Other than that it's awesome!  If you're the type of person that sort of sucks at shooting games but somehow gets past the hard boss battles, then rent it first and see how you like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2010"}

Wertz \"Imautobot\"","summary":"How to make your Character a GOD, and quick level some skills.","reviewText":"(If this seems too complicated, you can find videos of this glitch on YouTube by searching for \"Skyrim Alchemy Glitch\".)Things to collect:For Alchemy, get as many of these items as you can because you'll have to make the same potions several times in a row.  Potions only need 2 items to be made, but the different options make creating these potions easier because some of these ingredients are hard to find.Fortify Restoration potion requires any 2 of the following items;Abecean Longfin, Cryodilic Spadetail, Salt Pile, Small Antlers, Small Pearl.Fortify Enchanting potion requires any 2 of the following items;Blue Butterfly Wing, Hagraven Claw, Snowberries, Spriggan Sap.Fortify Smithing potion requires any 2 of the following items;Blisterwort, Glowing Mushroom, Sabre Cat Tooth, Spriggan Sap.Search Alchemy vendors to get ingredients faster; there is one in every major city.  You can get the fish you need just by swimming up to fish and catching them.Snowberries grow in a lot of places where it's covered in snow, but you'll find them easily just by walking around Dawnstar.Blue Butterfly Wings can be found by harvesting the butterflies in the plains outside of WhiterunFor Disenchanting you need:One enchanted item that \"Fortifies Alchemy\"Anything else that is already Enchanted.  (Ideally you want an item that fortifies health, one that fortifies stamina, and one that fortifies magic.)It is going to be important to Disenchant as many things as you can prior to enchanting your armor and weapons.  While this destroys the weapon or armor you disenchanted, it teaches your character what they need to know to enchant anything.For Enchanting:Armor without enchantment2 Helmets without enchantment2 Gloves, Gauntlets, or Bracers without enchantmentBoots without enchantment2 Rings (any kind) without enchantment2 Necklaces (any kind) without enchantmentAs many filled Soul Gems as you can find (Greater, Grand, or Black Soul Gems are best).  You'll need one for every enchanted item you make.  Many vendors have these gems for sale.Prior to making potions it would be best to activate Perks on the Alchemy, Enchanting, and Smithing perk trees.  High level in these skills isn't necessarily required, and the act of performing this glitch with likely max the levels on these three aspects.However, if you intend to Smith your own Armor to be enchanted, you will want to make sure you've activated enough stars in your Smithing perk tree for the type of armor you want to make.  Also, be aware of what is required to make the armor you want (i.e. type of Ingots, Leather, Leather Strips, etc...)Smithing isn't really necessary, because without further training your character can already smith Iron Armor.  Once you apply enchantments to your armor and weapons they will be so powerful that their type becomes irrelevant.Arcane Enchanter, Alchemy Table, and Smithing equipment are all easy accessible in Windhelm.  If you just arrived in Windhelm, turn left and run as far as you can.  In this market area you'll find a Smith, an Arcane Enchanter in the SW corner, and an Alchemy store called The White Phile which has an Alchemy table inside.Also, if you have bought a home, many large homes will have an Arcane Enchanter and Alchemy Table if you've bought the appropriate decorating package.Save the game NOW!1. Use the Arcane Enchanter to Disenchant all the magical items whose ability you want to apply to different item(s) later.  You MUST disenchant something that \"Fortifies Alchemy\".  It is important that you have learned \"Fortify Magic\", \"Fortify Health\", and \"Fortify Stamina\".  If you have not learned those enchantments, you can still do steps 1-10, but will have to learn those enchantments before finishing the steps.2. Use the Arcane Enchanter to Enchant; 1 Helmet (or other headwear), 1 set of Gloves, Gauntlets, or Bracers, 1 ring, and 1 Necklace with the \"Fortify Alchemy\" Enchantment.3. Now, remove all apparel you're currently wearing, and put on the 4 items you've just enchanted.4. Go to the Alchemy table and mix any 2 of these items (Abecean Longfin, Cryodilic Spadetail, Salt Pile, Small Antlers, Small Pearl) to make 1 \"Fortify Restoration\" potion.5. Back off the Alchemy table, Drink the potion you just made, then go to your apparel menu and remove the 4 enchanted items, then put them back on (don't ask me why).6. Next, repeat steps 4 and 5, 7-10 times.  Every time you do this you should note that the percentage of improvement increases on your 4 pieces of \"Fortify Alchemy\" apparel.  The amount of time you should repeat this step will vary depending on how skilled you were when you originally enchanted those items.  But the goal is to not over do this.  If you see the numbers getting way too big, you may cause the game to crash.  Be careful, if necessary, reload the game from the last save and start over.By now your Fortify Alchemy skill is really high because the repeated use of the \"Fortify Restoration\" potion has multiplied the effectiveness of the Alchemy apparel you're wearing.  Make sure your 4 enchanted items are equipped, and then return to the table.7. Now create as many \"Fortify Enchanting\" potions as you can by mixing any 2 of these items; Blue Butterfly Wing, Hagraven Claw, Snowberries, Spriggan Sap.Don't back out of Alchemy.8. Now create as many \"Fortify Smithing\" potions as you can by mixing any 2 of these items; Blisterwort, Glowing Mushroom, Sabre Cat Tooth, Spriggan Sap.Now you've created all the potions you need to make yourself a God, but if you want to, feel free to take this opportunity to make any other potions you can.  Because your Alchemy is fortified, any potion you create will be worth a lot of Gold.  So much so that no vendor would ever have enough, but if you want to be able to sell one thing and take all their money this is an easy way to do it.NOTE: speechcraft perks allow you to invest 500 gold in every store which will give the vendor 500 more to barter with.  There is also a speechcraft perk that gives vendors an extra 1000 Gold!  If you have those perks, the vendors will have 1750-2500 gold every 24 hours.Skip steps 9 and 10 if you don't intend to build or improve weapons.9. If you are going to smith your own weapons, make sure you have the right amount and type of ingots and leather before attempting.  Go to the forge and create your weapons and armor, do NOT drink the fortify smithing potion before doing that, it will not help you there.10. When your done creating weapons and armor, go to either the grindstone or the workbench.  Drink 1 fortify smithing potion, and improve your weapons and armor.  Keep in mind that improvements require additional ingots and leather.  Also, the potion you drank is only good for 30 seconds, so be careful not to take too long, other wise back out, drink another potion and do it again.  If you've done this right, you should have smithed both your armor and weapons up to a decent level of damage.  (i.e. Iron Dagger = 201 Damage)11. Next, head to the Arcane Enchanter.  Before doing this, you need to understand that only certain items can do certain things.  If you need to know what enchantments can apply to a specific item, go into the enchanter, and start the process by selecting the item you want to enchant.  When you go down to \"enchantment\" many things will be blacked out, meaning they cannot apply to that item, or you haven't learned that enchantment yet.Once you know what enchantments you want to apply to each item, back out of the enchanter, drink one fortify enchanting potion, then QUICKLY enchant 1 item.  Your potion is only good for 30 seconds, that's why you need to know what you're trying to do before you do it!If you pulled that off, your item will either have a serious magic damage attached to it, or your armor will have a wicked rating on it.Drink 1 potion and repeat this process for every item you want to enchant!Enchanting suggestions;Enchant a ring with Fortify StaminaEnchant a Necklace with Fortify HealthEnchant your Gloves, Gauntlets, or Bracers with Fortify MagicEnchant your Boots with Fortify CarryIf you've done at least those 4 things, you most likely will be invincible, have pratically unlimited magic, stamina so good you can RUN all the way across Skyrim, and the carrying capacity to move thousands or millions of lbs!Feel free to enchant your weapons however you see fit.  But keep in mind; this will probably make the weapon so strong it will kill anything with 1 strike!  So it might not be as fun.How to fast level certain skills.Speechcraft.Travel to Riftin and speak to the barkeeper at the Black Briar Meadery.  He will present an option to persuade him to tell more about Maven Black Briar.  Take this option, it will keep presenting itself.  You can basically make him repeat the same thing until you max out your speechcraft.Sneak.Find a location in a city near some people, go into sneak, then set your controller with rubber bands so your characters just sneaks in circles for about an hour.  As long as you are somewhat close to NPC's and in sneak your skill will level without you needing to do much of anything.  FYI, Xbox controller will sleep after 15 minutes, so check on it occasionally.Pickpocket.In Windhelm you'll find a beggar name Silda the Unseen.  She can sell you pickpocket training.  Buy one session, sneak around behind her, and steal the money back for an additional skill increase.  Save every time you do this because sometimes you'll get caught.  She can train you 5 times, and if you steal your money back you'll get another 5 increases.  Then when you go through another character level up you can repeat this process.  Though eventually this option will stop presenting itself.Combat and Destruction MagicIf you join the Dark Brotherhood you will eventually get a horse named Shadowmere.  Shadowmere has health that regenerates very quickly and he will not attack you, so you can attack him repeatedly using One-Handed, Two-Handed, Archer, and Destruction Magic and level up without actually being attacked.ConjurationWhile traveling near the bottom of a steep hill or mountain, if you are attacked by any creature, try to move up the steep incline.  Your character can usually get up higher than your attacker.  Once you're in a location where they can't hit you, cast \"Bound Sword\" repeatedly.  You have to be currently under attack for conjuration to level up, so having someone actively trying to get at you is essential.  Keep a lot or magic potions on you so you don't have to stop.BlockYou can do this in pretty much the same manner as conjuration.  Just block with a sword or shield while being attacked, if your health get's too low, move back up the steep incline on the hill or mountain until you're healed, or use potions.  Then come down again and let them hit you some more.  Doing this with a low level enemy like a wolf would be best.Free goodies can be found in a secret chest in Dawnstar.  Fast travel to Dawnstar, if you haven't discovered it yet, you can pay a carriage operator to take you there.  There are two mines in this town.  Find Iron Breaker Mine.  Do not enter it.  Just to the left of the entrance there are 3 rocks.  Place your reticle in that location and eventually you see an option to \"Search Chest\" even though there isn't anything visible in that spot.  The chest is teeming with goodies, empty it.  It is supposed to refresh every 2-10 game days, so check it out whenever you're in the area.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2012"}

Unlike Diablo2 the world feels large and lively that only 3D graphics could produce.This is all tied with some nice music, some of it interesting to hear but it is the usual epic fantasy themes.I could forgive the lack of a story. Let's be real, we are going to end up killing monsters whatever the reason is. I am not really interested in talking to NPCs for clever dialog or spending time reading volumes on a world that doesn't really exist. All I need to know is A)Where are the monsters and B)how to kill the monsters. DS let's you do just that.Something also has to be said for the lack of a story, you are free to make up your own. There is no rule that game developers had to fill your imagination for you.My one real complaint is the skill system. If I am going to kill a lot of things for hours, I want some really cool skills. I love how it works, just that there is so little to work with. The 4 skill catagories could further broken up in to more diverse skill trees and still be as easy to use.All that said, this is an entertaining game for the uninspired.

Rockstar does it again the same way they did it with GTAIV 2 years ago.Take just about everything you love about GTAIV and set it in the Old West, early 20th century.  Then take a classic revenge story and place it into this setting and off you go!To be quite honest, I was expecting this to be like the last Western game Call of Juarez II that came out last year and this game by miles blows CoJII out of the water.  Just like GTA you have many missions and side mission you can go on, The shooting mechanics are actually a bit more forgiving than in GTAIV and one thing I have noted early on is that you have to plan a little more when attacking a large group of enemies especially since in these times you don't have RPGs, grenades and hi tech sniper guns...I mean it's the turn of the 20th century after all what did you expect???Sometimes, you can just find a spot and sit back and appreciate the scenery and see what kind of solid job that Rockstar did with putting this game together. During the day, you can see the heat simmer off of the desert at a distance, check out the details of Armadillo with some of it's false front buildings typical of the times. And so on.And the west is indeed wild!  You will see men beating up on women, cattle rustling, gangs terrifying farmers and through it all you have the choice to save the day, side with the bad guys or ignore it all.  Another addition that sets this apart from GTA is the Fame meter.  For every deed that you do, you fame can increase or decrease and people react accordingly. Try it out!  Go rob a bank early on in the game and then come back later and see what happens!There are other activities you can do to get money such as play horseshoe, try your hand at poker and even chse down the average gang or 2. You can buy and rent property also, go hunting and even prevent the occasional hanging.  If it happened in the West, it's in this game.The dialogue and music also are pretty good altho a few accents are a bit over the top and I sometimes wish there was more variation in the music.And the horses????  Wow!! The best horse mechanic that has been seen in a long time but in a game like this where your primary mode of travel is the horse, why not get it right? watch the animation with the stagecoaches, wagons and even the lassoing tutorial and see what I mean.I have very few complaints about this other than the occasional sticking that I get when trying to enter or exit a building and one mission I am having trouble on setting the waypoint, whereas I am not sure if it's a glitch or I am just not in the right spot. You get a few missions whereas similar to GTA, they are unforgiving and you have to be near perfect to complete it. And a small nitpick that I have is yes, even though the moon changes phases nightly...LOL, sometimes the phases are out of synch! On the flip side, take note at how far off you can see at night depending on where the moon is! I also wish that the time of day could be displayed actively onscreen as you play.All in all, even if you have never been a fan of Westerns in general but liked GTA you would enjoy this game and I do plan on trying out the multiplayer side to see what that's all about.  It's one of the best sandbox games to come out since GTAIV and I see many days going down the tubes playing this game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2010"}

I just didn't know how the sandbox GTA style game play would mesh with the Wild West but I have to admit that this game is everything people were hoping it would be and then some. Its nothing short of brilliant and Rockstar truly are the masters of the sandbox. The Wild West really winds up being absolutely perfect for this style of game play. In fact I think I actually prefer this setting to the GTA cities. Dont get me wrong, I am a big GTA fan and love the cars and the cities but there is just something far more immersive about a sandbox style game taking place in this type of setting. Maybe its because people automatically associate that time period with freedom and the ability to go anywhere and do anything.One of the things I was worried about the most was how traveling would be handled, in particular the horse riding. Lets face it these types of games are massive thus its imperative that the traveling aspect of the game be not only extremely enjoyable but also deep enough to where it doesn't get repetitive. Imagine if driving sucked in GTA. It would have a seriously negative impact on the entire game. Its no different with Red Dead. Had the horse riding been mundane, it would have had a very negative effect on the game. Thankfully, like driving with GTA, the horseback riding in Red Dead is outstanding. Its incredibly organic and intuitive. IMO its easily the best horse riding in the entire history of videogames. They just really nailed it and this is a very good thing as this game is absolutely massive.I have seen a lot of negative comments in regards to this game. A lot of people are saying that this is basically just GTA on a horse. Well in all honesty that isn't too far from the truth but what I dont understand is how that becomes a bad thing. GTA is an amazing series so if they are able to take the GTA game play and adapt it to different time periods like the wild west then again how is that a bad thing. I for one consider that to be a great thing especially when Rockstar are able to adapt the game so well and create such an amazing experience. It makes the game feel completely fresh even tho its basically the same type of sandbox game. When you stop and think about it, almost every aspect to the wild west lends itself perfectly to not only this style of sandbox game but also the type of violent kinds of games that Rockstar creates.Overall I think they have succeeded with flying colors. If your enjoy GTA or sandbox games in general then this should be the top of your to play list. Its absolutely outstanding!!5 Stars!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2010"}

This is not a fault with the headset, but rather with the Xbox One console, so I did not count this against the headset.The Turtle Beach XO Seven headset is very comfortable and should feel great for long gaming sessions.  The ample padding makes it feel like you are wearing a soft pillow or something; it is an excellent feeling headset.  The microphone is removable, so you can use it just as a headset if you are not going to chat.  I like this feature quite a bit, but it could be a problem for kids, as they are prone to losing things.The headset comes with two different removable connecting cables that you will use to connect the headset to your controller or other audio device.  The cables are very nice and have a cloth covering that will keep the cables from kinking or tangling.  One of the cables has a straight connector and the other has a 90-degree connector, so you can choose whatever suits your application.  The cloth covering is a nice touch and one that I appreciate.The sound quality is really good and doesn't seem terribly bass heavy in presentation, so you can hear everything that is going on around you.  A great feature of these headphones is the ability to use them as regular headphones, as you can plug the standard mini plug into your iPod, phone, tablet, etc. and use them.  This is great, as it makes them a multi-purpose purchase instead of something that is simply for gaming.  The sound is certainly not as good as Grado or Sony MDR-7506 for music, but they are not bad at all and should be great for most people, especially those who will use them for multiple purposes.  The headset is capable of producing a very loud volume, so please be careful and protect your hearing.The headset comes with the adapter necessary to use the headphones with the new XBOX One controller, but you must update your controller before they will work.  This is a simple process that can be done in a couple of minutes:Connect your controller to your Xbox One console with a USB cable.Open the Settings application.Select System.Select Update Controller.The controller will be updated after this process is completed, but I was prompted for another update when the headset was actually plugged into the controller.

In fact, if you don't have x-box live gold, this game isn't even worth renting.The graphics run from very good to pretty poor.  The mechs look great and are highly detailed.  You can customize your mech with a ton of camoflauge patterns and decals.  The environments, on the other hand, are pretty sappy.

You can load up on weapons and armor, at the expense of speed.  There are TONS of weapons, legs, and cockpits.  You can carry missle counters, thermal vision, night vision, and other \"assist\" parts.X-box live featurs a \"war\" with three warring nations.  Every player must pick allegiance to one nation (though you can change allegiances) and you can go on missions for your country.  The goal of each mission is to destroy the enemy's HQ while defending your own.  You also win, but get less points, if you destroy the other team's mechs.X-box live also features ranked and unranked games so you can just try out your mech against other players before taking it on the campaign.This game is complex and it takes a while to figure out how to build the right mech for the right mission.  My only real complaint is going on missions requires you join up with your squad.  If you've ever been in a \"clan\" on x-box live, you know how hard it is to link up with your team to play other teams.  Overall, this game offers a unique mech simulator that assures players won't necessarily be beaten by trash talking 13 year olds with excellent hand eye coordination.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00004U55E","description":"It's been nearly 10 years sinceWolfenstein 3Dforever  popularized the first-person shooter, and at long last everyone's favorite Nazi  killer, B.J. Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done. Alas, pretty graphics  and a great multiplayer game don't quite make up for an exceptionally average  single-player experience.--William HarmsPros:Amazing graphicsGreat level design (including secret passages)Awesome multiplayer modeCons:Lackluster AISingle-player game is very short","reviewerName":"Knewace","summary":"Return to Castle Wolfenstein","reviewText":"Return to Castle Wolfenstein is a first person shooter with a good but very short single player and a fantastic multiplayer gameplay. It is not a sequel to wolfenstein3d, It is a remake with an expansion pack. The game does not start where the first game ended. Like the first game rtcw starts with the soldier escaping from the prison in the nazi castle but does not end when he get out of the castle. Set during the world war II, You play B.J. Blazkowicz an american soldier captured and imprisoned in a nazi castle. He escapes from there but discoveres strange things that the agency wants to stop the nazis from creating thier evil experiments, They send Blacz on many missions to destroy the robotic soliders, The ending was dissapointing. The story is told through lots of cutsences between the missions, But the cutsences are boring as the charecters are just talking and the hero does not appear in any of them. The single player gameplay is very short with about 25 levels in seven missions. The gameplay is good and fighting the nazis and the sten gun female gaurds are great, but the robotic soldiers, zombies were are very dull, It is also quite dissapointing to see zombies and robots in this game. Level design is very good and there are lots of secret passages and most of them remind me of the thief games. The levels are also quite hard to complete, shooter missions are very good but the stealth missions are dull and quite frustrating. In one mission you must kill all the nazi officers without sounding the alarm, It was very frustrating. The boss levels and the ending levels are very hard. Enemy AI is ofcourse not as good half-life or no one lives forever but they are impressive, They react well if you snipe their partners, throw a grenade near them and to sounds ect.Return to Castle Wolfenstein is created on the quake3 engine but the game looks like it is created on the max payne engine. The graphics and sound are very good, The german outdoor hilly environment is very beautifull. The charecter animation is great, They look and behave like real humans, Sometimes their caps will fall down, female gaurds will dive on the floor when dogging gun fire. But still the graphics were a little dissapointing to me, There are not much blood in the game. The game is very violent, you do feel like you are killing real humans but there are not much blood and gore like half-life or kingpin. The selection of weapons is good, Able to use your leg to kick and break objects is good because you do not need to switch to the knife to break a box in case you want to save ammo, you could just kick it and break it. But the weapons damage is dissapointing they should have been a little more powerfull, Flame thrower is almost usless in the single player. Rtcw's multiplayer gameplay is really great, deathmatch or ai controlled bots are not here but you will not miss them. Though almost everything besides voting is the same as Team Fortress it is great to play with better graphics and a better looking flame thrower.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00005ULXN","reviewerName":"Poop Thang","summary":"A Very Good Game, But Once Again, Not Nearly the Best","reviewText":"This game does have a rather addicting appeal to it, but it wears off after you beat it. First off, the adventure fields from the first game are gone. These were a huge take-down from the game because you could talk to people, go to courses and chao gardens without using an annoying map, and that you could find sonic emblems by simply going to a hard to find space and collecting it. It also added to the plot. You can arrive at one place and find an enemy there, leading into a boss battle instead of just being taken there after beating a level. Second, the graphics are good at SOME points, but are horrible at other points. Third, in some points of some courses, you just have to hold forward on the control stick and the character does everything for you. This is the bad side of the loop-de-loops and corkscrews: a lack of challenge. Also, some of the characters (Tails) might make you extremeley annoyed because of their stupid and corny lines. There are some good points to the game, though. Multiplayer can be unfair at times, but just barely. It is a fun aspect of Sonic games. Chaos are also a great aspect of the game. As a virtual pet, a Chao can like or dislike a character according to the way that character treats it. There are also races and karate for the chao, its skills raising with the animals it recieves. When Sonic Adventure DX Directer's Cut comes out, buy that, it has everything that was taken away in this game I am reviewing, AND more.

This is the first release of Spyro for the PS2, and is made by a new company.I had heard many poor reviews about Spyro in the hands of this new company. It was made by Universal Interactive instead of Insomniac, who wrote the old Spyro games. I still have my older Spyro games so I played them side by side to see just what the difference was.First, yes the graphics are better. I would hope so! The other games are from 2000 and before, and were for the Playstation (not the PS2). So in this new version the baskets, for example, are very pretty with their weave and decoration. The water ripples when Spyro runs through it, the grasses in the water wave. Even so, curved surfaces aren't as smooth and clean as in other current games, such as FFX and Kingdom Hearts.Graphics do not make a game, though, and we found the new Spyro gameplay to be ... sluggish. In the other Spyros you feel like you have an energetic kitten on your hands, one that jumps and springs and moves quickly. In this new Spyro, it's more like a baby elephant lumbering along. The sounds don't seem to match up well with screen actions, either. There are often delays between when an action occurs and the sound kicks in.Even worse, though, are the serious coding errors evident. I'm a programmer by profession so I know it can be tough to make a game perfect. However, this game didn't seem to get even simple testing done before it was released! There were NUMEROUS problems with drawing glitches on the screen, causing giant polygons to block our view. And when we tried to play through the display problems, it crashed. Repeatedly.I really wanted the game to work well. The plot of 'the dragonflies have been stolen' seemed fun. You got to have bubble breath to capture them, and lightning breath for other tasks. There were the usual gem collecting and fun enemies. But with the sluggy gameplay and the continual crashes, it becomes very tiring very quickly. Rent this one first to see if your love of Spyro is enough to overcome those obstacles.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2003"}

You get the open-world freedom of GTA with the intense action of MOH.Unfortunately, after a great start to the series, Pandemic seems to have released Mercenaries 2 prematurely. While the game is still lots of fun, especially if you're somebody who enjoyed Mercenaries 1, many aspects of M2 feel incomplete or half-baked.Here are a few examples of how rough M2 is in many places:*Character dialogue is repetitious and often missing from important places such as mission briefings.*Background music is limited to a small number of short fragments that are played over and over and over and over...*Many activities, especially side missions, are bland filler. Gun range challenges, vehicle obstacle courses, flight school missions, and the like are really just glorified training levels. B-o-r-i-n-g!All of this is disappointing because M1 was such a well-designed game. I wonder if this is due to Electronic Arts publishing M2 (LucasArts was the publisher for M1). As most dedicated gamers know, many EA games have this problem of being shipped out before they are truly ready for the marketplace.Bottom line: if you dug M1, you'll still have fun playing M2. You'll need your knowledge of how the game world works because explanations of the features and tasks in the game are few and far between. I wouldn't pony up full retail for this game, but the fun/cost ratio is decent if you can get it for a few clams off of the \"Greatest Hits\" price. If you haven't played M1, download the M2 demo from the PlayStation Network before picking up the full version.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GD06","reviewerName":"Jack Treese \"Jack\"","summary":"Black Ops II introduces FPS to the Wii U in style","reviewText":"Currently, I own five Wii U titles: This, Arkham City, Mario, NintendoLand and ZombiU.  While they're all very fun, I can see why so many people are hooked to these Call of Duty games.  Every time I play the Wii U, I find myself popping this in and having a blast online.Other than the new options that the Wii U version offers, I can't imagine it being any different than the PS3 or Xbox 360 versions.  I've played the PS3 version as well, and I do notice a great difference between the two versions.  First and foremost, the visuals are strikingly impressive on the Wii U.  While the PS3 version looks pretty much like any other Call of duty title on the platform, the Wii U edition has noticeably improved textures.Also worthy of praise are the myriad of control options.  Whether you use the GamePad, the Pro Controller, the Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote and nunchuck, you've got options.  And yes, I know that the Wiimote/nunchuck combo is kinda funny, but I was surprised by how good it handles.  I won't play that way online anytime soon (I prefer my Pro Controller for that) but it's neat to try on Zombie or Campaign modes.Like most of the launch games available for Wii U, this game utilizes the GamePad-only route of gameplay.  There's no need for a TV when you've got just as great of an image on the GamePad.  Also, split-screen is interesting, having one friend manning the GamePad and another looking at the TV.  YES, there is a noticeable framerate drop.  No, it doesn't affect the gameplay in serious ways.  If you can deal with BioShock's locked frame-rate, it looks similar to that.  And for me, as long as I can see it and play it just fine, that's all that counts.My one area of criticism is something that has been pointed out a few times already; the online environment needs improvement.  This isn't necessarily a fault of Nintendo Network, but I believe it has something to do with the fact this is a new console, therefore not as many people to go against.  When I'm not battling the same users in different sessions across Team Deathmatch and Domination, the connection randomly interrupts or decides to migrate hosts.  It doesn't stop me from reloading the game and trying again, but it does get rather frustrating, especially when you have an amazing streak going and it happens in the middle of a match.  It's inexcusable.Online issues aside, if you want an addictive FPS game to keep you hooked to the Wii U for a while, Black Ops 2 is definitely worth a try.  However, if you have it already on another platform there's probably nothing I can say to convince you to switch to the Wii U version.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

I remember well watching the original cartoons, having a good collection of toys, watching \"Beast Wars\" and even trying my hand at Transformers fan fiction (no, not slash fiction! One must have standards). So I went into this game with certain expectations (ie: It'd be better than the Bayformers films). Happily those expectations were met!The game takes place on Cybertron before the Autobots and Decepticons set forth to go to Earth. It centers around the battles that take place just before the great exodus. You take turns playing various characters, including Megatron, Optimus Prime, Starscream, Bumblebee and the like. You take them through various battles and progress the story, much like you'd expect.The gameplay is really exceptional! Transforming your character is very fluid and easy, which is especially helpful during boss battles. The Transformers lore is there, including appearances by Omega Supreme and Trypticon, as well as end credit music by the great Stan Bush! The voice acting is all top-notch, particularly by Peter Cullen, who has got to be tired of playing Prime by now (also notable is the voice of Jetfire, only because much to my surprise it's NOT Paul McGann). The graphics are also great; really bringing Cybertron to life.Where does the game fall short? Well, the story isn't great, but it gets the job done. It's also quite a bit too short. As for the multiplayer, eh, I couldn't be bothered. I tried to do a couple matches, but it seemed like there were only about two other people trying to do so, so it didn't work out.However, if you're looking for a solid single-player experience, this is a decent game and one I'd recommend.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

It's completely addicting.Boasting the largest player population of any other MMO out there right now, there are plenty people to play with.  A variety of servers means something for everyone, and endless quests.  there are so many quests, very often I have to dump quests to get new ones because my quest roster is full!  (you can only be on 20 quests at a time.) They update for holidays, decorating and making unique seasonal quests with events, items, and character morphs.  Frequent updates mean endless new content, and there is really never nothing to do.  I know many level 60 players who play all the time!  you thin your topped out? get epic items.  you can duel other players, or work on a trade skill, battle against the opposite faction in Player VS Player battle grounds, or just walk around the world and try to find some opposing faction invading your land, you'll be sure to find some, as they often are!There are endless things to do in this game, The classes are interesting and open ended, so much so that I would venture to say there are even more classes then they say there are.  Depending how you specialize your character, his or her abilities totally change.  for example, a priest can specialize in holy, (healing and dealing holy damage) Discipline, (buffs for the group and defence for her/his self) or Shadow (damage spells, damage of time spells, and life sucking skills) they vary so much, that a Shadow Priest is nothing like a Holy Priest, they are hardly the same class at all if you ask me.The world is huge and ever expanding, new caves and instances are added pretty frequently, and new updates are allowing even MORE options with SERVER WIDE quests where opposing factions must cooperate for a common goal.The new expansion, to be released at the end of the year I believe? (I could be wrong) looks amazing as well raising the level cap.  Truely its a stunning game all around.  Highly recomended, its fun, its addicting.There are some cons however.once you get your character to 60:I have heard of instances going up to 48 hours long.7 hour instances are not at all unheard of for epic itemsa new instance is being released that will take, (unless it was a typo from Blizard) 71 hours to complete.its a time sucker, thats the con.  depending on if thats a draw back for you or not, I strongly recomend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"great game, worthy conclusion","reviewText":"The Metal Gear Solid franchise has arguably been one of the absolute best, if not THE best, of the video game franchises to emerge in the last decade and a half or so.  While we don't get MGS games at a rapid rate, when a new one comes out, it is always a major event, and there are many reasons for this.  Always pushing the Playstation's capabilities to its limits, these games continually break ground in their presentation and their immersiveness.  There is no other game, franchise or not, that is stylistically comparable to these games in any way.  They are peerless, epic games with an intensity that is both unique and unparalleled.  Therefore, after finally getting my PS3 a few weeks ago, there was little doubt as to what my first purchase was going to be.I'm very happy to report that, after beating the game last night, Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, maintains tradition of greatness that I've come to expect from MGS, and is a worthy conclusion to Solid Snake's 20+ years in the video game universe.  Technically, the game is flawless.  Commanding Snake through those glorious HD levels was a thrill.  The graphics are vivid and detailed, and give the feel of the game a level of immersion that really wasn't possible before.  The sound makes your heart race and the music score is as excellent as ever.  Some of the action cut scenes we're just incredible, putting anything I've seen come out of Hollywood recently to shame.  There were no glitches or bugs that I noticed.  MGS has always been one of the best in the biz when it comes to presentation, and this one is no different.The gameplay, while taking more of a 3rd person perspective rather than the traditional overhead view, is slightly refined, but still feels very much like the other entries in the series.  But with the PS3's amazing technological capabilities, everything is kicked up a notch.  I liked the fact that I was forced to do more shooting in this game.  However, this is still primarily a stealth game, and to conquer the levels in the most efficient fashion (and in my opinion, the most satisfying fashion as well), you will need to keep your noticibility down and your awareness up.  The boss fights, once again, are epic & amazing.  There was a battle against a flying boss in the Eastern Europe act that was just stunning in its scale.  Metal Gear Solid has some of the greatest, most intense boss battles anywhere, and this entry is no different.  Along the way, there are many useful gadgets and ways to customize your weapons that will aid you in your mission.  Lots of reviewers have gone into detail on those, so I won't.  But down to the very smallest details, this is a game that was a labor of love, and it always shows.And lastly, there is the story.  Gamers can argue the various strengths and weaknesses of the MGS series, but to me, there is simply no dispute...Metal Gear has told the absolute best story in the history of video games.  And this game draws together all the elements from the previous MGS games (as well as the old school NES Metal Gear games and the ones for the portable systems) and wraps it all up in a very satisfying fashion.  In relation to this, I've seen a lot of talk as to whether this game would work for someone unfamiliar with the franchise.  My vote would be \"no\".  There is simply too much here that ties back to the previous entries.  It was those references and the way this game ties up and concludes it all, that contributed so much to its greatness for me.  It's like reading \"The Return of the King\" without reading the first two Lord of the Rings volumes first.  It can be done, but the amount that would be missed is just too great.MGS4: Guns of the Patriots is a stellar offering to owners of the PS3.  I absolutely loved the game and couldn't wait to get home from work in the evenings to play it.  The story was riveting and the conclusion was worthy of the franchise.  The game was just as addicting and intense as ever, and seeing the evolution of the series into the world of high definition is a wonder.  To any fan of the series, this is a no-brainer.  I'm glad this was my first PS3 game.  It will be a tough act to follow.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Julian Pope","summary":"An Escapists Dream","reviewText":"Grand Theft Auto V seems to me to be the perfect way to cap off an outstanding generation of gaming. The PlayStation 3 has seen so many fantastic and deep RPG's, from Mass Effect to Skyrim to Red Dead Redemption and finally GTA V. As each of those games offer very different looks into very different genres, sci-fi, high fantasy, western and modern crime, they all give a very real sense of role playing. While some of those other games actually take you to another time period or planet, GTA V keeps you somewhat grounded in reality.If I had to use one word to characterize this game it would be 'heist'. This game, is all about heists. If you have ever wondered what it would be like to take a big score, Grand Theft Auto V shows you exactly how it would feel. I think the single biggest production to influence this game was the movie Heat (even in the music), which was a great blueprint to use. Second biggest influence might be Point Break. There are probably more pop culture references in this game than any other piece of media in the world, which definitely dates it.I am a harsh judge when it comes to the Grand Theft Auto games because the experience they are trying to create endeavors to be so genuine, I want to make sure it actually is. I have a few criticisms for the game as far as things you can and cannot do in the story that you probably should be able to do like sell cars you customize, buy different houses (at least 5), be able to purchase a wider variety of businesses (owning an Up N Atom burger might be nice), being able to buy more clothing/accessories (really missed not being able to buy a $300k Audemars) and several other small functional things. When I first heard that GTA V was in fact NOT being released for next gen consoles (PS4), I was worried that the game would be too big that the current hardware couldn't handle it. Overall it performed pretty well in spite of this fact, though it surely would have been better if they did develop it for the PS4.The voice acting was excellent, the world is huge and there is almost an infinite amount of things to do in Los Santos and Blaine County. Overall, the 3 main character narrative (even though I'm not really a fan of Trevor) was the perfect way to tell this massive, violent and gritty story.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2013"}

Batman: Arkham Origins 1000381341 Xbox 360 Games","reviewerName":"Brandon P. \"Brandon\"","summary":"Great Game Overall...","reviewText":"This game is well done. Of course, it looks the same as Batman Arkham City. The developers probably made with the same game engine. Cinematic scenes are amazing. It was like I was watching a movie. Everything is the same for me like the same game environment, the same controls, and same graphics from Batman AC.  Anyways, I played the single mode missions. I am talking about the MAIN missions where Batman has to find out about Black Mask. The story was very entertaining for me, and it was very suspenseful every mission. I don't really want to spoil the story of Batman,so I am not going into great depth about the story line. Most people got this game because of single player. Now, multiplayer online is not bad at all. I think there are two modes to play. I only played it for a little, because I was not very interest with it. I got the game only single player. I am guessing that the creator made this online feature, so people can keep playing Batman Origins. I understand why, because I beat the game within two days, JUST THE MAIN MISSIONS. It will be a little big longer if you also play the side missions. The storyline was pretty darn short, and that is why the developers wanted to be sure to make this game more playable for everybody to play everyday. On my opinion, everybody will be playing this for about few weeks, and that is it. Most gadgets are the same from the recent game, but there are some new ones that could be useful during combat fighting. The best part of this game was the shock gloves. After beating up Electrocutor, Batman took his shock gloves, and use it through the storyline. If there are multiple hostiles that you have to face, you start increasing your shock gloves after beating up the hostiles. A pop up controls will be shown on the screen (L2 + R2), and you activate the shock gloves, you are going to be crazy after making multiple combos. I nearly almost got 150x with those gloves, but the problem is that you can only use it for specific amount of time. The shock gloves will decrease after you use it. Now, the game added with another feature called Challenge Mode. Yes, it is the exact same way as Batman AC, but I find it more interesting play that than Mulitplayer online. I recommend everybody to get this game. The story was so good, I am going to play it again, but harder.Controls: 9/10Gamplay: 8.5/10Graphics: 8/10Environment: 7.5/10Gadgets: 9/10Game sounds (Explosive, sound effects): 10/10Story: 10/10Game Modes ( Multiplayer, Challenge Mode, Plus mode): 10/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

I own both the PS2 and Xbox as well, but on days I don't know what I want to play I find myself playing games like Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong...(The list goes on and on).  The GameCube is an excellent second console if you already own one of the others.  Nintendo made the GameCube to be powerful but inexpensive, [less expensive] than the other two.  Don't be fooled by FanBoys out there that will tell you the cube is for kids, it has the horsepower to keep up with the PS2 and is close with the Xbox.  Yes it might not look like the coolest thing or have DVD player installed, but it can play games and does it GREAT!!!

Hear sounds of true war, people yelling in pain and for cover, interacting with you.  Bombs exploding right and left.

Shoot soldiers with all sorts of awsome weapons.  Anything from a handgun to a Sniper, it's all here!3. Last, but not least, incredible replay value.  Each mission is fun to play again and again and again.  The CPU keeps your stats.  Try to hit 80% of your targets, or beat the mission in less than 10 minutes.  So many options, so little time!

The visuals are excellent, the combat mechanics and gameplay are enthralling.  Even at $40 it would be a worthwhile purchase in terms of dollars for entertainment. What I like most is the richness of the environments. Even though the main story line certainly follows a linear progression it never feels like you are bound to a specific path.As good as this game is, one cannot help but draw parallels between it and Naughty Dog's Uncharted series, particularly Uncharted 2. It seems that Tomb Raider has come back and reclaimed a lot of what Uncharted borrowed from it and added a heaping helping of badassery and gruesomeness to the combat. I really wouldn't mind if Square Enix and Naughty Dog decided to just straight up copy each other if it meant twice as many games like this.Unfortunately, Tomb Raider 2013 doesn't feel like it's on the same level in terms of narrative as Naughty Dog games are. While Drake and company build the character with witty banter and snipes back and forth as you play, and integrate the treasure hunting/puzzle solving tightly with the story line while the soundtrack is both relevant to the setting and evocative.  I'm not getting that same kind of tight integration of character, narrative, soundtrack and environment from Tomb Raider. If anything the hunt for treasures is a significant distraction and the weakness of the voice acting for Lara really exacerbates it.  At one point, while wading through a lake of blood, bones and people meat, I opened a treasure box to have the game jerk me out of the experience so that Lara could gushingly explain to me about how the fan in the box was used in wedding ceremonies. This happens constantly. Overall it seems they just tried to pack Tomb Raider with too much stuff rather than get the stuff to work together in a cohesive manner.Bottom line, great and worthwhile game but (here comes the warning) DON'T make my mistake play it right after playing The Last of Us. The games have a lot of similarities in terms of grittiness, weapons and mechanics that invite comparison but Tomb Raider will come out feeling hollow.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2013"}

The car models look extremely realistic and the background design is over average. To bad there aren't any cutscenes though...Gameplay: The gameplay is PGR2 is pretty simple/self explanatory. Race your car and win! Thats practically it. However, PGR2 includes a feature that no other racing game does. Kudos! By cutting sharp turns, you earn a certain amount of Kudos which goes towards your \"Kudos Jar.\" Some races depend on the abount of Kudos that you collect, some races depend on whether you come into 1st, 2nd, or 3rd place. It all depends. This, i found was very unique and a cool aspect on PGR2.Audio: The audio all depends on whether you like rap/hip hop music or not. If you like it, you will give the audio feature a 5/5, if you dont, then you will most likely give it a 2/5 or a 1/5 if you HATE the rap music that blares out of the radio in your car.Online: The online feature in PGR2 is cool. You can basically only race your opponents online and trash talk them which is very fun! Plus there is downloadable content.As a result, if you are a fan of Project Gotham Racing #1, you will fall in love with Project Gotham Racing #2!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2005"}

True 5.1 surround and multi-console support!","reviewText":"Now I'm not an audiophile by any means but I do like sound whoring (sound whoring is when you use positional sounds your ememies give off to know where they are/ what they are doing and then proceed to kill them using this tactical information) in Call of Duty and I know that gives you a tactical advantage over your enemies. So generally I like wireless headphones better just because those times when you stand up to go get a sandwich or take a leak and you either rip your Xbox or PlayStation off the shelf or you rip your headphones off your head. But that being said if you can avoid doing that these headphones are awesome.The one thing I like about these is there true 5.1 surround sound headphones. That means there are five speakers in the headphones and each of the speakers gets the signal from the game. Now a lot of times this simulated surround sound headphones that you see work really well in simulating the surround sound experience, but I think is a reason MLG went with true 5.1 surround as their official headphones if you are competitive in your gaming there will be an advantage I believe. Now I've used Triton 5.1's in the past and I kind of like the turtle Beach is a little bit better. I also like the Mike on the turtle beaches better than a my Tritons.Another thing about these headphones is they work on multiple devices. And that's a big deal I know many people have a PlayStation and an Xbox or they want to game on their iPad etc. we live in a world were people have multiple gaming devices and this can be used amongst them all. That's me is a huge selling point.So I say if you really are and the competitive gaming or you play a lot of search and destroy go with the 5.1 surround is definitely is a better experience.Thanks for reading!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002ZJPYHS","description":"","reviewerName":"HitRaj 47","summary":"Mediocre At Best, Not Worth Buying","reviewText":"I bought this game as a go between, whilst waiting forCall of Duty: Black Ops. If you are contemplating spending your hard earned dollars on an FPS, skip over this one. It adds nothing new to the genre and just borrows from other games. Even in a few years or months, when you feel you're all burned out of FPS games and have some spare cash lying around, this game won't be worth it and neither will it be remembered.Unless another Medal of Honor game comes out, this is sad end to the series. It's just another cookie cutter game making money off a franchise. The singleplayer, developed by Danger Close studios isn't very well designed and again, it won't be remembered. It seems fun to play, the weapons have solid feel and sound to them. It's linear and quite frankly it would have made a great co-op mode, but there is no co-op mode. It's not worth replaying.The multiplayer is developed by DICE and is the main course of the game really. It's not too bad, considering it used the same engine asBattlefield Bad Company 2it seems they have made major improvements to the weapons. Just like the singleplayer, the weapons have a good feel to them, sufficient recoil and strong sounds make the guns feel powerful, even the pistols. However, speaking about the guns, there are three classes you can play as in game. Assault class uses assault rifles and machine guns, Spec Ops use sub machine guns and shotguns, and then there's the Sniper class, which is the one that seems to be the best to use. The maps aren't as small as say, Modern Warfare 2 but not as big as Bad Company 2. However, they are big enough that between two to three snipers or more can pin down an entire team.The spawn killing is also an issue. DICE have never learned how to create a good spawn system. There are times where you will have no choice but to die literally a second after you spawn, because an enemy sniper is already watching your spawn area. It's frustrating and I'm disgusted that, even with a so called \"beta\" that they released a week before the game, they didn't bother to fix this. This is another game that has been released before any proper playtesting has been done.The multiplayer employs a leveling system, however I wouldn't expect much from it. It's nowhere near as refined as Modern Warfare 2's system and quite frankly the rewards that you get for gaining each level sucks. I went from level 4 to the max (which is 15 for each class, making 45 in total) for the assault class without changing my loadout once. None of the unlocks are worth it and they are too similar across each class. For example, each class, when you reach a certain level you can choose to use the enemy's guns. So if you were playing as Assault class on the American side, instead of using an M16 you can opt to equip the AK47 instead. Neither of these guns, in my opinion have noticeable differences.Overall this game is mediocre and average at best. This release isn't worth playing and will probably be forgotten in the years to come. If you're looking for longevity, originality or even fun, spend your money on something else. My score out of 10 for this game would be a 4/10.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00D4WTO1M","description":"","reviewerName":"dookerJ","summary":"Worst COD ever, the death of the series","reviewText":"This game was terrible.  I've never wanted my money back so much after buying a game.Firstly, I play COD primarily for the campaign; I want an immersive story with cool, innovative gadgets and gameplay.  This game had none of that.  I don't know about the disc version, but if you buy the digital download version, the campaign is an OPTIONAL download (3.8GB)!  Someone at Infinity Ward said &#34;only 10% of gamers play the campaign, so we didn't care much about it&#34;, to paraphrase.  The campaign was extremely dull, the highlight being able to use the DOG two or three times. It lasted, literally, 4-5 hours, even on hard mode.  Epic fail.In the past I've been a fan of Infinity Ward's iterations of the series; but Treyarch has really taken the reigns.  COD: Black Ops 2 had an incredible campaign, written by the same screenwriter who wrote some of the new Batman series and tons of other Hollywood hit films.  The mechanic of flipping back and forth between the future warfare (2030 or something) and flashbacks to the Cold War in the 60s-80s was fantastic.  They really put a lot of effort into that campaign and the game in general.The hype before the COD Ghosts launch talked about the &#34;totally redesigned engine&#34; and all this stuff, but it's very dated, graphically.  It's the same old small iteration on the id tech engine.  Nothing was thrilling, nothing was immersive, it was total crap.Multiplayer is obviously where they put their money, but it was boring.  It was pretty much identical to the previous games, but somehow, more dull, less gadgets, less technology.  Lots of cheaters using lag switches, etc, especially on the 360 version, which is a very hackable console.Overall, a terrible flop of a game.  Widely considered the death of the series. Probably why it's on sale now at a budget.On a side note, I played Battlefield 3 back in the day, and wasn't too impressed.  It was graphically poor.  Too much chaos.On the other hand, Battlefield 4 on the PS4 (the definitive) version is killer.  Epic.  The campaign was at least 10-20 times longer than Ghosts, and more thrilling and immersive.In multiplayer, the maps are enormous, and on PS4 and PC, it's 64 players!  You have 5-6 player squads, so team play is paramount,  All kinds of vehicles, Jets, Helos, Tanks, Trucks, etc, and you can spawn on a player in a vehicle, say a Helicopter, and your teammate flying the vehicle, while you can switch between stations (machine gunner seats, etc).  Spawn in a tank and a teammate will either drive or operate the secondary gun,  You capture areas and can spawn from them.  You can parachute from planes and helos and capture points.  It's like COD times 5 or 6,  A truly epic game,As squad leader you can give orderers, and anyone can use a quick menu to make quick questions/commands/etc.And one of the coolest parts, is if you sign in on the EA website, you cannot only further customize your soldier, but you can go into battlemode and see, in realtime, the map, and everything that's going on, in your browser (I recommend Chrome).  They did some top-notch HTML5 work here.  You san see strongholds, characters (including you), a all in real time, it's a real, working, second screen that runs in the browser, and there's a full-screen button.  So you can have your laptop/PC/MAC next to you and see all of the action tom the minimap, but in full screen, and if you're a commander, you can target objects, etc.  It's pretty amazing how they got all of this to work.Last note, if you're going console, get the PS4 version, as it is the definitive version, running at 1080P without a hiccup (the review sites, like GameTrailers, noted that MS wouldn't allow them to show footage from their versions prior to launch&#8230;  questionable?  They also said the PS4 version's graphics were on par with the PC version with graphics set to HIGH).  It's one crazy, but again, epic game!  Reminds me a bit of Tribes 2; steep learning curve, but once you've got it, it's a masterpiece.  If you're deciding on which one to get between this and COD Ghosts, definitely get Battlefield 4; it has taken the crown, COD is DOA.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2014"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone.

New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"G.

I don't see a difference, both versions look fantastic!! This is an absolutely beautiful game on either system, I purchased the PS 3 version because I am still, and always be a fan of the Dualshock controller, I guess you could call me a dualshock fanboy.Ok some reviewers hammered home the comparisons to RE 4, and that's fair, apparently Capcom didn't want to stray from what worked for them and RE 4 was a runaway hit. I like that the game \"feels\" familiar but different at the same time. I played the demo a lot to get a handle on the controls, because we can all agree that they take a bit of adjustment from other 3rd person games. I know for the purity of the game Capcom decided to leave the run and gun aspect out of it, but I can't tell you how many times I wish I could pull a Gears of War tactic out of my a$$ during some of the more intense encounters, but after adjusting to the RE frame of mind I adapted quickly.The story has enough cheese in it to keep me happy, I am perfectly happy with the story, my level of escapism with the game was just right, I don't need a life altering story to make me love a game.I can't recommend this game enough, it is perfect for me in many ways.

Certainly, the graphics are not super top-notch, however, the graphics are good enough for this game. Cap fights and jumps his way through a lot of tough opponents. His shield deflection capability is put to good use, that's for sure. He also gets to pummel a few opponents along the way. This game has a fun and spectacular finish and is not overly hard (except on hard mode, heh). There are collectables to find and skills to unlock but for the most part fighting is what Cap does best.Edit: This game is similar to Batman:Arkham Asylum. First, once you get to the Sewers in Cap you can backtrack to any previous area, and probably should. Combat is similar to Batman, but Cap has a mighty strike ability. He has a power bar, so the mighty strike can be saved up to four uses when you need it. It will also heal you when you do use it. Furthermore, Cap needs to dodge a lot more than Batman, and Cap's shield is more powerful than Batarang. Cap also has grapple attacks and a few special moves that can be unlocked that are not based on the 'square' button. The Caped Crusader does have better graphics, provided you are not in Detective mode. Also, Batman has a few gadgets for outside of combat. I found both games fun, but Captain America is more combat oriented.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world.

Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

Marshall \"Geoffrey Marshall\"","summary":"There are first-person shooters...and then there is Halo","reviewText":"The only word I can say for this game is \"magnificent!\" I can't quite put my finger on what makes this game better than any other first-person shooter i've played, but I do know that it's the only one I like enough to purchase. The story is given in other reviews; basically, humans are fighting a losing war against a covenant of aliens bent on eradicating us called (surprisingly) the Covenant. You play the last remaning supersoldier called Master Chief, and you're on a last-ditch mission to draw the alien forces away from Earth. The ship you're on makes a random space jump and crashes on this place called Halo. It seems to be a planet...or is it? What secrets does it hold, why are the Covenant exploring it? Play the game and find out.This is an intelligent gamer's FPS. You have limits as to what weapons you can carry (2 at a given time) and you can only pick up ammo for the weapons you're carrying. You can only have 4 grenades (thought you can have 4 each of Marine and Covenant grenades, switching to the one when you run out of the other), and you have control of various vehicles at various points in the game. You also have the intermittent support(?) of Marines who crashed with you. Usually, they end up being cannon fodder, but they can hold their own; if you're in a Warthog (indestructible 4WD that holds you and two others), it's great to have them as gunners.My passion is the weapons. These are for your selection, human first then CovenantAssault Rifle: The mainstay of your armory, I view this as a steady girlfriend. You may date others and use them more, but you always return to her. It is good allround, has a max of 600 bullets with a 60 bullet clip. Relatively accurate but don't try sniping with it. I usually it as a backup. I may use the shotgun or plasma rifle as my main weapon, but this is always there.Hand Pistol: This pistol is good for accurate shooting and taking out Hunters in their weak spots, but i haven't developed the skill for that. Aim correctly and you can kill a lot of Covenant with one shot. Flood, on the other hand...It has 120 bullets and is a single shooter. It'll do in a pinch, but I wouldn't rely on it as a main weapon.Shotgun: Can't dodge buckshot! This is my fav weapon in the game. It has a max ammo load of 60 shells and chambers 12. It isn't good at distances, but one shot at close range will take out any bad guy except a Hunter and maybe an Elite with shielding (and 2 shots will take the Elite out). Especially good for fighting the Flood...Rocket Launcher: Tried and true staple of all FPS, operates like all the others. You're only allowed a max of 8 rockets, and 2 per chamber, so aim well or die. For taking out vehicles and bad-asses(Ghosts, Banshees, Hunters, enemy groups, etc)Sniper Rifle: Great zoom, nice accurate bullets, one shot one kill, great for the game, bad for multi-players. A pox on all those who win by sniping. I believe it's a 60 bullet limit there. Very effective against covenant, ineffective against flood.Covenant weapons: Whenever possible, I recommend using these against the covenant. They seem to be more sucseptible to these than to human weapons (not that human weapons are BAD) and you can conserve your ammo better. Keep your machine gun, but use and discard Covenant guns as your main attack when dealing with covenant.Plasma Pistol: Small energy-blast weapon that can be retrieved from bodies of defeated Covenant. It's better than fighting bare-handed, and you can charge the pistol to deliver a large burst against your enemy. Firing the weapon depletes the charge, and you cannot recharge it; once it's depleted you'll have to toss it and get something else.Plasma Rifle: The covenant equivalent of your assault rifle, it's bigger and more powerful than the plasma pistol. It doesn't do the charge-release attack like the pistol, and must be fired in moderation lest it overheats. A good primary weapon when facing the Covenant. As its smaller cousin, it depletes with firing and cannot be recharged.Needler: This weapon fires needles which home into and stick onto your targets, and then explodes. The needles bounce off shields and Hunter armor, but it's a decent weapon overall. You can get ammunition for it. You can have a max of 80 needles, and the weapon holds 20.more can be said, but look it up yourself.

{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"Ben Rowland","summary":"In space, everyone can hear you scream!","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of the original Dead Space, it being the first game I bought for the Xbox 360 and the one I have gone back to constantly, and my hopes were suitably high for the sequel. The first game was a chilling at atmospheric game that was part Aliens and part Resident Evil, and Dead Space 2 retains the looks and feel while providing some marked improvements that fans of the original will love.Set three years after the events of the first Dead Space, the main protagonist Isaac is confined to the mental ward of a hospital, suffering from dementia and haunting visions of his dead girlfriend, who comes to him in creepy flashbacks and cut scenes early in the game. The first acts of the game are rather hazy, as Isaac is suddenly freed from the hospital during an invasion of the Necromorphs from the first game, and when he escapes with his life and begins to make his way through the chaos that surrounds him. After being eased into the game through some expository dialogue, you don the space suit and obtain the weapons and then the real fun starts. The first thing that is noticeable from the start is that Isaac is more fleshed out as a character, having full dialogue and an intriguing back story. The secondary characters, some looking to help and others looking to harm him, are equally compelling and add a depth to the story that felt absent in the first game. The frightening Necromorphs are more aggressive than ever in Dead Space 2, and you will spend a good part of the game fighting them off along with a host of other nightmarish creatures. The key to survival is aiming at their limbs, and this leads to some tense firefights where you are surrounded by enemies and aiming becomes a frantic and sometimes frustrating endeavor. The weapons we know and love form the first game have also returned, including the Plasma Cutter, the Pulse Rifle, and my favorite, the Line Gun.Dead Space 2 is every bit as creepy and atmospheric as the first game, but you will immediately notice that they have increased the gore and the frequency of the \"jump\" moments. Like any good horror movie, you will find yourself walking into a dark and eerily silent room, knowing that something is going to jump out at you. The graphics and sound of the first game set a gold standard for survival horror games and they are equally stellar here. Adding to the atmosphere are more varied locales, including hospital rooms, a concourse and, most creepy of all, children's bedrooms with bloody handprints on the wall. This adds up to an experience that feels fresher than the original Dead Space and you get less bored of travelling through space station areas that all look the same after a while. The gameplay is as tight as the original, with responsive controls and meaty weapons are are a pleasure to eviscerate enemies with. That I have noticed an improvement on are the controls in the Zero-Gravity areas, which were cumbersome in the first game but feel better here. Returning are your abilities with Stasis, which allows you to slow down enemies and grab far away objects. Using this skill is a life-saver, especially in the more hectic fights later in the game.The other notable improvement is the online multiplayer, which consists of two teams of four people, one side being the soldiers and the other being the creatures found in the single-player campaign. The leveling up works like most other competitive online games; you earn points by getting as many kills, as few deaths, and assisting your teammates when they are overpowered. The points from levelling up allow you to upgrade equipment, armour and abilities and it works well for the most part. The only drawbacks are the high learning curve, especially when playing as a creature, and the lackluster performance of your weapons and stasis in the beginning. Some of my friends have complained about the connection issues with the servers and horrible lag, but I have yet to experience this myself. It's fast, frantic, and yes, a little frustrating. However, I look at the multiplayer as a bonus since I bought this for the campaign.Overall, Dead Space 2 is a sequel that keeps the strengths of the original game while making some improvements that will please fans who are looking for something new. The single-player campaign is very solid and will keep you busy for 10 to 12 hours, depending on the difficulty chosen, and the multiplayer should satisfy your competitive streak once you get past the learning curve. I purchased the Xbox 360 version of the game, but the Playstation 3 version comes with Dead Space: Extraction, an on-rails shooters previously exclusive to the Wii, but I own this already so it didn't make a difference to me. Whatever version you choose, Dead Space 2 is a winner and is one of the first great games of 2011.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}

I was used to taking names in COD, which I played a lot.  Then, soon after getting really bored with MW3 (which is very marginal at best), I decided to take a very patient approach to getting into Battlefield 3's multiplayer.  At first, I got smoked everytime I spawned and quickly lost interest.  But soon after, I had a handle on the maps and the different classes of characters and what they were capable of.  Soon, I started ranking up quickly and unlocking better weapons and gadgets, increasing my chances of success. It wasn't long before I was knee-deep into this game, realizing just how realistic it is and what a great challenge it could be.  COD games are more like an arcade shooter and I love them for just that.  But Battlefield is almost an RPG shooter, where you feel like your progression rewards you with a better chance of further progression.  The campaign is challenging, but nothing to write home about.  If you have the patience and can work towards getting better at an MP first person shooter without getting discouraged easily, Battlefield 3 is a rewarding experience.  If you expect a COD shooter, you'll get frustrated (and owned) very quickly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0016NRS8M","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Two Worlds II - A Huge Improvement","reviewText":"Two Worlds II is the sequel to one of the biggest disappointments ever, Two Worlds. That game had so much potential, but it was a technical nightmare. The game was choppy, looked rather poor, had lousy combat, no blocking, awful voice acting, and so many other issues. Many enjoyed it for its \"campy\" approach to dialog and such, but it just wasn't a very good game at all. However, Reality Pump has turned the corner and improved on every facet of the original game with Two Worlds II. This is an exciting role-playing game that succeeds where its predecessor failed.Positives:- Beautiful Graphics Engine - Unlike Two Worlds, Two Worlds II is a beautiful and lush gaming world. It looks crisp, alive, and vibrant. Each different environment is detailed and beautiful. The lighting, water effects, texture work; it's all top notch!- Some Solid Combat - While the moves the main character does are a bit exaggerated, the combat itself works well. While the original Two Worlds didn't offer any blocking mechanic, Two Worlds II does and does it well.- A Large World, Filled w/ Quests - Two Worlds II is a very large game. While its map isn't as seamless as Two Worlds map, it offers much more detailed and interesting locales. Along with that, apart from the main quest and such, there are many side quests to complete.- Better Voice Acting, More Interesting Story - While neither of these components will win any awards, it's a vast improvement over the first Two Worlds. I actually really enjoy the main character in Two Worlds II, as there's some good and witty banter that goes on in the game. The story itself is typical fantasy fare, but it's certainly an enjoyable romp.- More Polished Than Two Worlds - Two Worlds II is still a game that's rough around the edges, but unlike its predecessor, it's completely bearable now. It feels like a more well put together game.Negatives:- Framerate That Dies Out - Even though the framerate is usually pretty decent, sometimes the game will get super choppy and almost unplayable for a few seconds. It seems very inconsistent, so I have no idea what causes this, but it's a slight nuisance.- Clipping - Enemies will clip though the environment and it may become a chore to kill them.Two Worlds II still isn't a perfect game, but it's one of the most enjoyable role-playing games I've played in recent memory. As long as you go in not expecting a perfect masterpiece, I think you'll really enjoy your time with Two Worlds II. I'll give it 5 stars because of my personal enjoyment, but that doesn't mean it's flawless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2011"}

I really wanted to like this game a lot but the glitches just got too frustrating.The overall story is fun. You play as the new leader of the gang The Third Street Saints and events closely follow the end of Saints Row II. Your gang has gone corporate and is a shell of its former self. After your gang's second in command Johnny Gat gets killed the Saints try to take away the city of Steelport from the organization that killed Gat. During all of this the people of Steelport have elected an anti-gang mayor who's sole mission is to kill the gang bangers in the city and that includes you and the Saints along with the rest of the gangs you're fighting against.If you've played any of the Saints Row games before the missions will feel familiar. Just like the other two games they're similarly over the top and generally fun. One of the things I liked about this game is that unlike the Grand Theft Auto games you choose the difficulty level of the overall game. Even on easy certain missions will still be hard but they won't be frustratingly impossible for gamers who don't have great skills. The side missions on the map are opened up as you encounter them through the main missions. Each side mission is ranked from easy to hard. In order to fully take over the city and complete the game you need to do the side missions. Most of them are a lot of fun.Unfortunately all of that fun is negated by the bugs and glitches in this game. I experienced frequent freezing as well as numerous graphical glitches like falling through a bridge while driving and my car disappearing while driving. The game also seemed like even if you had a choice of three missions it wanted to make you do one before another because I would choose to do a mission and the game would freeze until I chose another one after resetting my XBox 360.If it weren't for the technical problems I think I would have loved this game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVV9","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"One of Nintendo's many masterpieces, essential gaming for the video game enthusiast","reviewText":"SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3, one of the most famous games Nintendo has ever produced, came out toward in the middle of the NES console's life cycle, and brought renewed life to the aging console.  Like the original Super Mario Brothers, SMB3 became one of the biggest selling games ever.  SMB3 also brought a lot of new innovations to the Mario series, many of which can still be found today.  SMB3 regularly charts both player and critic polls as being among the best video games ever released.Released [in at the end of 1988] October 3, 1988 in Japan, SMB3 became one the Famicon's biggest sellers.  America had to wait for over a year from when Japan got it.  Originally released in some Nintendo arcade machines before it even hit stores, the buzz soon spread about the game.  This buzz was helped by the ninety minute commercial known as THE WIZARD (some people insist that it is a movie proper, but it's little more than a Nintendo advertisement) in which the climax of the movie - er, commercial - is the unveiling of SMB3, as well as revealing the secret location to the one of the warp whistles.  America finally got its hands on the game in released February 12, 1990.The game went on to sell approx. eighteen million copies, and when you include the reissues and rereleases with SUPER MARIO ALL STARS and SUPER MARIO ADVANCED, this figure swells to over thirty three million copies.  And what makes SMB3 such a successful, highly regarded title?  Read on.For the second* officially released sequel to the biggest selling game of all time, Nintendo didn't pull any stops when it came to crafting this game.  Returning to the familiar environments and gameplay of the original title, rather than the radical reinvention of SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, Nintendo greatly widened Mario's moves and gamestyle.  The Fire-flower and starman return.  Nintendo introduces Mario's famous raccoon suit, which enables Mario to fly briefly, and greatly opens up what is possible in level design.  New suits and powerups also include the Tanooki suit, which enables Mario to become a stone statue, a Frog suit for swimming, and Hammer Brothers suit, which enables Mario to shoot hammers.One of the biggest innovations was the inclusion of an overall game map, where Mario would move between levels.  Nintendo also used the concept (in a much different setting with a much different effect) in ZELDA II: THE ADVENTURE OF LINK, though in that title the overworld was much more important and you had a lot more freedom.  Here, the map served as a level grid in which to progress through the eight worlds.  SMB3 returns to the eight world format of the original game, rather than the seven world format of SMB2.The level design itself is where SMB3 truly shines.  First off, Nintendo returned to the original game for its basic game mechanics but [induing] ensuring Mario has a whole new bag of tricks to beat the nasty Bowser and his koopa kids.  While staying true to the overall atmosphere and play of the original title, Nintendo, over the course of eight worlds, features platforming levels that ingeniously use the game's new suits and powerups to fully integrate the player into the game's world.  Each of the eight levels is themed.  The first world is grass lands.  The second world is desert (much like the second and sixth world in SMB2).  The third is the water levels.  Where the castle is on the overworld map for World 3 is roughly a map of Japan and Tokyo.  The fourth world is the land of giants.  The fifth is the Skylands.  The sixth is frozen tundra, all ice.  The seventh is Pipeland, and the eight is Bowser's world, featuring lava, tricky airships, and challenging levels.SMB3 also introduces the seven children of King Kooper (whose the mother???), each of which rule one of the worlds and which at the end of each world you must fight in an airship.  Other innovations include minigames, new enemies (many of which would feature prominently in later titles), and the aforementioned suits.A good portion of NES games are notorious for being extremely difficult.  Some titles are damn near impossible (BATTLE TOADS, NINJA GAIDEN III), and others are filled with cheap shots and just unforgiving, unreasonable difficulty (the original MEGA MAN).  In fact, the original sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS (known everywhere but Japan as THE LOST LEVELS) went unreleased in its original format stateside or in Europe for twenty one years due to difficulty and too similar to the original game.  We only just now got the title via the Virtual Console on the Wii.Fortunately, SMB3 has a very intuitive difficulty level.  As each world progresses, so does the difficulty of the levels, which culminates in the last world of Bowser, which does have some hard patches.  Overall, however, SMB3 has a medium range of difficulty, and while there are some tricky parts here and there, the game is not really that difficult and most players will be able to beat it given enough time.  Not giving too much away, SMB3 also jokingly refers to the original title after you beat Bowser, with the first words out of Princess Toadstool's mouth is \"Thank you Mario, but our princess is in another castle . . . just kidding.\"  Strangely enough, they cut this joke in the SUPER MARIO ADVANCED reissue.Overall, SMB3 stands as one of the gaming industry's most outstanding achievements, and is one of the corner stones of the Mario Series.  As much as I love SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, SMB3 really felt like the true sequel to the original game, and Mario went out with a blaze of glory on the original NES with this title.  One of the greatest games ever.*Though this is the second sequel to be released and that the general public knew about, this was actually the fourth officially licensed sequel to SUPER MARIO BROTHERS.  The first, developed by Hudson Soft with Nintendo's permission, was a game called SUPER MARIO BROTHERS SPECIAL, which appeared on the obscure NEC PC-8801 in Japan only.  This is the truly forgotten Mario game, the real lost levels if you will.  Due to technical limitations, it does not scroll and the hit detection is rather off.  Nintendo had nothing to do with its development.  The second sequel is SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2, released in 1986.  This title was released only in Japan.  The game was just like SUPER MARIO BROTHERS, but much harder.  Howard Lincoln of HOWARD AND NESTOR fame (anyone who had Nintendo Power back in the 1980s knows what I am talking about) hated the title, so they took a Japanese game called Doki Doki Panic, changed some sprites, and in 1988 released the American version of SUPER MARIO  BROTHERS 2.------------------.-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history. Notably, Miyamoto said that \"Super Mario World\" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make. As \"Super Mario World\" came out in November 1990, that means Nintendo began production on this game sometime in 1987 - the same year they were working on \"Super Mario Bros. 3\". On a game forum someone asked why Nintendo did not release \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" on the SNES, instead of the NES, and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system. This was my answer:]Let's look at some Mario history, shall we? SMB3 came out in Japan in October 1988. That means it was completed, finished, and ready to be published by that point in time.If you look at the Japanese publication dates, SMB came out in 1985, Lost Levels came out in 1986, Doki Doki Panic came out in 1987, and SMB3 came out in late 1988. Given the fact the game was finished and released by 1988 I would hardly call that \"late in the NES hardware cycle\". Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn't they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom). There's nothing like the major differences between the Japanese and the Western versions of Zelda II The Adventure of Link.All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).I've read SMB3 took about two to three years to program, meaning Nintendo began work on it possibly by late 1985 (though that does sound entirely too early) but definitely by early 1987 and possibly even late 1986 given it was released in October 1988 and both Doki Doki and Lost Levels would have been finished (in the case of Doki Doki, it would have been closed to being completed if not already completed).In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..I do find it strange that they had problems with Yoshi (which for the record Miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original 1985 SMB). After all, Hudson's Adventure Island series, the same company responsible for the abomination that is Super Mario Bros. Special, the first ever sequel to the Mario franchise, were able to get ridable dinasaurs, and the 1993 Capcom title Little Nemo Dream Master had ridable creatures too.Then again, Adventure Island II came out in April 1991, two and a half years after SMB3.Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.So that's why they didn't develop it for the Super Famicom.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2007"}

The difference here is that this new model is quite a bit smaller than  its older brother, and quite a bit cuter, too.The system is made up of a 32-bit, 34-MHz RISC processor with 16 Mbits of main  memory, 8 Mbits of graphics memory, 24-channel stereo sound, double-speed CD-ROM  drive, and one Dual Shock analog controller.

{"product_name":"B00004W4QJ","description":"Three years ago, gamers were introduced to Aya as she resigned from the  New York Police Department and enlisted as a NMC (neo-mitochondrion creature)  hunter for the shadowy government organization M.I.S.T., a secret agency of  monster slayers somewhere betweenGhostbustersandMen in Black.  Wherever there was a neo-mitochondrion outbreak, Aya and her team were on the  scene to put the boots to the mutants. From the outset, it's evident that  SquareSoft revamped the entire game to give gamers a better looking, sounding,  and (most importantly) playing experience.The game starts with Aya training in the agency's shooting gallery in Los  Angeles. Just as she begins to get in a groove, she is asked to look into some  strange happenings at the Akropolis Tower. When she arrives on the scene, an  explosive, full-motion video flashes across the screen and showcases the death  and carnage as Aya surveys the scene. Her entry into the Tower is where this RPG  begins.SquareSoft has kept some of the excellent elements of the weapons systems from  the firstParasite Evetitle, but went for an entirely new battle system.  Combat is delivered in real time and allows players to run, hide, and open fire.  Aya can tap into her parasitic powers and can unleash elemental, magic-based  attacks on the many foes she encounters. Ammunition is plentiful in the game and  there are plenty of entertaining weapons to choose from. Auto targeting and  involving puzzles are back, though the arrow-pointing interface for solving  these puzzles is really hard to operate.The cinematic mix of story and action is very well done, and the numerous  cutscenes do an excellent job of moving the pace along in a believable way.Even though the originalParasite Evehad its problems, SquareSoft has  pieced together an excellent sequel that will satisfy fans of the first game and  help create many new ones.--Todd MowattPros:New, real-time battle system is an improvement over firstParasite  EveGreat weapons and plentiful ammunitionGreat mix of story and actionCons:Clunky interface for solving puzzles","reviewerName":"\"evilwithin\"","summary":"An improvement over the first title.","reviewText":"It may play like Resident Evil, but PE2 is actually quite original.

It is still an RPG, mind you, even if you can fire whenever you like during battle.

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"engnir1","summary":"great on rails shooter!!!","reviewText":"This game is great!!!

At first I was weary of this game because it was developede by Artari, who really didn't leave much of an impression on me with \"Driver\" [PS1] or the glitch-tastic movie tie-in, \"Enter the Maxtrix.\" I figured they were gonna rush this game like they did with the aforementioned game and it was gonna turn out horribly.I would be left with a bad game I wasted my money on. But to my humble surprise, this game is fantastic. You'll be able to play up to 20 or more characters from the series villains and Hero alike, spanning from Goku Piccolo, the sayains and, Dr. Gero's greatest creation: Cell. The video game menus are done quiet nicely. It looks and feels like something from Japan rather than the US.The game has Practice, Story, and Tournament modes to choose from. The story mode is not at all impressive. They could have just inserted some animated cinematics from the actual DBZ cartoon, instead they give the player poorly animated 3D cut scenes that are somewhat like sequences from the episodes, but not at all as impressive. A lot of work needed to be done in the Animation Department and it was simply overlooked.The Tournament mode is probably the hardest level in the game of all. Your opponents will knock you around like a rag doll, which means your gonna have to spend a lot of time in the practice arena unless you wanna get beat down because of your lack of skill with a character. The A.I. are sheerly brutal [which is a DBZ trademark] when their not being stupid and allowing you to beat the crap out of them.You also need to learn a lot of combos and special moves if you are to survrive either the Tournament or Story mode, because the further you go into the game the harder it gets regardless the short battles.All the characters retain their trademark moves, like Goku's Kamehameha wave and Kaio-ken attack, Piccolo's spical beam cannon, Vegeta's Galick Gun, And Freiza's Death beam. To make a long review short, this game is great for Die-Hard fans of DBZ. However, if your not a fan and dislike DBZ don't bother giving the game a second glance. However, if you are, give this game a chance. You'll enjoy it, just don't expect too much out of it. --- [a 4 out of 5]","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2004"}

I was never really interested in the game until the second one came out.  I then got to reading up on it and found that a lot of people liked the game.  I always thought the darkness powers looked interesting so I finally bought the game for cheap and gave it a spin.After playing it for about 2 hours I just got bored.  The biggest problem I have with the game is that the combat is so slow.  The aiming in the game is just not for me.  When you move the reticule over close to the enemy it automatically sticks to him.  It has to be this way because trying to move the reticule in any direction takes forever.  Its almost like trying to aim a tank.This makes enemy encounters predictable and boring.  All I did was walk look at an enemy and shoot and repeat that until they were all dead.  Not very exciting.  Im more of a fan of running around frantically trying to find cover and flanking the enemy.  That isn't how this game is played.  The main character just moves too slow.I do have to say that for a game that came out awhile ago, alot of its aspects hold up even today,however.The darkness powers ideas are cool and interesting.  The environments are detailed and look very good.  The developers knew how they wanted the game to look and feel and they nailed it.  There were just a lot of details that got put into this game that I don't see very much in games these days.  Still, they didn't make up for boring combat and predictable enemy encounters.If you do enjoy the first person shooters then definitely give this one a shot.  Its cheap enough that its worth it.

You are a mute, essentially nameless and faceless warrior of a particular stripe sent into the Deep Fog or help rescue an imperiled kingdom from the demons that now infest it. While power and glory may be motivation, unless the Fog is repulsed, it will swallow the world.The graphics are very pretty, and flow very well, so you're not caught feeling liked you've switched universes as you change rooms, but the various worlds are eerie, unsettling things that will make your skin crawl at times as you explore torture chambers in a prison filled with armed psychotics, run across ramparts pursued by gigantic dragons, and face 30 foot tall demons with weapons reminiscent of shadow of the colossus. Monster repeat rather lamely at times, but they are varied and well put together.The gameplay in this is virtually realistic. And by realistic, I mean full of mistakes, and utterly without mercy. Four or five blows from a peon can easily kill you, and while you're tougher than the average bear, its hard to fight with weapons in a cramped corridor, meaning your frequently hitting walls and other obstacles rather than your enemy. A lock on feature and fairly good combat mechanics help make up for this, but unfortunately, the sheer brutality of the game will frustrate many, though a shot of reality in the midst of nigh invincible super men is at least a welcome departure, but this makes up for it almost too well.Annoyances that still haven't been fixed despite this effectively being Kings Field VIII abound. There's very little, almost zero, interaction, apart from some yes/no dialogue options. Some items, such as levers, are interactive, though these are not easily or clearly identified, despite items being made glowing orbs of light or a bright shine. Its too easy to get lost, and there's no map. Level 80 monsters can be found next to level 8 ones, meaning there's lots of surprise deaths.Overall though, this game is entertaining, well storied, and contains some nice and almost unique developments. The interactivity and hints dropped by other players are nice, and the Black Phantoms, where you can break into another players game and try to kill them are sweet. The ghosts that crop up periodically are spooky and still manage to be helpful at times. It is very difficult, yes, but so long as you fight smarter and not harder, its only a 7 as opposed to a 9 as many say.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Sam Allen \"A zealous individual\"","summary":"Terrific Game","reviewText":"This was the game I first got with my Gamecube, and it still remains one of the best fighting video games of all time in my book. It takes everything that was in the first and makes it a thousand times more elaborate.The music was all MIDI in the first one, now we have some awesome orchestral compositions that are updates of all sorts of classic Nintendo themes. My personal favorite themes are: Mute City, Big Blue, Fountain of Dreams, Great Bay, the Temple, Fourside, and Venom.The first game only had 12 players (8 at the start and 4 hidden), now there are 25 in all! The original 8 (Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Samus Aran, Yoshi, Kirby, Fox McCloud and Pikachu) are back in the starting lineup, and the previously hidden Ness and Captain Falcon are immediately available as well. 4 new characters join the starters in the form of Bowser, Peach, Zelda (who can transform into her alter ego Sheik), and the rather obscure Eskimo pair known as the Ice Climbers. 11 hidden characters are to be found. In addition to the two returning from the original (Jigglypuff and Luigi), Dr. Mario is in for a routine physical; Falco Lombardi of the Starfox team flies into town; Link goes back seven years in the past as Young Link, and has a run in with his arch enemy, Ganondorf; Roy and Marth of Fire Emblem have joined the party; two more Pokemon have been caught in the form of Mewtwo and Pichu (aka baby Pikachu); and even Nintendo's very first character, a little LCD man known as Mr. Game and Watch, is featured.In the first, there were only 9 arenas, now there are at least 20, and they are far more interactive than they were before. For example: in Brinstar Depths, every 15 or so seconds, let's say, a giant monster named Kraid (Metroid fans remember fighting him) comes in and takes a swipe at the arena, moving it around either counter clockwise or clockwise and changing where you can and can't stand.The single player mode has been significantly updated. In addition to the classic single player mode (which has been somewhat reformulated), there are two new modes: Adventure and All-Star. All-Star mode pits you against random assortments of 1, 2 and 3 characters in 12 matches and ends with a battle against 25 Mr. Game and Watch drones. Adventure mode, on the other hand, is a series of 12 stages that include side-scrolling action as well as fighting. For example: in stage 3, the Underground Maze, there are two parts. Part 1 is the maze itself, which may end up pitting you against Link several times; then, in part 2, you have a fight with Zelda at the Temple.The classic 1 player mode has been formulated somewhat differently as well. There are no set opponents except for Master Hand in the final stage. There are three traditional matchups against a random opponent (like the ones in the first one against Link, Fox, Pikachu and Samus), one matchup against a random Giant opponent with 2 random computer controlled allies (like the Giant DK battle in the first one), one 2-on-2 matchup with a random computer-controlled ally (like the Mario Bros. Battle in the first one), a battle against a metal opponent (like the one against Metal Mario), a battle against a team of 10 of a random character (like the Kirby, Yoshi and Fighting Polygon teams), and Master Hand, plus three bonus stages (Break The Targets, Snag The Trophies and Race To The Finish). Board The Platforms is no more.There are a ton of new multiplayer modes to, which only add to the fun. Want some quick K.O.'s? Then give Super Sudden Death mode a try and have everyone handicapped at 300% damage! Do you like your fights faster? Slower maybe? Lightning and Slo-Mo melees are available. Trying to become a photographer? Then give camera mode a try. Also, a tournament can be held with up to 64 players.There is so much more that I could discuss (trophies, multi-man melee, etc.), but if this hasn't convinced you that this game is worth having, as dated as it may be now that Brawl is out for the Wii, then I'm sorry for you. Trust me, it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2008"}

Then Joel loses something important to him, and the real game starts.It's important to not see this as a traditional &#34;survival game,&#34; where you might have control over your character's image, development, personality, skills, etc. This is a game with an older guy who has seen way too much in his life, and his journey with Ellie. His aim is shaky (it can be improved over time), bullets are very scarce to the point where a major firefight will leave you with nothing but your fists, supplies can be gathered and turned into tools necessary to survive, all of that. Joel isn't a military trained soldier. He is not a mercenary (at the beginning at least). He is a man struggling to live to see the next day.Stealth is the key word to this game. At the early stages, you'll be led around by your friends, and they will tell you to be stealthy. Why? Even taking on two enemies with your pistol will leave you dead or near death. Joel is not invincible, he will die and die fast if you run into a stream of bullets. Sneak around, execute those you can silently, and you can save your supplies for forced encounters.The game takes its time, like you would expect if you were in Joel's shoes. If you want a survival game where you shoot everything, play one of the more recent Fallout games. If you want a great story and more realistic combat where the characters develop, get this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}

Movie-quality cinematic with compelling story that inspires a good controversial discussion. Graphics is top notch, the weapons are solid, and the character movement AI(especially the sidekick/partner) is one step closer to being more human-like.I have played through many action games, and the ones I liked the least always involve battling zombies. I don't know, just not a fan of them. But it's different for this game! It's difficult for me to articulate, but somehow I enjoyed battling the 4 stages of the infected. Maybe is I'm able to control the actions better.The game is linear, which is good as the focus is on playing through and feel part of the story. However there is plenty of freedom to roam and explore the surroundings.The ending sequence with Joel's course of action was unexpected (and therefore inspires a lot of debate).  *SPILER ALERT* However, because the main characters are intact, it's a foregone conclusion that a sequel will follow!This game ranks up there with UnCharted in playability, and in my opinion is unrivaled in playing through a movie-quality story.

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"24 Hours and 47 Minutes Later....","reviewText":"Yep...24 hours and 47 minutes is exactly how long it took me to beat this game. I suppose my title would have been cooler if it were 28 Hours Later, because the story in this game is similar to the movie28 Days Laterin a few ways. From what I hear almost 25 hours is about 8 or 9 hours more than the average player finishes the game, and it's 3 times the amount of time that I've heard some people beating the game in.But I like to search. I like to look everywhere (if it won't get me killed). I get my release day price money's worth! This game rewards you greatly with much needed limited supplies and ammo for doing so. Extensive searching in this game also helps you find collectables that really mean nothing to the gameplay, unless you're going for all the trophies. And speaking of trophies, there are not a lot of those in this game. No easy unmissable trophies for simply completing chapters. Indeed most of the trophies are for finding the collectables and completing the game on various levels, and there are 4 associated with online play. But who cares about trophies? (Me.) On to the game....The game is way up there on one of the best I've ever played. I was a big fan of Telltale's recentThe Walking Deadwhich is very heavy on story and a bit lighter on action and player participation; The Last of Us adds the action and player participation by 100% to a similarly story-rich game. You play (mainly) as a 40ish year old Joel tasked with escorting 14 year old Elle across a country devastated by an infectious fungal disease that has turned humanity into 28 Days Later-like maniacs (runners) that over time mutate into fungus-faced monsters (clickers). But the runners and clickers are only half of your problem. The other half?....you guessed it: humanity.I'm not going to go into a lot more since my review is well beyond 28 Days Later than the release date, and there are already a ton of reviews here that you can look at for more detail if you're not already sold on this game. But I will say this: This is no run and gun game. In fact, sometimes you will wind up dead more often than not by firing a single bullet in some situations. Other times, if you don't use your firepower you will be equally dead. Some parts of this game will seem impossible until you find the right strategy only to realize it was one of the easiest parts in the game. The AI in this game both for and against you is incredible. You will get some much needed help in a few situations, but choose the wrong tactic and the AI will shoot you down...or bite your head off.I absolutely loved this game and all of the true emotion that it is filled with. I cried. I jumped out of my seat. I laughed. I cursed (loudly). I procrastinated due to anxiety when it was time to put the game in my PS3. The Last of Us may be the PS3's Last hoorah, but the experience of this game will Last with me forever.Add The Last of Us to your cart.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2013"}

However, I went into this with an open mind and not expecting much.  What I came away with was a surprisingly good experience.  I really enjoyed Silent Hill 2 and Origins (I also liked the movie), so I guess I'm a fan.  Homecoming actually has a pretty compelling story, nice graphics, and decent mechanics.  It didn't really scare me or creep me out that much, but I found myself really drawn to the story and anxiously awaiting the next tidbit of info to unravel the mystery.  Graphics are very grainy (more so than the usual fog-laden environments).  Character animations and cut scenes are very good.  Spoken dialogue isn't too cheesey.  Controls are pretty good, but there were times when it took forever to line up with a door to get that \"open\" option to pop up.  The score and sound effects definitely served to heighten the tension.  Puzzles aren't too challenging, but they aren't a walk in the park either.  I think if you like survival horror you will find something to like in Homecoming.  It's definitely worth a rental or purchase used.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Craig B. \"Craig B.\"","summary":"Was wanting more...","reviewText":"I can't help but feel disappointed with this game.  I was hoping for something unique, but what I found was another gear based questing/dungeon/PVP game.  SWTOR's biggest new advancement is full voice acting.  That is a cool new feature, for a while.  But, I found it bored pretty quickly.  I still think it's a great new addition to the MMO genre, but it did start to get old.  I truely felt underwhelmed.  This is the only MMO I've played so far that didn't meet my expectations.I suppose what I was looking for was the gear based questing/dungeon/PVP WoW model with some sandbox elements.  My first MMO was Star Wars Galaxies.  You had a huge amount of freedom in that game.  SWTOR is very linear and confining.  There isn't much to do in the game other than quests/dungeons/PVP.  I stumbled into an auditorium, and I was thinking, \"Cool, players can make shows and have weddings here.\".  But, you can't even sit in the chairs.  Why even make an auditorium and not allow players to sit down to enjoy some player created content?There is currently no player housing.  I knew people in SWG that redecorated their houses every few weeks.  It was a big deal to some people.  You could orient items however you liked, and people were so creative.  I remember walking into a house and they had taken boulders and made it look like a cave.  I was blown away.  We use to have block parties, weddings and fashion shows, ext.  We use to have guild wars and could set up turrets to help defend the town.  You could craft in your house, then put them up for auction while still in your house with vendors that you set up.I haven't seen any cosmetic clothing yet.  Maybe I just haven't leveled high enough, but I haven't seen it yet.  For role players, this is kind of a big deal.  Sometimes it was an achievement like getting a full set of stormtrooper armor and a carbine so you could walk around feeling like a stormtrooper.  Even people like me who don't role play enjoy having something different to wear to distinguish you from the crowd.  In WoW, once I got my raid set, that was about it.The character and race selection is horrible.  I didn't find only having four body types to be that big of a deal.  But, I didn't like the hairstyles at all.  And, the little extras like tattoos or horns were all so similar you really couldn't distinguish yourself.  And, all the races were human.  No Wookies, Rodians, ext.  It just feels so confining.So what's the big deal about role playing or sandbox elements?  I worry that the community will become what WoW's community has become.  A bunch of kids or elitist punks.  I've been playing LOTRO the past few months, and I don't think I've heard the word \"noob\" or \"pwned\" once.  It's kind of like the difference between going to a fine dinning restaurant and your local McDonalds.  You don't find a lot of screaming kids in a fine dinning restaurant.  If you want a more mature playerbase, then you have to give them the tools to do other things than obsess on gear and who's 1337.The graphics weren't great, but I was expecting that.  They aren't bad either.  I can't say they were disappointing to me because they were about where I expected them to be.  Not everyone has a maxed out system after all.  I once bought a laptop and couldn't get it to play WoW.  I had to return it and get an upgraded model.  So, I know they were trying to get the maximum amount of people whose systems could handle it.  I can't fault them on that.Ambient sounds are missing from the game.  And I've heard very little of the original soundtrack.  Playing Star Wars Galaxies and hearing the original soundtrack really made me feel like I was in the Star Wars universe, and I was missing that in this game.  I guess I kinda miss the whole timeline from the movies as well.  I miss seeing stormtroopers and AT-AT's and the like.  I just didn't feel immersed in the Star Wars universe that I know and love.  It's someone elses Star Wars universe, not the one I grew up with.Not sure still if I like the group questing in dungeons (flashpoints).  Did one with a person that was lagging pretty bad, and we constantly had to wait for him because you all have to talk to the NPC to get quest dialog at the same time.  It made for a terribly long and boring dungeon.  We could have talked to the NPC and cleared trash while he caught up if we weren't all required to talk at the same time.The space combat is just a mini game.  I think I saw that they may add a more robust space aspect to this game in the future.  Which is fine, Star Wars Galaxies didn't launch with a space feature at all.  But, if it is going to remain as just something to kill time, that would be very disappointing.  Space is a huge part of Star Wars.  If I wanted to play a mini game I would sit down and play a hand of Sabaac with another player...if I could sit down.  I hope this gets addressed soon in a meaningful way.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy questing and dungeons and PVP.  I just want....more.  I am the type of person that tries to complete every quest, even if they are grey.  Most of the things I mentioned like sitting down in chairs, player cities and bases and cosmetic clothing are simply tools and really wouldn't effect the gameplay at all.  And, they still may add them in later.  But, I don't want to be dragged along for years hoping they'll add them, and they never do.  I think I'm going to wait a few months to see what direction they are going in before I put down money on a monthly subscription.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2011"}

Does anyone care? No because the True Crime series had two previous games that were mediocre to poor and there was little hope for this game. Square Enix picked up the project, seeing the potential in the game, and released it as Sleeping Dogs because they did not buy the name from the previous company. What we have here is probably the best GTA clone since Saints Row and that's saying a lot. There have been many GTA clones but very few are any good or do anything different. Sleeping Dogs features a fluid martial arts system, a huge open world, gripping story and characters, and a few side missions.The story is actually very gripping and entertaining. You play as an ex-triad member turned cop named Wei Shen. You are working undercover to bring down the Son On Yee triad gang and bring in their Chairman. Your rival gang is the 18K which is relentlessly making hits on your turf. This isn't just your typical gang war story. You actually get to really like the characters and feel for all of them in different ways. While you ware working for the triad you can do cop missions on the side as well as busting drug deals throughout the city. This story is pretty epic and has a satisfying ending; I never once felt bored or detached from the story.If that isn't enough then the combat system should help bring you in. The combat system is simple, but deep and requires some skill to stay alive. You can counter when enemies turn red, but you must use the attack button and hold button in combination to bring them down. The animations are fluid and you can really feel the punches. This isn't just some wailing and kicking combat system that feels half-baked and broken. Some enemies may have weapons which you can take and use, but they are pretty rare because they do so much damage. If you are doing really well you will go into an adrenaline type state and start to heal while enemies may flee from you. The other half of this combat is the gun play which is really smooth and well designed. The cover system works great because as you leave cover you can go into slow motion and shoot out enemies who might be an immediate threat. This also goes for jumping from ledges. Once you actually start completing missions you will earn Cop, Triad, and Face experience which allows you to upgrade to better moves. Each one can be upgraded to level 10, but I reached this level way before I finished the game so I felt all that experience later on was wasted. There just aren't enough upgrades in the game.Another main feature of the game is a parkour system similar to Assassin's Creed. Chase sequences play out often, but instead of climbing up walls you can climb ledges and jump gaps. The trick here is to hit the sprint button just before each obstacle so you smoothly go over them. Keep fumbling over everything and you will lose your target. This is something that has never really been incorporated into a GTA clone, and Sleeping Dogs nails it perfectly.Of course you can travel around the huge open city of Hong Kong, but there isn't much to do. There are the drug busting side missions, favors, races, and random events, as well as finding hidden boxes for money and clothes. That's about it. I wound up doing all the favors and most drug busting side missions, but didn't care for the others. There are some hacking mini-games thrown in here as well as lock picking, bug planting, and other mini-games which are fun. There's a lot of detail but into the gameplay of Sleeping Dogs, but I just wish I could do more in this huge city.After you finish the main story there's no reason to really go back unless you want to collect all the boxes (which can all be show on your map thankfully), but after you finish this you will probably have had enough. The driving works great, there are lots of different cars, taking taxis is convenient, and there are other things you will be familiar with in this kind of genre, but Sleeping Dogs masters the story, characters, and combat system very well. My biggest complaint is only the lack of side mission variety, and the large about of bugs and glitches in the PC version.The PC versions does gives us some nice DirectX 11 visuals with a free high-resolution texture pack for people who have 1GB video cards or better. There is a huge difference with the game maxed out over the consoles. The anti-aliasing and FXAA make the game look smooth and flawless, plus the ambient occlusion adds a little extra that consoles can't do. The PC version is by far the superior version, and most of the bugs have been ironed out by now since there have been 5 patches released thus far, but the large amount of crashes and bugs were unacceptable at launch.Sleeping Dogs is a beautiful game both in execution and spirit. The game really captures the Chinese culture, atmosphere, and triad feel of Hong Kong. This is a must buy for any fan of the genre, and if you have the high-end PC, make sure to pick that version up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2012"}

Without a doubt this is a five star game, and easily the best game of the last 6 months.  I can't really think of anything negative to say at all (well honestly, I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, so I won't say anything good or bad about that feature), instead I just keep thinking of everything that is awesome about this game.  The story, the visuals/atmosphere (the island you're trapped on is pretty amazing to explore), the gunplay/bow & arrow...in fact, using the bow and arrow to take out enemies is so much fun, it makes you want to ignore the fact that you're also carrying around some actual guns.This game is definitely more action packed (with gunplay, action sequences) than previous Tomb Raider games (which were more heavy on the exploring/puzzle solving), but there is exploring/side quests in this game too (quite a few I've found so far actually).  It pretty much goes without saying that if you're a fan of the Uncharted series, I see no reason why you wouldn't love this game as well.  The big difference here being you can obtain skill and salvage points to upgrade your stats and weapons (something I was worried about at first, for some games make this type of system way too complex - which takes away the flow of the game - but not here, it's very simple and straight forward, which allows you to quickly upgrade and continue on with your exploration/battles - love it!).Basically if you're on the fence about this, just know that this game is worth all the hype and the positive reviews it's been getting.  So far it's been fun, exciting, and a blast to play, and really what more can you ask for in a game?  Just buy and play it, you won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

This sequel takes everything that was great about the first game and enhances it tenfold. The graphics, sound design, gameplay and voice acting are all near-perfect. It's just a shame that there's not much replay value to the game as it's rather easy to finish.The adventure this time focuses on Marco Polo's mysterious voyages in the 13th century and the Tree of Life. Nathan Drake's quest is to stop a Russian warlord from exploiting the tree for his own devious means. The game takes us from Turkey to Borneo to Tibet across a wide variety of levels including museums, jungles, war-torn cities, a mile-long train, the same train dangling from the edge of a cliff, and snow-covered mountains. You'll pick up loads of different weapons along the way and you'll never really run low on ammo so feel free to be as trigger-happy as you like. I do wish that it could have been gorier though. However, creeping up on a bad guy and shoving him off a cliff while watching him plummet into oblivion is very enjoyable.On a second go you'll find it easy to unlock more than half of the trophies available, and playing it a second time is worth it for this alone.

Boy was I missing out on my first playthrough. There is so much to do with side quests its not even funny. This could keep a person busy for quite some time. I am now on my third playthrough and plan on doing every side quest possible this time. The story is just awesome. The gameplay is ok, there are a few things I dont like such as the radial menu and the limited hot keys you get to do spells and such. Also the NPC's dont always do as you have them set up to do. I also think the leveling system lacks. You only get 3 points to spend per level up, I think you should get more, or be able to level up quicker considering you cant really \"level grind\" like you can in other RPG's. I think the graphics are very well done and the voice acting is superb. There have been a few times where the game would freeze or the dialog would keep going but there would be no audio, but nothing to frequent to distract me. Overall this game is pure greatness in my opinion. I have waited for a good in depth RPG for PS3 and I have found it in this game. I hope to see more DLC and can not wait until the Awakening expansion comes out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"Review - Dragon Age Origins","reviewText":"I got this game a few months ago and I have played through it (i'm almost finished with it).  This game is actually one of my favorites.  The game is basically a cross between D&D;, Final Fantasy and Fallout.  You can choose from between a bunch of different races including Human, Elf or Dwarf as well as from different classes including soldier, mage, assassin ect, each race/class bestowing defferent bonuses and abilities.  I started as an Elf Mage, but I have also played as a human soldier and I must say that the Mage is the most fun and the most complicated class to play as.The graphics for the game are ok, they are nothing brilliant like FF13 or something like that, i'd say they are mediocre, and the music is definately pretty sucky.  For veteran RPG players you should definately crank the difficulty becuase the same is overly easy, so for a challenge a veteren RPGer will definatly need to play on hard or nightmare mode.  The storyline to the game is not bad, at least for the mage and the soldier.  While the game definately does have its short comings I definately find it highly addictive and truthfully, I really have alot of trouble putting it down, which is why I gave it 5 stars.  The game is alot of fun and it definately keeps you busy.  If you are only looking to do the main quests you will probably be done in less that 10 hours, but if you are going to do all or as many of the side quests possible, it will definatly take you a much longer time.  Also it should be noted that in easy mode, powers such as storm that cast a lightning based attack over a massive part of the battle field do not harm your team with friendly fire, bu tin hard mode it will, and man do these spells to massive amounts of damage.  Also it should be noted that most of the enemies are not overly difficult, and can be beaten quickly with teh right srategy, the only exception to this is when you are forced to fight an evil versionof your own team (that is not fun) or when you have to fight dragons (they will destroy your team really fast, but their skin makes awesome flame resistant armor so its worth batteling them)One of the other things I enjoy about this game is the quasi-morality system incorporated.  You get certain dialogue choices to choose from and much like Skyrim and Fallout your team and your surroundings will act accordingly.  I definatly liked this touch to the game, and I like that some of your actions can alienate your own team and make them all abandon you, which i svery bad for you if it happens at the wrong time.  Additionally, you can use your skills to make traps and potions as well as use different types of powers (my favorite is the Blood mage).I really enjoy using the mage as you get a huge range of powers and abilities.  You can use your mage to cast spells to harden your team, or to soften the enemy.  Additionally you have a ton of powers to chose from including lightning based, fire, ice or spiritual offensive powers.  As a mage you can also develop as a shapeshifter in which you can change into different animals or an evil blood mage in which you sap the health of your team but at the same time your powers and abilities increase 10 fold.  In the spirit of any great RPG you have a ton of weapons to choose from, from swords, maces, axes, bows and arrows ect, however each type requires different strengths or abilities.  As a mage you can also arm with differnt staffs to increase  your powers as well as to increase your resistance to enemie's abilities.If you are looking for a brilliant cinimatic experiance like FF or Skyrim, I would have to say you wont find it with this game, but if you are looking for a fun addictive 3rd person RPG you will have plenty of fun with this one.  If you play as a soldier the game gets old and repetitive very quickly, but if you play as a mage, you have tons of spells and abilities to learn and that keeps you wanting more.I recommend this game, as I enjoy it alot, but I caution it is not for everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2012"}

I rented it and have a little bit of withdraw after a returning it.  I can't say I'd be happy owning it though.  I'll compare it to Fallout 3, since one of the developers mentioned that it's like Fallout 3 but with more action.1.  The say the game has a lot of weapons.  True, but most of the time it's just a little tweek to the particular weapon.  During my time where I made it to New Haven, the weapons fuction pretty much the same with a slight tweek on it's color, effectivenes and effect.  Fallout 3 at least can say it had a lot of different types of weapons.  Fallout didn't just have similar weapons thats in Borderlands, but they had a weapon that shot out anything you can get, they had a rifle gun, lazers etc.2.  They said that its more action than Fallout 3.  Well, yeah.  Fallout 3 had a lot of loading and after the DLC, those loading screens were longer than the cut-scenes.  Borderlands basically has huge maps for you to work on without loading, unless your traveling to that seperated maps like Headstone Mine and New Haven.  Their were loading screens that were long, but you hardly have to deal with them unless you want to progress into the story.The problem was that their was too much action were it became redundant and repetitive.  Here is an example:I was sent to a mining town where I had to take down a boss.  Upon entering, I was confronted by enemies.  Mine you that the map of this location is huge.  So I basically had to press through each part of the map by taking down bandits and other enemies slowly.  Each section was a battle.  Finally I manage to get to the boss and defeated Sledge.  Now it was time to go back to the exit and then to location to collect my reward.  Now here is the problem, all of the enemies that slowed me down have regenerated with full health.  I was pretty much out of ammo and I wasn't going to run back to the boss area to buy some more of it.  Especially since I wasted most of the money purchasing upgrades.  I don't mine enemies spawning, but the game should give you a good amount of time for you prepare in dealing with their enemies.  I fought all of them.  The least they can do is let me have a safer way of going back to the previous map to collect my bounty.  SPAWNING ENEMIES ALL THE TIME SUCKS!  I bet them in this map, in this mission, so please savor my victories.The driving SUCKS!  I hate the driving.What is better on this game than Fallout 3:1.  FPS.2.  Works.3.

{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"newfound32","summary":"The origin, of the madness","reviewText":"Golden eye, games that are coming out now owe their controls to golden eye.

{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A masterpiece, plain and simple","reviewText":"For some people, there hasn't been a \"proper\" Zelda title since Majora's Mask. While Wind Waker was indeed an incredibly solid title, a ridiculous amount of people wrote it off and probably never played it because of the graphical style. With people longing for a more \"Ocarina of Time\"-like feel have got their wish with Twilight Princess. Utilizing the Wii's remote-sensing technology, this is probably the most different Zelda you've played yet the most familiar. Time will tell whether this'll eclipse Ocarina but it's sure exceptional so far anyway.Story: In probably the most melancholy and darkest entry so far, Link starts out as a citizen of Ordon Village who's tasked to deliver something to Hyrule Castle. However, he's attacked and children are kidnapped. Trying to save them, he gets thrown into an unusual world known as the \"Twilight world\", with strange enemies and a foreboding atmosphere. Worse is that Link transforms into a wolf whenever he's there but at least he has help with Midna, a strange character who bosses him around. Putting Hyrule back to normal and beating those responsible is one of many things you'll have to look forward to.Graphics: When I first played the game, it was in 480i and even then I thought the graphics looked great. But upgrading to 480p is a huge improvement as lighting is more fantastic and bright, water and streams are more lifelike and areas such as Zora's River and especially the Springs where spirits are found just look gorgeous. Sure it doesn't look as next-gen as others but you have to admit, these graphics are a pleasure to look at and I never get sick of em.Sound/Music: Some sound effects actually come from the controller's speaker such as Midna laughs, sword sheathing or that familiar puzzle ringing when you solve something. The music is very good with plenty of beautiful themes and big epic splendors but while it would've been nice if it was orchestrated, this'll do. As usual with Zelda, there's no voice acting to speak of save for yells or character making groaning or happy noises.Gameplay: The nunchuk controls Link, Z-button is for targeting, C is camera and if you swing the controller, Link does a spin move. As for the remote, the D-Pad acts as a item setter where you can assign an item to one of the directions (except Up, as that's your Midna guide) and it'll assign that item to B. Swinging the remote will make Link slash. Only problem with both is that doing the spin gets irritating since it might not happen when you need it to (a horse battle early on was frustrating as hell because of this). But I don't think I'd go back to manual aiming with an analog stick after the immensely accurate remote aiming. A target will appear on screen should you use, say a bow and arrow and I've found I was deadly accurate, picking off enemies that weren't even remotely near me.As for the wolf part, it's actually not as cumbersome as I thought it would be. Basic controls are the same except A is for attacking. Instead of items, Link turns on a \"sense\" which can locate either ghosts, parasite bugs and others. Also in sense mode are dig spots where Link can dig up hearts, rupees or locate secret entrances. As for faults, aside from the aforementioned spin attack, the game is not really difficult but this is no cakewalk in the park either. If enemies don't give you pains, the dungeons and puzzles will which might range from frustrating to smack-in-the-head obvious.Most of the Wii games I've noticed are either novelty games where it's just about using the controllers in weird ways such as Cooking Mama or just simply ports with Wii controls (which almost always seem awkward), games such as Twilight Princess are for hardcore gamers that want a long and involving quest to spend nights trying to master.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0017ZDGWG","reviewerName":"F. Jury \"dsunglasses\"","summary":"About what I expected","reviewText":"I'm not a real fan of Mortal Kombat, or of fighting games in general. This ones takes a nice twist though. The inclusion of the DC characters was a good idea. There are two story modes, one for the DC universe and one for MK universe. The animation and graphics are good, as is the voice acting. At the successful completion of each story mode you unlock a new character, though neither one is very good. The story itself is mediocre, but honestly I'm not sure what else they could have done that would have even remotely made sense.The game definitely scaled back on violence and gore. There is a little blood and uniform ripping, but overall, the violence is muted (compared to some previous versions) and the fatalities are mostly lame.The arcade mode is same old, same old. You can continue unlimited times both in arcade and story mode, making the game fairly easy to beat. You can also change your character as you go through arcade mode. You unlock an ending for whatever character you're using when you beat the final boss. Unfortunately these endings only consist of a picture and about 15 seconds of spoken words. Many of them are not very good or are just confusing. Longer endings with some animation would have been much better.The MK games including this one still have numerous problems. The arcade system is getting really old school and needs to improved.  This game like all MK games favors button mashing. There are a number of cool, moves but like always they are tricky to learn and difficult to execute when fighting, and why do them when you can just do what I call \"old same moves\" and dispatch your foe just as easy. I realize there are limitations with the controller, but really stop making complex moves and fatalities so difficult that most people cannot execute them.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2009"}

Warren \"gamer\"","summary":"A review from somebody who actually owns a Gameboy Micro","reviewText":"(On a side note, I own the 20th anniversary edition, which is alot more sleeker than this one.  But since on the whole, they are the same great quality, most people will read this one, and I want to help people, so I think it's best that I review the one that most people will look at when finding.  But I definitly thought the special edition one was a whole lot sweeter).I have read a lot of complains about the Gameboy Micro.  I though that this one was a lot better than the GBA SP.  HEre's why this is my favorite GBA so far.Both GBA's were great.  While the original GBA had a bad lighting system, the system looked cool, had a decent map of buttons and was easy to hold.  THe SP was a redifine in the history of portables, offering such innovation as a recharable battery and clamshell design.  the SP however, was missing some things:  The design wasn't very cool looking, basically because of the generic colors and it just looked like a cheap toy.  The SP had terrible shoulder buttons.  And the lack of a headphone jack stung.  Basically because some GBA games have great music, so you can't listen to it or plug it into a speaker (the speakers that came with my computer plug into anything with a headphone jack, and they rock).  The SP was also pretty clunky.  I thought the design was pretty bad.  It just dosen't appeal to somebody who actually dosen't want people to look at you funny because you have a portable game console (when I bring my  PSP, people occasionaly stop and admire it, especially if I am playing one of Lumines slick skins).After researching, I decided to sell my SP (not to a game store, to a friend, and we were way more happy than we were if I had of sold it to Gamestop), and I went out and bought the GBA Micro.  This thing is a lot better than the SP in so many ways, it really made me happy.  It's really slick, and it felt really cool when I first took it out of the box.  But enough of that.  One thing to just tell you, it's really cool looking.However though, it dosen't mean jack if the system look cool, what you are probally reading for anyway.  The system has a headphone jack, and has a decent amount of battery life. There is five levels of screen brightness, and the GBA micro, unlike the PSP's screen, is very clear when you are out side (although be careful, sunlight can really damage the screen and take away screen life).  The Micro is not as rugged as the SP, but you sh ould not own one anyway if you do not take care of it.  The screen itself does not get scratched if you leave it in the pouch it comes with.  That's exactly what I did, and I do not have any noticeable scratches on my micro.  The Micro does not come with a handstrap, so you will have to buy that seperate if you want one.  The controls feel very good.  The Micro may seem like the buttons are smaller, but in reality, they are far more comforable and the same size or bigger than the buttons on the SP.  THe shoulder buttons are about three times as longer as the ones on the SP.  The Micro in my opinion, is much better designed.The only problems are minor.  THe thing that kind of hyped was the fact that I heard the MIcro takes SD memory cards (for viewing pictures).  Then I found out you have to have a play-yan adaptor, and  you can only find that in Japan.  Bummer.  The screen size is a concern for older gamers, so if you have trouble seeing small screens, than this is a portable you should skip.  The other thing is that, yes, the Micro does not play any other games other than GBA.  But I don't really miss playing those old Pokemon games anyway, so I don't care about that anymore.But other than that, this thing is the coolest GBA yet.  It's the smallest system for sure, and it flat out rocks.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2007"}

With games like Wario Ware: Smooth Moves and The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (both of which take great advantage of the Wii Remote), this game comes off as too simple and just not as innovative as Nintendo boasts.Like it's cousin, Wii Sports, Wii Play is nothing more than a small demo of the Wiii's capability.  Shooting Range is an ok game with an amusing allusion to Duck Hunt (kinda wish it WAS an updated Duck Hunt), but it's too short.  Billiards is way too clumsy and tedious.  The ping-pong game is just horrendous!  Stick with Wii Sports: Tennis.  Pose Mii is completely ridiculous.  The only good games are Laser Hockey and Tanks.  Those are the only two I can see myself playing over and over.  Also, the graphics on this game aren't bad.The only saving grace of this package is the bundled Wii Remote.  Since they're still hard to find, it's comforting to know that at least you get a game.  I have to remind myself that I'm really paying $10 and not $50 for Wii Play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2007"}

Due to the great reviews I went ahead and got it, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I would compare this game to a blend of Max Payne and Splinter Cell. The visuals are absolutely stunning, almost on par with Far Cry 3. The stealth gameplay offers some freedom, although not &#34;sand-box&#34; in terms of depth, and allows you make some limited choices as to how you want to tackle each level. Being a stealth-heavy game, generally your chances of success is higher if you go stealth instead of all-out aggression. The plot is somewhat interesting although not the best, but just good enough to keep things moving forward.In terms of content, there isn't a ton of variety. There is no competitve multiplayer, which isn't really my thing anyway. You can create custom challenges (kind of like puzzles) and share them with your friends (called 'Contracts').All in all, I had a great time with this game, and highly recommend it to stealth action fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2013"}
