So if you are a gamer, you know is worth checking out at least.Now, if you are a parent or someone thinking of buying this game for someone under 18 be warned. This game has some content that is very graphic. It looks colorful and suitable for all ages in trailers and videos, but it has some very graphic violence and nudity.If you're thinking of getting it for yourself, then its good, but seriously lacks in replayability.

{"product_name":"B00886WO7A","description":"","reviewerName":"Louie the Italian Jew \"Lou da Joo\"","summary":"kind of like a nice low budget B movie","reviewText":"I really enjoy this game, but not so much the settings. I was expecting more of a beautiful Far Cry 3 type of atmosphere when I pre-ordered this game. I'm 20 plus hours in, and most of the game has been in the jungle, in dark tunnels and in the swamp.The wheel of weapons: You'll be able to equip yourself with a few different weapons, and fix them and upgrade them when needed at a designated workbench.Upgrading- This is an RPG and is all about having fun by challenging opponents that you know you can beat, and run away from enemies (with consequences though) when you know you're going to lose. If you lose, you lose cash, and are respawned at the exact location where you died, and the damage still says intact from your previous life.Respawns for me:  The respawn points for the most part put me in an advantageous position from where I died. Only one time, did I respawn not knowing where I was (after dying in the abandoned movie theater). I restarted the game, and I was put back in the theater.Glitches, but helpful glitches: Sometimes, you can go back to where you came from and the loot is all there for the taking, so you can take more, repair and upgrade your weapons. Helpful cheats can be helpful.Let me be clear though, this is not a bad 2 star or 1 star game. The game is fun, but the graphics (screen tear, characters not moving their mouths at the correct time during cut scenes) are not up to par with the top titles.I've never played the first one, but am having a good time with Riptide. I just feel the swamp is not a place I really want to be. Far Cry 3 took me away to a dreamy land I actually dreamt of. This is sort of like a second rate Far Cry 3 with more depressing settings, or a Dead Rising 2 without the cool mall. In this game, it felt more like the after-effects of a hurricane, and your mission was searching for supplies. Getting one supply though usually took completing many tasks which never seemed to be enough. Nobody cared about helping you which really added to the tension. This game seemed different from the advertisement on Amazon's page with the man and woman setting fire to the trailer with the romantic music playing in the background. Personally, I wanted that game. It's my fault for not reading into the title \"Riptide\" which meant a giant tide came in and ripped the island apart. That being said, this RPG is fun, and a solid purchase, but I have a feeling I would have liked the first one more.In conclusion, although I haven't finished the game, I feel like being in the city of Henderson makes me feel like I've accomplished something. It's a beautiful town filled with zombies. Escaping the jungle was a big accomplishment. This game is fun, and I expect this series to be a classic one day. Finally, I predict that if a PS4 budget version is developed, this will be one of the PS4's best selling launch titles.Update: Just finished the game. I used the Fast Travel method to return to the jungle. Once in the jungle, I had a difficult time finding the Fast Travel method by the tunnels. It really doesn't stand out, so I went back in those miserable tunnels looking for the transition point. I FINALLY got out, and was frustrated. The bulletin board that has the Fast Travel method on it isn't very obvious to find. Anyway, I Fast Traveled back to my missions and finished the game. There was a lot of ammo and firepower, so it was a fun change from the slashing and throwing sickles and knives. Still find it to be a four star game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2013"}

With multiple endings, three styles of combat (party, army, and one-on-one battles), and the ability to recruit from over 100 characters throughout your quest,Suikoden IIIraises the bar for RPGs everywhere. Also new to both the series and the RPG genre is the Trinity Sight System, which enables players to experience events from the viewpoints of three different characters.","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Not as good as the original, yet satisfying","reviewText":"Suikoden was my favorite game of all time, Suikoden 2 was also a masterpiece, and lived up to the original. Suikoden 2 however, took me a bit to realize how great it was. After playing this game, I soon realized that Suikoden 2 lives up to number one extremely well, and this game doesn't.3d graphics seem weird at first, I really liked the 2d sprites better, they rocked. The 3d looks fine though, I mean it feels alright after a while, and I do enjoy the character detail. I thought there would be the same models for 108 charactes;however, every character looks different, and actually has their weapon sheathed on them when they walk around. When they attack, they take it out. I love how they made the models seem fluid, and look like their 2d portraits.The runes are alright. Ruins can now hit your party. If you aim the fire ruin wrong, it can destroy everyone, I dislike this idea greatly, mostly because sometimes my party walks into the rune by themselves. The new runes are fine also. True fire rune, true water rune and so on.Battles are alright. Much like the first 2 games, except characters can move around, which only really effects runes, and now you can like double team some guys, which looks cool. There are still uniting attacks, where character combinations do killer moves, which is always fun and nice to use.Main character? No, not this time. There is the flame champion, in which you customize his name, and he doesn't play that big of a role. There is that dude, the castle guy, I played his mission once and was bored. Then there are Hugo, Geddoe, and Chris. These 3 are the main characters. Their chapters all occur at the same time, yet you can see different perspectives and such. I loved hugo's missions. Geddoes's were longer, but fun, and Chris had some boring characters backing her, but fun missions none the less. Basically there is a war or something? Big war, and the flame champion is alive, and what is going on. It really doesn't matter.The world map, now, if you want to get across, you need to go through the plains and towns. I haven't gotten the blinking mirror yet, but im not even sure there is one. I really despise walking across the plains every time I need to go to a town, but I get use to it.My opinion of the game? Not as good as 1 or 2, which had great fights, nice battles, terrific storys, extremely well done sprites, creative characters, dramatic stuff, and the occasional laugh or two. This game can't live up to the previous ones, but it is a fun game to just fight and slash monsters apart.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2003"}

Bakehorn","summary":"Mario Kart DS is easily the best in series","reviewText":"I had my doubts about Mario Kart DS in the early stages of its development. Mario Kart: Double Dash (Gamecube) was never one of my favorite games, and I was hoping that Nintendo would stick to the roots with their DS edition of the high-selling, fan-favorite racing game. With Mario Kart DS, they've done just that.It seems that the developers took everything great from Super Mario Kart (SNES), Mario Kart 64 (N64), Mario Kart Super Circuit (GBA), and Mario Kart: Double Dash (GC) and put all of those elements into a single Mario Kart game. When you consider how wonderful all of these games have been and how much fun they still are today, that's quite an achievement. Mario Kart DS features some of the same gameplay modes that fans have seen for years: Grand Prix, Time Trial, and Battle. They're the same as always, with three ranks of difficulty in Grand Prix and several different battle modes in Battle.Nintendo didn't stop with the classic game modes. In fact, they added another interesting mode called \"Challenge\" in which you pick up certain numbers of coins or do a set number of power slides in a lap under a certain amount of time. These challenges can be excruciatingly difficult but they make you a much more weathered Mario Kart player and therefore are a great addition to the game. Also, Multiplayer has come in the form of Nintendo's first WiFi-enabled online multiplayer DS game. The races in WiFi multiplayer are relatively simple but it's a great addition to the game nonetheless.On the track itself, the controls are easy but don't utilize the DS very much--driving is done with the directional pad, acceleration and braking are done with the A and B buttons, power sliding is done with the R trigger, and item usage comes from the L trigger. This simple system goes alongside several classic items and three new ones. The Bullet Bill thrusts you forward knocking anyone in your path off of the track. The Bob-Omb explodes, causing anything in its blast radius to spin out and slow down considerably. Last of all, the Blooper spits ink on every other racer's screen, making steering very difficult due to limited visibility.Visually Mario Kart DS stands out as one of the best-looking Nintendo DS games to date. It faithfully recreates some of the classic 3D tracks from Mario Kart 64 and Double Dash (like the ghost house level from MK64 and Luigi's Circuit from MKDD) while also bringing SNES and GBA tracks to life in 3D. Of course, there have also been sixteen new tracks added to the mix, making a grand total of 32 different tracks that all look unique but beautifully show off the wacky Nintendo universe. The music from all of the classic tracks return as well (even the GBA tracks) and the new beats are as catchy as the old ones. Sound bytes, like the different celebrations and yelps of pain when a character is hit with a shell, sound just like they always have.Mario Kart DS is the essential Nintendo DS game. If you've almost given up on the DS, than you clearly haven't played Mario Kart DS and for that reason you're missing out. MKDS is being sold for $35, and if you see it how I do, that's $1.09 per race track and you could easily get more than a few dozen hours of enjoyment out of this before you want to play something else. Is Mario Kart DS worth it? I'd say so.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2005"}

I saw video reviews of it for a while and screenshots and trailers. They got me pretty excited but the fact was that at the time this came out for 60 dollars and already there was talk about problems with graphics and such put me off and allowed me to wait before buying it.When I got it I realized man this is a fun game even though there are problematic graphical bugs and just regular bugs. The story is okay maybe even good with some problems with it near the end of the game (I will get a bit more into it later). When you first get some guns and a vehicle and start exploring the &#34;wastelands&#34; you will probably start to really enjoy this game. Its a first person shooter game (FPS for short) that has many different and interesting weapons. Although its not as open of a world as I would like its pretty darn close.You play as a mute character like most games these days and you don't really care to much for his story cause there really isn't one but that isn't bad. You get vehicles which you can upgrade later on in the game and get new vehicles but unfortunately its only a few vehicles at most. The guns and gadgets you get are pretty cool and make the game a lot more fun. Once you get the ability to craft turrets that are either on the ground stationary or actually move (like a spider!) and shoot at enemies you can't help but find it fun.The enemies are a lot better then other games at the time. When you shoot them in the leg or something they actually react to that. Such as limping or jumping or crawling towards you. They even try to avoid your shots by jumping off of walls or grabbing onto the ceiling and such to avoid getting hit. It makes it much more challenging. You also get the heavy class of enemies that have bigger weapons or much more difficult to take down. You also get the ability to loot dead bodies when playing missions to allow you to buy items and materials to make the game more fun so there is also that.A lot of the time your tasked with going to ruins and such to get a specific item or such and have to watch out for bandits and all that. Unfortunately a lot of the levels are recycled so that you basically go through them again but in reverse. Such as going in through the exit you made before and leaving through a somewhat new entrance near where you entered the first time. It isn't a game breaker but iv heard a few players complain about that. I still enjoyed it even though some of those levels I already knew from playing through them once.You do drive at times from mission to mission so there is that but its not really a difficult drive. The racing missions are scattered around and you only apparently have to do like 2-3 at most in order to progress through the story so your not forced to do a bunch but you can if you want. Some of them are fun cause its kinda like mario kart in a way where you can destroy the other vehicle with weapons. Luckily there is no rubber band effect (if you play racing games you probably already know what this is if not look it up on google such as &#34;rubber band effect racing games) so you can end up winning the race by a landslide at times.Unfortunately you don't really meet to many memorable characters and most characters you meet you only talk to a few times for a little bit before never having to talk to them again.At one point near the middle of the game you do fight this really big.. um &#34;enemy&#34; (again not going to spoil it for those who don't want to know just yet) and well its not the best fighting spot iv played but its still pretty fun.The end of the game though is a huge disappoint. You can almost tell that they rushed the game or were busy working on another game at the time *cough* Doom 4 *cough* which really made this game not as good as it could have been. When the ending was coming up I was thinking &#34;no it can't be done yet.. they really aren't going to end it this soon&#34; I could almost tell it was ending around then. It was kinda like &#34;here is the big gun now go kill bla bla and help save us all&#34; type of scenario.What really got me annoyed was near the end of the game you are walking around and you might catch this old guy talking to this other guy talking about a &#34;monster&#34; that was &#34;at least 60 feet tall&#34; and then when you get close and try to ask them about it they just shut their lips and tell you not to ask about it or something. Then after the game and started seeing the credits it hit me that they must have been working and planning out a lot more to happen but then either lost the funding, ran out of time, or were ordered to rush the ending and get the game out as soon as possible. You will be able to see this if you play the game and make it to the credits.The ending level was strange and felt out of place. You drive to this area and are told to take out this enemy to basically save the people or something and you get this very strange level that looks nothing like the rest of the game and go up against these enhanced &#34;enemies&#34; that you never fought at all before with a special gun that what iv heard most players saved and didn't use much because they though they needed it for a final boss fight and then were disappointed by a cut scene. I even heard about players rebooting the last save and playing through it again just incase they might have missed something or that there was a bug and caused them to miss the last boss fight that it clearly felt you were going to have.Ontop of all that after the cutscene and the end credits they don't allow you to go back and explore the outskirts and finish up any side missions you might have had. You basically have to start the game all over again. For those who didn't get the anarchy edition (or special edition) that has a few DLC stuff. Such as a different costume that gives you 5-10% off of stuff in shops and the double barrel shot gun I will tell you this. Your not really missing out on anything. I think it was just a ploy to get a few extra dollars out of you for a few stuff that really wasn't that great. I never tried the extra sewer missions except 1 because I heard it was just an area you go through and shoot a few waves of enemies and get an item at the end over and over again through all of them. The one I played through was basically the same as what I had heard so unless you want to waste ammo and shoot more enemies then your not missing out on much.Recently a month ago or so Bethesda released a DLC that kinda fixed the problem with not being able to go back to the outskirts after the final mission and added a bit more to the game. Unfortunately though it was a long wait for people who bought the game a year before and played through it already. And it wasn't even free it will cost you like 5-10 dollars to get it for something that fixes the game. I had just finished the game around the time they announced this and I know most players who had bought and beaten the game a year before were like &#34;DLC that's a year late on a game I played a year ago is a little to late&#34; so it is nice they finally release a bit extra stuff to the game but like most players felt it was a bit to late.Conclusion:I might sound a bit hard on this game near the end of this review but I really did find it to be a fun game. I heard they are making a sequel to it so I hope the sequel will be a lot longer and have a lot of the problems ironed out but since they kinda focused more on Doom 4 when they were making this I am unsure how it will work out. The ending of the game was pretty weak and bad but I think they made it in a way so that they can make a sequel to it.I would say if you are interested in this game get it. Right now for PC its not to expensive and even though there are some graphical problems at times its still a fun FPS game. If they do come out with Rage 2 I will be pretty interested in getting it but I will probably wait like I did with this one for the game to go down in price unless im quite sure they did a better job on it then this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2013"}

Immerse yourself in the glorious chaos of all-out war, found only in Battlefield.","reviewerName":"T. Frye","summary":"Still worth getting on current-gen.","reviewText":"First off, let's get this out of the way -- Battlefield 4 is still a fantastic game for PS3 and Xbox 360. If you are getting a PS4 or an Xbox One, it is worth waiting so you can get better graphics and 64-player online combat (as opposed to 24 on the current-gen consoles). However, if you are not getting a next-gen console at launch, and would prefer to wait until you buy one (like me), then Battlefield 4 is still a must-buy, regardless of the player count.Other people reviewing this game often skip over the campaign altogether, insisting that Battlefield has always been an online focused experience. While I definitely agree, I feel that the entire product needs to be taken into account. With that said, I played through the entirety of Battlefield 4's campaign. But how good is it?CAMPAIGNThe story of Battlefield 4 is pretty good. Without giving too much away, I found myself caring for the characters. DICE has done a MUCH  better job with character development here than they did with Battlefield 3. While the overall plot isn't amazing, the voice-acting is superb throughout, and I felt constantly connected with the characters. I was genuinely surprised at the effort DICE put into the story and characters. However, I felt that the endings, no matter which one you chose (yes, there are multiple endings), were a bit sudden, and didn't have enough emotional weight to them. However, everything else story-wise is great, so it doesn't matter too much.On the gameplay side, many people have complained that the game is too linear. I disagree. One of my biggest complaints with Battlefield 3's campaign was that there was absolutely NO freedom to play how you wanted. In Battlefield 4, you can choose how exactly you want to clear the room full of enemies. There are no people with \"follow\" markers above their heads. While you don't have complete freedom in every part of the campaign, there are numerous opportunities for stealth, sniping, close-quarters assaults, and more. For example, I ran into a hangar, with at least 20 enemies. When I played it the first time, I tried to be stealthy. I took out four enemies from behind with my knife before I was discovered. I then began killing as many as I could with my SCAR-H, before I was taken out by a sniper. Next time, I went to a weapon crate (crates where you can choose between weapons you have either picked up or unlocked through playing single-player), picked out a .50 cal sniper rifle, and began picking the enemies off one by one from a vantage point. After killing as many as I could, I ran downstairs and mopped up the rest with my assault rifle.There are some light squad mechanics as well. Press R2 while aiming at a group of enemies, and they will be designated for the squad to kill. While designating a squad of enemies for your squad to kill, while you kill the others, can be cool, it's not a very deep system. It is almost easier to just kill all the enemies yourself, and save your squad the trouble. However, this isn't as much an issue as it is an unnecessary mechanic.The campaign is not very long, taking the average player 5-6 hours to complete. A veteran can probably beat the game in even less time. However, unlike in Battlefield 3, where there was no reason to replay the campaign at all, Battlefield 4's campaign has more replay value. In every mission there are bronze, silver, and gold ribbons to earn for earning a certain amount of experience in the mission. However, in my first playthrough of the campaign, I managed to earn gold ribbons on every mission without really trying. But there are still many trophies to earn (if you care anything about that) and collectibles. Since the campaign is so fun to play, it is worth playing more than once, not only for the thrill, but for choosing a different ending, and to marvel at the awesome set-piece moments once more.MULTIPLAYERBefore stating my opinion on the multiplayer in Battlefield 4, note that I am playing on a PS3, and not a PC. This means that this review is based on the 24 player multiplayer experience, as opposed to the 64 player online experience available on PC, PS4, and Xbox One. If you have purchased the game on PC, refer to that version for a more accurate review.Where do I even start? Battlefield 4 multiplayer is the same fun and addictive online experience that was available in Battlefield 3, but with more maps, weapons, modes, and the all-new Levolution system that allows for a lot of \"HOLY S#@%!!\" moments.Yes, this game is awesome.If you were a big fan of Battlefield 3 like I was, then everything will seem familiar to you in your first match of Battlefield 4. My first game was a game of Conquest on Flood Zone. Everything, from the gunplay and the classes seemed familiar. I was in the middle of an intense battle for a flag, when I looked down the street, and saw the water level rising. Since I was on a rooftop, all of the enemies were stuck swimming in the water from the flood. Me and my teammates were able to kill them and take the flag for our team. With moments like these, players have the opportunity to drastically change the level. Whether you're watching a skyscraper collapse in Siege of Shanghai, or a massive ship ram into the shore in Paracel Storm, the new Levolution mechanic can often make matches unpredictable and exciting to play.There are two new modes available in Battlefield 4 -- Obliteration and Defuse. In Obliteration, two teams battle over a bomb. This bomb must be armed at one of the enemies three bases, resulting in a massive explosion. Each team has to blow up all three bases to win. This mode is easily one of the most action-packed game modes in the game. Matches often have all 24 players battling over the bomb at once, which results in absolute chaos. Once the bomb carrier picks up the bomb, everyone on the pother team can see exactly where he is at all times, which can result in quite the adrenaline rush if you are carrying the bomb.The other mode is Defuse. If you have played Counter-Strike's Demolition mode, or Call of Duty's Search and Destroy mode, then you will be familiar with Defuse. It is a 5 vs. 5, close-quarters game where death is permanent -- no respawning. The attacking team must either destroy one of two of the enemies bomb sites, or kill off the enemy team. While this mode can be fun every once in a while, I didn't quite get the Battlefield vibe that I get when I play the other modes. However, fans of a mode where skill is paramount to success should thoroughly enjoy it.I do have one problem with the multiplayer, however. Rush on a few of the maps in particular can make one team slightly overpowered, making it very hard to defend or attack the objectives. For example, in Operation Locker, my team easily armed the two objectives at the first base. However, when we moved up to the next base, we discovered that the only way to get to the bomb sites is to force our way through heavily defended chokepoints. Attacking teams rarely make it past this base, and if they do, it only happens 1 out of 5 times, making Rush games on this map very short. However, besides that, there isn't anything else wrong with the game.Graphically, the game looks fantastic. While many players have been complaining about them, I can't really see much of a problem. While there is an obvious dip in quality between PC and PS3, the only way you would notice is if you played the two versions side-by-side. In my opinion, the graphics are still great on current-gen consoles.Battlefield 4 is a consistently entertaining experience. The campaign is a fantastic diversion from the multiplayer, and the multiplayer is consistently fun and addictive, with an endless supply of unlocks to earn for each of the classes, resulting in nearly endless replay value. I would definitely recommend buying the game for the PC, PS4, or Xbox One, rather than the current-gen consoles. However, the game, regardless of platform, is still ridiculously fun. PS3 and Xbox 360 owners, don't worry -- the game is well-worth buying for current-gen if you have no other options.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Overall Score: 9.5 (not an average)Story: 8Graphics: 8.5Audio: 10Gameplay: 10Replay Value: 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000XJS00K","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Near Perfect Grindhouse Experience","reviewText":"Back in the day, you could go to a drive in and watch really bad action movies like Bare Knuckles or Murder High.  Although the movies lacked production values, morals, and common sense, they were entertaining and fun.  WET captures that experience quite nicely.Concept: 10/10A beautiful girl in leather pants guns down 100 henchmen with a gatling gun while 50's Rock n' Roll plays in the background... suddenly the \"film\" breaks and you get a laughably bad and somewhat dirty commercial for hot dogs... when the 'movie' resumes, she's hacking up guys with a sword.  Action Packed + Sexy + Funny = Great Concept!Story:  8/10Rubi Malone has been betrayed by a crime syndicate full of degenerates and she wants her revenge.  Rubi is a loner and a hired gun who will do any dangerous job for the right price.  Scumbags die, limbs fall, heads roll, and cars explode.  Parts of this game will make you cringe, cheer, or laugh out loud.  Rubi Malone is voiced by Eliza Dushku, best known as Faith from Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Echo from Dollhouse.  She does a decent job, but the story would have been more entertaining if she acted a bit better or a bit worse (on purpose) and the script was more over-the-top.Gameplay:  7/10When the game first begins, only a few of Rubi's moves are available, so the game feels really clunky as some of the animation transitions are very rough.  The game sacrifices fluidity for speed, and for a \"Grindhouse\" style game, it's ok.  Rubi is armed with twin pistols and sword.  She faces mobs of henchmen and kills them by the dozens while using acrobatic props.  Whenever Rubi performs an acrobatic move (wall run, jump, pole swing, zip line, slide, dive...) the game slows down allowing the player to aim and become more effective at killing bad guys.  When Rubi is in this mode, she is much harder to hit.  With each bad guy she kills, a score multiplier increases, giving her more points per kill and boosts a healing factor.  The acrobatic, gun, sword, scoring system, and health regeneration features all combine to reward the player for aggression.  This isn't one of those duck behind a wall games... this is a kill the bad guys as fast and as cool as possible games.  As you get better at the combat and you unlock more moves, the game becomes really fun.  There is some depth here that you wouldn't expect.  At the end of each level, you get a score and you use those points to unlock new moves or improve Rubi's weapons.Levels:  6/10There are five different types of levels in the game.  They range from Great to Poor.Arena levels are large areas loaded with gymnastic type ramps, walls, poles, etc... and they are laid out like Tony Hawk Style Tricklines.  As you play, you try to maximize the acrobatic moves as you kill the bad guys.  The level ends when you destroy a set number of enemy spawning points with your sword.  These are the best parts of the game!Quicktime Sequences are also in this game.  Press the right button at the right time to watch Rubi do amazing stunts.  The timing is generous, but if you press the wrong button, you die.Rubi Vision levels occur at set times and begin when Rubi shoots a guy and gets blood in her face.  These levels are cell shaded in red.  Rubi gets a decent healing factor and is rewarded for Chain Kills.  Basically, killing guys within 5 seconds of each other increases the counter.  If the timer runs out, the counter resets to zero.  The enemies have low HP, so these levels are a fun change of pace and reward aggression.At certain points in the game, Rubi flashes back to her home base... a junkyard... where she runs through timed obstacle courses and shoots targets.  Every target shot takes 2 seconds off of her time.  If she completes the course fast enough, you earn a gold, silver, or bronze medal.  Because you don't have to do these over and over, they are kind of fun.The worst levels in the game are platforming levels.  They are loaded with insta-deaths and you must restart them from not-so-generous checkpoints.  These go against the strengths of the game, which is the fast paced combat.You cannot replay levels over again in the Story Mode, but there is a \"Points Mode\" where you can replay levels with maxed out abilities and weapons to try and achieve a high score.  If you perform badly in a level while you are in Story Mode and you don't earn enough points to upgrade Rubi, the remainder of the game will become much more difficult.Graphics:  5/10The environments are passable, but the character art looks dated.  The game gets away with this because it is a game based on low-budget movies.  There is also a \"scratchy film\" filter running over the art as you play, so the game does feel like you are watching an old bad movie.Sound:  10/10The explosions, gunfire, and screams of the dying punctuate the battles and the Tarantino-esque Soundtrack is perfect.  There's old school rock, surf guitar, and garage band music.  All of it delivers a perfect grindhouse atmosphere.Humor:  8/10This game will make you laugh out loud and shock you at its audacity.Replay Value:  5/10There are four difficulty levels and a special 1 bullet - 1 kill mode for the hardcore fans.  Aside from these and the \"challenge mode\" there really isn't any reason to replay the game and for most people, one time through will be enough.Maturity:  MThe swearing in this game surpasses a biker bar on alimony night and there's enough killing in this game to fill a battlefield after a small scale war.  There is no sex or nudity, which was kind of surprising.  It's M-Rated because of the violence, blood, and language.Overall:  7/10This ends up being a good game for the same reason that you like \"good\" bad movies.  They aren't complex, they aren't pretty, and you just sit back, laugh, and have a good time.  The game lacks features, it's rough around the edges, and there are a few bugs.  But in the end, it manages to be fun.Buy it cheap if you love action games or bad action movies and you understand that this is a \"Budget\" title.Rent it if you have 6-8 hours to blow through the story mode.Avoid it if you need high production values like Call of Duty, Halo, or Assassin's Creed.If you enjoyed this game at all, get Bayonetta.  Bayonetta is more fluid, has high production values, it's sexier and funnier.Other great action games include Ninja Gaiden 2, Assassin's Creed 2, and if you have a Wii, No More Heroes!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2011"}

I discovered it through my friend's son, who was a 5 year-old Star Wars fan.  At one point, he needed help with an area and asked me to guide him.  So I took the controller and tried my best.  After about a half hour, he asked if he could play again, but I told him that I was still \"trying to figure out how to play this game.\"  (In actuality, it was an instant addiction.)What I learned about Lego Star Wars is that the two-player function is awesome, but only if you are already friends with your counterpart and/or they are a skilled gamer.  If not, you will find yourself directing their every action (to help move the game along), and they might take exception to that.Anyway, if I may now review this particular rendition, Lego Star Wars: Complete Saga...The game is awesome.  I put it on par with the classics (Legend of Zelda, the Super Mario games, Sonic the Hedgehog, etc.).  That may sound like hyperbole, but let me assure you that Lego Star Wars: Complete Saga is the real deal.  The fact that the current generation game consoles enable new features (like Wii's remote control of the light sabers, guns, and Force) only bring this game from cult classic (kid's and diehard Star Wars fan's game) to popular classic (that everyone loves).Lego Star Wars: Complete Saga will take you approximately 40-50 hours to complete.  (That is, to get 100% completion of the game.)  And it won't be 40-50 hours that you regret; even if you take a break from the game and come back to it in, say, 6 months, you will gladly find yourself playing the next 40 to 50 hours that you allot.  (And I recommend coming back to it after a while - that way you don't always remember where everything is in the game, thus maintaining some challenge.  Also, like that cool song on your new CD - don't play it out too fast, even if it is the best song ever!)Star Wars fans probably found this game first, but it was the Lego concept that makes this a classic game.  I grew up with Legos, and Star Wars was pretty scary to me when it first came out.  Combining the two did what one expected: offered a fantastic venue for humor.As you play along to the Star Wars theme and plots, the Lego style adds some of the funniest things you will have seen in a video game.  I laughed out loud at some of the mini-movies in between the chapter stories.  Also, the way that characters die... their Lego bodies fall apart!  This really keeps the game tame for the younger set, but for us adults, it just adds that wonderful, simple, comic humor that we can appreciate.The Lego Star Wars: Complete Saga version is an addition to the Lego Star Wars series.  In the beginning, they released Chapters 1-3 to coincide with the Chapter 3 movie release (marketing).  LucasArts was already releasing their \"grown-up\" versions of a Star Wars game at the same time, so Lego Star Wars was decidedly their kid's version.A strong market was found, however, among a wide range of ages, so the developers released Chapters 4-6 with more featuers so as to close out their video game series, and thus the Star Wars saga.  Or did they...?The Complete Saga obviously combines the two previous versions, but also adds content.  For example, new characters become available, as well as new levels, quests, and features.  On the topic of the latter, the first version of Lego Star Wars (Chapters 1-3) had a relatively limited stud-collection/quest system.  In the Complete Saga, these chapters are fleshed out (as in the later version - Chapters 4-6), and many more sequences are provided.In all, if you want a game for yourself and/or a game for your kids, Lego Star Wars: Complete Saga is where it's at!  It is easy enough to simply pick up and play, with really only 4 or 5 buttons to use (4 buttons if you only play the Story Mode).  But if you are interested in taking the game beyond the Story Mode, you will find yourself having to manage your characters to know which situations call for which abilities (in the Free Play Mode).  This means that the game reaches out to the kids and to the kids within us!In my experience, the younger kids (ages 12 and under) will likely only appreciate the Star Wars concepts and gameplay.  Also, that sense of accomplishment as they complete the Story Mode (where they kind of know what to expect, thus keeping them thinking along).  If your kid does not like Star Wars, the Legos concept will probably not redeem the value for them.For the older kids (ages 13 to 70), the Story Mode is way cool, but the Free Play is where we get to use our management skills!  What awed me the most were the great and true renditions of the environments that were present in the movies.  I always wanted to go to Endor, for example (not Northern California, by the way, but the make-believe location).  Now, in this video game, I can guide characters in a wider use of the Endor location - not just the parts that were featured in the movie.And that is just one example...  The Complete Saga has more levels in it, such as the sequence where Anakin and Obi Wan are onboard General Grievous' ship.  (And the deleted scene from the movie where Shak Ti is killed by General Grievous.)  And there are still others...If you even WANT this experience to last only 40-50 hours, then I think you have rushed it, my friend!  I highly recommend taking your time (when you are not up against the clock) to really explore all that is in this game, the Complete Saga.  It goes so far above and beyond what we saw in the original two releases, and the game itself, as I stated at the beginning, is a true classic video game.  The Complete Saga is the seminal classic incorporating the two prior versions and expanding upon them.  (You may want to get one copy and console for yourself and one of each for the kids!)  I recommend buying this for any console that you own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2008"}

The game was notable for including the Super FX chip, which gave programmers the ability to create 3D objects with simple polygons.I booted up this game today, and it's still a blast to run through. Yes, it's very primitive 3D - you can count the individual polygons on each object - but the designs are creative and Nintendo found some commendable ways to make distinct, varied worlds with what they had. It always marvels to see the programming feats and innovations of the 16-bit era, and Star Fox is the pinnacle of that.More importantly, the game plays well. A couple of the later FX Chip games suffered by pushing 3D at the cost of gameplay. The framerate in Star Fox does suffer a bit in the later levels when there's so much onscreen, but overall the game plays exactly like a fast-paced shooter should. You get your upgrades, barrel rolls, adjustable settings, multiple difficulty levels, and a few secrets to discover - not bad for a game that could've just cashed in based on its graphics.In the end, this is a Super Nintendo classic. Like the original Mario Kart, it holds up well despite the numerous sequels that have followed. Worth adding to any SNES library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2006"}

Now I'm paying for it.  I recently decided to purchase a 360 due to the fact that the other consoles didn't have games that I wanted.  PS3 games, I think their still working on it and Wii, if I'm 7 I'd might enjoy them.  But 360 had Crackdown, Dead Rising, Bioshock, etc.So I finally got it and yes it is fairly easy to install and off I go.  Bought Crackdown and it worked great.  I was loving every minute of this GTA rip off.  I can't believe how fun it was.  After three weeks, I just could take it anymore.  I had to know how that zombie filled mall was going to be.  It was good, wished I had more weapons.  But something happened.The game didn't worked right after a week.  I looked at it and found scratches.  Just having bought the item, I returned it and got another one.  No scratches this time.  I logged on and the infamous tech thing happened.  The event that made so bittered from all you fanboys how preached about how great this console is.  3 freaking rings!  Are you kidding me.  I didn't buy this at launch.  Why?!  Why?! is it to impossible for them to make their console work.  I followed the rules.  It's on top of a well ventilated area, not dust and never move it when it's on.  All that and nothing be three red rings, a call and a box to mail it into.  I hate fanboys and I hate this waiting.

{"product_name":"B001QXNBNI","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Mostly Good Gane, BAD Online Squad Size Options","reviewText":"This is my first Battlefield game so I write this review from a non-biased, not obsessed with the series review. I only point that out because you'll have a bunch of the \"I LOVE all Battlefield game\" type reviews and although it's cool to love the game, it doesn't give the rest of us a realistic picture of the game.I will keep it simple...Pros - The frost bite engine obviously; that is the platform used to create this game. You can literally blow up everything in the game. I love how you can just take apart a building if someone is hiding inside. You can also spawn with your team which is nice since the maps are so expansive. There also seems to be a fair number of maps available with enough depth to keep me interested. The single player campaign is decent, but lets face it, most FPS games are really all about the online action these days. And lastly, VEHICLES! Tanks, jet skis, 4-runners, helicopters, etc. AWESOME!!!!!! I would also say the graphics are pretty solid. I've also heard there are a lot of weapons options but since I am only a level 2 I have yet to really experience anything beyond my XMB assault rifle.Cons - If you think you're going to get online with 7 or 8 friends and jump into a match against some guys, FORGET IT! Major failing in this game is the fact the online multi-player only has 4 person squads. I imagine this is because they want to keep with the 4-person squad behind the BF story. But who cares? Let me invite more than 3 other friends to play. AND, you will often have your group split up when attempting to join a game. That is terrible in my opinion and the primary reason I will most likely not spend a ton of time playing this otherwise good game. There is a way to have 24 person private matches, but sometimes you just wanna face a bunch of \"randoms\" with your friends, and more than 3 friends at that.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Ryan \"yahweh_jireh\"","summary":"This game is awesome.","reviewText":"This is a incredible game on many different levels.

{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach. They've made a solid shooter that takes full advantage of Epic's state-of-the-art graphics engine, but did nothing to set the shooter apart from the crowd. One hopes thatUnreal II: The Awakeningawakens Epic to the fact thatUnrealis a genuinely interesting franchise that deserves more.--Andrew S. BubPros:Gorgeous graphicsDecent gameplayCons:Amateurish if consistent art designToo short","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Sluggy Slugfest Non-Action-o-Rama","reviewText":"I really loved Unreal.  I'm also really impressed by Unreal Tournament 2003.  But I cannot believe what a poor product Unreal II: the Awakening is.  While I can see that they needed to give you more storyline than previous FPS games, I simply find the characters boring, the dialogue pretty trite--yes, even for a macho First-Person Shooter--and the gameplay terrible.  The animated cutscenes, while pretty, tend to go on too long and usually involve a long shot of a ship landing or docking, or someone walking up a staircase.It's really like UT2003 and Unreal II were built on 2 different engines:  they play like night &amp; day on my system, a pretty decent PIV 2.0GHz, 400MHz FSB, with 1GB of RAM.  Movement is sluggish, weapons work so-so, and although Unreal II gives you the ability to &quot;vault up&quot; onto those crates and boxes that are so hard to negotiate in other FPS games, you still feel like you're wearing weights on your ankles.  I can play at any resolution or level of settings and the gameplay is the same.There's also bad cropping of the map - I've run across &quot;invisible walls&quot; that are in the middle of walkways, enemy combatants that get wedged into the landscape and jog in place, and objects that look as realistic as any 4-year-old FPS from the days when PIII was cutting-edge.I'd suggest you consider Unreal Tournament 2003 (and playing as one player with a lot of bots if you want a single-player game) instead of trying to slog through the poor performance of this game.  The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 4 is that teams of AI bots tend to behave better than the bots in the original Unreal.  This doesn't redeem the game, but it makes me see that they tried to bring something to the sequel.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2004"}

I'm not sure why; i've got no real connection to it and the creators have never done anything for me personally.  I think it might be that, despite everything, you can tell this thing was put together with a lot of love.To bad it came up so short, huh?The ideas behind this beast are really fun and different.  The Norse myths and characters translate to this cyber infused pseudo-future surprisingly well (provided you're not an absolute purist, but that's neither here nor there). The characters and their conflicts are interesting, if a bit soap-opera-esque ('he murdered my wife, the fiend!'), the voice acting is hit and miss and in the end winds up feeling a lot like a poor man's mass-effect.  Still, it's its own world, the color palette is interesting, the sound design isn't bad (ambient conversations are pretty fun) everything has a nice, wide open feel, the cold is palpable, the tone is pretty even.  All nice and immersive.Where the game really falls short is in the combat. The controller mechanics work pretty well, actually, given that the developers tried some different things: the self-adjusting camera was pretty reliable, melee-ing with the right stick was pretty cool, dual wielding guns and switching targets with the same right stick was probably the most satisfying part.  But... that's the problem.  It wasn't exactly 'satisfying' at all.  Swing that right stick, and your little guy moves his sword, kinda.  It hits a monster, kinda.  And the monster goes flying, technically.  The physics are simply wrong, they don't add up.  Remember, in Devil May Cry, the first time you launched one of those puppets in the air and then blasted it to pieces with your pistols?  Damn, that was fun!  The same thing happens in the game... technically, kinda, sorta.  Only it's not fun.  It works, it happens, but you can't feel it.And that's what might have pushed this game from something forgettable to something memorable: polish.  If the physics had been more engaging, if the fight animations had been more interesting, if the puzzles and the atmosphere in 'cyberspace' had been more distinct, this could have been a really special experience. And the animation in the cuts scenes is really weak!  How is that possible?  Those have been awesome at least since 2004, right?  This game came out in 2008 and those are awkward as hell!  It's a small thing, but it's that lack of polish and shine that makes a game like this(set in future sci-fi fantasy land where everything is supposed to be shiny and awesome) feel really weak.  How can it compete with things like Gears of War or Mass Effect or Devil May Cry?  I can't and it doesn't.  Had Too Human been released on an earlier system, the Xbox or the gamecube or PS2, it may have had a fighting chance.  But for a current gen release it just doesn't measure up in fun or in flash.Not to be too critical, of course, there's fun to be had: the enemy types are cool looking and when they swarm on you in large numbers things can get pretty exciting. Shooting is still a good time, all the gear and loot you come across is engaging and outfitting your particular god, with specific skills and gear, into a robot killing bad-ass is a good time.  I've put more than a few hours into it with no real regret...  Right until I finished the game that is.Ending please?  No, not quite.  The designers obviously wanted to leave room for sequels, so they've only told about a third of a story.  There's only the beginnings of a conflict, weak character development, and things end abruptly a few scenes before what would be the climax in any good story.  In fact, when writing this thing the developers seemed to expect that EVERYONE who played it would be super-familiar with the Norse myths, so they didn't bother explaining who the hell any of the characters are.  If you don't know who Braggi, Tyr, Frey and others are you're a little out of luck.  You won't get some of the things they say and you certainly won't give a damn when a some of them start dying off.  Kind leaves the whole story feeling hollow and unsatisfactory.  Much like the combat (booyah!) !In short, it's worth a look if you're not in the mood for anything too engaging or too demanding.  Pick-up, slaughter some robots, put-down, no long-term commitment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2011"}

It has some unique ideas, but are very poorly implemented. Take the primary offender, the right analog stick driven combat. Whoever thought this was a good idea was probably brain dead, as it feels extremely clumsy and counter intuitive. As you're sliding about, boffing robots on the head, you'll catch on other enemies, and endure many cheap deaths, after which you'll be lifted into the sky by a robot angel, and plopped back on the ground apropos of nothing. If loot is what you're here for, Too Human has it in spades, but the mediocre combat doesn't make your Dragon Scale Jockstrap of Popularity feel like it's worth having.You use the left bumper to center the camera behind your head and enter a sort of free look mode, but the hard cut to this viewpoint, and the utter uselessness of the free look makes me wonder if all of Silicon Knights had been high while making this. To make everything feel more worthless, clicking the right stick initiates a close up look at Baldur's face.The whole thing smacks of \"passion project\", but not in a good way. One of my favorite games from last year, \"Dust: An Elysian Tail\" was a passion project, but Dean Dodrill knew what worked and what didn't, pushed past his pride, and cut the fat out. Silicon Knights obviously had a monumental ego, because there are a lot of things that any normal developer would change for the sake of a good product, that SK wouldn't do for the sake of it's baby. For example: look back on the infamous \"Amy's Baking Company\" episode, where Amy was in aggressive denial about her cooking, and told all the dissenters to go @#$% themselves. Too Human is like that Blue Ribbon burger, b/c some things just don't work.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2013"}

It was the summer of 1992.  Growing up in rural Oklahoma, my parents had a cow tank that we used for a swimming pool that we chlorinated.  I was in that tank all the time.  My father and my brother had gone to Oklahoma City (about an hour away from where we lived), and they had gotten an SNES, with \"Super Mario World\" prepackaged.  I immediately dried off, ran upstairs and my brother and I were immersed in Mario bliss.Being the Nintendo fans that we were, we were subscribers to Nintendo Power.  I poured over all the pre-cover of their latest [Nintendo] console, as well as any information we could glean of \"Super Mario World\".  I had even known some people who won the SNES in one of those give-aways they used to do back in the 1980s and 1990s on cereal boxes.  I was so jealous.Playing \"Super Mario World\" was a pure revelation that first time, and a perfect exhibition of the power of the SNES.  The graphics were gorgeous, the enemies were monstrous yet whimsical, and the Bullet Bills were enormous.There has always been a debate on which is better - \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" or \"Super Mario World\"..  For myself, I'd give the edge to \"Super Mario World\".  To be fair to \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", \"Super Mario World\" simply took the foundation laid by \"SMB3\" and perfected it, just like \"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past\" did with the original \"Legend of Zelda\".Essentially, take everything great from \"Super Mario Bros.\" and \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", expand the graphics and audio from 8-Bit to 16-Bit, overhaul the level lengths and add a ridable dinosaur named Yoshi, include a lot of secrets, and wa-la!, \"Super Mario World\"!Everything \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" is so adored for, \"Super Mario World\" takes and does several steps better, with only one exception - suits.  \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" famously introduced us to Racoon Mario, Hammer Mario, Frog Mario, and Tanooki Mario (though oddly no Boomerang Mario, which we wouldn't see until \"Super Mario 3D Land\").  \"Super Mario World\" only features Fire Mario and Cape Mario.  However, Cape Mario is able to fly for unlimited amounts of time, unlike Racoon Mario which is captive to a P-Meter and can only fly for short bursts.The story, always the same in the core Mario series, is simply that, while Mario, Luigi, and the Princess are on vacation to Dinasaur Land after the events of \"SMB3\", Bowser and his seven children kidnap seven dinasaur eggs and also abduct Princess Peach.  It is up to Mario to free the Princess and rescue the dinasaurs.  Don't worry though, the story's not important.  Mario is never about the story, it's always about the gameplay.  And what gameplay it is!\"Super Mario World\" is famous for introducing the world to Yoshi, the ridable dragon.  Miyamoto wanted Mario to ride a dinosaur in the original 1985 \"Super Mario Bros.\", but was not able to implement this new character until this game.  It is strange Yoshi doesn't appear in \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"; after all, ridable steeds appeared in \"Adventure Island II\" and also the later game \"Little Nemo: Dream Master\". [Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshis - the basic green one, the blue one [(who, when swallowing any type of turtle shell]]Regardless, you are given four types of Yoshi, each with a special power according to their colour: green, red, blue, and yellow.  The green is the most common.  Upon injesting a turtle shell, the red blows fire, the blue flies, and the yellow creates a dust storm attack.  The green is able to do all of these, if he swallows the same color turtle shell (red = fire, blue = flying, yellow = dust).  The special color yoshis are only available in secrect Star levels, where they appear as babies which Mario must feed five enemies for them to become full grown.Yoshi is also famous for eating.  Strangely enough, Mario must punch Yoshi in the back of the head before Yoshi sticks out his tongue, looking for goodies.One of my favorite additions is just how Miyamota and company added to the lenght.  One legitimate weakness of \"SMB3\" is simply how short so many of the levels are - many times, you complete the level just when you feel you are about halfway done.  Even Miyamoto commented on this on one of the reissues of \"Super Mario Bros. 3\", asking his developers if the game's original levels were really that short.  Once a level is beaten, you cannot go back.  No so with \"Super Mario World\". Indeed, due to the secret exits and alternate paths, Nintendo encourages you to go back and explore levels already beaten, and the levels themselves are consistently much longer than those found in \"SMB3\".Taking the overworld map first introduced in \"SMB3\", for the first (and, until the 2012 \"New Super Mario Bros. U\", only) time on a home console Mario game, the map is connected and completely visible, unlike its predecessor.  Previously, the worlds were divided into individual maps, but not \"Super Mario World\".  From the get go, you could view the entire game map.  Dinasaur Land comprises seven different areas, played in this order: Yoshi's Island, guarded by Iggy Koopa; Donut Plains, guarded by Morton Koopa Jr., Vanilla Dome, guarded by Lemmy Koopa, Twin Bridges, guarded by Luwig von Koopa; the Forest of Illusion, guarded by Roy Koopa; Chocolate Island, guarded by Wendy O. Koopa; and the Valley of Bowser, home to not only Bowser but Larry Koopa as well.You cannot underestimate how the world map truly effected gameplay.  For the first time on a significant level, you could choose your own path.  The map also afforded the game developers the opportunity to made the game chock-full of secrets, alternate paths, and hidden areas.  The secrets were not so esoterically hidden to be inaccessible to the average player either - if a regular level had a secret exit, the level would be a red dot; if no secret exit existed, then the level is represented as a yellow dot.Each world is thematically diverse.  The first world features basic levels that ease the player into the gameplay, teaching you the rules and dynamics of Mario's new adventure.  The second world is set in the plains, the third world is set in caverns, and the fourth world is set on dual bridges, along with some mountain levels.By the fifth world, the Forest of Illusion, the challenge has been ramped up, and to proceed you MUST find those deviously hidden secret exits.  We then have the \"tasty (but dangerous!)\" Chocolate Island, which also features a level that how fast you beat individual sections determines what the next segment of that level will be.  Then we have the challenging Ghost Ship (which, according to the instruction manual, is a wrecked ship from \"Super Mario Bros. 3\"), and the only boss level that Yoshi will enter. After that, naturally, is the Valley of Bowser.One of the best features are the two secret worlds - the Star World and the Secret World.  Unlike other Mario games, there are no warp zones present in \"Super Mario World\". However, there are levels called the Star Road, which enable you to get to different parts of the map quickly and effectively by accessing the Star World and completing the levels.  To connect the Star Road, you must find the secret exits.  Once you find the fifth and final level on the Star Road, you are then taken to the Secret World, a world of eight gruelling, ultra-challenging levels that will truly test your Mario metal.\"Super Mario Bros. 4: Super Mario World\" (the official Japanese title) is the best 2D Mario out there, though perhaps \"New Super Mario Bros. U\" will usurp this game from its lofty throne.Interestingly enough, Miyamoto has said that he was not entirely happy with \"Super Mario World\", as he felt the game had been rushed to publication and not completed to his exacting standards.  However, just like \"Mega Man 3\" (a game also apparently rushed), \"Super Mario World\" is as good as it gets.  I wonder what further changes Miyamoto would have made.  Unfortunately we'll never know.Those who love masterpieces of excellent 2D platforming action would be amiss without this purchase for their SNES - and better yet, \"Super Mario World\" is also available on the Wii and Wii U's Virtual Console.  Pick this one up!  You won't regret it...-----[This was written separate from the review back in May 2012 about the Mario games' development history.  Notably, Miyamoto said that \"Super Mario World\" began development with a team of sixteen people, and took about three years to make.  As \"Super Mario World\" came out in November 1990, that means Nintendo began production on this game sometime in 1987 - the same year they were working on \"Super Mario Bros. 3\".  On a game forum someone asked why Nintendo did not release \"Super Mario Bros. 3\" on the SNES, instead of the NES, and was complaining they should have released the game on the more powerful system.  This was my answer:]Let's look at some Mario history, shall we?  SMB3 came out in Japan in October 1988. That means it was completed, finished, and ready to be published by that point in time.If you look at the Japanese publication dates, SMB came out in 1985, Lost Levels came out in 1986, Doki Doki Panic came out in 1987, and SMB3 came out in late 1988. Given the fact the game was finished and released by 1988 I would hardly call that \"late in the NES hardware cycle\". Actually, the NES had only been out three years when SMB3 hit Japan, although the Famicom came out in late 1983. However all the heavy hitters for the Famicom came out in 1985 and beyond.Essentially all Nintendo had to do at this point was release it on cart; the code was written and completed. If have a sequel to the biggest game for your console, and the sequel SMB2 is also a massive hit - why wouldn't they release SMB3 which was already completed and published in Japan? They had a massive financial interest in getting this game out.There are very few differences between the Japanese SMB3 and the western SMB3 (namely if Mario gets hit with a powerup he goes to little Mario rather than Super Mario, ala Mario with a mushroom). There's nothing like the major differences between the Japanese and the Western versions of Zelda II The Adventure of Link.All four 8-bit NES titles were completed in a three year period, 1985-1988 (and were published in Japan as well, though SMB2, there called SMB USA, came out in 1992).I've read SMB3 took about two to three years to program, meaning Nintendo began work on it possibly by late 1985 (though that does sound entirely too early) but definitely by early 1987 and possibly even late 1986 given it was released in October 1988 and both Doki Doki and Lost Levels would have been finished (in the case of Doki Doki, it would have been closed to being completed if not already completed).In comparison today, that would be like saying Nintendo should not have released \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" back in 2009 (three years into the Wii lifecycle) because obviously the Wii U is coming up and they should save it for a new system. The timeframe is the same. And according to your logic, for this generation we definitely SHOULD NOT have gotten Skyward Sword for the Wii, despite the fact it has had a five year development timeframe was began shortly after Twilight Princess came out..I do find it strange that they had problems with Yoshi (which for the record Miyamoto has said he wanted to put in the original 1985 SMB). After all, Hudson's Adventure Island series, the same company responsible for the abomination that is Super Mario Bros. Special, the first ever sequel to the Mario franchise, were able to get ridable dinasaurs, and the 1993 Capcom title Little Nemo Dream Master had ridable creatures too.Then again, Adventure Island II came out in April 1991, two and a half years after SMB3.Basically, I said all that to say you should research your Mario history more. When Nintendo began development on SMB3 (late 1986/early 1987) the Super NES was nowhere on the horizon, at least not publically. Even in late 1988 when the game was published, we were still over two years away from the Super Famicom which came out in Japan in November of 1990.So that's why they didn't develop it for the Super Famicom.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00113JSCG","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Thinks too highly of itself, ultimately extremely frustrating.","reviewText":"Many of the other reviewers have very similar feelings.At first the game seems interesting, unique, fancy, innovative, and pretty.  Not long into it you'll begin to encounter the very real problems the game has.  Controlling your character with any precision is impossible.  You can select first person, which is painfully sluggish, but the game forces you back into 3rd person most of the time.  3rd person _looks_ really nice, and I can respect the artist's vision of the world.  Trying to actually function in 3rd person is a whole different thing: completely frustrating.  The camera is rarely where you want it to be looking.  At many points in the game you may have to resort to hand to hand combat, which will be forced in the 3rd person, and will make you want to throw your fancy wireless remote right out of the window, followed by the XBOX and TV, still plugged into the wall.  At least hand to hand, while completely worthless in this game, isn't like Silent Hill:  no stance fighting.  But: basically as useless.The inventory system, while it seems innovative, is actually quite stale once you get a bit into the game.  It's also extremely clunky and hard to use under duress.  The healing system, too, at first seems innovative, but is actually quite obnoxious.  Let's face it, they were neat ideas on a white board in a room full of excited marketing guys -- but in reality they don't work well.  The game boasts this open style combination system.  Flammable liquid in container, tape, box of bullets, throw at bad guy, shoot, repeat.  Put alcohol on bullets, aim for little cracks in baddies, shoot repeatedly because the targeting system is crappy, repeat.  There really isn't much too it after you've done it a few times.  One little gripe here:  the eye blinking spectral vision thing.  Yes, push down and hold the right thumbstick which is also what you'd need to use to aim, precisely, on a moving target, to kill it.  Who play tested this, and where can I find them?  I'd like to have a little dialog with them about this subject.Vehicle driving...  man, what can I say?  Nothing like tapping a 3\" curb and watching the vehicle fly up into the air and shed all of it's fenders in one motion.  You can do some neat things with vehicles...  cut open the gas tanks, fill bottles, use them as rolling bombs, all kinds of things.  Too bad the interface sucks so bad that it's hard to pull any of that stuff off.  Once again:  it sounds neat, but doesn't work out that way.To be fair, I haven't completed the game as of yet.  Honestly, while I like to see things through, I may not.  Some of the puzzles are, frankly, very annoying.  Some of the stuff is very... cryptic and without any real clue of what is happening.  Sometimes you'll find yourself somewhere, nothing is happening, and you don't really know what to do next.  Other times the solution is so obvious and streamlined that it is a wonder they put it in at all.  The story is not engaging.  The story doesn't even make sense in a few places.I could go on and on, but basically I am very disappointed in this game.  The fire effects are out of this world, the environments are decent, water is awesome, and there is some definite lighting/atmosphere neatness...  but that's about it.  Otherwise, the game is very awkward, repetitive, confusing, and above all else: frustrating.  It's just not the game it could be, and it's not the game that was advertised.  This is no surprise, none the less, it is what it is.I really wanted this game to be spooky, creepy, innovative, cool, engaging, and immersive.  It's not.  It's just a waste of time and money.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2008"}

You can't plot out your crops, your main aim is to work on relationships with the townsfolk.The graphics are very interesting, with 3D characters much like in the Dark Cloud series. The music is OK, bordering on slightly annoying. I found the intro sequence to be especially tedious, with the little sprites leading you by the nose through every single task you could possibly want to do. It would be much better if they told you about a given task when you got to it, instead of overloading you with every single minute detail right at the beginning.This is a great 'training' game to get people used to the Harvest Moon style of gameplay. Experienced Harvest Mooners might find this game too short, because just as you are getting into your farm tending and relationship building, POOF it is over.

The original game had stellar graphics, sound, action, and an overall epic feel. The sequel lives up to its name, and improves upon it in nearly every way.First of all, the game was released near the end of the Playstation 2's lifecycle, and many consider it to be the last hurrah of the console. Why would anyone spend $50 on a game that's released on archaic hardware, with worse graphics and such than current generation consoles? There's many reasons, and I'll tell you them.God of War 2 has an amazing graphics engine that shows that the dying Playstation 2 still has some tricks up its sleeve. It really shines in the visuals department and is an amazing feat for the console. Considering most of the game's cut-scenes utilize ingame graphics, you can clearly see how much emphasis was put into making this game look good. Audio goes hand-in-hand, bringing the entire audio/video experience full circle.As an action game, God of War 2 is one of the best ever released. It has extremely frantic moments where tons of enemies fill the screen, each creature having its own distinct traits and skills. Just when you think you're dead, a context-sensative icon will appear, allowing you to do certain actions at specific times as they appear on screen, causing massive damage and rewards. The pacing of the action seems just right, although a fair amount of dying will be involved.The one thing God of War 2 captures, much like its predecessor, is the epic feeling of the entire game. Cut-scenes, battles, locations, enemies, weapons, and the overall feel of the game just immerses you in it, much like a film. The production values are some of the best ever seen in a video game.Really, the only bane of the game's existence are the overabundant placement of puzzles. God of War 2 and the original all have very interesting and well placed puzzles, ranging from quick move-the-boulder to sprawling levels consisting of tens of time-based and skill-based puzzles. The original game had just the right ratio of action to puzzles, but God of War 2 focuses much too heavily on the puzzle aspects. There's really almost more puzzles to the game than action, which can be excruciatingly annoying and demoralizing. Being cut short of continuing the action because you can't time a grappling hook is obnoxious the first time, but having it happen hundreds of times in countless parts of the game is unnecessary.All in all, God of War 2 is a mandatory game for any Playstation 2 owner, action game lover, or really just any gamer in general. It's a landmark release with some glaring flaws that still can't bring it down, because everything else about it shines so brightly.Pick up God of War 2 now and enjoy the game as soon as possible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2007"}

The Pro Elite Wireless positions its analog sticks asymmetrically, with left analog stick up and the right analog stick down. This design helps prevent cramping during extended gaming sessions and is especially ideal for first-person shooters. The R2 buttons have also been repositioned for greater accessibility while gaming. Additionally, all of the buttons are backlit, so you'll still be able to game in the dark.Ergonomic, Natural DesignErgonomically designed, the Pro Elite Wireless provides optimal comfort for all hand sizes. Its textured rubber grips are soft and breathable, so your gaming won't be ruined by sweaty palms. The palm handles have been expanded to provide a more generous area for gripping the controller. And with its gently contoured edges, the Pro Elite Wireless helps alleviate pressure on your hands to ensure comfort.Precise SIXAXIS Motion ControlNot only is the Pro Elite Wireless comfortable and intuitive, it's also compatible with SIXAXIS games. Using a fine-tuned accelerometer and gyroscope, the Pro Elite Wireless can sense your movements and translate them into the game. This gives you more direct, lifelike control over the events in your game. To get the most out of SIXAXIS-heavy games like Warhawk and Heavenly Sword, you'll need the Pro Elite Wireless Controller.Rumble Feedback for Immersive GameplayFully supporting rumble feedback, the Pro Elite Wireless uses two vibrating motors on either side of the controller to create a rumbling sensation at certain moments during the game. This makes yaour gaming experience even more immersive, as you're able to feel every gunshot and explosion in visceral detail.The Pro Elite Wireless Controller is backed by a two-year warranty.

Johnson","summary":"Great visuals + OK game play = ...","reviewText":"A pretty good WWII shooter.  This was one of the first games I got with my 360 about 4 weeks ago. Eventhough it was the first game I played when I got home, I put it down for a while since getting into GOW.  After beating GOW, I came back to COD3.Now that I have beat this game I must say that I am fairly satisfied with the game.  And that is a big FAIRLY.The graphics are the best thing about the game.  The war zones seem life like down to the individual blades of grass swaying as you and your comrades creep through it.  You will see dirt fly up in the air as you and your enemies exchange fire on the battle field.  Glass breaks realisticaly as you try to kill Nazi's from inside houses.  Your comrades and enemies are also done very well, the move like humans move and they die the same way.  I really haven't found much to complain about with the graphics.If the graphics are the best part of the game, the sound is a real close second.  I decided to purchase the optical audio cable for the 360 and plugged it in directly to my A/V receiver.  The result?  True 5.1 surround sound from all 6 speakers.  The sounds of explosions, bullets whizzing by your head, tanks, trucks, all sound lifelike.  Crank the volume up and you get an even better audio experience.  Truly impressed with the sound.The controls are easy to pick up as well, the 360 controller seems well suited to handle this game.  While nothing beats a mouse and keyboard, the controller gives you great control over your character.So if the graphics are awesome and the sound it great, then the game has to be excellent right?  Not so fast.  While this game has all of the elements of an \"excellent\" game, they just don't come together as I would have exepected.  To me the game is not nearly as fun as the original COD on the PC, and there were only a couple of levels in which it was easy to feel like I was actually there; something the original COD was able to do very well on every level.  Maybe it was the actual levels; which I found many to be somewhat boring and tedious because of the annoying checkpoint system. I found myself having to do the same thing over and over and over again, which greatly took away from the fun factor of the game.  I don't know about you, but it is real annoying for me having to spend another 10 minutes doing something I already did, just because I got killed before the next in game checkpoint.  If a game is going to have checkpoints, make them closer together and/or give the player an option to save at any point in a game, even if they are only given 2 or 3 saves per level (e.g. Rainbow Six Three for the XBOX.)  Another thing about the game was that many of the actual missions were simply not fun.  I wanted to feel like I was just another person in the war, but things always seemed to center on your character, it would seem enemies would direct all there fire at you, and many of the missions involved YOU having to do something.  Another ANNOYING thing about the game was that there was no way to skip through the cut screens between levels.  It was fine to see them for the first time, but if you load a saved game after you turn on your 360 again, you have to sit through the cut screen again, with no way to just go to the action.  Some cutscreens are rather long so you can imagine the frustration.  This is unacceptable and I have no idea how this was overlooked and allowed to be in the final product.In summary COD3 is an OK game, the four stars are actually rounded up values from a 3.8 or 3.9.  It's definetely worth playing and completing, but I probably won't play it again unless I decide to get my XBOX Live subscription back again, which I am still debating due to the stupid kids online.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2006"}

Too much C4, weak overuse of Tactician play, and just an overall feel that the map designers took a HUGE step back from 2.Overall it is worth it to experience these games. The single players are the usual brofist average stuff and nothing more although 3 has some surprisingly cool stuff that is worth a play through once.

The load time is somewhere in the neighborhood of an hour and a half to two hours, so have something else going on when you first instal the game to your system (mine is a PS3). Afterwards though, it's pretty awesome. The opening story is pretty gripping. You then create a superhero (actually, you can have several, but i have only made one so far). You choose good or evil and then one of three mentors (mine was Batman).  You choose any number of variations, from technology based power to magic based power, a main fighting style, and many other things. The customization of your character is pretty detailed. Then, you play through an intro, essentially your in game training manual. After that, you run around, fly around, climb around, etc....finding and completing quests, meeting other superheros, or sometimes simply wander around striking superhero poses (something i have found to be quite humorous when done at just the right time). Some of your fellow superheros are really cool, some are pretty much inspired by existing superhero molds, and some are fun to laugh at. Names such as \"Flame Dude\" and \"Yellow Guy\" in the same area as \"Voltor the Destructive\" and \"Cuny Linger\" pretty much tell you that it is a mixed crowd (old and young)....anyway....amusing and enjoyable.

But just after 30 minutes, it kind of starts to get boring and you just wish there was something else to do.  The original game came out several years ago, before the Dreamcast came out.  It is fun to play....if you play it once and awhile, than it seems pretty new everytime.  This is not a game you play for hours and everyday.  At least, not all the time.  The graphics are just pretty much like the Dreamcasts'.  There is no real improvment, which is disapointing since the PS2 has much better hardware and could have pulled off some pretty neat things.  They could have at least added a new city or something.  What is also lagging is a multiplayer.  Then the game would get interesting.  It's not really fun watching SOMEONE ELSE play.  The sound is great but for some reason, the people you pick up have more of a vocabulary than the drivers, which kind of ... since your driver can' defend himself when the people verbally attack him/her when they say &quot;YOU...&quot; or something like that.  The control is a little slugish and you'll be slamming into walls and buildings at first. But I have to admit, this game is addicting, just not that addicting. It's a good game to get, better than most for the PS2 right now.  NOTE: I've read that a lot of people got faulty disks and everything dissapers and freezes.  I was one of those people. The problem is fixed now, it's just that the first shipment was probebly rushed.  But everything is fine now.

{"product_name":"B002I0K3M0","description":"","reviewerName":"j-rob-82","summary":"Good Game But Honestly Don't Pay $60 For This","reviewText":"The reason I am reviewing separate from my Wii U review is the length.  My review was way to long and its actually still in the process. I have been playing this with my kids for some time now and I am very glad it came with my console or I might regret my sixty bucks.  Unless you have money for games laying around or are looking for something to show off on your Wii U than buy it.  The games are limited right now so I don't think you will be too disappointed.  Adults might be but I don't think younger kids will get bored too fast.The games are fun and you can tell it is really to show the possibilities of the gamepad which isn't a bad thing.  The games seem to wear thin pretty quick with my kids five and seven always wanting to keep moving from what we are currently playing.  It could of been because there is so much for them to play and discover, I guess.  There are I think six games for more than one player and six single player give or take.  I don't have my console on but I know its close to that.  It is great to play Luigis Mansion or the Mario hide and seek type game.  One person controls Mario on the gamepad and can see everyone on the map on the screen.  The object of course is to catch Mario and I can tell this is one of the better mini games on here.  You can have four people in pursuit of Mario and my kids were just laughing.  Luigis mansion is the same way really but it is fun no doubt even though the maps are quite small.  The gamepad is the ghost and the others have flashlights to try to spot the ghost.  All I know is my kids were laughing and I was being a moron so everyone was having a good time.  Its something we don't really do enough with our gaming consoles.  Anyways the other games aren't awful by any means but these two are the ones that stuck out to us and there are others that kind of play like this.All the games do have unique ways of playing on the gamepad like the one where you have to swipe the screen to blow the air to move the player around onscreen while they are attached to balloons.  I think everyone will find one they like but keep in mind they are just minigames.  I know some people aren't like me but I still have paranoia about my kids holding the gamepad and accidentally dropping it.  So keep in mind these games revolve around that gamepad so it may or may not be a big deal.  I just know its questionable if I should of really bought this console in the first place and to have the broken gamepad would not make me smile and heart feel warm.  Of course this stuff is directed towards kids so eventually you will have to bite the bullet and let them have at it.  Maybe once the newness rubs off a little.  I am actually disappointed there aren't more multiplayer games like the Luigi and Mario ones.  The gamepad is the shining spot for the new console and I could see how these types of games truly do benefit.I still have problems with the gyro on that gamepad but after playing with it awhile you do get use to how to turn it to move the camera on the screen.  Other the weirdness of moving the controller to move the camera its actually quite easy.  My daughter is five and picked up on the games pretty quick and she was having lots of fun being the ghost chasing me around the mansion.  So the controls are tight and consistent once you get your feel of it.As far as graphics they are bright and pop which will really draw in kids with its colorfulness.  It was actually surprising to me (no offense ) that the game looks this good being one of the first on the console.  Though it's not the best of all time but its certainly not the worst.  The sound is good too which has little bits of classic tunes my kids don't really care about but when I hear bring a stupid grin on my face.I do feel that everyone with a Wii U at least try it out and if you have kids I think it will be a winner in the household.  It is a great way to show off your new consoles capabilities.  My recommendation is to rent it first if possible and see if it does it for you and your family.  Who knows you may think it is worth the sixty and if so buy it with no guilt and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Playing it does kind of feels like games they should of had as DLC for five bucks or less and just buy the ones you want which is kind of what kinect does.  It will remain to be seen if this game will have a long life or not in our house but whatever you do just enjoy it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9V2Q","reviewerName":"Thomas Riccardi","summary":"PC Classic hits the consoles!","reviewText":"There are many role playing games out there that have defined a generation. From Final Fantasy and Ultima to Diablo these games have left players wanting more. Diablo III has been out for the PC for sometime now and it seemed that the console market was going to be left out. But no more as Blizzard has released this game both for the XBox 360 and the PS3. But will this be a worthy experience or should you just stick to playing this on your PC?The story and content for the most part are the same with the console versions and the PC version. Everything is there from the origins in New Tristram to the finale of beating Diablo it is all there. The bonus levels are even included so you can find development hell or wander into the brightly colored world of Whimsyshire. There are tons of items that you can get for the various classes you play in the game from the steely barbarian to the steadfast monk.I was worried a bit about the translation of this game from the PC to the consoles. There have been many horrid adaptations of PC games to consoles and vice versa. However Blizzard was on point with this conversion and has even made some really great upgrades. For example you don't have to be constantly connected to the internet to play this game. You can play this game online with your friends but also offline if you wanted to. Also playing this on a console adds a bit more control to the game but with using dual analog sticks the controls feel more fluid on the PS3 than a regular PC.My main problem that I have with this game is that it is tied to the console services. For example if you have a friend that plays Diablo III on the PC you can't join their game on a 360 or PS3. The reason is that the PC, XBox 360 and the PS3 have their own networks and none are compatible with each other. It would be nice to see some type of sharing application or syncing where everyone could join everyone elses game but for now it's just simply impossible.So is this a game that you should get if you have it already on the PC? Not really. But if you haven't experienced this game yet and own an Xbox 360 or PS3 then rush out and get this game now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

Kane has been drafted into Rhino Squad, one of the squads of space marines currently assaulting the planet Stroggos, home of the strogg aliens.","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"A dud from id Software's grenade launcher","reviewText":"There are good first-person shooters out there. Those shooters contain a story that captivates the player enough to blast through a dozen or so levels of shooting, dodging, and grenade-lobbing. Those levels generally have multiple objectives that are varied, from bombing a structure to rushing a certain location and killing everything from point A to point B while staying alive. Those shooters are generally accompanied with attractive graphics and pulse-pounding music. The Xbox 360 version of Quake 4 doesn't have many of those qualities. It's not a terrible game, but it's one of the least impressive shooters I've played this year.In Quake 4's brainless campaign, you'll strap on the armor of the space marine Matthew Kane, a member of the Rhino Squad that is attacking the evil Strogg on their home planet. The biomechanical beasts are foul, dirty, and ruthless--and a small twist near the middle of the game will show you and Corporal Kane just how dirty the Strogg can be. I thought that it was nice for Raven to throw in a truly unexpected story twist but I never really found the rest of the game to be very interesting. At least the second half of the campaign is fast, frantic, and intense. It's preferable to the first half. Overall the game is about 10-12 hours long, clocking in at or near the shooter average.It's the gameplay that had me let down and shaking my head. Quake 4 plays like a good first person shooter...from 2001. The fragging is so ridiculously generic from the start of the game until the very end. Some will say it's just Quake's traditional gameplay, I say it's boring. You'll pick up progressively stronger and better guns but at the same time your enemies get a little faster, a little bigger, an a little more deadly. There's a balance established between strong weapons and strong enemies. However, most of the action consists of running forward throughout similar rooms, finding the Strogg, and shooting them until they fall over and their corpses disappear. They don't move around much at all, they often don't even try to evade your fire, and they don't try to outsmart you in the slightest bit. Usually they'll stand in place, move towards you, and shoot you without taking much cover or attempting to get around you for an easier kill. A few of the enemies have different tactics but these tactics are usually just slight variations from the \"stand-and-shoot\" or \"run-and-slash\" strategy. It's disappointing when games like Call of Duty 2 have such impressive intelligence.The guns you get can be pretty cool but I discovered that almost anything can be killed quickly and effortlessly with a few well-placed shotgun blasts or an entire clip of machine gun ammo, even near the end of the game. The enemies don't take much cover, which is an example set for the player--running around and mindlessly shooting doesn't have many repercussions, because it isn't necessary to hide very often. Because of this, even inexperienced gamers can plow through this game's action. If you have to play through this game, play it on a hard difficulty setting unless you simply want to cruise right on through it. The only things that break up the action even the slightest bit are a few vehicular distractions, which are admittedly a lot of fun. One of them puts you on the back of an on-rails truck, shooting off the Strogg with your own weapons. The next throws you into the cockpit of a hovering tank, where you can quickly fire off missiles and pound the opposition with machine gun fire. The most exciting and last vehicle is the walker, which can use lock-on missiles and machine gun fire to rapidly take down enemies. These distractions are a lot of fun and it's a shame that the rest of the game is so generic.Multiplayer, on and offline, isn't any more interesting than the single-player. What should have been a robust, fast-paced, frantic set of games turns out to be pretty dull and generally unexciting. Eight people can join up in a single game and of course you can frag each other in deathmatches but there isn't anything here that impressed me in the slightest bit. All these years I've heard about how much fun Quake can be in terms of multiplayer and I'm let down by gameplay that simply isn't interesting. Not to mention, Xbox Live is very inconsistent and the already-low frame rate (which I'll mention momentarily) makes Quake 4 more frustrating to play than it ever should have been.Visually, it is very difficult to classify Quake 4. There were certain parts during the game that I was admittedly impressed with Raven's choice for art and style. There is a lot of detail throughout the environments, from blood-splattered walls to gears and mechanisms scattered around the various rooms. Even the nicely-lit interior locations, which compose most of the game, are interesting. Corridor shooting isn't nearly as repetitive when the bulk of the graphical factor isn't stale and boring. On the other hand, player models are very generic and almost every marine looks like his partners. One marine might have different hair and another might have a different skin color. The models also look so jagged without a high-resolution screen that it appears they have spikes or fur. Quoting a friend, \"Quake 4 has cactus graphics.\" The effects are extremely dull, whether it's the Nintendo 64-calibur muzzle flash or the fire and smoke effects that would look at home in a generic Playstation 2 game. The music isn't very good, either. Where Perfect Dark Zero set a mood with its tunes, Quake 4 does nothing to pump the player up for any battle or confrontation. It's not epic, it's not exciting, and it fails to impress me at all. The voice acting is alright, but the dialogue is so cliched and generic that it cancels out any sort of impressing aural quality.Overall, Quake 4 is a big disappointment. What was supposed to be a visually stunning, fast-paced, pulse-pounding shooter ends up being one of the most dull launch titles on the Xbox 360. The story is interesting enough to pull you through 10 hours of generic and brainless action, and the vehicular distractions are a quick and effortless blast, but that's about the furthest Quake 4 goes. If you're a Quake fan, I wouldn't question you if you rented the game but I'd have to frown down on anyone who decides to buy this game. There isn't enough here in terms of depth or new, modern shooter attractions. Pick up Perfect Dark Zero or Call of Duty 2 instead. Believe me, you won't regret it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2005"}

What unfolds over the 5 episodic chapters is one of the most intense, gripping, and emotional tales ever committed to digital media.At its core, The Walking Dead is very much a point and click adventure game, similar to the masterpieces made once upon a time by luminaries such as Sierra Online and LucasArts. But what differentiates The Walking Dead is its focus on narrative as opposed to puzzles. The game is very much a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" video game where you control Lee, and the plot unfolds based on the decisions that you make at critical plot points. In a world where the people you come across can be more horrifying than the hordes of undead, the relationships you choose to forge can make huge differences in the outcome of the game. But at the core of every decision you make will be your desire to protect little Clementine, one of the most sympathetic, genuine, and well-developed characters to ever appear in a video game. She is an absolute triumph, and forms the emotional center of this unforgettable tale.Whether you are a fan of zombies or not, The Walking Dead is not to be missed. It is an indicator of the storytelling potential of video games, and clearly establishes developer Telltale as a studio to watch going forward.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0009IX7K8","reviewerName":"Nathaniel V. Graham","summary":"Terrible PC port of a classic.","reviewText":"This review is for the PC port of the game, the original PS2 version is easily a 5 star product. The controls for the PC are so terrible that it goes beyond a simple lazy port, I think it was an actual joke by Rockstar on the PC users. Not since the early 90s has a default pc key configuration been literally impossible to use. For example, for the forklift mission, to control the forklift you use WASD to steer, the mouse to control the camera and to move the fork up and down they chose numberpad 8 and 2. Now try to hit W, number pad 8 and move your mouse at the same time. Easy, if you happen to have 3 arms. The number pad couldn't possibly be further away from WASD, that isn't just laziness, that is sabotage. The most fundamental control options simply don't exist. Doom, which came out in 1993, more than 10 years before GTA SA, allowed you to select a weapon with the 1-7 keys. In GTA you must cycle through your weapons with the mouse wheel. The last straw was when I failed to purchase chicken from the chicken restaurant because the command to EXIT was...(drum roll please) ENTER!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2013"}

Go wild with a new fighting system, larger tournament groups, detailed scoreboards and more. Form clans, or just enter the lobby areas to talk with other DOA fans.  Best of all, the fighting system allows even more mastery and strategy of your favorite character -- including the most complex DOA countering system yet!","reviewerName":"Adam B","summary":"Fighting FUN!","reviewText":"This is definitely my favorite, and in my opinion, the best fighting game to date.  There are so many different ways to play the game it's not even funny.  There are 23 characters this time around with new ones to choose from, including a Halo inspired Female Spartan.  You have your single player gametypes including story mode, time trials, and survival among others.  In story mode you pretty much play different matches against other characters (8 levels for each story mode, if I remember correctly).  You also have your cut-scenes and movie quality endings to actually make up a \"story.\"  The endings are awesome (especially one is particular...HELENA) and can each be re-watched when you complete the story mode for that character.  In Time Trial, you play through a certain amount of levels and you are timed throughout.  Your times, then, are ranked and put up in leaderboards over xbox live.  Then there is the Survival mode, which is basically you against a never ending boss.  You play, without stopping, against one other character, and when they are \"K.O.'d\" a new one comes in the ring to verse you.  You get back some of your health each time and there are also items to boost your score and for additional health. Both of the Time Trial and Survival modes can be played as singles or tag matches.There are also ways to play against other players in a verses mode or over xbox live.  The multiplayer portion of this game is awesome.  I find myself playing over xbox live for hours on end without losing any bit of amusement.  Like other games played via xbox live, there is a ranking system involved.  You can be anything from a F- to a SS.  It's pretty much like grade scale from F through A with the - and + signs, and then after A+ a player becomes an S, and then eventually a SS.  If you want to become a SS you are going to have to work a lot harder at it because there is a significant difference in points needed for each rank.  These points are obtained or lost by winning or losing games on xbox live.  Overall, this game is extremely fun and is hours and hours of fun.  It has definite replay value with its different modes and especially from its Xbox Live capabilities.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2006"}

I loved Allied Assault, but I think this one is better. I can back this up with several reasons. First, the story is great. It is the story of a young soldier going through first time experiences of battle. The game plays this to perfection, you feel like you are in each scenario for real. The gameplay is also phenominal, rivaling the likes of Halo, or Battlefield 1942. I found the story, plus the gameplay to be amazing, and surprisingly emotional. It was very touching for me, the way they handled Pearl Harbor. It was a complete, saddening experience. I have never played a game that showed it all, people drowning in air tight compartments, bombings, giant machine guns... All of this is dramatized by excellent voice acting, incredible sound effects, and heart wrenching music featuring orchestra and choir.The third highlight is GRAPHICS! These are the best I have ever seen in a PC game. Honestly, they are beautiful. The water actually reflects and looks glassy. The helmets show sunlight, and you can see particles of dirt and stuff. This is a major high point of an already excellent game.I do agree that the loading times are a little long, but not long enough to keep me from playing hours on end.

The game of course does play very similarly to SMB though with different levels and characters the basic style is there of course there aren't any fire flowers and such here though good old DK hardly seems to need them anyway. Of course you have two player co-op which is fun though it can get frustrating when you and your partner aren't on the same page on how to play through the levels sometimes.  The game music like with SMB is very catchy as it has a nice tempo throughout each level of gameplay, the graphics background detail is nicely done as you can tell the creative team really put their hearts into this game and it's appreciated.So if you already played the previous game this is a nice one to add to the series and for new comers a good game to play regardless.

{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Rocco","summary":"Finally a good game for Western aficionados","reviewText":"Deliver some lead in this spaghetti western videogame!Red is a gunner with a Clint Eastwood face (I would not be surprised if good old Clint sued Rockstar for using a skin that is a bit too close to his likeness). His parents were murdered when he was a child, his father's legendary gun, &quot;the Scorpion Revolver,&quot; robbed. Now that he is old and skilled with all sorts of weapons, Red is on a quest to avenge his parents, get that gun and kill anything that gets into his way.This game is an excellent western, and here are its game characteristics:Graphics: 9 out of 10.^^^^^^^^ Its like being at the movies, great 3D animation and wonderful graphic engine. The wild west finally revives...Sound: 10 out of 10.^^^^^ Music seem to come directly from the The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Sound FXs are perfect, voiceovers are well done.Atmosphere: 9 out of 10.^^^^^^^^^^ Story, voicovers, music, and graphics will all contribute to a perfect western experience. Gun slinging, western humour, duels... you get everything.Gameplay: 8 out of 10.^^^^^^^^ Yes good, but a bit too arcade &quot;kill them all.&quot; You will have a LOT of fun though, expecially if you like things simple and entertaining. Plus, not only you command Red around the game, you will use also a cast of other 5 perfectly designed characters.The Bottom Line:Thus is a GOOD BUY:1) for western movie fans.2) for Rockstar Game fans.3) for action oriented gamers tired of battling undead that jump out of the sewers or aliens in airshafts.For all others, this is a possibly good game on which to spend your money, as its overall quality is undeniably great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2004"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or braving it solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesHunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone.

The location is changed from a large shopping mall to \"Fortune City\", a Vegas-like strip full of casinos, movie theaters, and restaurants, but the basic gameplay is the same: use whatever you can to defeat zombies and save your fellow humans.One of the main differences between DR1 and DR2 is the character's \"special ability\". In DR1, you played as a photographer, so the player could take pictures to earn experience points. In DR2, you play as a character with a mechanical background, so your special ability is to combine things to form new weapons. Dead Rising had a lot of improvised weapons (basically anything you found in the mall could be picked up and used as a weapon, from park benches to trash cans to handfuls of jewelry), but in DR2 these items can be combined. Some of them are simple (baseball bat + nails = baseball bat with nails in it), some of them are peculiar (jewelry + leaf blower = shotgun-like gem launcher), and some of them are outright insane (it's possible to make a fully-functional lightsaber).Another change from Dead Rising 1 is that the game feels a lot easier overall. The zombies present more of an obstacle, but survivors are much smarter (compared to DR1's survivors, who had to be led around every step of the way) and solving the main plot is pretty hard to mess up. One feature of the Dead Rising games is the fact that you can restart the game with your earned experience. In DR1 this was necessary because it was difficult to beat the game on your first try, because of how much time it took to rescue survivors. In DR2, it's pretty easy to beat it on the first or second try, which sort of cut down on replay value. Dead Rising 2 is full of little changes that make the game a lot more convenient - better AI, easier missions, the radio is less annoying, and so on. The funny thing about this is that while these are all good changes, they almost make the game \"too\" easy. It's not a bad thing, just a notable change.The graphics are pretty good. There's a wide variety of environments, from shopping areas to different theme casinos, and basically it feels like a place where people would really work and shop (for the most part). This helps drive home the nature of the zombie apocalypse scenario. In competing zombie franchise \"Left 4 Dead\", many of the environments seemed deliberately made, rather than depicting \"actual locations\". Dead Rising 2 does a better job at seeming like a real place overrun by zombies.Overall, Dead Rising 2 was a lot of fun to go through. Veterans of the first game may find a lot of stuff familiar (things like which foods restore the most health and so on), but the new combination system will give even the most invested DR1 players something new to experiment with. Those new to the series will be able to spend a few hours trying out different weapons, items, and foods to see what works best for them, as well as exploring the whole of Fortune City. Dead Rising 2 is a game with a lot of meat to it, and is both fun and content-rich.Rating: 9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Sheree D","summary":"awesome","reviewText":"This game is in my top 5 favorite games Gears of War,Halo1,Halo2,bioshock,halo 3 this game is amazing i like it more than the 1st Halo thtis game is awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Back to Basics","reviewText":"The Ratchet & Clank Series has come a long way over the years, but this is the game that started it all.  If you're new to Ratchet & Clank, the concept is a simple one:  Ratchet is (he thinks!) the last of his kind.  He is a whiz with gadgets and mechanics, and as we kick off the series he quickly falls into the role of 'Hero', taking on one small quest after another, building to the biggest, which is to save the galaxy from an opportunistic alien bent on conquering everybody.  Ratchet's sidekick is a clever little robot named Clank.  Clank not only helps him figure things out, he serves as some of Ratchet's gadgets, transforming into gadgets like a helicopter backpack, and more.  Clank also gets some play-time of his own, too:  there are times when you get to navigate him around a smaller-scale world, often enlisting the help of his fellow robots.  The world of Ratchet & Clank is a sci-fi world where there are plenty of planets to explore and all kinds of interesting life forms, most of whom want to kill you (but a few would settle for a good 3-lap race or two).  Dialogue varies from funny to downright hilarious, and there is enough variety in your objectives to keep things from getting boring.The beauty of the Ratchet & Clank series is that it marries both sides of platform heaven:  Ratchet gives you the jumping-action-shooting, while Clank lets you play strategy-maze-puzzle styled areas.  As a whole the series is quite fun, and each installment seems to come up with more gadgets and fun things to do than the entire run of Warner Brothers' Roadrunner/Coyote cartoons.  As you go from place to place, the bolts you collect can be used to buy new weapons and ammo, as well as creative little gadgets:  for example, one device is a suction gun designed to drain water from various levels...but can also be used to vacuum up smaller enemies and then toss them at larger ones!If you're a fan of Ratchet and Clank and you know your way around, you'll have to be a little forgiving of this title:  it's not as polished as the later entries.  You won't have as many gadgets, and you will have enough minor button or camera problems to remind you that the early days of platforming were not a perfect science.  If you're completely new to the series, this is still a good place to start.  It's fun, it's got entertaining characters and dialogue, and bouncy, cheery music that makes this very first Ratchet & Clank tons of fun.  I'd love to see them remake a \"Ratchet Trilogy\" with this title, as has been done for Sly Cooper.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

I knew it would be good, but I wasn't really interested until I heard about some comparison's to one of my fav old games, pitfall. I ordered this game and beat it within 3 days of its arrival on my doorstep. I absolutelly cannot wait until Uncharted 2 is released.This game is 1 part Pitfall, 2 parts Tomb Raider, 1/2 part Syphon Filter(control-wise), and 5 parts hollywood adventure film. Never before have I seen a game come so close to an actual movie in script, story, and dialogue(note that I played this before MGS4 came out ;p ) and actually laughed out loud many times during the journey. The voice acting is outstanding and the script is quite witty for videogame fair. The movie scenes are always short and too the point, but compelling while they last. It really feels like your there in the midst of the chase-scenes and such. The atmosphere of the game is its greatest asset though as the landscape is shwon in near perfect detail. I have never seen the lighting or gorgeous sunlight effects this game has in any other \"console\" game. Climbing from ledge to ledge, I actually found myself at points just angling the camera a bit to catch the perfect view of the distant sunset shimmering off the nearby plane wreckage, or the waterfalls cascading down 100 feet below to a rapidly flowing river waiting for you to fall headlong into its depths.The shooting elements, the platforming elements, and everything in between is perfect. I figured this game would just have some lame throwback shooting system but its actually very fine-tuned and works better than most I've played. If you played Gears of War and thought those controls were to your liking due to the tightness in all aspects, then you will find solace in the fact that these controls feel just as simple and smooth.The only drawback I can think of for this game is that its much too short. You can beat it under 10 hours, maybe less than 5-6 if you really know where your going. I can't express enough, however, that this absolutelly does NOT mean you should bypass this gaming journey. On the contrary, the short time you spend playing this game will only serve to stregthen the experience as you will probably find yourself appreciating it that much more for its jam-packed content.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2008"}

Powell's Review is spot on. I found myself compelled to still put my 5 cents in, just in case the developers read these comments for the inevitable sequel.When you start the game, everything looks and plays awesome and you believe that the developers finally 'got it right'. But it seems they had a few great ideas, but then implemented them repetitiously throughout the game. Basically, every city is exactly the same, with a different color scheme. I loved the tower climbing/map idea, but after the 30th time... it gets old.The fighting engine is great, but after being attacked every 2 minutes for no reason didn't bode well for the fun factor. One thing I would ad to J Powell's review is the totally useless backstory of the 'real' assassin. Basically, you're going from your experimental science table to the bed in your room, and back. You get to read a few emails, but that's pretty much it. I was wishing for a 'run' option, to make it pass more quickly, so I could get back to climbing another tower.In the end, there is some fun to be had, but it gets old fast. There are some awesome ideas in this game and they are executed quite well, but there simply isn't enough variety to the gameplay and what you can do with it. It's like watching \"A Christmas Story\" once a week all year long.

Heard it was like a lamer version of Mario Party. Boy I tell ya, disinformation is a hell of a thing. Some guy on Youtube asked me (completely out of the blue) to play with him online in Fortune Street cuz he saw I had the game from a comment I made. I was like \"what?! That crap has online?!\". So I decided to try it out. If it weren't for him I'd never know how awesome this game was. This game is a A LOT of fun, and even cooler with the online mode.The game outside of any of the gaming modes kinda lags lol. The graphics are choppy as hell with light detail. Only when you start a game it's good. This game is NOT like Mario Party, it's like Monopoly, but different so it's original. Up to four players, human or AI, and you use your Miis. You can customize the hell out of your Miis. Outfits, poses, gestures, the way they walk, your player description and gameplay style. It's cool. Now there are a bunch of people from all over the world who's friend codes I've added and we play online all the time. It's great.

That is the question I asked myself when I picked it up from my local gamestop for $30.  I really enjoyed playing Red Dead Redemption, and so playing Undead Nightmare should be a similar experience.  However, it was different - for a variety of reasons.  First, the storyline is kinda set in limbo (there's not really any time in the first game for this to happen if you play straight through), although this doesn't matter, as the attitude presented in the beginning fits in perfectly with the end of RDR before the Army betrayed Marston.  The combat is great, but it must be stated:  DON'T TRY STANDING TOE-TO-TOE WITH THE ZOMBIES, especially in towns.  They can come from anywhere and overwhelm you quick.  You can't carry grenade launchers or machine guns, so ammo capacity per weapon is a concern and must be taken into consideration.  It is easy to run out of ammo quick, so headshots are a must, as anything else just staggers the zombies.The key characters from the first one play parts in this game, and it is a nice touch, from having to kill MacFarlane's father to seeing Seth play cards with a zombie (what?!?) - it drives home the reality of the RDR world gone mad.  The only thing that really makes one more cautious about gameplay is that shops are not open for purchasing tobacco or moonshine (to boost the dead eye meter), so you have to strategize and make every second count.If you love zombie movies, this game is for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXKQ","description":"","reviewerName":"matt","summary":"Really fun games, lasts for hours upon hours!","reviewText":"I reluctantly bought this game because I had heard things like, &#34;they should never focus a game on the sailing part of the 3rd one&#34;. But I figured I would try it out. To my surprise it was actually really entertaining and addictive. I will make a list to make reading easier.Pros:- PIRATES! Who doesn't love pirates? And to be honest this game has created something super fun that hasn't really been done before.- Open world to sail and plunder! You can go around and explore islands and settlements, as well as open ocean- Many activities to part-take in. From Whaling and gambling, to attacking and boarding enemy ships, you can spend hours just sailing around not even continuing the story.- Nice graphics and visuals. As always Ubisoft has made their next AC with great landscapes and towns, fully immersing you into 1715 villages and islands, untouched and beautiful.Cons:- As of late the stories of AC have dwindled. This story seems a little short when it comes to involving the player in a deeper story such as AC1 or AC2. It was an OK story, but they could have done much better.- The fighting system is still lacking. Once again, since AC1, the fighting system is far too easy and mundane. You can simply wait for your opponent to attack then counter him and kill him with one button, even though the kills looks cool, you don't feel like you are really trying. (For the ground fighting, not naval battles).- Sometimes the free running doesn't work the way you want. As you're running through towns or forests sometimes Edward (your character) decides to do a 90 degree turn and run up a wall or tree, if you get too close. This makes for some frustrating sequences if you are trying to escape some guards. You will be running towards a hay stack, then he will jump onto the ledge next to it and over it instead of in it.Over all this is a really fun game and deserves a play through. If you want to save money I would say buy a used copy, but maybe not rent it because you will want more time to just go around and plunder the seas ;)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2014"}

This is probably one of the best looking DS games out there right now with this FPS survival horror running at 60 FPS it's fast, smooth, and very creepy. Yes, the game is actually creepy kind of like Silent Hill creepy. The game is full of weird monsters, mind boggling puzzles, and creepy atmosphere and ambiance.The game controls really well, but the actual size of the DS makes your wrists cramp up and go numb all the time. If you've played Metroid Prime: Hunters then you know the whole set up, but if you haven't then I'll tell you. You move your reticule around with the stylus so this feels real and also makes things a lot easier (yeah PSP!) while you move around with the A, B, X, Y (if you're left handed) or the D-pad (if you're right handed). You have your inventory right under your health bar (which is your heart monitor) so you can just touch the weapons you want on the fly and this makes combat easy and fast.While the game play is pretty straight forward (double tap B or Up to run) you just run around shooting the weird monsters and solve the annoying puzzles. Yes I said annoying because the hallways all look the same and it's easy to get lost in the labyrinthine buildings and hallways with a terrible map and no sense of direction. This is not good since your wrists are cramping and going numb while you hold it in 20 different positions. The map is just a bunch of lines with yellow dots for doors and there's no way to tell where you have been. You can write on your notepad and leave notes, but this proves useless for the map and only good to jot down clues and codes for keypads.The whole level design is just stupidly annoying with fallen over vending machines, desks, chairs and anything else a hospital has blocking hallways and doors so you have to find your way around EVERYTHING. Since you lose track of where you were last you'll tear your hair out because of the retarded save system and this kills the whole game. You'll spend a good 20 minutes on one level and then die because there are 10 enemies coming after you and you only have 3 bullets. Dying forces you to restart the ENTIRE chapter all over again even when you at the boss fight at the end of the chapter. I really tried loving this game since I absolutely adore survival horror games and I'm very very forgiving with them (read my Alone in the Dark review) so I suffered through 5/16 chapters. The thing is it wasn't so bad until I picked up the game again 4 months later and realized why I stopped playing...the retarded save system.I also really hate how ammo is so scarce in the game when there are so many enemies to fight off; this and the fact that enemies respawn when you re-enter a room so all the ammo you saved up for the boss are now spend on enemies you killed 4 times already. I don't know what Gamecock was thinking, but they must not play survival horror games much. Survival horror games need to have really good maps, a way to save clues, no respawning enemies, and a good save system. The whole point is to \"survive\" so you have to scrounge what you have around you. This game really shows how to NOT make a survival horror game, so please just consider this before even renting this game.What made me actually want to like the game is that it looks so amazing and plays so damn well. The game is very creepy with eerie music, spooky sound effects such as babies crying, water dripping, doors creaking, lightning, thunder, rain pounding on roofs. The game is also very dark so you need your trusty flashlight and this is where the \"Doom 3 meets Silent Hill\" aspect comes in since you can only either use your flashlight or your gun. Since the DS isn't very powerful there's a black \"fog of war\" all around you so when you turn your flashlight off for some reason you can only see 2 steps in front of you, but your flashlight can illuminate a 30 foot hall. This is actually a hardware fault and nothing on the developers, but you really don't ever notice it. The game's monsters are very creepy with zombies that have their chests open up an shoot poison at you, weird creepy things that crawl around the ceilings, nasty slugs that give out high pitched sonic screams, really freaky bosses that I can't even being to describe, there's blood all over the halls, broken windows, papers, books, and whatever you can think of thrown everywhere so the whole place feels deserted and you feel like your all alone.I don't remember much about the story, but I do remember that you wake up in a hospital and you are trying to find your way out so it has a Silent Hill feel there. The game also has highly detailed textures and great lighting effects (as I've described) like lights (and your flashlight) flickering on and off, and there's lots of detail in everything. Puzzles are solved by finding papers and clues as to where to find keys, codes, and even solving certain random puzzles to open boxes, doors, etc. If you want an idea on what the puzzles are like they are exactly like the Silent Hill puzzles we have all grown to hate so you know what to expect. Overall, the game looks and plays great, but the punishing save system, scarce ammo and health, maze like hallways, and terrible map ruin this otherwise great survival horror experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Inevitably, the idea was expanded to a toy line, then a video game franchise, then (shudder) a movie franchise.  Frankly, of all the \"Big 3\" spin offs, the video game series proved to be the best.  Starting ironically on the ill-fated Atari Jaguar, AvP was first created as a Doom-ish corridor shooter.  It was much slower paced than Doom or other FPS games of the time, but it somehow successfully captured the feeling of playing as the Alien, the Predator and the Colonial Marines.  Each species had its own unique play style, with arguably the Alien being the most unique of the three.  It wasn't until 1999, some 5 years later, that the same team that developed the original (and probably only) Jaguar \"killer app\" would bring one of the most memorable and awesome FPS shooters since the genre was invented.Fast forward 11 years, and you have 2010's  Aliens vs. Predator for the PC, XBox 360 and PS3.  So what's the verdict?This review pertains solely to the 360 edition, as the PC edition has enough features to set it apart that it would warrant its own separate review.  What it boils down to is a re-imagining of the franchise, bringing with it yet again more unique features and gameplay styles across the three separate playable species.  Harkening back to its 1999 predecessor and drawing far less inspiration from the 2002 sequel, AvP is an ultra-violent and medium-paced FPS that combines corridor/wide area shooting battles, stealth and assassination techniques.  Each species experiences the same story from their own perspective, with each campaign being continuous and not an \"alternate outcome\".  Players piece together the story by playing through the 3 separate campaigns, particularly in the Marine campaign wherein the player learns the most about Weyland-Yutani director Karl Bishop Weyland's goal of unleashing the potential of an ancient Predator temple that was discovered buried deep within a Predator ancestral world, along with utilizing a new breed of controlled Alien.Each scenario offers up a different play style that may not be accommodating to all players, as the three species are different enough that it requires some practice.  Thankfully, each campaign begins with a tutorial mission (except the Marine mission, you simply learn as you go throughout the first mission).  It is in the first two missions of the Alien and Predator campaigns that the player will learn the abilities of both species, as well as how to perform executions...ultra-gruesome instant-kill maneuvers that are vicious enough to possibly disturb some players.  Once the tutorial ends, the player uses said abilities in a short stint of combat training as part of the plot, and then the actual campaign begins.The Alien campaign is entirely stealth based...a true expert Alien player can get through most Alien missions without being detected, except for situations that call for direct combat.  The stealth-based gameplay may seem slow-paced, as there is much navigational challenges, but the blinding speed of the alien and the sheer brutality of its instant kills make for an exciting experience.The Predator campaign consists of stealth, maneuverability and occasionally situations with heavy fighting.  Like the Alien, the Predator will rely heavily on stealth and ambush tactics (aided by his ability to Cloak and jump great distances), utilizing ghastly execution moves and sophisticated weaponry capable of widespread havoc with the occasional forced firefight.The Marine campaign is your standard corridor/open area FPS with extra challenge thrown in...Aliens take a LOT of shots to bring down, and all it takes is one screw up to end your mission.  It stands out as being the most frightening campaign, since you lack the superhuman abilities of your extraterrestrial enemies and spend a lot of time wandering dimly lit corridors with very little ammo...or none at all.This game has seen its fair share of criticism, and I understand why.  As a HUGE fan of the franchises (I shun the AvP movies however) it was an absolute thrill to play again as my favorite iconic movie monsters.  The gameplay has evolved tremendously since the old 1999 predecessor and the game engine is smooth and sweet.  However, many ugly problems rear their head early on in the game, but lets break it down:The Good:This game is as close to experiencing the species as you will get.  Everything about the Predator and Alien is represented faithfully.  There is a coherent story attached to the game that, once you play through all 3 campaigns, comes together rather nicely.  The graphics are outstanding, and the level of detail is truly amazing.  The grace of leaping through trees as the Predator and the primal feeling of stalking prey as the Alien are both rewarding gameplay experiences.  The violence is unlike anything I have ever seen, and frankly the execution maneuvers are among the most gruesome video game deaths I have ever borne witness to.  How this game got past certain censors is amazing.  The marine experience is difficult but rewarding for the sheer terror it invokes.  Overall, the single player campaign is a fun, if short, experience.The Bad:What you've heard about the control is true...it's pretty awful.  While I didn't experience vertigo as many endlessly complained about, I found that the controls for the Alien's wall crawling abilities were terrible.  The Alien would get stuck on objects, endless spinning in circles when all you want to do is dismount.  Sometimes it would even mount a wall you don't want it to.  Predator controls are sensible but confusing in a fast paced fight, and frankly the difficulty and species balance is way off.  Marines have superior firepower but the cruddy targeting system (even on the smartgun) results in countless needless deaths, ESPECIALLY in multiplayer.  And that's where the game gets...The Ugly:Multiplayer is a mess.  On the 360, finding a game can take over ten minutes.  There are no dedicated servers, and there is tremendous lag at times.  What is worse, the game does not revert to a new host if the host player leaves...it simply ends the match.  There goes your hard earned points and your progression towards new skins for your characters.  It is plagued with untalented and cheap players who rely on Predator instant kill weapons such as the disc and shoulder cannon.  These spammers make the game a chore to play, and it quickly loses its fun.  From what I can gather there are only two multiplayer modes: Predator Instant Kill Avoidance or Marine vs. Alien.  Apparently they have tried to patch this but these no-talent spammers always find an instant kill weapon to abuse.  The executions are also extremely frustrating, taking you out of anything you are doing, even jumping in mid-air.  They can sometimes become hysterical, as a chain of 5 or 6 players will all instant kill one another in sequence.Furthermore, the lack of support this game has received is unbelievable.  No Dedicated Servers or patch updates...multiplayer is a mess, and finding a match 8 months into this game's lifespan is now impossible as players have become frustrated with the flaws and moved on to other games.  Let's not even get started on the atrocious DLC.  $8 FOR TWO $*(#ING MAPS THAT NO ONE PLAYS?!Also, the single player campaign draws influence from the AvP movies...I think I just threw up in my mouth.Overall:Great but short single player experience.  Fun but seriously flawed multiplayer that gets old quick.  Poor support.  Overpriced and useless DLC.Franchise fans: Definitely pick it upGenre fans: Worth a rentCasual gamers: Barely worth a rentHardcore gamers/FPS gurus: Completely AvoidGraphics: 5/5Control: 2.5/5Fun Factor: 3/5Multiplayer/Online: 1/5DLC/Patch Support: ZEROIf you want a great AvP experience, go with the PC version.  I regret taking the 360 over the PC version, which I did only because I had 8 friends who promised they'd play.  They all got sick of it in less than a week.  Sad but true.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}

I thought I was blown away by Uncharted 2. I was but I am even more so with God Of War 3. Unbelievably, God Of War 3 floored me from the 30 minute opening sequence to the mind blowing finale. How did Sony Santa Monica pull this off? The SCALE of this game will boggle the mind and make your jaw hit the floor! When I first played the demo some 3 months ago I was in awe. After having played through every luscious drop of GOW 3 I am spellbound beyond belief. If I could only use one word to describe this game: EPIC! Remember the old home arcade system Neo Geo and SNK's motto for it \"Bigger, Badder, Better\"? This applies to GOW 3 in spades.Upon first sight of GOW 3 you'll notice that the high def graphics are probably the best, on any system anywhere, computer gaming rigs included. Sony really tapped into the \"true\" power of the PS3 with this one. Some of the things I saw in this game is making me think it was all a dream because it just isn't possible in games, right? Wrong. Seeing the gigantic titans filling up the whole screen in perfect graphical splendor, on a 50 in. plasma, all the while Kratos is scaling it, and fighting a boss(Poseidon) on it, is completely amazing. Gamers, this is what we live for! The detail of not just the titans, the environments, and the Ghost of Sparta himself, but the minor enemies, such as the skeleton warriors, is astonishing. And seeing 15 or so of these skeleton warriors pile on Kratos and then seeing him violently power them off is unbelievably cool and empowering. It almost makes you feel like a god! The sheer power you feel controlling Kratos and watching him annihilate everything in his path in the name of vengeance will cast a spell over you.The combat control is much the same as before, if not better. In other words, the control is flawless and if ain't broke don't fix it philosphy applies here. There are timed button presses for the boss battles(quick timed events). And bosses there will be. Some of them are absolutely enormous, such as Hades. Dealing death to the bosses is quite a sight. Impale them. Check! Rip off body parts. Check! Let blood and guts flow like a river. Check! This is one of the goriest and most violently graphic games I've seen. EVER! Kratos can still have sex in GOW 3! Always a welcome addition. Even one scene with a goddess! I think what might impress me most besides the scale of the game, is the number of enemies that can be on screen at one time. At times, there had to be close to 50 or more on screen. That is incredible considering it's running at 60 FPS the entire time with no slowdown. All of that even when there are cyclopses and minotaurs on the same screen, along with a titan in the background. Ridiculously amazing!The story, sadly, was the most disappointing part of the game. It seemed a bit convoluted; like too much was going on with too many different characters. The story is not bad mind you and it`s easy to follow, it just feels like it's taking a major backseat to everything else. Still, it takes nothing away from the greatness of GOW 3. The puzzles in the game are challenging without being overly so and some of them very clever and ingenious. More than a few I was a bit stumped by. All in all it took me about 10 to 12 hours to roll through this masterpiece. I don't really remember how long it took me to go through each of the first two, so I can't compare length. While a bit short, for my taste, it was still one hell of a magnificent ride! The camera still can't be controlled by the player, but that has never bothered me and I think it was put to even better use this time around. It seems the angles and various shots are Hollywoodesque, if that makes any sense.Weapons! The Cestus easily steals the show of the several new ones that you'll earn. The Cestus is completely WICKED! The combo moves are spectacular and more so than ever before and you can now swap weapons on the D-pad in the middle of one. When surrounded by a bunch of baddies and knowing you have different button options to pound the pulp out of them is especially gratifying. The use of the bow and arrow is easy and very useful. Very cool shooting the harpies with it and grabbing on to them to further your progress across chasms or to the top of places well out of your reach. I like the fact that now the bow quickly recharges after each use. I love being able to pick up enemies and charge with them, using them as a battering ram on other baddies. Completely awesome! Controlling the cyclops is amazing as well; swinging him around and pulping your enemies is gleefully sadistic. It must be experienced! You level up your health and magic much the same way as the two previous GOW's via feathers, stones, and now, minotaur horns.The music is excellent! But hasn't the music always been excellent in the series? The voice acting IMHO is top notch. Seems even better than before. The action and pace of the game are relentless. Something new(and amazing) and unique is always happening to keep you glued to the screen; even if it happens only once. There is so much more I could go on talking about with this stunning, amazing, and breathtaking game known as God Of War 3, but I`d be here for a while and then you`d be bored;)I don't care what genre of games you like or whether or not you even like GOW 3 type games, this is a game that absolutely MUST be experienced. I won't say this is my favorite game of all time, but it's right there at the top with Uncharted 2, Modern Warfare 2, Metal Gear 4, and Resident Evil 4. I don't care if you have to get an extra job(gulp), rob a convenient store(gasp) or steal if off your friend(yeah!) you have got to get this SOON! I've been playing games for 30+ years(since the days of Colecovision) and I've never been this AMAZED by a game! There is so much diversity, so much to see, so much so tightly packed in such a spectacular game that it will make you wonder how they pulled it oof. Folks, the next generation of gaming has arrived and I am stunned, blown away, mesmerized and spellbound by what Sony Santa Monica created. My hat goes off to them for they are a TRULY talented team! Kudos of accolades go to Stig Asmussen for his brilliant direction of this game and for making it so much more than I thought possible.This seems to be the end of this GOW saga and I hope we'll see more of Kratos in the future, because this is only a scratch on the video game surface of the great things the future could hold for the Ghost of Sparta. I am truly moved!It's a 10/10 experience!ARE YOU GOING TO JOIN THE SPARTAN ARMY NOW?SIDE NOTE(or bottom note) - I'm not sure why this game was released earlier than it's scheduled March 16th release date. I had originally preordered GOW 3 on Amazon, but after I found I could get it nearly a week earlier on eBay I cancelled my Amazon pre-order. Not that I'm complaining about any of that. The same thing happened with Modern Warfare 2. I'd like to know how people are getting these games so early. The guy I bought my copy from on eBay said he'd had his copies since March 6th,. He wouldn't elaborate as to where he got them. I received mine on March 11th. I had to pay and arm and a leg for it, but it was worth every dime.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2010"}

Hard to tell why since I had a perfectly good Playstation 3 working and with good exclusives but like most people, the other team has cool stuff too. Playing it endlessly at the time of its release, I find it graphically stunning, fun to play and Horde mode was a bit addicting. But time has a habit of lessening the impact and while I still say Gears of War 2 is an extremely well-executed game, some aspects of it bug the **** out of me.Story: Taking place several months after the end of the original, citizens have been reported being sick by something called Rustlung disease thanks to the Lightmass bomb detonation. To make matters worse, entire cities have been sinking into the ground and the last city stronghold Jacinto is next and so Marcus Fenix and friend Dom Santiago decide to take the fight to the Locust stronghold and hopefully find Dom's missing wife, Maria.The problem ultimately with the story is 2 things: one concerns Cliff Bleszinki's claim that the story is more personal. And while there's an actual reason for Dom in this one, too often does it feel like they skimped on the extra elements that would've made the story work. Okay the character Maria, who we have to save and who Dom keeps obsessing about finding, is introduced in one flashback scene and only mainly seen in a photograph. Would've been nice to at least get some extra development on her character considering she's one of the key figures in the story. Secondly is Epic's love for setpieces or namely outdoing their last one. Yes sequels always have a \"bigger, badder, better\" mentality but what made the original work is the bigger gunfights mixed in with more quieter and different chapters. Recall the Kryll section from the first one. Here it feels like you're just constantly shooting ****.Graphics: Yes Gears of War 2 is definately one of the more superb looking games on the Xbox 360. The lighting, the detail on character's faces, the more improved architecture and changes in fight encounters make this more advanced than the original, which is pretty amazing still. However, as most people have complained, there's an extremely noticeable \"same-y\" feeling to it, what with the greys and browns. Multiplayer doesn't have the same level of detail though that's a given and lag can hit so watch out.Sound/Music: There's 2 different things to look at in regards to voice acting: the acting and the scripts since its what the actors have to actually say. Some actors can deliver awful lines with gusto and that's a case here since a lot of these lines are just...bad and not a whole lot of character development either but at least the actors do a good job with the lines themselves. The music is big, epic and frequently engaging,making the bigger firefights that much more awesome. Although I am getting tired of the theme that plays during matchmaking though.Gameplay: Same thing as before since the game isn't like Call of Duty or Halo where you can just run and shoot; this time you have to find cover, pop off some rounds and get back down. It's not as magnetic as it was in the first one where you'd attach to walls you didn't want to and they're quite easy to pick up on. Weapon selection is mapped to D-Pad with default Lancer being right, left being shotgun/bow/sniper rifle etc, up's your grenades, down's your pistols. Aside from the wonky d-pad making you pick a pistol when you wanted the shotgun, it's a lot more faster and immediate than having to scroll through your lists a la Half-Life 2 let's say.Co-op of course is here but this time there's a special feature: individual difficulties. Say you beat the game and want to beat it on Insane with a buddy (seeing as how the AI is still pathetic). Well rather than tackling insane on both sides, one guy can be on Casual, other's on Insane and just let Casual do all the work up front while Insane snipes from the back. It makes getting that achievement easier but I hate going through single player since the AI on your friends are a little...screwed. One thing: the Friends with Benefits achievement unlocks if the entire game is in co-op, so if for one second somebody logs out, it messes up the achievement and you have to find a friend and pick chapter start. Worse thing is that it actually doesn't tell you WHAT chapters you're missing so it becomes a dart throwing game on a map where you randomly pick an act and hope your missing chapter's in there.The big draw and the one reason people will repeatedly play Gears of War 2 is the multiplayer. There's quite a few modes from a Capture the Flag variant where the flag is a gun-toting brat who doesn't want to be captured, King of the Hill with hills frequently changing location, Wingman where you and a buddy take on 4 2-player teams and the ever-popular Horde mode. You and 4 others take on 50 waves of locusts that get stronger after every 10. While it's very fun (though slightly boring if you've beaten all 50), would've liked to see variances in the waves since they just repeat the next time and a surprise round would've been nice.However I will say that after 3 title updates, there's still a lot of kinks to get ironed out and it's strange how the talented guys at Epic still can't seem to get this one right. Weapon damage is inconsistent (guy survives 3 shotgun blasts to the face at point-blank range, he gets one shot 10 feet away and poof!), lag can be frequent, matchmaking can be long and disconnects can result in loss of EXP. Why can't it be like Call of Duty where individual actions bring EXP and not disconnects or Halo where EXP only comes from winning the match. People play to win not find all their hard work vanishing because you had the one bad connection match. So of course naturally most of the achievements are in multiplayer. How lovely.Gears of War 2 is one of the most successful games of 2008 but it's still not a flawless experience but that doesn't stop people from flocking to it in droves. Give it a play though I find other games have been eating up my time lately.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}

Neo Cortex is back, and he means to rid himself of Crash once and for all. To energize his most diabolical creation to date, Cortex channels the power of the Elementals, a group of renegade masks with the destructive power of air, earth, water, and fire. To stop the Elementals and Cortex's new weapon, Crash or Coco (a fully playable character for the first time) will face five game hubs, 25 dynamic levels, and five unique bosses, as well as a new character that will rock the Crash world.You can complete specific levels of the game to play as Crash's fiery sister. Coco will have a wide variety of moves and animations tailored to fit her personality. New free-roam sections will be implemented within certain levels of the game. These sections feature puzzles and hidden areas never before seen in a Crash game. New bosses and minibosses offer up a Noah's Ark-sized list of new creatures.

The graphics are spectacular and the music is the usual Crash Bandicoot style stuff. The controls are easy to pick up. They even added a few new types of levels (i.e. rolling crash bandicoot. Imagine super monkey ball with crash inside the ball :)). It is kind of short, but what is there is extremely fun (although sometimes irritating). The reason I gave this game a 3 star rating is because of two things. The first is the load times. It takes (on average) 45 seconds-1 min to load each level. This wouldn't be bad, but that brings me to the second problem. There is no loading bar, so you can't see how much longer it's gonna be. Plus, while you are waiting for it to load, this annoying alarm type noise plays. Now, put all that together and imagine sitting there for a minute not knowing how much longer they are gonna torture you with that annoying noise. This prevented me from beating the game because I refused to wait for the loading screen. I have heard that the gamecube version is much better with the load times, although I wouldn't know because I didn't want to buy the same game for two systems. Definately buy this game if you are a Crash Bandicoot fan, but I reccommend the GCN version instead of the PS2 version.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2002"}
{"product_name":"B003GT8IL0","description":"","reviewerName":"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF \"Wolf\"","summary":"F.E..A.R. 3 best $18.00 I EVER SPENT!","reviewText":"UPDATE: At first I hated this game. You see I am autistic as such many of the games more subtle cues I like totally miss. Unfortunately in FEAR 3 you really have to search the game world for weapons. Also in Fear 3 you can't just shoot everything that attacks you. In FEAR 3 it pays off big to Maylee some of the creatures you encounter. It is especially effective if you just beat the pig like gray to orange glowing creatures to death by stabbing them repeatedly. The ice blue dudes were hard to kill at first but eventually one gets a taste for it even a knack. I am not a man long on patience when it comes to video games. Honestly on Easy Mode I was able to win against the game in campaign mode and if was both difficult and fun for me once, I mastered an understanding of how the game wanted to be played.FEAR 3 is a lot of fun but only if you adopt the playing style dictated by the game which makes the game less fun and more linear. FEAR 3 does do something I find painfully bad in any video game. I have found that when playing video games there are some weapons I love far more than others. Generally speaking give me a quick loading sniper rifle and no enemy is safe no matter where or how far away he is. When I am armed with a powerful sniper rifle with an equally powerful look down sight any enemy I see is living on barrowed time and I will collect their debt permanently.With each installment of FEAR 3 the game just takes your favorite gums away and replaces them with the garbage guns the game wants you to have. Un a FPS there is no relationship more scared that that between a player and their favorite gun. What made matters worse is Fear 3 had one of the BEST Sniper Rifles I had ever been honored to use in any game. The FEAR 3 Sniper weapon made enemies just explode and the sensation of killing was a visual visceral state of near carnal rapture that never got old. After learning when to use it the laser gun was also a big favorite. Driving and killing everything that moved using those huge lumbering MECH's was also a much improved totally awesome experience in FEAR 3. The dialogue in FEAR 3 just was not as funny and over the top as it had been in FEAR 2. FEAR 2 set the standard for soldier dialogue, it was vulgar, common and had comedic timing that few video games could match with maybe the exception of Borderlands!The Fear 3 ending was rather uninspired. Interval 8 the final installment in Fear 3 was not nearly long enough, involving enough or satisfying enough. The disorientation effects were way over the top and were not much more than a bother than adding any excitement. The game itself was rather strong and fun which made the ending appear lame and weak. I enjoyed the story through much of the game play. I enjoyed some of the locales. The game play was too liniar. Since the game allowed you to carry only two weapns types I think it should have let you always keep the weapons you like most. Also ammo is scare in FEAR 3 a fact that makes the game more tedious rather than more fun.All in all however for the tiny $18.00 investment I made buying this game I could have done worse and often have. For its price $18.00 as of this writing FEAR 3 was one heck of a fun filled ride. To give you a sense of how horrible I am at playing video games most folk breeze through FEAR 3 on easy mode in approximately 6 hours so I hear. It took me three days to get through FEAR 3 on Easy Mode! So no I got few if any time bonus points in FEAR 3. But when all is said and done even with its few flaws FEAR 3 was a hoot and for $18.00 buying it was a no-brainer.P.S. Do not buy F.E.A.R. 3 from Amazon.com.  It is rare that Amazon.com gets beat on price to this horrible degree.  In the pricing of FEAR 3 the Amazon.com price got undercut so bad almost makes me want to laugh.  The Amazon.com price is more than twice as high as the Amazon.com allied seller stores as of this writing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

This is ridiculous! Never have I felt a game deserved full price ($60) more. Best of all, I'm not getting tired of it anytime soon cause it is just that damn fun.Like another reviewer, I too bought this and God of War 3 around the same time. Finished GOW3 on a single weekend and haven't played it since. Don't get me wrong GOW3 was great but no where near as addictive as Just Cause 2 (or as big).Almost every conceivable action sequence you can think of is in this game. I've played through almost every action movie I've ever watched (that didn't take place in space)! I've been in all manner of chases (foot, car, boat and air), jumped from exploding skyscrapers, from exploding cars, from exploding planes and from pretty much anything that can explode. I've fought with gun toting ninjas and destroyed countless strongholds with anything from guns to run away cars to attack helicopters. Heck I've parachuted from heights that would make Superman queasy. I surfed on a freaking jet! I've never done this much in a single game before, and I'm only 28% done! Honestly this game is longer than most RPGs I know.On the downside, the game can be frustrating. I STRONGLY recommend playing on easy/casual. Not that its hard, it's just frustrating having to restart a mission when you die, and you will die quite a bit. I really wish that the health kits were easier to find as there's nothing more irritating than running around looking for one while the bad guy's chopper is shooting at you.The story is pretty good, though I can't really comment much on it since I haven't actually completed the game (and by the looks of it, I won't be finishing it anytime soon). The voice acting is atrocious, seriously it's almost painful. Plus I hate the way the cutscenes are fragmented. For instance a mission will start with one cutscene showing you approaching the person whose gonna give you the mission, then it goes black and loads another cutscene showing you getting on the vehicle that will take you there, then another cutscene loads with you being briefed in the vehicle, and yet another cutscene loads with you arriving at your destination. This happens for many of the missions.These are very minor problems of an otherwise outstanding game. Honestly the love put into this game shows. This game is ridiculously fun and I highly recommend it.P.s - You can swim and dive too! I know that sounds stupid but I've never played a sandbox game that allowed you to actually dive under water.>_>  GTA4, Infamous, Prototype, Red Faction, The Saboteur, Assassin's Creed 2","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2010"}

Wario, Mario's jealous rival, plays the hero--well, kind of--in his first console adventure.Money TroubleIn the depths of Wario's castle lies the plunder of his many adventures on the Game Boy, Game Boy Advance and elsewhere.While Wario kicks back in his crib, enjoying the videogame equivalent of bling-bling, a mysterious black jewel in his trove transforms gems into monsters. His wealth, which was once a source of pride, becomes his greatest foe. Now, Wario must scramble to recover his riches.Cranky CapitalistStep into an alternate world filled with quirky puzzles, swarming enemies and lots and lots of loot. You'll learn a multitude of cool moves as Wario progresses in the game. You can punch, kick, jump, grab monsters and objects and inhale surrounding coins like a two-legged vacuum cleaner. The game even has a wrestling game-ish feel, as you can string together combo attacks that The Rock would give his eyebrow for.Early on, you will learn the significance of special sticky balls that dot the landscape. Wario can cling to these balls to navigate tough spots, reach new areas, and even fight bosses.You can freely bash and manipulate your surroundings to discover secrets. For instance, you can pick up a stone pillar and swing it at your foes or spin a fallen monster to activate a switch that raises a gate.Perplexing PuzzlesThe side-scrolling action remains true to the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games that made Wario famous, but Wario's incredible range of motion gives him newfound freedom.Finding treasure often calls for flipping a colored switch, then searching high and low for the activated chest. Considering the size of the worlds and the plethora of hiding places, this can be quite a feat. When it comes to moolah, though, no task is too tough for Wario.Trap doors transport you to hidden worlds that offer mind-bending puzzles. Using your noggin' will yield some important items. A colorful band of fairies offers game info and advice throughout your adventure.GraphicsThe development team at Treasure have stamped Wario's Nintendo GameCube debut with colorful and vibrant graphics. Wario's signature look comes to life like never before. From his arrogant waddle to his purple trousers, Wario is immediately recognizable. Charles Martinet, the actor famous as the voice of Mario, brings a special zest to Wario's growls, chortles and guffaws.From gleaming castle walls to gloomy gravestones,Wario Worldis crammed with beautifully realized details. The action is relentless but the frame rate never falters, even when the screen is packed with dozens of enemies that explode into showers of coins when defeated.Wario Worldwill test both your brains and your button-mashing skills.","reviewerName":"J.

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"It doesn't do a whole lot, but what it does do, it does well","reviewText":"I am always wary when a different studio takes over a sequel to a solid first game (Knights of the Old Republic 2, anyone?, but fortunately, Monolith and WB delivered! I put off buying this game for a long time, because...well it seems like every game that is released to even marginal success gets at least one sequel.Anyways, as for the game itself, it's nothing unique, or special. And it doesn't try to be. I will say that this game was, I felt, about half as suspenseful as the first, which is still moderately tense. Anyone who played the first and had the holy hell scared out of them the first time they went down a ladder (boarding the ladder, and turning around to come face to face with a child Alma), will still feel a slight tension every time they go to climb on a ladder, wondering if this is the time it will happen. With this game, there are creepy moments here and there, but nothing lasting. This game is more just a straight shooter.I didn't run into any glitches, and some of the new things you are able to do will make you grin a little (I don't know about anyone else, but being able to flip over tables or slide couches to use as cover was a nice touch to me). The main reason this game gets 4 stars and not 5 is the story. It's very disjointed. I think if you were reading the novelization it would work well, because there is a lot of jumping back and forth in regards to mission objectives. You spend the first half of the game trying to find this certain guy, and then you finally reach him and he gives you a prototype weapon, and then almost immediately has his head ripped from his body. And you're left thinking...uh, what was the whole point of that? Just to get a new weapon? Genevieve Aristide is also present throughout the game, but again, she is sort of half-assed into the story and then becomes like a ehhh, forget about her (til the very end).What frustration there is in this game comes not from poor gameplay mechanics or a sketchy framerate (neither of which I encountered), but rather from not knowing exactly why you're doing the things you're doing. Go here and find this, and then go here, and now follow your crazy squad member. I think in their desire to have a game that keeps a lot of the backstory to itself, and have a little mystery, the developers retained too much information, and at the end of the game (the most complained about thing I've read about from others), you are left feeling like...huh? I myself had to Google the end to figure out what the hell happened.But it's a minor point. Almost all of the weapons in this game are fun to use and very useful (except the flamethrower...what'sgoingon?) The is a lot of blood and gore, and extreme violence. Occasionally it will get annoying how many enemies keep coming at you, but since the action aspect of the game is the strongest point, it really can't be that big a complaint. All in all, this game does more right than it does wrong.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2010"}

The main story is ok, if you like long lengthy passages where all you do is go on long walks in the bizarre, or the museum or the desert where you do very little other than walk and get plot filler.  There is not enough Elena or Chloe in the story and what is there is basically walkon roles.  Where the game really becomes miserable and vile, however, is in the split screen co-op where you get to fight dead people from the previous games, many of whom are impossible to kill even when you reach level 40.  They have gatekeepers, the have bosses, they have chokers--all of whom are nearly impossible to kill even when hit with a bazooka or a hammer. What were the developers thinking to make a game that is nearly impossible to beat? They have guns that don't kill even the lesser enemies as they ought, and when you try to roll, more times than naught you will end up deader than a doornail.  I liked the first two games, no that is too mild, I loved them.  They were two of the best games I ever played, although not without their faults.

This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T.

The story is interesting, and the game itself is pretty good. I bought it recently since I have been playing with my nintendo DS lite more often now. It is a great game. It could use some improvements in its menu options.

The game also features better single-player, with adventure, and coin rush, which they don't have for single-player in New Super Mario Bros Wii. The game also features a new objective, not just saving Peach from the Koopalings, but also collecting 1,000,000 (one million) coins. I really enjoy that, and if that seems impossible, think again. The game had a gold mushroom, turning enemies into golden enemies (where if you jump on a koopa and kick his shell, he leaves a trail of coins behind). The game personally is better than the Wii version, just if you're deciding which to buy.Graphics: 10/10Sound: 7/10 (it's good but the music is exactly the same as in New Super Mario Bros Wii)Controls: 10/10 (You can use the stick or the arrow buttons)Fun and enjoyment: 9.5/10I WOULD GET IT!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Engrossing and addicting!","reviewText":"I love detective stories. Whether it be in TV or movies or just a damn good book, watching a detective work a crime scene, gather evidence, chase down crooks and interrogate suspects is a geeky delight. 'L.A. Noire' is a video game by Team Bondi and Rockstar that tries to capture this experience and for the most part it succeeds.'L.A. Noire' puts you in the role of Detective Cole Phelps, a decorated WWII hero with some shady secrets working as a police officer in 1947 Los Angeles, CA. After a patrol detail you work your way through four desks in the department: Traffic, Homicide, Vice and Arson. Each desk has it's row of cases and an over-arching plot which ties them together (though you spend most of your time in Homicide and Arson). The story-telling of these over-arching plots really isn't that compelling (thanks to some oddly placed cut-scenes) and seems a bit sketchy, even for a Rockstar game. Also, I never really got a feel for the Phelps character (despite an excellent performance by Aaron Stanton) and his character's story only seems to come into play once you reach the Vice desk (a bit more than half way through the game). Thankfully, the self-contained 'Cases' are interesting enough and I really enjoyed getting sucked into these (though I would've liked more Vice cases).The gameplay in 'L.A. Noire', like the story-telling is a bit uneven and takes a while to really pull you in. The game starts VERY slowly, introducing the different gameplay mechanics of walking, driving, investigation and some shooting. The driving and running and gunning are typical GTA fare (in that it's very solid but unimpressive) but the investigations are very dynamic and they really give 'L.A. Noire' it's weight. Walking around a crime scene and gathering clues feels natural after a while and really makes you feel like a detective. Interrogating suspects is also very unique as you have to watch the character's facial animations to be able to tell if they're being truthful, holding something back, or flat-out lying. If you accuse someone of lying you have to present evidence contradicting them. I was terrible at these bits and they never really had much bearing on the outcome of the case but again added a unique element to 'L.A. Noire' and puts it's motion-capture technology to good use.The graphics in 'L.A. Noire' (when they're not glitchy) are VERY impressive. The facial-capture is of course excellent but it's the Sandbox world of L.A. that shines. Everything you do feels like a small part of a bigger world. Crime-scenes are not in little mini-arenas but are fully integrated into the sandbox world. My only disappointment came from having a cutscene trigger whenever I got close to a destination. I would have preferred coming up on a crime-scene on my own to add to the game's wonderful atmosphere.The acting in 'L.A. Noire' is perfect down the line. Again, Cole Phelps really isn't that interesting a protagonist (though his partners, especially Biggs and Roy and very well drawn) but Aaron Stanton is very convincing and the facial-capture tech used in 'L.A. Noire' turns everything he and his fellow actors do into a full performance and not just voice-work. You'll recognize a lot of the actors in this game, and if you're a fan of the show 'Mad Men' you'll be in for a treat!Graphical glitches aside there's nothing really 'wrong' or 'broken' with 'L.A. Noire', you just have to sift through a lot of mediocrity to get to the game's shining moments. The overall story could have been more interesting, the main character could've been more compelling (anyone else more interested in Jack's story?) and the game's slow start will definitely test player's patience. However the immersive atmosphere and the feeling of being a real detective make 'L.A. Noire' a definite purchase if you're a mystery/procedural fan. Everyone else should at least rent 'L.A. Noire'; it's a flawed game but so unique that you won't forget it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00004SPW9","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"Give it a chance, it may grow on you","reviewText":"Square has always been known to develop quality titles and Vagrant Story proves its still one of the best in the game industry. Created by the same team who brought you Final Fantasy Tactics, Vagrant Story offers something quite different yet refreshing to the world of gaming. You are hero Ashley Riot, a Riskbreaker agent who chases the mysterious cult figure Sydney Losstarot into the city of Lea Monde. Throughout the game, you'll attempt to clear your name for being accused of murder while uncovering remnants of your past. Vagrant Story proves you don't need an overly epic storyline to make a game impressive, and this game definitely has one of the best scripts ever written for a video game.Unlike other big-budget Square titles, which the storyline or visuals are the dominating aspects, gameplay is the star of Vagrant Story. As fair warning, this is NOT a game for casual gamers, which someone can just pick up and play. While battling, you target enemies' bodyparts with the use of a sphere grid. You'll learn to chain combos but your \"risk meter\" will rise, making you more vulnerable. You'll also learn to forge your own weapons and armor, do puzzle-solving and much more. The visuals are outstanding. You feel as if you really did visit Lea Monde with its dungeons and ruins. The character designs are equally amazing and the graphics push the PlayStation to its limits. Sound-wise, the music is hauntingly atmospheric and everything from the grunts and groans of monsters to the sounds of magic spells accent the game perfectly.Although the difficulty level is a bit high and requires some patience and even frustration, it will still be an interesting but rewarding experience for anyone who really does get into it and understand the gameplay fluidly. The amount of time and effort you put into the game will determine how much fun will you have in the long run. You have to become deeply involved and immersed in order to enjoy Vagrant Story, but once you do, you'll realize you are playing one of the most unique games ever created. It's really like no other, even though it didn't receive enough recognition that it deserved. Give it a chance, it may grow on you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Sam The Alligator","summary":"Slightly dissapointing,still a game of high excellence.","reviewText":"Okay this game is pretty much nothing like Super Mario 64 but the gameplay is equally as good.The music in Super Mario Sunshine isnt as impressive and snazzy as the music in Super Mario 64 but Sunshine is still lots of fun to play.Like Mario 64 all the missions run in kind of a pattern.In this one its usually fight the first boss, collect red coins,fight the boss in a harder setting, run after Shadow Mario. Instead of Bowser appearing as the bad guy more than once(he is in this game but at the very end) you are sent to chase Shadow Mario which is lots of fun.

I kept my expectations relatively low so I had a good time with it while it lasted. Unfortunately I probably won't be playing it again unless I get very bored and decide to go the other route with the whole good/evil thing. It was fun overall although a few of the missions got on my nerves for repetiveness or just being boring. The story was pretty mediocre as well, but the games main flaw is its shallow length which brings its score down. I would recommend this to people if you are really into action/rpgs but I would wait until the price goes down or get it if its on sale like I did.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000HFGKN4","description":"super castlevania IV 4 for super nintendo","reviewerName":"jdealy999","summary":"Too awesome of a game to miss.","reviewText":"When I first owned the Super NES, Super Castlevania 4 was one of the titles that I started working on.  I was immediately blown away by the graphics, soundtrack, and sound effects.  If you've already played the previous titles for the NES, then this sequel grows leaps and bounds.  Most notably, of course, is the gorgeous, haunting introduction after the title screen.  It's a prelude of things to come when Dracula is reborn -- oh no!!!  :(  So it's Simon Belmont to the rescue once again!  Castlevania 4 truly has some of the BEST music -- period.  (Particularly, my favorite soundtracks are on Levels 1, 2, 4, 9, 10 (A), and 11 (B).Simon can use his whip to move in all directions (by holding down the Y button) instead of just up, down, or straight ahead as you did in the previous installments.  Each level is much more challenging as well, but you also get to face the familiar baddies such as the Medusa heads, Medusa herself, Frankenstein, The Mummy, and eventually Dracula himself.  The first 5 levels take place outside of Dracula's Castle.  On the 3rd level, it is consisted of three parts:  inside a damp cave, up a waterfall, and inside an ancient palace, where you eventually have to face off with a huge dragon head!On the 4th level, it has 3 parts and 2 bosses.  After you defeat the huge skeleton head, you will find yourself inside a dizzying room where you have to grapple onto the ceiling while holding the button down.  The final part may also give you some vertigo, as the background swings back and fourth as though you are rolling around inside of a bottle.  Creepy but effective, huh??  :)Levels 6 through 9 are inside the castle.  Level 7 is inside of a library.  Level 8 is the second difficult level in the entire game to get through with spiders and moving spike traps.  And what's worse, before you reach Frankenstein, you are forced to pass through a disappearing floor area, and the tiles appear randomly, so you won't know when to jump or to wait.  :(Level 9 is a &#34;golden&#34; level.  You will trounce through gleaming treasure chests and crumbling golden shaped tiles while staring at the fast moving ghouls in the background.  By the end of the level, you will have to face off against a golden bat.  As you defeat him, he will break into smaller bats and they will be tougher to dodge.Level 10 (A) should be familiar to Castlevania veterans.  It's a clock-tower level and it also updates the music that you heard from Castlevania 2:  Simon's Quest for the NES.  Many more traps await you before you reach the Mummy boss.Level 11 (B) is THE hardest level of all, but it's also my personal favorite because of the updated (and best) soundtrack that you may have listened to in Castlevania 3:  Dracula's Curse for the NES.  Part 2 is completely vertical with crumbling stairs and more headless horsemen to face.  If that's not bad enough, you have to hightail it because of the moving spiked wheel at the bottom of the screen!!  :(If you manage to make it past that portion of the level, you will have to face 3 MORE bosses before facing Dracula himself.  And yes, one of those bosses is the infamous Grim Reaper.  He's even meaner than before; he will throw his scythes all over the place, so now would be a good time to use Simon's whip to fend them off.  Once Grim Reaper touches down and starts throwing a huge scythe your way, it's when he is at his most vulnerable.  Give him a few hits and jump over the scythe before he repeats his cycle all over again.  He is also the second most difficult boss in the game.Before you meet Dracula, go down the invisible floor to the bottom left (which is below the stairs) and wait for some food and power-ups.  You can do this every time that you lose a life against Dracula.  And believe me, defeating him is a real doozy, unlike his previous incantations.  He doesn't turn into a bat this time, however, he WILL use some electricity and fiery chandelier monsters to slow you down while you hit him in the head.I don't know of any Castlevania game on any console that ISN'T awesome.  :)  I especially loved Castlevania 1 and 3 for the NES, as well as the 2 Game Boy installments.  I'm also hoping to get Castlevania:  Bloodlines for the Sega Genesis.  I've even managed to beat the 3 Castlevania installments that were released on the Game Boy Advance from 2001 to 2003.  Lastly, there are 3 MORE sequels that were released on the Nintendo DS.  Oh, and let's not forget Lords Of Shadow:  Mirrors Of Fate for the Nintendo 3DS (please keep in mind that the game is rated Mature).So stop reading this post already and download Castlevania 4 to your Wii or Wii U!  Believe me, this WILL be time well worth spent once you've beaten this game.  :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2014"}

No longer will everybody use the same basic vehicle, now people can change tires, gliders, and the model! Some people prefer monster truck tires, and others may prefer tires that are wood. Unlocking more parts gives the game more replay, as well as improved online play. On the home menu the \"Friend List\" icon can flash, and that signals when somebody is playing MK7 online. All you have to do is tap \"Join Game\". It makes a huge improvment over MKDS and MKWII's online play. The best part about MK7 though is flying! If you ride over a Glide Panel your character equips a hang glider and can soar through the air! It can be very amusing to launch a red shell at friends who missed the glide panel and are stuck on the ground.Graphics: 7/10- It's pretty average. Everybody babbled about the \"amazing\" 60 FPS, but I don't really see any difference. If it does anything, it would be draining the battery.Music: 5/10- It's the same thing in that's in every Mario Kart. I normally have the volume turned down after a while, it gets kind of annoying.Tracks: 8/10- They are not on MKWii's level, but the gliding makes up for it. It gets really fun to cut corners and risk the entire race. The retro courses were also remade in 3D, and they use gliders too.3D effects: 6/10- Sometimes my car pops out a little bit, but the game moves too fast to enjoy 3D.Controls- 8/10 The game introduced gyroscope controls, where you drive in 1st person and tilt your 3DS like a steering wheel. It worked pretty well, even though it would have been better in 3rd person. The circle pad works pretty well, although it is a little rough. The only problem was accelerating. Like in every Mario Kart game, you hold down the A button. It's fine, but the 3DS had me holding a stiff hard plastic A button. I normally end up with an circle indention in my thumb, but I don't really care, it goes away in about 5 minutes.Overall, Mario Kart 7 is a very innovative game. It has some flaws, but it for a portable system. Nintendo could fix some bugs with updates, as they have done it once already. Maybe they could even add new tracks! I highly recommend it for the innovative online play and customizable karts. It could be a stepping stone for an even greater Mario Kart (The Wii-u is overhauling online play, so that could really be something good) with tons of more options!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Strangely, it's my favorite in the series","reviewText":"It's a completely weird thing to say that the most polarizing Final Fantasy game in the entire series happens to be my favorite of them. I found VII great but kind of sluggishly-paced; ditto with IX which had attractive visuals, lovely music but a slow narrative at times. With VIII, the graphics got kicked up a notch, the FMV's became more cinematic and the storyline was more adult and sophisticated. However, some love it and many hated it and there's still people who outright despite this game. Sure it's got a few nagging problems but in my opinion, this was my favorite in the series to experience.Story: You play as Squall, a student at the Balamb Garden which specializes in turning students into SEED's, elite mercenaries that get dispatched to different parts of the world to resolve conflicts. One mission has him getting involved with the Timber Owls, a resistance group headed by Rinoa. Squall and Rinoa, along with 4 others, will eventually get caught up in a story involving space travel, a powerful sorceress and a trip through time.Graphics: Often-criticized for having \"Popeye\" arms, the characters now look completely realistic and proportioned evenly. The world itself however looks kind of drab as there isn't a lot of locations that make you go \"holy ****!\", Esthar being the exception. But where the game shines is the FMV's which have an even more movie-like quality in its direction and look than VII's. While the change from pre-rendered to the FMV's is obvious now, it helps make the transitions more seamless.Sound/Music: No voice acting (till X) but again we have another great soundtrack by Nobuo Uematsu. Anyone who's ever listened to the soundtracks knows that he's hit and miss and for one amazing track like Liberi Fatali, Man With the Machine Gun or the Extreme, there's completely average and even bad tracks. But it's got a bit more thematic similarities from track to track so it's more consistent.Gameplay: The ever-present annoyance for gamers and it all comes down to the Junction system. Each game has had different ways on how characters played the game. From the Esper system to Materia to the Sphere Grid, characters levelled up uniquely from game to game. VIII's different in that for one thing we don't have MP anymore. You \"draw\" it from enemies, getting 1 to around 5 or so spells to use with the limit being 100. While it is annoying that you can have a finite number of spells, I like the idea of junctioning them to your stats to make them more powerful or adding resistance to a certain spell or status effect.The other idea presented is the idea of the enemies levelling up along with you. No longer can you spend an hour beating enemy after enemy in hopes that the boss will be easier this time. Basically the enemy gets powerful just as you do when you level up so it's best to just be weak, as it were. Also, in previous games, shops or even enemies carried character weapons and armor that were more powerful than the one currently equipped well now the weapon has to be synthesized. Get a certain number of items and the magazine listing the weapon, take it to a shop and they'll turn it into a weapon. Of course you don't know what enemy even has them and you'd have to consult an FAQ to figure out who has what.On one hand, the game does have some issues, nay some huge issues but for some reason I think about re-experiencing this game more than the others which is strange. Might not be everyone's favorite Final Fantasy but for me it is.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience.

In the original, you were able to rotate the camera angle to get a better view; that feature doesn't exist in this version (I suppose due to the restricted available memory).

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"E. Luna \"FPS Connoisseur\"","summary":"It's pretty awesome","reviewText":"I've played through the first two Infamous games, and I consider myself to be a moderate fan of the series. It's not one that I would say I'm obsessed about, but I am very satisfied with the series in general. The story has always proven to be interesting, and the characters are pretty well fleshed-out as well. I recently beat Infamous 2 in anticipation of Second Son, but to be honest the stories are so far apart that I don't really feel that it's necessary to have played the last two at all. Second Son is an excellent stand-alone game, and it's by far the best in the series.First thing's first, the game is just gorgeous! The graphics are incredibly detailed, and the color gamut is beautiful. Each power has a color palette of their own, and they are quite a sight to behold. Sucker Punch's rendition of Seattle is massive and very detailed. All in all this is just a pretty looking game.The gameplay is what you will expect from any Infamous game if you've played any of them. Easy to navigate, climbing is encouraged, and the combat system is fun and fluid.What I would say is the biggest departure from the first game is how the powers are handled where before you could switch between Thunder, Ice, or Fire in the fly, now you have full control of one power at a time. In order to switch back to another power you have to absorb energy from a fuel-source of that power. So go to a chimney to reactivate smoke, or go to a neon sign to reactivate neon, etc.The level up system is a bit more organized now as well, and finding blast shards (which are used as power up points essentially) is much easier than in the other two.Perhaps my favorite thing about Second Son is the main character. Delsin Rowe is a really cool character, it's easy to like the guy. I think this is mainly due to the fact that Troy Baker did a hell of a job voicing Delsin.All in all, I think it's a fair assumption to make that Infamous: Second Son is the first must-own exclusive for the PS4. I'm a huge Sony fan, and an avid Killzone fan, so I wish I could give this honor to Shadowfall, but the latest iteration of Killzone really did disappoint me in many ways. Infamous, on the other hand, impressed me immensely.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2014"}

As Heather, you will fight,solve, run, scream, and occasionally die.  With a high yuck factor, this is not at all a game for the squeamish.The Silent Hill series has been noted for being horror games with a satisfying amount of story line and psychological effect.  This made Silent Hill 2 far more than a gothic shooter.  Thus, expectations were high for the third title in the series.  Unfortunately, the creators took an unexpected turn in this time.  Heavy on graphics and gore, but way short on playing time.This isn't accidental.  Playing time is about four hours at first, and dwindles quickly on repeated excursions.  Many of the game's neatest goodies are rewards for completed runs.  If you are someone like me - not much on playing a game repeatedly - you will find Silent Hill 3 something of a disappointment.But the graphics are good - especially if you have a strong stomach.  If only the story was more finely detailed, this would have been a monster hit.  It still is a very good game, but it is too brief to build the kind of tension needed for a really good scare.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"Acoma","summary":"No spoilers inside - excellent game!","reviewText":"Bioshock is a Sci-Fi Horror game set in the underwater city of Rapture which gave me, without a doubt, an amazing gaming expierience.  To me, it seemed there has been a bit of a \"dry spell\" to good games lately, nothing notable has come out this year that gave me an original wow factor like Bioshock did. So what made it good? Well, let start with the gameplay...At the core Bioshock has very fun and original gameplay where nothing is repetitive and even \"respawns\" that occur have interesting placement. It does have strong RPG elements, but you won't be selecting dialogue.  Rather your actions speak louder than words in your choices as they present themselves as you move along the city of Rapture.  I believe the gameplay was so strong of the PC version because the folks who made it are primarily PC developers rather than console jockeys.  There is lots of key bindings that make sense and are customizable and everything in your arsenal is easy to get to, which was quite a feat considering how many tools you have at your disposable to combat the denizens of the underwater freak capitol of the world. The AI is quite amazing and above Half-Life 2's in my opinion, where the hostile folks you meet will do everything in their power to get away from your damage and give you theirs in kind (I won't say how, because that will be part of your fun!).One of the standouts for me was the sound.  The repetitive mumblings of the baddies you have to meet aren't too persistant and various enough to give you entertainment without listening to the same guys over and over chanting \"Doom to you!\" or something similiarily annoying.The producers of the game mentioned quite a bit pre-release how there is many different ways to handle all your encounters and this is definatly true as there is no \"one-size\" fits all, but I will say if you try to run through it with guns blazing you will die very quickly.  I played through the game on the normal mode (have yet to do hard) and it was challenging to manage my resources and really think how I am going to get through a \"level\".  Speaking of level, its not really a straight forward \"follow-the-corridor-to-the-end-game\".  There is a lot of hidden stuff and places to explore that have nothing much to do with the main quests, but allow you some freedom to move around a bit and not be tied down to one objective.  You also don't have to do anything in order, and the game is smart enough to know and doesn't lock up and crash if you feel like doing something out of order or just going back to somewhere you haven't been.So okay, sounds pretty good, eh? Well, there is some disturbing elements so if you are a bit squeamish then this game might not be for you. Namely the little sisters...without giving away too much in the game, they are one of the cornerstones of the whole story and how you deal with them makes your character \"good\" or \"evil\".  I couldn't bring myself to do the bad thing, so I got the good ending, I assume there is a bad one too if you chose that path, so there presents some replay value.  Little sisters aside, there is also blood, gore, strong language, adult themes and just some straight up sick, twisted and sadistic \"bosses\" you will meet in Rapture.One of the big things i'm glad that was a departure from games like Half-Life 2 and Doom 3 is that the game is somewhat dark, but there is enough light going around where you don't have to squint or turn up the brightness on your monitor to that of a supernova to see what is going on (No flashlight required!).Bottomline, if you are looking for a good gaming fix this is definately worth your money to pickup...Deus Ex, System Shock 2, Half-Life 2 are all games fairly similiar to this one so if you liked those you will be blown away by Bioshock because it trumps them all, especially in gameplay. The developers have a statement posted on their website and I would like to reiterate it here in that -- DON'T READ ANY SPOILERS --.  It will ruin the game for you and most of the fun.Pros:- Amazingly fun gameplay- Sound effects and voice acting waaaay above average.- A long game so you will get your money's worth.- ZERO bugs that i encountered..start to finish. *clap*Cons:- Nothing, except the violent, sadistic themes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2007"}

I just got done beating dead space and I feel a strong need to spread the news on how awesome this game is.  Before I wrote this review I went and read the single star reviews, because I couldn't understand how anyone could not like this game.  So before considering this game further you need to consider some basic things.  Do you like action games?  Do you like scary games?  Do you like space?  Did you like Resident Evil 4?  If you answered no to any of those you may end up rating this game as a single star.  If you answered yes to most or all of those you should probable get this game.  Let me now go into some details.This game plays a lot like resident evil 4.  The variety of feelings you get from the game range from creepy suspense to adrenaline pumping fights.  The environments in the game are very well designed and often times very creepy.  The enemy design could have used some work but given this game relies on dismemberment as the main way to dispatch enemies there aren't a whole lot of different ways to take the enemy design.  The storyline wasn't really that impressive but the delivery was very nice.  The graphics in this game are excellent aswell as the sound.  The mission variety for the game is somewhere in the the middle.  You do alot of the same kind of missions traveling around the ship, however from time to time it's mixed up with something different.  The achievements for the game are also very nice, nothing out of the ordinary. The game lasted me around 12 hours on medium, which is short in my opinion, but I intend to go back and the get the achievement which I am guessing will take another 18 or so hours. In conclusion, the game may not have the best story and the graphics may be to par with other games of next generation console; but the game play, the environments, and the variety of missions make this game a must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2009"}

The game pretty much plays like the first one so there's no need to relearn new button controls are anything which is appreciated also the graphics and effects are understandably improved from the first game. Also like with the first game you have scenarios where you must choose your karma side meaning if you perform humane and good deeds you're seen as a hero and if you perform wicked and selfish deeds the opposite happen, it's of course up to the player if you want to be the hero of the world or the dark jedi who rules it instead.

{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"Steven Rinck","summary":"Terrible letdown for a very highly-reviewed game","reviewText":"Let me start out by saying I know this game came out 6 years ago as a launch title.  That means it shouldn't be compared to current FPSes, and by being a console release game it was most likely rushed.  Even considering that, the game is really bad.  I'll forgive the dearth of voice acting, the rushed \"still-picture-voiceovers\" substituting cutscenes, utter lack of character development and a narrative structure that rivals the literary/cinematic \"masterpiece\" DOOM 2.  What I can't forgive is some of the dullest gameplay seen this side of the 20th century for a game that the box cover says is rated 9.5/10 and 5/5.  These reviewers have been added to my long list of people never to take seriously again.GRAPHICS/SOUNDSFor being 6 years old, the graphics relatively good.  Textures are crisp (even if it does have the muddy color palette of too many ps1/ps2 era games) and the framerate is solid.  Models move a bit stiff, but that's forgivable for the game's age.  Aside from the female narrator (whose voice acting is so-so) and the occasional troop chatter/radio message there's not much aside from alien screams, gunfire and explosions.  It's ok I guess, but the game just feels kind of empty.  That might be intentional with the whole \"mankind being exterminated\" theme, but it's not necessarily a plus in the ambiance department.  Either the main protagonist had his tongue removed before embarking on this mission, or any dialogue he delivers was so immaterial my mind has completely erased any memory of it.  With Gordon Freeman, the silent protagonist is kind of a joke at this point.  With this game, it's just lame.GAMEPLAYThis is where the game truely...doesn't shine at all.  It is trying very, very, very, very, very hard to be a PS3 HALO clone, and it shows.- Partially Rebounding health meter?  Check- AI companions troops (aka fodder)? Check- Aliens/virus taking over friendlies? CheckI trimmed this list back from about 20 items, but you get the idea.  Even here it fails though.  I'm not even a HALO fan (never played any of the games after the original) but this game makes me pine for the innovative FPS days of 2001.  Aside from the graphics and stealing a few superficial elements from the 2001 release of HALO, this game would be considered stale by mid 90's first person shooters.The fodder (I mean AI companions) are worse than useless, as you generally only notice them when they're actively causing you harm (more than once I got trapped in a corner or between them and a structure, unable to escape until the enemies did me the favor of killing them.  The enemies all have instantaneous perfect accuracy; as in they run, stop to fire perfectly at you, and run again.  Even when you're behind large cover, they put all their bullets into the spot you're in, and fire the instant before you break cover.  This was incredibly difficult to deal with until you learn to take advantage of their AI routine (ie learning there's always exactly 2 seconds between their volleys, etc), then it just becomes tedious as even the standard enemy you'll face 10s of thousands of in the game is a bullet sponge requiring 20-30 shots.Some of the alien weapons in this game are neat, but hardly enough to make the game worth playing.  It's compounded by the face that for the first half/third of the game you only get one to play with, and it's not that good in the context of the game.To summarize: the game is terrible.  This is one of the few games I can honestly say I'm sorry to have forced myself to play.  If you've played any first person shooter since about 1995, you've played a much better game.  Steer clear of this.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2012"}

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs.

It's not a requirement that you play the first Resistance: Fall of Man in order to follow what is going on in this one. It's pretty simple, you're human and you need to destroy any and all Chimera. The single player campaign is pretty good but where this game really shines is in the online multiplayer options. The 8 player online co-op is fantastic. You are on a team of up to 8 players and can select one of three different classes: soldier, medic, and spec ops. Soldiers are responsible for providing cover for their team by utilizing their shield, medics are responsible for providing health to teammates, and spec ops are responsible for providing ammo to other team members. You will have a hard time finding success in the co-op missions unless you have at least one player in each class on your squad. As you play each class type you level up and unlock new weapons and beserk powers. I have played a lot of co-op and have reached the maximum level (level 30) in all three classes. There is also online competitive multiplayer with up to 60 players in a game, which is unheard of up to now. All the typical multiplayer modes are offered: deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag (although it's called core control), and skirmish. Skirmish is my favorite mode since your objectives are constantly changing. You will be assigned to various tasks such as capturing various control points or killing a designated player on the other team. The battles feel very intimate, even with up to 60 players at one time. Each team is divided into small 5 man squads with a rival squad on the other team that you will be matched against.

Fights with the Prometheans were also varied enough that you could approach enemies from a number of different angles and entry points unlike a typical FPS.I focused on the single-player campaign mostly, but there's a healthy amount of multiplayer for other \"hardcore\" gamers. There's Spartan Ops which takes place after the Halo 4 campaign and allows you to play as UNSC Infinity crewmembers or part of a Spartans squad called Majestic Squad. It's episodic and free. In addition, Forge (BEST MAP EDITING ON ANY GAME) returns so you can design your own multiplayer maps.You can also play the entire campaign mode cooperatively with up to three other players, though oddly, everyone plays as Master Chief. (I mean... I guess that sort of makes sense. Who wouldn't want to be Chief? It'll probably saves friends from fighting with each other.....lol)The love that Chief and Cortana have for each other as true friends is strong in Halo 4 and helps in service to what is surprisingly an emotionally strong game. There's lots of \"the's\" thrown around over the course of the story as in we have to stop The Blank from accessing The Other Blank... but put all of that aside, and the story of this friendship that knows no bounds is exceptionally told and emotionally earned.There's also love for the source material by developer 343 Industries that is quite evident. Franchise fans will see how they tried to echo previous games as well as ensure their story tied into the one Bungie told. It was a tough mission but one they accomplished.Easily should win game of the year IMO","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2012"}

RW manages to perfectly balance the RTS and RPG elements, creating a great experience. In many ways, this game takes a lot of good things from Warcraft 3 and applies them to the FF Universe.- Graphics and music are very good. Especially the levels with waterfalls look gorgeous.- Game Speed is on the slow side (no Command and Conquer 3 here), but this works well with the limitation in controls. Having to be in multiple places at once is a bit more difficult on DS, so I look at this as an advantage.- Game Difficulty varies between Normal to Hard. I am at 83% of the game and overall, all battles felt fair, even if some were more difficult than others. Like in any RPG, the key here is to level up a lot, which you can do with the side missions.- How cool is this: You can create weapons - more powerful than anything you can buy or find. All RPG classes are also represented here, even if they have different names. You can also level up your summons, use high level spells that can change a battle's outcome and you can set up a gambit, for automatically using of a spell.The bad:For all its depth, it is rather hard to play this game as intended. The main problem here is the size of the screen. Your summons and characters are sprites and - when it is 20 of them on screen - it is difficult to select the ones you want. In this game, even summons have spells and using them efficiently, can help a lot. While the Y button can be used to select groups, I found myself using just the heroes' spells for most of the game.The ugly:The story starts very, very slow. I would guess that most reviewers that gave up on this game, did it because they got bored quickly. It takes 5-8 hours before you can start talking strategy / RPG gameplay, so be aware that you need some patience in the beginning.Overall, this is a 5 star game in my book. Despite some minor setbacks, the final package is probably the best RTS/RPG on DS and maybe one in many iterations to come.Do yourself a favor and buy this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2008"}

In this latest expansion, something is afoot in the cold, harsh northlands. The Lich King Arthas has set in motion events that could lead to the extinction of all life on Azeroth. The necromantic power of the plague and legions of undead armies threaten to sweep across the land. Only the mightiest heroes can oppose the Lich King and end his reign of terror..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }The tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman, inhabit the icy Borean Tundra.View larger.Half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land.View larger.You'll enjoy exploring Northrend and all its environments and dungeons.View larger.Explore Northrend and battle the Lich King with World of Warcraft's first hero class character -- The Death Knight.View larger.One of many new environments, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.View larger.Many strange and terrifying creatures inhabit this frozen continent.View larger.Enter the Death KnightThis expansion adds a host of content to the already massive existing game world. Players will achieve soaring levels of power, explore Northrend (the vast icy continent of the Lich King), and battle high-level heroes to determine the ultimate fate of Azeroth. As you face the dangers of the frigid, harsh north, prepare to master the dark necromantic powers of the Death Night -- World of Warcraft's first Hero class. No longer servants of the Lich King, the Death Knights begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries. Each is heavily armed, armored, and in possession of a deadly arsenal of forbidden magic.If you have a World of Warcraft account with a character of at least level 55, you will be able to create a new level-55 Death Knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the Death Knight must be the same faction as your existing character). And upon entering the new world, your Death Knight will begin to quest to level 80, gaining potent new abilities and talents along the way. This expansion allows for only one Death Knight per realm, per account.New Environments in Northrend AwaitJourney through the remote, diverse lands of Northrend and explore Dragonblight, Grizzly Hills, Borean Tundra, and Howling Fjord. Named for bones of perished dragons and majestic shrines to the fallen creatures, Dragonblight is an arctic wasteland surrounded by dense forests.Not everything is frozen in Northrend. The lush mountains of Grizzly Hills are the ancestral home to the furbolgs, who have grown accustomed to relative peace. Although their tranquility is being challenged by trappers, goblins, and ice trolls, Grizzly Hills remains a vast and dangerous wilderness.The southwestern tip of Northrend is home to the sprawling Borean Tundra. The Horde has established a dominant presence in this icy portion of the continent and has formed a bond with the tuskarr, a walrus-like race of nomadic fisherman. Magical energy is afoot in the region, and it has caused increased tension.High above the Great Sea at the southeastern tip of Northrend lies the Howling Fjord. Ancient mythology holds that a race of half-giant warriors, the vrykul, once inhabited the land, founding a prosperous civilization. They mysteriously vanished, leaving deserted villages and abandoned temples. In present times, the Alliance and the Horde have come to Howling Fjord to confront the Lich King. Strangely, this has prompted the return of the vrykul, who are attacking the Alliance and Horde settlements. Howling Fjord presents a difficult challenge on two fronts: withstanding the vrykul's onslaught and battling the evil Lich King.A Multitude of MonstersStrange and terrifying creatures inhabit the frozen continent of Northrend, such as Nerubian Viziniers, Plague Eruptors, Shoveltusks and Flesh Giants, to name just a few. Half-spider, half-humanoid, the viziniers utilize sorcery and high intelligence to emerge as the rulers of Nerubians' underground kingdom. The Plague Eruptors are walking corpses created by the Lich King's evil experiments to spread horror and chaos across the living world.Massive curved antlers make it easy to identify the Shoveltusks. These grumpy beasts are very dangerous, territorial, and best left alone. The Flesh Giants are nothing short of nightmarish abominations. Cobbled together from the pieces of giant body parts, the Flesh Giants employ tremendous strength to carry out the Lich King's wishes.The World of Warcraft: Wrath of King Lich expansion pack allows you to engage in epic siege warfare. The pack presents the first Hero class and allows you to transform your Death Knight's look with character customization that even include hairstyles and dances. You'll enjoy exploring the Northrend and all its environments and dungeons, filled with some of the deadliest creatures -- and greatest treasures -- on all of Azeroth.System RequirementsMinimumRecommendedOperating SystemPC: Microsoft Windows XP or Windows Vista (with latest Service Packs)Mac: Mac OS X 10.4.11 or newerCPUPC: Intel Pentium 4 1.3 GHz or AMD Athlong XP 1500+Mac: PowerPC G5 1.6 GHz or Intel Core Duo processorPC: Dual-core processor, such as Intel Pentium D or AmD Athlong 64 X2Mac: Intel 1.8 GHz processor or betterGraphics HardwarePC: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transfor and Lighting with 32 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon 7200 or NVIDIA GeForce2 class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Hardware Transform and Lighting with 64 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon 9600 or NVIDIA GeForce Ti 4600 class card or betterPC: 3D Graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capabilities with 128 MB VRAM, such as an ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA GeForce 7600 GT class card or betterMac: 3D graphics processor with Vertex and Pixel Shader capability with 128 MB VRAM, such as ATI Radeon X1600 or NVIDIA 7600 class card or better.MemoryPC: 512 MB (1 GB for Vista)Mac: 1 GBPC: 1 GB (2 GB for Vista)Mac: 2 GBHard Drive Space15 GB of free spaceAll Platform RequirementsKeyboard and mouse, required for controls.

Leonard","summary":"Great game, horrible players....","reviewText":"Pros:  The new class, Death Knight, is fun to play.  They have a lot of advantages with any of their Talent builds.  There are a lot of quests to complete, comparable to Burning Crusades.  The new zones are big, and are visually appealing.  Items in this expansion are also nice.  The game is stable compared to Everquest 2's latest expansion.  Server down time hasn't deviated from the weekly update, aside from server restarts.Cons:  Every Tuesday brings apprehension that a patch will nerf Death Knight abilities.  You need to reach level 77 and spend even more gold to be able to use flying mounts in Northrend.  The terrain in the lower leveled zones requires you to wait for automated traveling systems.I like this game, and I like the concepts this game brings to the table compared to other MMOs.  The problem with World of Warcraft in general, is that it's full of griefers and people who lack common ethics and courtesy.  It's a problem in all MMOs I suppose, since a lot of people overcompensate when they aren't personally held accountable for how they act.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2008"}

You judge games by how well they implemented their paradigm of choice.This game was ground breaking!It shattered my mental paradigms, and expanded my mind.I love it, and I even love replaying it.If you haven't seen a trailer of this game, it essentially is a gravity puzzler.  You run around from tiny planet to tiny planet, and gravity plays a huge role.  It isn't quite gravity as we know it (because the objects are usually fixed in place, so their gravity doesn't affect one another), but you are affected by their gravity (though you have to pretend each planet has an incredibly dense core for the gravity to make sense)....the one critique I have is that this is branded as a multi-player game.  It is not multi-player.  A 2nd player can join in to move a cursor around your screen to either collect stars, or just irritate you.  So it is definitely a single-player game, where a spectator can join in and perform 1 single simplistic task over and over.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006418I","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"wrrc","summary":"WOW!","reviewText":"When I heard the Gamecube would be getting a wireless controller I really had my doubts that it would work well. When I got home and plugged it in, those doubts were ended. The controller's shape is slightly different than the normal one due to the fact that there is a battery slot, but the weight and feel of it in your hands is virtually identical to that of the normal controller. I can lean back on my bed, halfway across the bedroom from my system, and it STILL works! I've even pointed it backwards and put objects in front of the sensor, and each time it works just fine. There are only two problems. Problem one is the lack of a built-in rumble feature. This isn't a big problem though, in that it was left out to save battery power. Without that feature, the controller lasts up to 100 hours (and I doubt I've even played my Gamecube that long since I got it!) You can also change the frequency so that you can use any combination of Wavebird controllers or the standard cord using ones. Problem two is the lack of color variety (to date this controller is available only in gray.) But that doesn't disrupt gameplay so it's not a big deal either. If you've got a Gamecube and a quality game like Super Smash Bros. Melee or Star Wars Rogue Leader, the Wavebird is all you need to make your gaming experience complete.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2002"}

It is very cheap. No trophies though!","reviewText":"PSN ID GremDUDE. This is a great game for the PS3 for those of you who want the fun of Heavenly Sword and cannot afford to lay down $50 USED for the game. This game is very entertaining. Kind of like God of War with a sense of humor. I believe Kevin Sorbo does the voice of Conan. My favorite line is when the lead female of the story says, \"Perhaps you would serve a woman\" to which he replies, \"I would service her!\" Great stuff. The graphics are very nice with good frame rate throughout and despite the reviews to the contrary, some of the puzzles are interesting to solve and difficult as any you would find in Half life. Of course, Conan does pretty much tell you what to do most of the time. I would say my favorite part of the game is the checkpoint system. After playing and giving up on Turok due to the ridiculously long checkpoints, I am happy to say that this game has plenty of check points. You will never find yourself having to kill the same 20 guys over and over again. Even the Boss fights have the checkpoints split up so each step to kill the beast will not have to be repeated. Very nice. Many save points every where and for the most part short load times means this game does not frustrate you like many of the games which made it to the PS3 as well as the XBox. For this price(this game can be found at Game Stop for under $20) it is well worth the money. I am not sure I would say the same if I had to be one of the original people who bought this game for $60 however which is why I give it four stars. This game ain't perfect but it is very entertaining and a hell of a lot of fun! Buy it!Amendment to the above review:After playing this game for about a week and getting nearly to the end, I ended up returning the game for a refund. It gets REALLY BORING. The moves of Conan don't change that much but the opponents keep on getting stronger and almost impossible to beat. There are some guys in the last level who have these shields with spikes in them. Whenever Conan reaches back to hit them(and yes Conan moves very slow always no matter how fast the opponents are moving at this point) spikes come out of the shield and this causes damage to Conan. These are not bosses mind you. There are like 10 of these guys who you have to kill. Ugggh. BORING! You just hack away at these idiots from every angle until I figured out that they throw out their shield every once in a while. So you have to wait for them to throw the shield, not get hit by the damn thing and then quickly get behind them(Quick is not really a word in Conan's dictionary remember) and beat the crap out of them before they recover their shields. They give Conan magical \"armor powers\" but these get used up pretty quickly. Plus every level is pretty much the same as the last. The graphics start looking pretty grainy after awhile as well.To add insult to injury, remember how I was talking about the great checkpoint system? Well, there is one level where you land on a platform and kill a bunch of big hard to beat guys along with the guys with the shields and huge bats. Once you complete this the place starts falling apart so you have to run and jump from platform to platform as the whole place falls apart. Guess what? THey forgot to put a checkpoint here!! So as you keep falling off to your death, you have to once again battle all the idiots on the platform. This was never done in the game until now. Probably because they felt people needed a real challenge to get to the end of the game. Ugggghhh! Annoying. I got killed three times and that did it for me.This game is probably still worth less than $20 but I am playing Dark Kingdom and that game is a lot more fun to play with more variety and better graphics.

Unfortunately, as I made the jump from PC to PS3, I wasn't impressed. I played with the controls for twenty minutes themselves before becoming frustrated. Since the Sharp Shooter has a certain button layout, it's not really compatible with Portal. Not the gun's fault. So I tried the game without the gun. I still wasn't impressed.Then I tried the 007 demo that takes advantage of the Sharp Shooter, and it was much better, though it still was frustrating. The aim was too high even though I kept resetting the center. Ah well.The gun itself is well built, and seems very sturdy. I got it during Sony's Christmas sale for $15, so at that price it's not too bad. I wouldn't have bought it at the regular MSRP, though, as you're really playing for a piece of plastic that doesn't add to the controls, just modifies the experience. Like the Wii Wheel.But unlike the Wii Wheel, Sony put some thought into the design and layout, as the controls, for the most part, are well positioned on the gun, and the Move and Navigation controller fit snugly in their respective compartments.

I think that was one of the best 2D platformers ever made, and there was very little about it that I would change. But after playing Legends, Origins is like an unrefined chore to play! Somehow, Ubisoft took a near perfect game and improved upon it and polished it and now we have Rayman Legends. The game is amazing.The one thing about Origins that I found somewhat annoying is the emphasis on collecting those electoon things. Finding the hidden ones in each level was cool, but there were the ones you had to get by collecting 300 of those floating things and the ones by doing speed runs, and that got really difficult and annoying.  Especially when you miss the 300 target by like 5! Well, Legends fixes that by just concentrating on 10 Teensies in each level that can be challenging to find, but doesn't rely on a platformer's version of grinding. This makes the game so much fun. Combine that with a crapton of levels, challenges, etc, and this is easily one of the most comprehensive and enjoyable platformers ever.The graphics are great. Again, Origins looked awesome and it's hard to imagine THAT much of an improvement to 2D cel-shaded graphics, but they did it fantastically. The colors in this game really pop and the shading adds a whole new layer to the look of the game. The gameplay is a little floaty, but not bad at all. I love that you don't have to gain abilities like swimming or hovering...you start with them from the beginning. On the Wii U, the Gamepad sections are frantic and fun, and the controls very responsive. I have no complaints.I think Rayman Legends is one of the first releases in this fall season's onslaught of high-profile games, which could mean that it will get overlooked by a lot of people.

Pure was advertised as being just that, and did it ever deliver on the promise! Pure is quite simply the most awesome ATV video game available today. The short tutorials get you right in the action and the controls are pretty much standard. You will have to spend some time playing to pickup the advanced tricks, but by the time you really need them, you will already love the game anyway, or at least I did. The events do get tougher, and you will find that although you were really good before, you must improve to move up. I found the skill levels to be about right. It was hard enough that I wanted to get better, but not so difficult that I gave up. I haven't completed the entire game yet, but I am ranked 6th, so I only need a few more points to be head honcho, well on local play anyway! My only complaint is that there is no split screen mode. You can't play with a friend in your own living room. This is happening more and more these days, and I wish they would knock it off. C'mon, if you can build a video game to play almost flawlessly online, surely it's not that difficult to give us two player mode locally! But, regardless of that complaint, (That fact IS clearly stated on the game) Pure ATV has been hours of fun for me, and I can't wait to have some friends check it out as well. It's just too bad I can't leave them in the dust at the same time!Bottom Line: If you enjoy ATV video games, you will really enjoy this one. If you're not 100% sure, rent for a few days, but be prepared to be buying it soon after!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001DO3NEW","description":"When it comes to music and rhythm games,Wii Musicstands in a class of its own. Unlike other music games, which penalize players if they don't play perfectly,Wii Musicis a musical playground where there are no mistakes. Here anyone can pick up and master the huge array of instruments available, through simple motions like strumming and drumming. Musicians in your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart's content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more. No matter what you do,Wii Musicautomatically transforms your improv stylings into great music.Your music, your waySimple pickup and playability.View larger.Easy controls and learning curve.View larger.Huge array of diverse instruments.View larger.Make music by yourself.View larger.Or with up to 3 friends.View larger.Gameplay: Getting Your Band TogetherInWii Musicevery band has six members: Two play the main melody, two cover the percussion beats, one covers the bass groove and one uses the song's chords to support the melody. As a band, the six members often play their special parts at the same time, though each player can jam however and whenever he or she wants. Play all at once. Take turns in the spotlight. Pair up in creative ways throughout the song. You can bring the band to life by yourself, playing one part at a time-or with up to four players. See game mode below:Solo Play: When you play by yourself, you can add one part at a time to arrange the whole song exactly how you want. The Tutes are on hand to back up your band in any parts you need filled.Multiplayer: When in a band with friends, up to four people can be band members.Wii Friends: Using WiiConnect24, you can send your jam videos to Wii Friends who own Wii Music. They can then watch your performance, modify it to their liking and send their jam videos back to you.Tutes: Your Own Private Back-up BandWhen not playing with friends, you can invite jam masters known as Tutes to play with you. They'll join a session playing an instrument that each thinks is strong for a specific song. You can simply enjoy the musical camaraderie, or pick up instrument tips by watching them jam. If you choose to watch, the Tutes will show you lots of techniques for many of these instruments, then ask you to follow their examples. They'll start with the simplest techniques, then as you master each one, show you even more nuanced ones.Key Game Features:Easy to Play Improv Jams- All members of your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart's content. Play faster. Play slower. Skip a beat, or throw in 10 more.Wii Musicchallenges you to transform your improv stylings into great music. There are no mistakes and no game scores-just playing for the pure joy of playing.Wii Controls Immerse You in the Music- You can play most of the 60-plus instruments inWii Musicusing simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers. Strum to play guitar, banjo and sitar. Drum to play jazz drums, congas and snare drums. Hammer away to play piano, vibraphone and marimba. Unlike most music games,Wii Musicdoesn't make you use many complex buttons. You only need to imitate playing the instrument.Virtually Endless Ways to Make Music- You choose the song and instruments and decide whether to blaze through a rock take on classical songs, put a jazzy spin on folk tunes or transform Nintendo classics like theSuper Mario Bros.theme into Latin-flavored numbers. The song list is only a takeoff point-it's how you improvise with the songs that matters.Share Your Band Jams With Friends- They'll see your Mii band members, your players' improv styles and your instrument selections. They can watch your recordings, or play over parts of your song, then send their modified recording back to you. So you can send improv jams back and forth over WiiConnect24, changing them again and again.60+ InstrumentsYou can play most of the 60-plus instruments inWii Musicusing simple motions with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers.

Make them play quickly, slowly, strongly or gently-the orchestra is at your command.Handbell Harmony: In this musical mini-game, you'll play in a handbell ensemble by swinging your Wii Remote and Nunchuk. Everyone on the team has a job to do: play one of your notes only when the tune demands it.Pitch Perfect: How good is your musical ear? In this whimsical musical quiz, you'll have to solve challenges, like putting note-playing Miis in order from lowest to highest pitch.Drum Mode: In the one mode that uses the Wii Balance Board accessory (sold withWii Fit), you can feel what it's like to play a real-life drum set. You'll use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk as drumsticks, and place both feet on the Wii Balance Board-which work as virtual pedals for the bass drum and hi-hat cymbal.","reviewerName":"Fryfat","summary":"Wii Music : Guitar Hero :: Mario : Pinball","reviewText":"A big mistake being made in nearly every review is people likening Wii Music to Guitar Hero.  It's like comparing Mario to Pinball.Music games generally fit into three categories:- Rhythm  (you copy exactly what you see on the screen)examples:PaRappa The Rapper, Simon Says, Guitar Hero,Dance Dance Revolution- Free Form  (emphasis is on music rather than gameplay)examples:Electroplankton,Traxxpad, Fluid- Hybrid (a combination between a non-music genre, such as an RPG, and a music game)exmaples :Rez, RagnarawkIt's hard to pin Wii Music down, but it best fits into the Free Form category.  The comparisons to Guitar Hero are silly, as Wii Music is not a \"simon says\" type game.  When reviewers compare the two, they're just stating their preference for one genre over another, which is rather useless.One example of people's silliness comparing the two are the complaints about the track list.  Track lists are important to Rhythm games, not so much Free Form games.Much like beginner piano lessons where you're first taught \"Chopsticks\" or \"Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\", Wii Music's track list has songs that ease you into the creation of music, which is the main point of a free-form music game.  The tracks are not for listening to as much as they are templates for your own creations.As a Free Form music game, Wii Music is strange.  While it doesn't allow you total freedom of pitch and tone (which most do), it still allows enough wiggle room to create your own songs.  For example, playing only the 8th notes in a given song - such as Jingle Bell Rock - will sound nothing like Christmas.  Or you can stick to the established notes and remove entire sections, or play certain parts quietly, or just cut loose with the Wiimote and make noise.Still though, you are limited in what you can do, as Wii Music doesn't allow total musical freedom.  The tradeoff in losing that freedom is that it lets non-musicians create music with relative ease.  I want to emphasize \"relative\", because making music is still difficult; it takes thought, planning and some basic knowledge of music theory.  Wii Music wisely teaches players the basics of music theory over many lessons, though some painfully last 30+ minutes, and I wish they'd use real music terminology rather than dumbed-down terms.The last song I made took two hours to get to the point where I was happy with it.  Those two hours were spent experimenting with different instruments, rhythms, and melodies - all of which were enjoyable.  It was also spent dealing with occasionally inaccurate controls, frustrations with certain notes I couldn't change, and some bad sounding midi instruments - all of which were not enjoyable.Collaboration is fun, so long as you're both in the same mood (creative or silly).  I've jammed with friends sitting on the couch at the same time, as well as people online where we take turns adding pieces to the composition.Wii Music has the ability to save and share your creations, something I wish other free-form games would focus on, but the sharing features still come up short to youtube, which has become the premiere place for users to show off completed works.Wii Music is also full of mini-games, including ones that focus on volume, theory, memory and yes - rhythm.  You can compare the little bell game to Guitar Hero all you want :)  However, these are mostly distractions compared to the real meat - the free form \"jam\" mode.Wii Music, even for a free-form music game, is strange, brilliant and sometimes frustrating.  It's sad that its been shoved into the middle of the silly \"hardcore vs casual\" game war, released at the same time as popular rhythm games (increasing the amount of useless comparisons) and is often judged by reviewers with an established belief of what a music game can and can't be.  In the end it's one of Nintendo's most ambitious and insane games ever made, and if you have some untapped creativity lying around, it's worth a buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2008"}

If you cannot get through a particular game, there is no need to worry. You get a stamp for trying and after three stamps, you have completed that level. If you win, you get three stamps and advance immediately.It saves your progress although there is not a way to keep more than one saved file.Most games have three levels of play, easy, medium, and hard. There are a variety of skins for each game (normal, stone, paper, techno) but these are unlocked by playing and winning.Some of my favorites are: backgammon, connect five, grid attack, Spades, Escape and Word Balloon. Some of the games do not offer much in the way of a challenge but are great for passing time and zoning out.There are some duds like soda shake (although for some reason I keep doing it...) bowling (way too hard to do with a stylus) and darts.This is not a game that builds excitement but is great for a doctor's waiting room, to de-stress after a busy day or just to better your score.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2010"}

As you have heard this game borrows heavily from many titles from both cinema and gaming. This works to this games advantage in so many ways. This game really sucks you in to the point where you become totally absorbed and immersed in your surroundings.The gameplay is excellent as there are many different functions that can be utilized using the controller. Anti-gravity is definitely a stand out feature on this game. There is nothing else like it out there. Combat is also a great feature that is made a lot of fun by using the dissecting feature. Enemies are hard to take down as they are fast and have thick skin. There are a few weapons to choose from and all have their pros and cons on individual enemy types. There are a few puzzles scattered about the game that make for a fun change of pace.Graphics and sound on this title are some of the best to date. The main characters costume is truly an awesome sight to behold on the screen. The enemies are scary and disgusting which makes you want to kill them ASAP. A few reviews mention that the game gets predictable after awhile. Although you will get a sense of when an enemy is going to enter the scene due to a cue via scary music, you will still be jolted quite often as they don't always come from the same areas as some say. The music and sound effects are critical in making this game as great as it is.The storyline is another plus. You are basically spending most of the game trying to get your ship up and running. This entails a lot of running around trying to perform various tasks while fending of the Necromorphs. This game was put together perfectly. I can tell that they spent a lot of time and effort on this game to make it the best they could. It paid off bigtime! I'm really impressed by this one. It keeps my interest whereas a lot of other games in the same genre can't even come close. It's hard to put the controller down on this one. It's truly a beautiful game in every aspect.I have nothing negative regarding this game except that it would be nice to see another human being every now and then (that isn't dead) as this game has a very isolated and claustrophobic feel to it. Dead Space can make you feel a little jumpy right after you play it, especially at night. That's the power of a great survival horror title. It can really give you an adrenaline boost every now and then. Dead Space is probably only a half star lower than Fallout 3 and Bioshock imo. You won't regret buying this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYOOA","reviewerName":"OrangeCrush \"Still shooting with Film!\"","summary":"I Am Loving the HD Upgrades.....","reviewText":"I will openly admit that many of my favorite games are from past console generations. That's why I consider this HD remake trend to be the most exciting development in all of gaming right now. Beyond Good and Evil, Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil: Code Veronica...have loved replaying all of them. Now they have plans for Silent Hill and many others. Its like videogame nirvana. Its great for publishers as they get to make more money on a game that is already made, simply by doing a few upgrades. More importantly, its great for gamers as it gives fans of the games the ability to play the games again, with an HD upgrade. Of course, it also gives gamers that have never played the games a chance to experience them firsthand. Its just a win, win, win scenario all the way around...at least in my book.That brings me to Metal Gear Solid HD, which in my opinion is the best HD remake's done so far. Personally I purchased this for MGS 2 & 3. Peace Walker is just a bonus as I really didn't have much interest in playing it and have only had a few short sessions with it thus far. It is important to note, as others have already done, that Peace Walker was originally a PSP game so if you go in expecting a top notch HD experience on the same level of MGS2 or MGS3....well, your going to come out the other end disappointed. For what it was, the developers did a very good job bringing it to the 360 and PS3.Basically this package is exactly what it says it is, an HD upgrade of these games. The old style controls are still intact, which I am sure many people were hoping would be updated as well. I think controls should remain the same as changing the controls is changing the game itself and that isn't what the HD remakes should be about. Do you think the tension would be the same in Resident Evil: Code Veronica if it had an updated control system? Not a chance. HD remakes should be about preserving the games as much as they should be about updating them to HD standards. Thankfully that is exactly what we get with this package. In all honesty, I think MGS is one of the most polarizing games ever to hit store shelves. People either love them or hate them and this release isnt going to change any minds. The people that love these games will love this package and the people that hate these games....well, they will still hate them.As for how they look, I certainly wasn't disappointed. Personally I think that MGS3 benefited the most from this upgrade but that isn't saying that MGS2 looks bad. Quite the contrary actually as it looks great. Its just that MGS3's environments are better suited to the upgrade. MGS2's environments were small and confined compared to MGS3. In regards to the updated graphics I would rate MGS2 a 7/10 and MGS3 a 9/10. Again, I really haven't played Peace Walker enough to really say much about it, just that it looks good given that it was originally a PSP game.Bottom line - If your a MGS fan then you should absolutely pick this package up and re-experiences these titles. If you dislike the MGS series then skip it. This release certainly isn't going to change your opinion. For those new to the series, there really isn't anything else out there like MGS. You simply have to play it to understand what the fuss is all about. Hideo Kojima is a master storyteller. Things may get quirky from time to time and they might even be a bit difficult to follow from time to time but that's Hideo Kojima. Overall, MGS's stories/characters are some of the more interesting stories/characters to ever grace a videogame console and ironically some aspects of these stories have more relevance today than they did back when they were originally released. There is a reason that this series is one of the most successful in history.As for the developers - Keep the HD remakes coming!!5 Stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2011"}

Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail.

However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy.

Ten years ago when I sat in front of my bulky CRT monitor gaming my brains out, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is what I imagined video games would be like in the year 2011. Sadly, as we all know, the game industry regressed in almost all areas except graphics in the last ten years. Bored to tears with the seemingly biannual Call of Duty releases and all their clones, frustrated with the latest lackluster, dumbed down release of a once proud franchise (ahem, Civilization and Command and Conquer), insulted by the latest game breaking DRM scheme, annoyed with yet another clunky console port, I've become jaded to say the least and I don't buy many games anymore.Deus Ex was (and still is!) one of my all time favorites games and I was skeptical when I heard of this new prequel. Instead of looking forward to it like I once would have, I waited for release day then popped into to Amazon intent on reading the plethora of bad reviews slamming this game into it's rightful place. Lo and behold what did I find? Near universal acclaim? What's going on here? I decided to take a chance and shell out the dough and check it out myself. Right choice!Choices, choices, choices! Yes, the game gives you missions, goals and a storyline but the method of progressing through them is left entirely up to you. And I mean entirely! Let's say you need to (or just want to!) explore a room. There's a guard on patrol, a turret guarding the hallway, and a security camera over the door. Hmmmm what to do? Well, you can charge in guns blazing and take out everyone and everything in your path or you can sit back and devise a more cerebral approach. Find a vent and bypass them altogether, chuck a fire extinguisher at the turret that creates a nice cloud for you to hide behind as you advance, hack a computer and disable security leaving the guard to your mercy. How about this one? Knock out the guard, drag his body to a conspicuous area (thus attracting his friends) and hack the turret to take them all out! I suppose if you really wanted to you could punch a hole in a wall and drop a grenade through it too. I'm just scratching the surface here, the simple act of advancing down a hallway in this game has more replay value than most entire games these days!The graphics aren't exactly cutting edge but they're not bad either. It looks like an updated Deus Ex so I'm perfectly happy with the visual presentation. Voice acting is so-so, not a deal breaker but it didn't wow me. The game's not perfect but the cons are small compared to the overall scope of the game. My biggest gripe is the odd choice to include boss battles. The game encourages choices in your play style but boss battles are guns blazing battle royales and that's it. You can't exploit all your skills, you just unload a ton of rounds into the guy. I thought that was a strange decision. If you are specced out as stealthy sneak you will be at a major disadvantage when a boss shows up which is weird because the game gives you the most rewards for using non-lethal and creative tactics in every other part. Again, not a deal breaker, I just thought it was strange.The one thing that cost this game a star is that stupid Steam program. Before all you Steam fanboys start spamming this review please understand that I don't care if you like Steam. I don't think it's as evil as some do but I don't like it and I resent being forced to use it. Steam is what it is, if you like it, more power to you. Personally I find it to be an annoyance more than a service and given the choice, that thing wouldn't come anywhere near my HDD. I do feel this game is worth putting up with it though, it's that good.In conclusion, buy this game! Play it, love it and enjoy a return to the golden age of gaming!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

Survival horror as its never been seen before, The House of the Dead: OVERKILL is a pulp-style take on the best selling, classic SEGA light-gun shooter series. Back when the famous Agent G was fresh out of the academy, he teamed up with hard-boiled bad-ass Agent Washington to investigate stories of mysterious disappearances in small-town Louisiana. Little did they know what blood-soaked mutant horror awaited them in the streets and swamps of Bayou City.","reviewerName":"credit risk","summary":"Stale and not a $50 game.","reviewText":"This game is fun because shooting targets with the wiimote is fun.But other than that I felt let down that the developer didn't try to add to that formula.  The result is that HotD:Overkill is pretty stale.  And that is disappointing.The criticisms are many.The camera work wasn't that good.  There's often a lot of long sweeping camera movements that border on tedious.  They could and should have trimmed many of the camera shots down.The boss fights are meh - mediocre.  Not interesting.  Uninspiring.  On the second boss fight I often sat there for 30 second waiting for him to reappear so I could shoot him.  And I had no idea what he was supposed to be.The graphics are so-so.  Technically impressive in many spots for the Wii, but lacking a great art style.  Also there is too much slowdown in frame rate.  Not a show stopper, but you wonder why they release games with as much slowdown as this game has.Imo Ghost Squad, an arcade lightgun port on the Wii, is much smoother, slicker and better paced.I also think the target shooting game that comes with the Wii Zapper has more variety than HotD:Overkill.  Hell you might be able to make the case that the target shooting game in WiiPlay has more variety in gameplay than HotD:Overkill.Seriously, and I hate to say it, but Zelda's Crossbow Training is more interesting than HotD:OK.  It might be lacking a few modes, but it's also a $5 or $10 game depending on the price you place on the Wii Zapper it comes with.I will make a confession.  I could only get through the first 3 or 4 levels in HotD:Overkill.  I have not played the full game.  But it's not for the lack of skill.  There is a chance the rest of HotD:Overkill could be super awesome and I would not know.  But imo that would be the developer's fault.  Not mine.  They should really put there best content first or enough of it so the player keeps playing.In the end there really is nothing here very interesting.  And the $50 pricepoint makes the game next to impossible to recommend.  Perhaps if you have a friend to play the game with and really love these games then you go ahead.  As I said shooting targets with the wiimote is fun.  Shooting them with a friend is even more fun than that.But I just think this game is a letdown overall.  A wasted opportunity.  I have a few of these games already and this one really doesn't add anything except it is the only one I won't play with my 8 yr old around.They should have spent more time making the gameplay more interesting rather than just giving us more f-bombs or gore or special effects per minute.  It is fairly apparent they are trying to entertain the player more with the latter than the former.  Maybe you're that player.  I wasn't.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2009"}

Equipped with newly acquired skills, amazing new vehicles, and help from new and old friends, Spyro must find a way to return the dragonflies and restore order to the Dragon Realm.","reviewerName":"Antoinette Johnson \"Pooky\"","summary":"The glinchiest game I've ever played.","reviewText":"I love the Spyro series. My favorite was Spyro Year of the Dragon which was perfect. When I heard Spyro was gonna be on next gen systems I was excited! Boy...I did not espect them to butcher the series for me.For one this game was not made by Insomniac games who are responsible for making the first 3 kickass games. That was my first sign this probably wasn't gonna be as good as I want it to be. (May contain spoilers)Story: This entire story is a plot hole. In the 2nd Spyro Ripto was the main villian and you kill him at the end. This game gives no explanation on how the hell he returns. I understand the Dragonfly plot, but Riptos return is just crazy.Graphics: Even though the graphics looked pretty good, I found lots of graphical glitches. For one the game lags alot. Before trading my copy I had a glitch where the all the sheep in the game front leg stretched into the sky. I restarted my console, but the glitch remained. It wouldn't go away. I also noticed the character designs seemed a little distorted at time. In the honey world theres a graphical glitch where all the honey stops flowing too. Damn! Did they have any quality assurance?Gameplay: The gameplay works the same as the first 3 games, but new firebreathing techniques are added. I found lots of trouble wuth the bubble breath. I would be chasing a dragonfly and I will clearly be hitting it with the bubblebreath, but he won't be caught. That is a huge pain in the ass later on when you have to chase them annoying things on platforms and are faster. Once again theres lag. Lagging is a huge issue in this game because it happens often and slow gameplay. theres also this funny ass glitch where you swim un the air. In the homeworld just swim to the edge of the water at the Beach world entrance. Do a headslam and hold square when you do it and start swimming in the air like its water. You can go all over the place with it. This prooves they didn't test the game before releasing it. I also had trouble figuring out what to do after fighting Ripto. I got no ending or nothing, so I tried collecting everything. It was impossible. I needed one gem and it was in the Thieves den. I spent days looking for it even using Sparks to help, but it never showed up. In the dragon dojo there was a glitch that happens when you try to get the kites for the baby dragons. IIf you jump in the right spot around the kite trees, the game will make the mistake of thinking you touched the kite and give it to the baby. Removing any strategy involved with getting it the normal way.Sound: One of the highlights of Spyro games was always the sound and music. The music wasn't too bad. Its definately not the usual Spyro formula, but it wasn't too bad. I notived alot of the music consisted of what sounds to me like Indian chants. My favorite tracks were in the Thieves Den level. The music is kind of boring though. Its lacks the intensity and fun of the older games. Sadly even the sound has glitches. sometimes the music and sounds skip. In the Dragon Dojo the sound of the enemies attacking skipped the entire time I was in the level and wouldn't go away until I left.Lengh: This game is short. I MEAN short. Its only one world! I mean WTF! Spyro the dragon had 5 worlds including a bonus, Riptos Rage had 3 including an bonus, and Year of the dragon had 4 including many extras. This has one world with 7 or 8 short levels! From my knowledge theres not even a bonus for getting all coins and dragonflies. You don't get all your money from Moneybags the bear, theres no extra powers, nosatisfying cutscene, or any reason to try and complete the levels 100%. As mention earlier nothing happened when I defeated Ripto so I know this because of a LP I saw on Youtube.In short Spyro Enter the Dragonfly was a huge disappointment. This game could have been good if put in the right hands. I would love to see it remade with all these problems taken care of, but given the bad recession this series has had lately, I don't see that happening anytime soon.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2010"}

Doom allies with Loki to build his &#8220;Doom Ray of Doom&#8221;.  Nick Fury gathers the world&#8217;s Superheroes together to track down all of these bricks, battling some of the Marvel Universe&#8217;s most insidious villains along the way.  You play the game usually in pairs or trios of heroes, taking on a wide variety of missions to track down the bricks.  You&#8217;ll start with Spider-Man, Ironman, and The Hulk battling the Abomination and the Sandman for the first of the bricks.  Next, Mr. Fantastic teams with Captain America to battle Doctor Octopus.Along the way you&#8217;ll also play in missions as Black Widow, Hawkeye, Thor, The Human Torch, Invisible Girl, The Thing, Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Iceman , and the Beast, as you battle the who&#8217;s who of Marvel villains including The Green Goblin, The Red Skull, Magneto, M.O.D.O.K., Sabretooth, Juggernaut and, finally, the Big G himself, Galactus!If you played any LEGO game before you&#8217;ll know the score&#8230;smash objects, pickup coins and bricks, and built helpful items.  Each character has their own special abilities that you will keep you making frequent changes to the one you need to perform a particular task.  The difficulty is low in terms of you really can&#8217;t die and there&#8217;s no timers in boss battles although there are certain puzzle situations that need to be thought out.  Finishing the game merely opens up the open play where you go about collecting  everything and unlocking new characters, up to 150 in all.

In my opinion, the PS3 graphics were way superior and amazed me even before I plug it through HDMI, which Xbox lacks at the moment.  There are similarities between the two systems like online game play, demos, trailers, and games to download online.  One difference I notice was how much quieter it ran versus the xbox.  The xbox when playing a 360 game was really loud, but the ps3 is just as quiet as when playing a game from it's hard drive.The high definition era of this system is unbeatable...it has everything built in...all in one.  You got high def gaming, movies, HDMI, music all built into the system.  Microsoft has some of this, but it comes in separate components which causes clutter for some.  Some issues with it may be that the downloading my take a while, and you can't do anything else with the ps3 when it's downloading otherwise the download would cancel.  Maybe a future firmware can fix this.  Another things is that the controller lacks the vibration feature, but the new motion sensor makes up for the lost in vibration.If you're still deciding which system to get...this is the best recommendation I can make...it will keep you entertained for years to come and keep you on the \"cutting edge\" of technology.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2006"}

It is my opinion that Dead or alive is about nothing else but [exploitation]. This statement holds true of DOA 3, but for some strange reason it works for me this time. I noticed that the \"bounce\" that the series is well known for has been toned down significantly, and the movement of the characters is more realistic. I guess because the game itself has less of an emphasis on [exploitation] that I can take it more seriously as a fighter game, which is why I enjoyed this one, and plan to buy it later.However some of its predecessor's weaknesses rear their ugly head. Once again the game attempts to tell an incoherent and irrelevant story that makes no sense. Temco needs to learn how to tell a cohesive narrative in the worst way. The fighting engine itself becomes tiresome, as many of the computer-operated characters can be beaten with the same simple combination kicks over and over again. The repetitive nature of the combat makes this fighter only good in a two-player match. Once you get over the graphics the game becomes quite shallow.

There is no currency system like in the first or second games to get one-shot kills, or any weapon whenever you want (which was something I also didn't like about 3). Throwing back grenades was removed, and treasures are no longer up on walls or ceilings. The last one isn't necessarily a negative, just a change.There are a lot more treasures and hidden mysteries in this game than the other three combined. Some of these secrets are easy to find, standing obviously out in the open, some are a little off the beaten path, and there are plenty of classic, sinisterly hidden treasures as well. Each treasure now has a purpose and a little historical information tagged to it when you look it up int he journal. This was nice, and many of the items have voice overs for even deeper description. The touch screen controls add a lot more interaction with Nate's physical environment which may not be for everyone but I found as an interesting game experience. There are also bounties from enemies which can be traded using the Near function. Haven't used this yet, but it certainly gives the game more replay value. Each of the bounties also has a description, and some of the more rare ones also have voice overs.As for the rest of the game, expect it to be Uncharted as you have come to know. There's plenty of climbing, ducking for cover in huge gunfights, and a sometimes insanely difficult Crushing setting for gaming masochists like me who have to get every platinum trophy.If you like Uncharted, check it out. It doesn't disappoint.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000083JTR","description":"Tom Clancy's Splinter Cellgrants players access to the highest echelons of national security, where shadowy operatives have the freedom to do whatever it takes to safeguard America. The player controls Sam Fisher, a field operative of a secretive black-ops NSA subagency called Third Echelon. Sam Fisher is geared up to infiltrate high-security strongholds, seize critical intelligence, destroy threatening data, and neutralize the enemy--all without leaving a trace.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"One of the best games for the PS2 to date","reviewText":"One of the few games that I actually loved playing for the XBox, I had mixed feelings when I heard that Splinter Cell would be released for the PS2.  My reasons why?  Take a look at games like Wreckless and Dead to Rights.  Both of them were great previously XBox exclusive games that when ported to the PS2 were only a shadow of the games they were on Microsoft's money bag.  However we need not worry, Splinter Cell has been brought to the PS2 almost flawlessly, and the end result is one of the best games for the PS2 to date.  The formula for Splinter Cell looks simple on paper: you play as Sam Fisher (voiced greatly by Michael Ironside), an NSA agent who uses his stealth and military skills to uncover a terrorist group's agenda.  Your mission is to infiltrate high security buildings to retrieve top secret info, and this is where the fun of Splinter Cell is to be had.  You have to keep your cover in the shadows and make sure enemies don't spot you.  Believe it or not, while that sounds a bit boring, it can be very exhilarating and exciting, and when you get to take your enemies out the game gets even sweeter.  At your disposal is an array of high tech gadgets and weapons ranging from night vision goggles, a rifle which allows you to fire lethal and non-lethal ammo, and a pair of binoculars which are new to the PS2 version.  The control layout is very well laid out and the analog sticks provide precision movement for moving around and taking aim.  The graphics are phenominal, although a bit watered down from the XBox version (which was to be expected), but a superb lighting engine and the realistic character movements help the game shine.  The voice acting is phenominal as well, and Ironside's voice has never sounded better.  Although there are a few gripes (such as the levels are not as long and you can't explore them like you could in the XBox version), it does not take away from Splinter Cell being a phenominal game, and this is a must own for PS2 gamers everywhere.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2003"}

{"product_name":"B004UDB9SA","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris Chapa","summary":"A change of pace from other RE titles...but a welcome one?","reviewText":"Okay...first off, Resident Evil is MY game. What I mean to say is: some people may align themselves with a particular series of games that they are faithful player of. Resident Evil is mine. I have been wrapped up in RE since the Playstation original and have been first in line at the release of every one that came after (when I was able to!).Any fan of a long running series knows: at some point, the makers release a game that goes against the the vein of the series and changes things up. These 'rogue' games aren't always a good thing. Some have been (I'm sure), but most aren't. Operation Raccoon City is unfortunately, part of the latter.*This review is based on the single/offline player campaign and does not reflect online play or DLC*There IS an awesome nostalgia factor at work here, since game puts you behind the scenes and in the shadows of Resident Evil 2 and Nemesis. It was pretty cool walking through a decent portion of the Raccoon City Police Department, hearing a variation of the very familiar song from the \"main hall\" of the building playing in the background. Honestly, that gave me goosebumps! There numerous run-ins with characters from the old games that neatly weave themselves into the story without doing any facts getting 'clashed'...except for the ending. But you can figure that one out for yourself if you choose.But there were a few negative elements at work as well:This game is by and large meant for online play. That much is obvious from the moment you insert the disk. The layout of the main menu caters 90% to online play modes and settings, with a small little icon reserved for single player/offline campaign. With or without internet connection, there are load times in excess of 70 seconds at times, which may not mean much to most...but I would have figured that we had moved past load times in this day and age. Minus a few points for that.You get to choose from 6 members of your team to play as, including the 3 more AI that will join you on these mission-based scenarios. Each character has a specialty, as well as unique skills that can be earned and upgraded through experience points(EXP). EXP can also be used to unlock different firearms for you to pick from the start menu before each mission. Some weapons are unique where they can only be found in this menu, when a lot of other weapons that can be unlocked can just as well be found lying on the ground during the levels.There is no inventory list to be had, with the exception of a D-Pad inventory, which allows you to hold 3 different types of grenades, ONE anti-virus spray, and ONE first aid spray. Green herbs are still in the game, but you cannot collect them; they are simply a \"use it if you need it\" when you see them lying around.Puzzles are absent, and gameplay is 200% faster than past titles. Think of the gameplay for gears of War. Best addition to the Resident Evil series? FINALLY BEING ABLE TO RUN AND GUN!!! As fun as it is to clear rooms of zombies with an automatic shotgun, it's a little too easy after awhile. However, there are quite a few different enemies prowling around that keep the tempo up and balance out the action. Did you miss those pesky Hunters?AI for your team and the 'human enemies' is pretty dumb and predictable. Controls are sticky when needing revive your team mates (which is crap anyway because they can't revive YOU!). This becomes a bigger issue when...There are areas that have an infinite spawning of zombies, lickers, spec ops. No matter how much blasting you do and how many runs to an ammo drop you make, they will never stop. Only when you muscle past them and reach your destination marker is there a cut scene or transition that gets you out of that area. Best bet is to not get the idea that you can hunker down near an ammo box and slay anything that comes your way...you will be there a long time, or you will die. A lot.I'd say that the replay value is moderate/moderately high, given that you can maximize the stats on all your characters, if that's your thing. Otherwise, I'd say that this is a mediocre game that serves as an okay excuse to hold folks over until Resident Evil 6.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2012"}

I just got a copy myself just to give it a second chance, since I can't really say I had much to go on to judge the game from what little I saw. Boy was I wrong. This game is so much fun, most fun I've had with a Capcom fighting release since Street Fighter Alpha 3. Street Fighter 4 on the PS3 was decent, but I HATED the speed of the game. Tatsunoko vs Capcom gets the speed right. It's fast paced and has tons of bright flashing colours from super moves and special techniques. The shatter-glass effect caused by specials is pretty cool too. I really like the cast. All my fav characters from Rival School, Street Fighter, G-Force, Dark Stalkers, MegaMan, and the list goes on. ONLY STARS. I thought I would hate the controllers, and I did first actually the day I tried it out at my friend's place. Probably just needed to give it some time. I couldn't see how a game like that could be played on a sideways wii remote and two attack buttons but it's actually very deep in terms of combat. Once you understand it, and now I do. the fighting becomes very complex and it enjoyable to play. Very rewarding. The only downside is that if you just got this game like me, it's hard to find online battles nowadays :( Besides that this is a gorgeous must have fighter if you're a wii owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

I am 32 years old and actually have no patience.  So video gaming just doesn't seem like a fit for me.  I'm not very good at playing them.  All that said, I love video games.  I never was one to have every system or anything like that though.  I had Nintendo until Playstation came out.  Then the PS2 (which is horribly overpriced and I have had nothing but trouble out of.  I also refuse to buy a replacement considering it was $200 plus when I bought it.)The reason I mention this is that I fell in love with Resident Evil when it first came out and not the Gamecube version I'm talking about the one that you probably laugh at now.So when I heard that Gamecube was going to have exclusive rights to Resident Evil I was horrified.  I didn't want to buy a system just for one game series.I was wrong!  I bought my Gamecube recently when the price hit the newest low.  It is the best gaming system I've tried.  The graphics are fantastic.  Frame rate couldn't be better.  I don't have to worry about it hanging up(knock on wood) or other problems.  It's built so I although I wouldn't beat on it I don't feel horrible if it gets bumped.  So far the games I have played with it have been beautiful to look out and also are fun to play.  I'm not into kid games and they have the games I enjoy.  I recently played Medal of Honor RS on it and it ran wonderfully on the Gamecube.  I had tried the PS2 version and it hung up and had disc read errors.  Don't get me wrong I am not knocking PS2.  I just find this little system amazing it's compact and so are the games.  My fear was that I was purchasing this system for only a few games, but have found that they have a pretty good variety in the types of games I enjoy.The compact nature of this system is great. I can easily unhook this and use on other tv's in my house.  That is great since I have a much younger brother who likes to trade systems with me and a nephew.Now for my complaint I know many of you absolutely adore the controller.  I'm sorry I don't. Maybe I have small hands, maybe not, but the controller makes me feel like I do.  I'd prefer one a bit lighter and a little less bulky. That's a small complaint though in an overall great system.One minor issue, not a complaint because most systems require the same thing, is the memory card.  Of course you have to purchase them separately unless you find someone offering them with purchase(I haven't found one yet).  The 251 that nintendo makes is pretty good but still if you intend on saving many games and only have one card you end up having to delete games in order to save additional games.For the money and quality this would be a system I'd recommend especially if you aren't so sure where to spend your money.  You'll get a high quality system that doesn't seem as delicate as others and a company that carries a wide range of games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2003"}

{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"JckDnls","summary":"Great MP, passable SP and Co-Op","reviewText":"I've been a Battlefield fan for a few years now, and I have certainly enjoyed my time with Battlefield 3.  The campaign is forgettable, but fun enough to finish.  The co-op is borderline mediocre/downright bad (both in content and in glitches) and I only played it until I acquired all the guns that can be unlocked for MP.  That's all I'll say about those because the MP is the selling point of the game.Multiplayer is a lot of fun, but it is an acquired taste.  Twitch-gameplay is not the modus operandi here.  To really get the most out of the experience you need to be on a mic talking to your squad.  For whatever reason most people on this game decide to opt out of using their  mics (Mic-only servers can be found, but they're few and far between).  The MP has a few annoyances (to me, personally) but for the most part they are easily overlooked.  The sniper class compared to the one found in BC2 is largely useless.  I will occasionally get tagged by one, but it's very rarely a kill and snipers are more often than not a detriment to their team.  One or two good snipers could really hold down an objective in BC2, not so much here.  With the million candle-beam floodlight they have attached to their scope they are also easy to spot and/or kill.  Lastly, a few really annoying \"trends\" seem to come and go in MP (it used to be the USAS with frag rounds, at the time of this writing it's the M26 Dart).  Dice also goes a little crazy with the tweaks in their patches, but I guess it comes with the territory.Overall it's a largely great game, and if you haven't tired of military shooters yet, well worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2012"}

Unlike other game environments that serve as nothing more than a visual backdrop, the devastating Helghan climate takes a notable toll. And, worst of all, the Helghans know exactly how to use the planet against you.The in-your-face perspective comes to life as you take aim with exotic new weapons and mainstays from the previous games, including the M82-G assault rifle. And you can now drive an array of rugged, sometimes strange, vehicles that expand the gruesome possibilities of war.Guerilla Technology in a Terrifying, Realistic WorldGuerrilla's unique visuals and deferred rendering technology ensure that even the ugliest situations on Helghan are beautifully lit. Ambient occlusion and accurate shadow casting from a variety of light sources combine with gritty textures, detailed environments, and studio-grade special effects to help complete the realistic, Hollywood experience of this first-person shooter.Real-time cutscenes, full-screen anti-aliasing, motion blurs, and internal lens reflections all bring you into the fold and work to maximize the hardware capabilities of the PS3. And the audio experience is no less impressive. 7.1 surround sound capability lend a truly dynamic sound element to your experience, while audio occlusion with wave tracing means that you can hear the difference between indoor and outdoor firefights.Chaotic Multiplayer Drama OnlineWhile single-player mode lets you take on the unique challenges of 11 fully developed levels, online play lets you engage with up to 32 players at a time, bringing the gritty, realistic chaos of war to a whole new level.Other multi-player friendly enhancements in Killzone 2 include in-game clan management, a match wagering system, and the ability to integrate new information and track friends and enemies with the community at Killzone.com.","reviewerName":"Amir Alturkistani \"Video Games lover\"","summary":"the graphics are top notch but.........","reviewText":"this game graphic wise is definitely entertaining, but the game controls and the extent of attachment to the reality in this game is sort of sucking the fun out of vidoe gaming. the only one machine gun feature in this game is so off putting and the no crouching option is unacceptable.The game cairtenly doesn't deserve a less than 4 stars rating but it also doesn't deserve a 5 star rating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2009"}

The HK MP-7 SMG was pathetic in this game. The accuracy was mediocre and the damage was extremely limited. In terms of gameplay, HL2 gets 5/5 from me. However, it kept crashing every so often on my gaming rig to the point that I stopped playing the game for over a month until I just wanted to get it off my desk.I do not like Steam and it appears that it has never even asked for my DVD.

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"Robert SV","summary":"One of the Best Gameplay in a Wii Video Game","reviewText":"It is an great old schoool game on the Wii and had a magnificent gameplay, if you play it with the Wii Balance Board the game is more fun that the most game I palyed on the Wii, with the Wiii Balance Board if you move rigth ,left or duck, \"Little Joe\" move with youIts a very fun game, but it is a graet exercise game, you must have a good physical condition to play it with the Wii Balance Board + Wii remote + nunchunk, when I played for the first time in that way I just resist around 3 match before get tired, now I resist around 10 match (with 3 round each one) and I loose around 5lb of weight in 2 weeks, just playing it(every day around 10 - 30 minutes, it depend of how much you \"move your body\" playing the game).This game is great not just a great old school game, but a most interactive game(and healthy), ideal for who don't like to play just pushing buttons, if you have a Wii Balance Board you must have this game","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}

I appreciated the depth of the plot, which sort of took a moral stand against the views of Ayn Rand and seemed to promote altruism as the greatest human virtue.I played Bioshock 2 for like 30 minutes and quit, because I felt it wasn't a sequel, it was just an expansion pack.But I have to say I am very impressed with Bioshock: Infinite.First of all, I think that the \"moral\" of the game is well thought out, but at the same time more ambiguous. Just as in \"real life\" there are no clear-cut bad guys and good guys.Second, I think the pace of the game is fantastic. Half-Life 2 is (in my opinion) not only the best game ever, but the most perfectly paced game. This game comes as close to that as any game I've played.Now that video games have become such big business, I feel that gaming is suffering the same fate as that of Hollywood: The overwhelming majority are s***ty and worthless, because even a s***ty game can still make a ton of money (I'm looking at you, Sim City).

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Dave \"odyssasthai\"","summary":"XBO-PS4 Comparison (I own both)","reviewText":"I got both consoles at launch. (I bought the PS4, XBO was a gift) Both made solid improvements in multiple areas and are awesome machines, but honestly I think your choice should hinge on what you use it for. Below is my review for the XBO and also a comparison to the PS4:*Quick Overview*:- Get the XBO if you want a more well rounded platform, with better controls, media support, multitasking and network services.- Get the PS4 if high-end 1080p graphics and price are the most important thing to you.In short, the PS4 has more power under the hood, but the XBO has better controllers/camera, better network/cloud support, better app support, better media support. If high-end games are your thing, the PS4 might be better for you. If you do a wide range of things, the XBO might be better.*Xbox One Review*:The XBox One has throw-back design, and while it's bigger than the 360, it is much cooler and quieter. I've had no technical problems with it. Everything about the Xbox One has been improved, including processing power, controllers and the UI. I especially love the HDMI-in support and it's integration with my windows apps (for instance, it immediately picked up my current music library off my windows machine). And this is where the XBox One excels. Yes, the games are great, but that's only part of what gamers do... many of us listen to music, watch movies & TV, chat with friends and send messages. The XBO makes it easy to switch between all these functions in an instant, even having multiple apps up at once.On the software side, I really enjoyed Ryse--it is probably my favorite \"exclusive\" title so far, despite what the professional reviews said. Dead Rising was also a blast. I had more fun with these titles than I did with Knack and Killzone, although props should be given to Sony for their inclusion of Resogun and Contrast with their free month trial to PSN. Both were fun games on the PS4.Where the Xbox is left wanting is it's graphical processing power. On paper, the PS4 appears to have a decent lead here. Comparing Ryse to Killzone, or Call of Duty/AC: Black Flag between the platforms, there doesn't seem to be a noticeable gap YET--I actually thought Ryse is the best looking title I own--but the fact that some PS4 titles are in native 1080p and some Xbox games aren't should be a big red flag. (On the other hand, similar performance claims were made about how the PS3 Cell Processor was ~3x faster than the 360's or that the Wii U was \"17x\" as fast as the PS3, and neither of these really panned out in terms of graphics quality. We'll see though--but I definitely think the PS4 has the edge.)*XBOX One vs PlayStation 4*:XBO Advantages:+ Better overall game lineup+ Better network/cloud support+ Better controllers/cameras+ Better media support+ Better appsPS4 Advantages:+ Better graphics power/1080p support+ Better price point+ Better \"arcade\" games+ Better looking and smaller case (no power brick!)I hope that helps!My PS4 Review: http://www.amazon.com/review/R27LP2L5V6FXH7/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN;=B00BGA9WK2&linkCode;=&nodeID;=&tag;=","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00009TW6R","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"Halo, Good-bye (3 Stars)","reviewText":"It's finally here! And it's... okay. That I think is the best way to describe Halo- several years late, even before Microsoft assimilated Bungie, they had always planned to do a PC version, and had it been released three years ago, it would have been cutting edge. Instead, we get a two year old Xbox cast off retooled by Gearbox Software with oversight by Bungie. Personally, I think they should have put a little more time into Halo than they did, because if this is what Bungie had in mind for what was then a ground breaking title, then I'm afraid it falls short in several areas, not least of which is some of the most amateurish and dull level design I have ever seen. I generally hold FPS games up against the likes of Jedi Knight, Half-Life, and the original Unreal- if it can compare to the quality of design of those games, then it scores big.Halo's story, in a nutshell, is basically this: humanity is at war with a collection of races known as the Covenant, who are basically religious fanatics and the gods of which have declared humanity unclean and therefore must be exterminated. Naturally, the humans are losing the war so they concoct a plan to engineer super cyborg soldiers to combat Covenant, which they do successfully, but it's a case of too little too late. The last Spartacus II, the Master Chief, a.k.a you, are onboard the human starship Pillar of Autumn, when it engages several Covenant warships while investigating a ring word (I wonder if Niven got any royalties for that.), known as Halo. The ship is damaged and crash lands on the ring, but not before the Master Chief escapes with the Autumn's sexy babe AI core, Cortana. It is soon revealed that the Covenant have discovered that Halo is of course a weapon, but don't quite understand just how powerful it is and what it was originally intended for. Both sides race against time to gain control of the device to use it against the other side.There is so much in this game that's really darn cool- the overall look and feel of the weapons, characters and vehicles in spot on, as are the exterior vistas and buildings seen through out the experience. Music is top notch, though sometimes it sounds like it came from a cheap Casio keyboard, it is for the most part as good as the main theme. The sound effects lack, especially in how the weapons sound, and especially how the aliens sound- they grunt and roar like cheap cartoon monsters, not the kind of thing you expect to hear from slick looking beasties in colored chrome battle armor wielding plasma guns. Game play is pretty good, though I don't like the fact that you can't double jump, that is jump on to an object then use that momentum to immediately jump again to a higher position. Then there is the vehicles- whether flying or driving, it has to be experienced to be believed, because it's that good. In either the 4WD Warthog or the Ghost hover bike, ground vehicles are a snap to drive and a lot of fun, meaning you concentrate more on the game than figuring out how to steer. The Covenant Banshee, a small attack fighter, is also a cinch to fly, steer and attack with. Plus the enemy AI is superb- Covenant dodge, shoot from cover and attack intelligently.Now for the bad news. There is no gentle way to say this: Level design sucks. Maybe the bland stainless steel-like interior textures were meant to give everything a high tech look, but there are few elements of contrast and most every wall looks like every other wall. Worse, moving through levels is like a bad case of deja vu- because basically each new room is pretty much like the one you left, the main difference being there aren't any bodies or weapons lying around in the new ones. It appears as though the level designers merely cloned rooms, stuck tunnels between them to link a level together. Further, there aren't a lot of objects in them, either, and everything looks very sterile. There aren't a lot of computer screens, tools, junk or anything else lying around to look it. This doesn't just go for Halo's interiors- the insides of Covenant and human vessels are just as bland, with the same repetitive layout as their counterparts. If places, chambers, rooms, etc. had been decorated with as much care as the ones in Unreal II, I feel it might have made things a little more fun to explore and look at.What's also weird is that for all the hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of space on the ring world, I never saw one example of fauna larger than insects- no animals, no fish, no birds, nothing. It's like the biosphere gave up after trees and bugs. Exterior vistas are quite large, especially in Banshee missions, and as I said, 2-3 years ago, the graphics would have been ground breaking, but even outside the textures seem kind of plain, though still attractive. Other annoyances is the switching of weapons from one mission to the next. There are a couple of instances where the next mission picks up right after the last one ends, but you no longer have the weapons you finished with- and that makes no sense. This is doubly bad since you can only carry two of them at any given time. I find the shotgun and the Covenant plasma rifle to be the best of the lot, though the latter must be discarded once out of ammo in order to find another, because for some reason you can't reload them. And for all the work Gearbox said they did on this game, would it have been too much to ask for to give us real save game options rather than stinky console check points?My expectations were high and they were only partially met. There is a lot that's good in Halo- story, music, characters, vehicles and voice acting, but the things that are wrong with it are really wrong. It's a good game and it has a lot of elements that I love, but the uninspired level design, bland textures, dated graphics and silly aliens detract a great deal from what had the potential to be one of the greatest games ever made.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2003"}

Ico was released years ago near the PS2's launch, and though slightly flawed, it was a wonderful game.  Now that the team had time to master the PS2, it could improve the graphics and make an Ico like game even better.  Well not quite.You first start off in a temple, and you have to go after a Colossus.  You then ride your horse to the area where the Colossus is.  The area where you ride your horse through is expansive, though nice looking, is pretty monochrome.  The horse riding is a little annoying, because the camera is sort of half done, meaning that you can move the camera, but it will move back for no reason at random times, and there is no stationary camera angle.  Most games give you the option of keeping the camera directly behind you so you can move by the direction of the screen.  This does not, and I found it very, very annoying.Once you reach the Colossus, you face a large lumbering stone giant, and you have to defeat it.  It's just like a giant boss battle.  You have to climb up it somehow (which is where the \"puzzle\" portion comes in) and hit the weak spots.That is pretty much the game.  Ride to the Colossus, defeat it, rinse, repeat.  After about three Colossi, I was bored to death.  This game has a total of 16 of them.  Each one takes a really long time.  Uh, no thanks.While the Colossi look great and the music is good, graphically, the rest of the game is fully of jaggies that really shouldn't exist in a game engine these days.  The world to explore is really very empty with nothing to do.  The camera angle is the biggest obstacle, and I found the controls to be awkward as well.  Like all boss battles, there is a lot of repetition in defeating the boss.  You get to a certain point, and you either die, or you fall and have to climb up the boss again.  So, there is a lot of repeating.  And no, you can't save in the middle of a boss fight.I wanted ambiance, puzzles, thinking, new worlds to explore.  I wanted a new version of Ico or Prince of Persia, Sands of Time.  Instead, I got this.If you are the type of guy that only cares about the final boss, this game is made for you.  If you wanted another thinking man's platformer, you'd better look elsewhere.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2005"}

In Volleyball, the jump blocks rarely worked for me and the computer on Beginner was extremely difficult to beat. Boxing was fun, as was table tennis. Track and field felt a lot like the Track and Field with the Nintendo Power Pad from circa 1988 with respect to the running and jumping events! Soccer was interesting but the rhythm is broken up by the blocking and passing, but honestly it seemed like the logical way to develop that type of game. The announcers eventually become annoying and the replays aren't that interesting. It's definitely a lot of fun with several human players, and it provides some light exercise.

{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"A solid sequel to the original","reviewText":"The story of Dead Space 2 is a continuation of Issac's plight with the Necromorphs.  The setting is a space colony near Saturn.  In the beginning you get a quick re-cap as to the events of the Ishimura, and then you are plunged head long into the current events.The authors definitely tried to refine the experience but at the same time alter the flow and play style through the levels.  The game will feel very familiar to players of the original, but they'll generally find good improvements.  Weapon refinement, additions to the arsenal, improvements to the melee system, a higher dependence on stasis, and the new impalement system all result in a more dynamic combat experience.  The levels are, for the most part, drastically different -- as the setting is different -- so it only makes sense.  Zero G has been changed around and, to be perfectly honest, presents far less of a challenge than before.  Lastly, the airless environments are few and far between -- I never upgraded the air in my suit, and I never once was at risk for running out.Issac is far from mute this time around and almost spends too much time talking.  The story is much less about isolation, claustrophobia, and fear.  Overall I'd say the game is far less spooky/scary than the original.  That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but was somewhat disappointing to me.  The \"fear\" factor now comes from different kinds of enemies that require more planning to handle, and at times sheer numbers of necromorphs attacking from all sides.The last Chapter (or so) has got to be the worst part of the game.  The events of the game have reached a crescendo and it shows -- but still, it is too rushed/hurried and spastic.  I don't want to go into any spoilers, but the time pressures of the last level are just plain irritating as it becomes this frantic run and gun.  The authors of the original used a similar device, but less so, and it wasn't that entertaining either.  Finally, the \"end boss\" is just over the top frustrating.  It isn't immediately clear what to do, there is so much spamming chaos, and having to watch an overly long death sequence all makes for an end sequence that ensures I'll probably never fully replay the game again.  Difficult is one thing, but whatever you want to call the end game it just sucks the enjoyment right out.I played a few hours of the multi-player stuff.  It is unique/novel, but I'm not sure it has any real staying power.  There are severe balance issues, but it can be a fun way to spend some time.  I think this would be good game for a group of friends to play against each other, but mixing with the public/unknowns might make the experience very frustrating, especially if you happen to be playing the human side.  All the rounds I've played, so far, the humans are on tight time deadlines and the necromorphs just have to slow them down enough to blow their time goals.  There seems to be a rather involved upgrade through experience level system, and I've found that playing against people of a higher level ruins the experience -- they are significantly stronger, in all ways, than you are.  Building an MP game seems to be an interesting foray, but Dead Space will always be a single player experience to me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2011"}

Wind","summary":"Perfect choice for an upgrade from an older Xbox 360 model!","reviewText":"I have had an Xbox 360 since they launched the system, and despite never getting the Red Ring of Death (RROD), I kept upgrading to newer models because I was never 100% happy with the console. First I moved to a system with a quieter optical drive (the original sounded like a jet taking off), then I upgraded to a newer mainboard/processor (Falcon) and then again, to the Jasper model for increased stability and quiet operation. I didn't *have* to upgrade, but I chose to because my quest was to get a console that was silent and cool, with silence being the most desired feature. Each time, I sold my old console for slightly less than the new one, and so the upgrade was relatively inexpensive in the end.So when Microsoft introduced the Xbox 360 S, I wanted it. Still, I waited to grab one. My Jasper model ran fine, and I invested in a low-cost 250GB hard drive for it and didn't want to give that up. I have 100GB of data loaded into my hard drive (full games, demos, saved games, Arcade titles, etc.) and migration would have been a pain. On top of that, at launch the 250GB was the only one available, and I wasn't sure about the price working out in my favor for an upgrade.Enter the 4GB model! This was perfect for my needs! A little searching online informed me that, YES, I could use my old 250GB hard drive in the new Xbox 360 S. It does require disassembling the old hard drive's case/caddy, but it works (and cases/caddies for this new model are available to help stabilize the drive in the new console, too!) Thus migration turned out to be no big deal at all; I just popped my old hard drive into the new console, and I was back in business. I sold my Jasper model Xbox 360 and went to this new model.So what did I get for my money?The new model has some great new features. Honestly, these are all things that should have been present from the beginning, but now they're here and the console is better for it:* Built-in WiFi. It's about time! Microsoft was just plain rude making us pay so much for their WiFi adapter. In an age when just about every device comes with WiFi built-in, it was hard to believe Microsoft kept selling a console without it.* Better case design. The case is no longer curvy. The top (when horizontal) is flat and smooth, and has vents up there to push the hot air out. The buttons are all touch-sensitive now, and work great. There are five USB ports, too.* Built-in Optical audio connector. Again, this was something Microsoft screwed up in the first version of the Xbox 360. If you wanted optical audio for surround sound, you had to use their cable/adapter, even if you were connecting via HDMI. This new Xbox 360 doesn't have that problem. I have HDMI and optical audio connected with no interference from any other cables or adapters.* Internal hard drive (optional). Simply put, this is a much smoother, simpler connection. You're hooking up to a standard SATA connection, instead of Microsoft's proprietary one. You still need a hard drive that has been prepared properly (i.e. Microsoft's official, if they have anything to say about it) but at least you don't need to mess with non-standard connections anymore, and the size of the console is positively affected by this choice.* Redesigned controller. Not much of a difference, but I like the little notches on the analog sticks, and the whole controller feels like it has a little more \"play\" in it.* Quiet and cool.  The big win for this device. It's not silent, but it's as close as the Xbox 360 is likely to get. It's super-quiet, and runs very cool. A lot of hot air gets pushed out, but that's a good thing (as long you're not an idiot who encloses it in a tight space or blocks the vents.)I am also happy to report that the new Xbox 360 S works just fine with the old HD DVD drive (Hey! Some of us still use it!).All in all, this is a great way to upgrade an old console. You can pop in your old hard drive and it works. You don't have to get the 250GB model if you already have the drive space! And as a bonus, this 4GB model is matte instead of glossy. NO FINGERPRINTS!!!Get it. You'll like it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}

About 6 years later I pick up JSRF off eBay for $2 and well...you get what you pay for. I expected a lot more of this game, but really it's just repetitive with a horrendous camera, lame story, and a few others odds and ends.The story is almost non-existent where you have to stop the Poison Claw gang from taking over the city and you basically go through the city covering their tags with yours and racing them here and there. That's really all there is story side and it's a huge let down. I found the best thing here were the visuals and audio. The game has beautiful cel-shaded graphics with a rich hip and techno driven soundtrack. When it comes to game play things are very simple and derivative. Each section has a certain amount of tags you have to cover and you do this by grinding around places and covering them up. You have to pick up spray cans lying around everyone to do this though. Blue ones are worth ten and yellow ones are worth one. Once you cover all the tags you have to meet the Poison Claw gang and challenge them to a race. These are really easy and only require a little trial and error. The tags are fairly easy to locate thanks to them being dotted on your map.I found the levels to be a bit claustrophobic though since you characters can defy gravity and jump 50 feet so you'd miss your line on the building and fall all the way down. This leads into the terrible camera which you CAN'T control and never stays behind the character. You always have to make circles and use the reset camera button. This ruins a lot of the game because you'll climb all the way to the top of a high tower and then fall all the way down and have to climb the top again because you couldn't see that open ledge. So, this is the basic concept of how you play the game it's just grind here, tag here, fight camera here, watch dorky Japanese characters dance around, rinse and repeat. Don't get me wrong this game is pretty good, but the game is just to monotonous and the camera ruins everything. Sometimes the police will be after you so you knock them down and spray paint them to death, some are too strong to knock down so you \"boost\" into them.You're probably asking where is the trick system? Well there isn't one. The game relies on a few moves while grinding by hitting the X button and maybe a backflip here and there when you jump and that's about it. You do handplants in half pipes, but when you jump tricks are automatically done, and there are maybe a handful of tricks. After maybe 2-3 hours of playing you'll get bored and irritated with the game so much you'll stop playing (like I did). I got maybe 90% through the game and just stopped playing because it was too annoying and repetitive.The game was really great back in the day because of the amazing graphical style, but I think Sega concentrated too much on that. The game has some serious slowdown on the Xbox 360 and makes the game almost unplayable in certain areas. There really isn't much in sound just a grinding sound, grunts, moans, whooshing, and crowd sounds when you run into them. I love the visuals Sega, but in the sequel please upgrade the game play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

The game provokes mixed feelings, on one hand coming out only a year after the original L4D (which didn't receive much downloadable content) and on the other hand being full of enough new content to justify a sequel.Like the first L4D, the game puts players in the shoes of four survivors of a zombie apocalypse. The survivors battle waves of the infected to move from one safe area to another. In L4D, the tools used by the survivors were primarily guns and explosive objects like pipe bombs and fuel cans. One of L4D's shortcomings was that it never really felt like \"survival\" - ammo could be found easily, and you were never really short on resources.L4D2 keeps the basic premise - pistols still have infinite ammo, occasional caches of ammo can be found - but generally increases the scarcity of resources to make for a tenser survival experience. In addition, the choice of weaponry is greatly increased from L4D: in addition to a wider range of guns (rather than the 7 offered in L4D, 3 of which were an improved version of the other 3) there are also melee weapons. These allow for close-range damage without needing to reload. There are also more tools and items to be found, like adrenaline that increases your action speed, \"boomer bile\" which causes the infected to fight amongst themselves, and ammo boxes that make your guns shoot burning or explosive ammunition.In addition, there are occasional \"special infected\" with unique abilities who will show up to attack. In L4D, these were the \"hunter\", who pounced on his prey, the \"smoker\", who strangled them with his long tongue, and the \"boomer\", who covered survivors with zombie-attracting bile. In addition, the \"tank\" (a physical powerhouse) and the \"witch\" (a super-powerful zombie who could be avoided if the survivors were careful) also made less-frequent appearances. In L4D2, these special infected are joined by the \"spitter\", who launches gobs of area-covering acid, the \"charger\", who rams into survivors and pummels them, and the \"jockey\", who jumps on a survivor and attempts to steer them into nearby hazards. The new special infected affect the balance of the game overall - the spitter forces survivors to keep moving instead of holing up in one spot and the jockey uses environmental hazards to his advantage. The charger is a little annoying, because even if you spot it early, unlike the other special infected it can take so many bullets that you usually end up getting hit anyways.There are five campaigns, all with much more unique layouts than the campaigns in L4D. \"Dead Center\" is a fight through a shopping mall, \"Dark Carnival\" takes place in an amusement park, \"Swamp Fever\" sees the survivors attempting to get through the bayou, \"Hard Rain\" involves a two-way trip to get gas during a major thunderstorm, and finally \"The Parish\" puts you on the streets of New Orleans attempting to reach the last helicopter out. The maps are all much more fleshed out than they are in L4D, and due to the expanded list of items and bonuses in the game there's much more potential benefit to exploring out-of-the-way locations like abandoned houses. There's also more choice in route, though the paths are always ultimately linear. The campaigns on the whole feel much more unique and thematic than their L4D counterparts, and there's a distinct flavor to each of them.There are more game modes than in L4D. In addition to the regular campaign (human players versus ai-controlled infected), survival (players hold out for as long as they can in one area), and the versus mode (player-controlled survivors versus player-controlled special infected), there's also realism mode (a campaign wherein many elements like glowing silhouettes are disabled, making it harder for players to find each other without good teamwork) and scavenge mode (where players try to collect gas cans and bring them back to a central location). The versus mode is much more fun than in L4D because of the new special infected, but the new game modes are sort of iffy.Overall, L4D2 is a great game - much improved over its predecessor - but it still feels like it's lacking a lot. The new melee weapons are all basically identical, so there's no real sense of scavenging or anything like that. Everything from a fire axe to a cricket bat is completely capable of tearing apart a zombie with one swing. The new guns are a little better - I liked the idea of adding a grenade launcher that has non-replenishable ammo - but they're so easy to find that there's still really no tension. Basically, though, the game is an action game, not a survival game. If you want to have fun playing cooperatively with your friends, L4D2 is probably the best game to do it with.Rating: 9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2009"}

The game tells an epic story that blends magical realism with accurate historical accounts of 16th-century feudal Japan. It begins 10 years later than the events inOnimusha: Warlords, after Nobunaga, an infamous Japanese warlord, has brutalized a village. Players take the role of the hero, a young warrior and master of the Yagyu Shinkage sword-fighting style who seeks revenge against Nobunaga. In the process, he will uncover his destiny.","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"Samurai Legendry","reviewText":"If you follow my game reviews you know by know that I prefer the long drawn out, story oriented RPG's to those that take less than twenty hours and have a huge kill to puzzle ration.  But when the price drops low enough I find it can be worthwhile to play through the more notable games in this genre.  Onimusha 2 is certainly one of these.Being a fan of all things Japanese I find the samurai based plot, which sends Jubei Yagyu, young chief of a clan destroyed by Oda Nobunaga, on a journey of revenge and redemption.  Nobunaga is one of the largest figures in Japanese history - a warlord who wielded immense power in the 16th Century.  The premise of Onimusha is that Nobunaga died in 1560 and was resurrected as a demon (the historical Nobunage lived until 1580).  Jubei's quest exposes him to both human and demonic opponents, one after another, and each more colorful.Besides the puzzle solving and, often, wholesale slaughter, Samurai's Destiny has you use the Japanese custom of gift giving to cement relationships with five possible companions.  The most important of these is Oyu, a mysterious woman who appears dressed as a samurai and quickly wins Jubei's heart.  How you trade gifts and fulfill you're your obligations to these characters determines what your experience of the game is, and can provide considerable interest.The game is beautiful to look at, and generally well animated.  My only real irritation it with its insistence on using the direction buttons for character movement.  This reduces an otherwise gracefully game to one where poor Jubei often has to bounce of a wall to get to a treasure.  Otherwise Samurai's Destiny is a very pleasant diversion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2004"}

{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Bittersweet","reviewText":"I'll admit that I'm not very easy to please in the gaming department, but The Last of Us is one of best games I've played in years.  It's not perfect, but it has enough of what, in my opinion, are the hallmarks of a truly great game in all areas.In general there's a lot of scavenging and exploring punctuated by intense violence.  Not enough?  Let me continue...The Story- This is definitely a story driven game, with a lot of cut scenes to drive it forward.  I don't mind that.  They flesh out the characters and details of their situation which immerses you in the story.  A \"page turner.\"The Combat- Good, much harder than I originally thought it would be, with crafting to improve weapons.  The ammo is scarce so I wouldn't call this a shooter, the melee combat is good though weapons break after a few hits, and as you would expect, other options such as bricks, bottles, molotov cocktails, etc. are available.  The lack of ammo and the fragile melee weapons keeps you on your toes.The Characters- Well fleshed out, they seem real enough, gritty.  But the triumph with character development belongs to facial animation.  I've never seen expression done better in any video game.The Setting- Varied.  From ruined citiscapes (not too far off from some of our own) to forests, from sewer systems to derelict hospitals and suburbs.  This is not an open world though, unfortunately, but there's a lot of exploring to do (I like).  Can't ever let your guard down though despite the wonderful attention to detail Naughty Dog put into them.The Controls- Good but not great.  Some of the combat scenes turn into the infected swarming you, and when you're down, you're pretty much out (my experience).  The weapon handling is real time (Dead Space, etc.) which can fluster if not prepared, so you must be on top of your game at all times.The Ending- I won't ruin it for anyone, but for me it came much too soon.  I felt like I sympathized with these characters by the end and really wanted to continue playing out this story.I love this game and finished my first play through last night.  I'll start another today and see what I missed.  It has just about everything I like in a game.  Survival horror, lots of exploring and crafting, exciting combat, problem solving puzzles.  I recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002I094AC","description":"","reviewerName":"SuperGamecube64","summary":"Do a barrel roll! Again! In 3D!","reviewText":"Starfox 64 is legendary at this point. Not only is a hugely popular game with a dedicated fan base, it has also become an internet icon through the endlessly quotable memes it has sparked. The last time we saw a Starfox game was on the DS, and that one came out less than spectacular. Fans were not happy with its multiple endings, and questioned the future of the series. With no sequel on the Wii, or 3DS and no apparent plans for one, Starfox 64 3D may be as close as we get for some time. Is it better than the original, though?The most obvious improvement to the game is the graphics. I have to say, this is one of the best looking games I've seen on the 3DS and the 3D is most impressive. Things are a bit brighter than they were before, and the models have been totally redone. even though things look much more modern, the effects still have a vintage 90's feel. The graphics hit a perfect balance between nostalgically simple and elegantly modern. The environments arguably got more of a makeover than anything, and really feel like actual planets. The 3D effect, as mentioned, is very impressive, and actually has impact on the game. When an enemy is tailing you, it blocks your view. You may also be able to see some enemies coming from behind or to your sides when in all-range mode if you have 3D turned on. Unlike some other 3DS games, I experienced no \"bleeding\" images, crossing over of images or even a small amount of blur or eye strain. On most 3DS games, I have to have the slider on low intensity, and can only tolerate that for approximately half an hour at the most. In Starfox, however, I can turn the slider on the highest intensity and play endlessly with no problems.The music seems to be ripped straight from the original game, and the sound effects are nearly identical if not perfect replicas of what they were before. The entire script, however, has been re-recorded. Slippy and Fox sound almost perfect, but something seems a tad off about Peppy and Falco. New voices aside, all of those memorable quotes are intact. From \"Do a barrel roll!\" to \"Can't let you do that Starfox!\", the script is unchanged.The controls mimic those of the original SNES game, Starfox. Unlike that game, there are only 2 layouts, however. I opt to play wiht option A, in which the a button is fire, b is brake, x is boost and y is bomb. No matter which control scheme you select, L and R cause you to veer in that direction and double tapping either induces a barrel roll. The slider is used for movement and aiming, of course. Unlike the control stick, t takes a bit of getting used to having to line up your shots, or at least it did for me. The Arwing is jsut as responsive, but something just felt different. Somersaults and U-Turns are handled by pressing the boost button in tandem with up or down. Alternatively, they are mapped to the up and down buttons on the d-pad.The story is, of course, unchanged. Prior to the games events, Andross, a scientist from Corneria, is exiled to planet Venom after nearly destroying Corneria. The Starfox team, then consisting of Peppy Hare, James MCCloud and Pigma Dengar is sent in to investigate the planet. Pigma, however, betrays James and Peppy, causing them to become captured by Andross. James them sacrifices himself to allow for Peppy's escape. Five years later, the new Starfox team is called in again when Andross launches an attack on the entire Lylat solar system. This time the team consists of Peppy Hare of the original team, Fox McCloud who is James' son, Falco Lombardi and Slippy Toad.Fans of the original will be happy to know that the entire Lylat System is intact. Every level, every enemy, and every alternate path is just the same as before. Would we have it any other way?Starfox 64 3D is nearly identical to the original. The only real difference is the voice actors and the graphics. That being said, it goes back to my original question. Is it worth buying over the original? My answer is that it is very situational. If you do not own a Nintendo 64 or a Wii, then this would of course be your only option, and you'd be a fool to pass it up. However, if you do own an N64 or a Wii, the question comes down to how much you value portability. If you want the game in portable form, then again, 3D will be your only option. Other than that, it really doesn't matter if you get this, the N64 original, or the Virtual Console ROM. They are all the same basic experience. Starfox 64 is a classic in many ways, and if you have not played it for yourself then it is certainly a game you need to check out. If you already own the original, however, there is no reason to bother purchasing this remake, especially at the $40 price tag. I managed to find a copy in a bargain bin at Books-a-million somehow for $20, but even still I feel as if I wasted my money because there is no new content. It's definitely worth a buy if you don't have access to the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"Am I playing a new game?","reviewText":"The first word that comes to mind when I think of this game is \"sellout\".Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops, while not the FPS perfection that was COD4, were still very fun and felt like new products that contributed to a fledgling FPS genre. When firing up this game for the first time, I felt the instant placing of the COD franchise on life support. Maybe it's the nail in the coffin it needs. MW3, more than anything, feels like a giant, overpriced MW2 expansion pack. If Activision is willing to put out this LAZY, OUTDATED excuse of a game on the market and sell it full price as if it's a new title, hopefully it will wake people up to the fact that the COD games are now beating a dead horse.Nothing about this game feels inspired. It reeks of laziness, and it ultimately feels like a cash cow more than anything else. The fact that more than one company developed this game shows its embarrassing lack of central vision and connived to put out a half-assed game to make a quick buck. They literally took the same engine and design source from MW2 and added a couple new modes and uninspired maps and called it a new game. Everything is the same: the fonts, the menus, the load screens, the graphics, and I swear some of the voices sounded recycled. Actually, the graphics look worse than MW2's.The multiplayer is a huge disappointment. Multiplayer map design has always been the pride of the COD franchise. However, the variety and creativity of the maps in MW3 are lacking. They're just not that fun. The multiplayer maps in the previous COD games made me continue to play. That means that the maps are designed in a way where you can never play the same way twice. In MW3, all the maps are tight, messy, and ugly. Most of the time you're limited to run-and-gunning and looking for hiding people (ironic for such small maps). While the little tweaks to the killstreak system are a fresh welcome, they don't feel like they have an impact on the match.This game still has its fun moments, if only because of the familiarity; you know what to expect. But it only goes so far with this dinosaur of a game. With the previous COD games, I wanted to come back for more. I don't feel that vibe with this game. It feels like a tired old man trying to still feel relevant. Perhaps it's time for Call of Duty to hang it up and pass the torch.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00917DBUE","description":"","reviewerName":"Raul Vito","summary":"Death is only the beginning... old skool challenge and fun is back!","reviewText":"First of all let me start with this little tidbit; I played Demon's Souls a couple of years ago and I HATED IT; it was cryptic (especially on the weapon upgrade mechanics) the combat was unforgiving, the levels too long and the bosses cheapshoted you in seconds....I dropped the game and went to play some Arkham Asylum and God of War. Hell, I play console games to be entertained, I can get all my challenge from Total War, The Witcher or REAL PC RPGs you know?When Dark Souls was announced I couldn't have cared less, and from reading some reviews the game sounded pretty much the same, so I never gave it a second though.But then something weird happened...the game was being ported to the PC with some additional content, and in the meantime I had a weeklong Easter gaming session with one of my cousins, and we decided to undust our old NES collection, mainly Rush & Attack, Castlevanias and Ninja Gaidens for some old skool fun.After playing those punishing games and remembering all the actual challenge those games gave you, with learning attack patterns for bosses, memorizing the levels and enemy placements and how hard they where (especially the ending levels) but the great sense of satisfaction you got from beating that chapshot artist Jaquio from the first Ninja Gaidens, or the Trevor clone in Castlevania 3 (complete with frikking boomerangs) made me realize that I had recently played a game like this, where button mashing got you nowhere and a slow systematic approach (yeah and grinding a lot for rare items and xp) memorizing, levels and learning patters...So I got Dark Souls for the PC as soon as it was available and never looked back.First of all, the fact that the port is pretty bad is a well know but easily solved in 5 minutes by downloading Durante's fix, so that leaves you not only with a beautiful looking game, but a much better experience (performance wise at least) than the consoles, so that little fact is fixed and we get the better version for the PC.And then this leaves the game itselfMost of my problems with Demon's Souls where solved here, with maybe not shorter levels but one or two Bonfires per area so the penalty for dying wasn't as bad since you where sent back to the last bonfire you visited, and the weapon upgrade mechanics where cleared up a bit, plus armors could be upgraded too in this one. The challenge level was still the name of the game, maybe a bit less than Demon's Souls but still plenty tough...but this time I got in the proper mindset; this wasn't God of War or another mindless button masher, and since my old skool skillz where a bit rusty I decided to go on that well know RPG tradition; whenever I found a good grinding area (like the first bonfire in the Undead Burg or the Depths) I would do a bit of grinding, upgrade a few of my attributes, weapons and armors and making sure I always had a long range weapons, a good supply of firebombs, cures and some tricks up my sleeve (poison is your friend btw).Most of the time I would guess my tactics would be a bit cheap, but in a game where you can get killed by a missed step on a ledge or a well placed enemy blow, I decided I wanted all the help I could get.And you know something? Not only did it work but I was having a pretty great time too!This game can be a bit intimidating at first with its open world gameplay, but the developer relied on the gamer figuring out things for himself (or looking for help from one of the best online communities, with TWO wikis and great gameplay videos from people like EpicNameBro and A German Spy) and understanding that the dying mechanic is not a punishment but a learning tool which actually encourages experimentation and exploration. This is truly a game that rewards your curiosity and ingenuity, giving you a deep and rich lore history (mostly gathered from ingame item descriptions) which has you constantly questioning your actions and motivations as new pieces of information are discovered. Perhaps the game was too cryptic and the developer addressed this on the Artorias of the Abyss DLC, where the storyline was a bit more straightforward and helped fill in some of the questions we had from the first part of the game, so maybe that is a good glimpse of how the next game would go.All in all I have rarely enjoyed a game in so many levels where the challenge of the gameplay is wrapped on such a deep and fulfilling experience overall. I even went back to playing Demon's Souls and found it almost as good. I would mention that a more well developed tutorial where vital gameplay mechanics as poise or Humanity where explained in detail would make the game more approachable.For all the people who didn't like the game maybe they are right, this is not a game for everybody, but for those of us who grew up in the 80's and 90's where developers had to create challenging games so you didn't beat you brand new NES game on the first weekend, this is a return to glory and I would recommended it to anybody who is feed up handholding games that insult your intelligence and are produced for catering to the broadest possible market segments.This is definitely one of the best games I have ever played and I simply cannot wait for more games of this kind to be developed. I still enjoy my Skyrim and Kingdoms of Amalur for immersive uncomplicated FUN....but for a real challenge that sets your heart racing where you might face a much tougher opponent (like the Undead Burg's Black Knight) and beat him with a mixture of skill, tactics and maybe some plain old luck, the Souls series is unmatched.Now if you excuse me I want to try a new character build....oh and dont even play on playing this without a gamepad","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2012"}

An engaging strategy epic where you try to survive battles against secret cults and powerful, mysterious wizards.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A memorable and tolerable JRPG","reviewText":"The Good: Engaging story, ring system fully immerses the player in the combat, fun and frequent boss fights, memorable characters, crest magic allows everyone to use magicThe Bad: Random battles are really annoying, maze like levels are down right frustrating, poor pacing, spotty voice acting, some level grinding is required to finish the final boss, acquiring abilities by fighting certain people and talking means you end up missing themShadow Hearts is a JRPG that is all about politics and religion, of course what JRPG isn't? Covenant has a very interesting story with memorable characters, however the pacing is a bit off. You play as Yuri, a young man stricken with a curse called the Mistletoe. This locks out his inner powers inside his heart and you are trying to find a cure for it. Along the way you meet many people with various abilities for combat. The story is a bit involved and complicated, but it is interesting. I could try to explain it, but it would take nearly 3-4 paragraphs just to do that.Let's start with the combat. Shadow Hearts uses a ring system where a needle spins around a ring and you press X when it falls in the yellow and red areas. Each character has different sized hit areas and different amounts. You want to try to get it in the red which is a strike zone which does extra damage, but it can be hard because some character's strike zones are small 2 pixel slivers. You can acquire expansions for these areas and you can customize your ring. Once you get good you can increase the amount of hit areas, but they become smaller. This ring is used for everything from items, special attacks, and magic. In Shadow Hearts you can do combos with characters by watching your battle turns at the top. Use a four player combo and you can do massive damage and special combo magic attacks. One thing I really like in this game is that you aren't stuck with specific characters that only do magic. Everyone can do it because you use magic crests which have different magic attacks that are both offensive and defensive. Some character just have more MP than others. This means your heavy hitter can also cast Raise Up without compromising anything.Covenant is mainly comprised of boss battles. They are very frequent, but are the most fun in the game. Each is different, some are weak to combos, special attacks only, some are just weak to physical damage. However, the ring system makes you solely responsible for whether or not attacks hit or miss. If you don't focus and miss part of the ring you don't attack. This also makes the combat more engaging because you aren't just flipping through menus. Yuri has an ability to switch between fusion forms which are elementals. This allows you to target a weakness on the fly. However, everybody has SP which are sanity points and deplete with each turn. When you run out characters go berserk and JRPG players know that is not a good thing. You have to use Pure items to restore these points, but this only becomes an issue early in the game. Once you level up enough you get enough SP that it won't run out before a boss battle is over.The amount of grinding in the game is minimal. Since you mostly fight bosses you get globs of XP all the time, so just from bosses alone you can get to level 40. There are random battles but they aren't as frequent as most JRPGs, but they still exist. Random battles are the single thing that keep me away from these games. It is lazy game design and just needs to end. There are puzzles in the game which can be kind of challenging, but the mazes are frustrating. Running around trying different combos on different floors is just a nightmare. Partner this with random battles and you are bound to toss your controller a few times.There are side quests, but they are pretty weak and not really worth it. You usually just get items for it or armor, but these armors can be bought later on, usually just after the next boss fight or two. A lot of the character's abilities have to be learned from fighting people in the game or finding them which I found irritating. I'd rather just learn them from leveling up. Karin's sword arts are found by talking to certain people so if you miss them then your special attacks will always be weak, not fun. Besides all that this is a more tolerable JRPG, even people like me who hate them will enjoy this game.The graphics at the time were good, and there is a nice art style here. The CGI cut scenes are nice, but there aren't enough of them. The voice acting is spotty where a couple of characters sound good, but the rest sound like cheesy high school students in a play. That is usually expected in English versions of JRPGs, especially back then. I would play this game for the story and fun boss fights. Skip all the side quest crap and just finish the story. There's nothing worth while in spending 20 extra hours for some items.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

My seller was alright and everything was there, including the cool cloth map.  However, I had problems.  For one thing, it took me the longest time to level up, even with all the sidequests.  For another, the enemies were too blasted difficult, the magics tended to backfire in the worst way.  I would face a wolf with a paladin, a druid, a cleric, and a bard.  You would think that the druid would be about as strong as a wolf, but no, my first druid got killed of by a couple of goblins.  Then I fired a burning hands at point blank range on these wolves and it killed my full-hp paladin, while barely scratching the wolf.  My paladin has 10 or 12 hp and the wolf had 13 hp on average, which led me to believe that at least my paladin would make it against this critter.  But three hours later, when I got to the cave, I had trouble beating orcs.  I had to have my whole party gang up to beat one and there was a cave full.  Then when my thief finally levels up, I never figured out how to increase hp or anything else for that matter.  Having a 2nd level bard with as much or not much more hp and no discernible increase in effectiveness (he seemed _less_  able to fight orcs now) was the final straw.  I had wasted enough time on this game. It would have been one thing if I was given enemies like that in later battles, but I had such enemies from the beginning.  Furthermore, I had my biggest problem with the fact that point and click with the mouse was the only option, half the time, I killed my own party.I would recommend a multiplayer game if it was more like Neverwinter Nights: hands on tutorial, cursor keys enabled (if I remember correctly), totally customizable controls. If I wanted to set the format to call animals, to arm, and to use certain spells it was easy to do. Level up increasing was easy as well.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2003"}

Once you master the different moves, the joy you get punishing the enemies using them, is just indescribable.SPECTACULAR SUSPENSEFUL STORY: It has been a while since I have experienced a story in the game that makes me go wow. While the game does starts out a bit abruptly, things will make sense in the end. Don't want to spoil much.UNANITICIPATED AFTER CREDIT ENDING: If you are familiar with character names than you may see this after the credits ending I am talking about, but I sure as hell did not see it coming. I was very surprised by it and quite frankly could not get this ending (LONG VIDEO) out of my head for days. Don't want to spoil much, but please FINISH THE GAME, trust me, after the credits will make it worth your while.BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS AND ANIMATION: This game will make you go through jungles, valley, barren towers, huge castles etc. etc. Frankly, they are very nicely designed and the game looks great in 720p.GREAT VARIETY IN ENEMY: It has been a while I have seen SO MANY different types of enemies in the same game. Different types of werewolves, vampires, goblins, deads and other creatures I can't remember names of. All of these gothically designed. I am telling you artwork in this game is just magnificent.RIDING HUGE ENEMIES GAMEPLAY: I personally loved it. Once you weaken huge enemies such as big warewolves, spiders etc, YOU CAN RIDE THEM. Use them to unleash devastating attacks, solve puzzle etc. etc. Truly remarkable.TONS OF CHALLENGING BOSSES: Slaughtering hordes and hordes of enemies and moving forward in the game will reward you with some really compelling boss battles. Just like levels and small fry enemies, these bosses are also very aesthetically animated. To me boss battle was the third strongest aspect of the game (after story and art). As soon as I defeated a boss, I look forward to the next one. Such anticipation and mysterious story really drives you forward in this game.ACROBATIC GAMEPLAY AND PUZZLES: If you like puzzles there are tons and tons of them in this game. If you don't like puzzles no worries. Spend your experience points and you don't have to solve them. HOW WONDERFUL IS THAT? I salute this game for providing that option. Genius! The acrobatic gameplay, which would be hanging from cliff, then jumping from cliff to cliff, is pretty good. Kind of like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time games. What I particularly found interesting was use of the chain to do acrobats. There points in the game you can jump off of cliffs, use chains to hang somewhere, use the momentum of chain to break through weak structures etc. You have to play it to get a feel for what I am saying.UPGRADABLES AND HIDDEN ITEMS: In this game you can buy new combat moves and upgrade them by trading your experience. While most of the moves can be purchased through the first gameplay (assuming you don't trade experience for solving puzzles), to get all moves and all hidden items, you will have to play different chapters in the game over again.TREMENDOUS REPLAYABILITY: The game itself is long enough. If you want to go for 100% of the items, it will even take longer since you will have to revisit chapters and use your upgrades. In addition it comes with 4 different difficulty levels and a minigame. This will keep you engage for a long while.OH DID I MENTION FREE CASTLEVANIA SOT GAME WITH THIS GAME?CONS.MINOR ISSUES WITH PUZZLES: Honestly the only con I found in this game was I was too used to God of War 2 controls. Because of that I was stuck in puzzles such as clocktower puzzle. Fortunately I figured out the difference in controls and was able to solve the puzzle. An example: In clocktower puzzle, ever time I tried to raise a platform, it would rise halfway and then fall as my character would let go of the lever contrary to the fact that I was holding the button. THE KEY IS TO LET GO OF R2(or L2 whichever is to hold the lever) once you hold the lever. The character will hold it himself without you having to hold the button. Other than this I think some puzzles are a bit too challenging. But again every one of them is solvable and if not, YOU CAN ALWAYS SOLVE THEM BY TRADING EXPERIENCE.CONCLUSION:I frankly am quite impressed by this game. As listed above, Pros. easily outweighs Cons. My score for this game would be 9.5/10. God of War, Prince of Persia and Devil May Cry fans, THIS IS A MUST BUY. Only thing I recommend is play it on the hardest mode possible for those of who are veteran to God of War type of games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V8G","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"An assaulter. A ghost. A panther.","reviewText":"It has been years since a Splinter Cell game has been on the PS. Now, on the brink of the PS4's arrival, enter Splinter Cell Blacklist. After seeing many videos about this game, we've seen the various new features that this game has to offer. Now, the game has been put to the test. Was it worth the wait?CAMPAIGN/STORY: The story is surrounded by a terrorist's threat from a group called the Engineers, known as the Blacklist. The Blacklist is a threat of a MAJOR terrorists' action on a U.S. interest each week that American occupation is sustained in various overseas countries. Therefore, a countdown has commenced and Sam and his team -- CIA Spec Ops Isaac Briggs, Tech Charlie Cole, and Control Ops Grimsdottir -- has to do everything they can in order to stop the attacks.CUSTOMIZATION/UPGRADES: This game is FULL of them. Just about EVERY part of Sam and his arsenal can be upgraded and customized. For example, on his uniform, everything can be customized from his goggles to his shoes. Each weapon can be customized. Think ofTom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier. His gadgets can be customized, as well. In order to obtain these vast amounts of upgrades and customizations, money has to be obtained via level completion and actions done throughout the levels. Random actions on a level can get Sam more money. It can either be by killing certain enemies a certain number of times with a certain weapon, hacking a computer or even capturing - not killing -  a high-value target.The game introduces an aerial base called The Paladin. This is a jumbo jet, where Sam can freely walk around and talk to his other teammates about various missions, upgrades, etc. Sam can also access what is called the Strategic Mission Interface (SMI), which shows the local news, as well as show a animated global map, which allows Sam to choose what primary or side missions he like. He can also go and talk to his daughter on the phone. Lol The Paladin can be upgraded, as well. By upgrading various sections of the Paladin, it will serve as a tremendous help for Sam on the ground. For example, I upgraded the cockpit, which allowed positions of enemies to be seen as dots on the mini-map. I upgraded again. This time, it allowed me to see enemies as arrows on the mini-map, which allowed me to see what direction they are going to. In addition, when the enemies communicate with each other, I am able to see a signal indicating communication on the mini-map, as well. The next upgrade will extend the vicinity of enemies on the mini-map.ENEMY A.I.: This game has some smart and not-so smart enemy patrols. NO enemy should be underestimated, though. Some are well aware of a bad situation. For example, if two enemies are together and talking, they'll eventually split up. If one of those enemies is taken down, the other will get suspicious and go investigate the situation. If an enemy patrol is alerted, all hell will break loose. Of course, upon fire, the white silhouette of  Sam's last known position will come up. Enemies will engage it. Use that to get away or try to flank those enemies. The key is to try to stay out of sight all together. Keep an eye and ear on the sight icon, which appears and beeps, upon coming across the sight an enemy. If not seen by an enemy, no icon will appear. If Sam is somewhat seen by an enemy, the icon will appear in a narrow form and have a white color. If an enemy has a VERY good sight on Sam, the sight icon will widen, turn red, and a constant beeping noise will occur. A full alert will commence.There are various types of enemies to be aware of. Some enemies may have helmets, which will protect them from headshots. In addition, there are some juggernaut-like enemies. These brutes are fully armored with shotguns and must be engaged by a different set of rules. In other words, straight-up gunfire will NOT take them down. Also, they CANNOT be taken down with hand-to-hand combat from the front. However, they can be taken down from behind. Good luck sneaking up on them! Laser-equipped snipers are on the game, as well. They can see you from far away, even in the darkness. Try to study the patterns of their laser sights and move accordingly. Then, there are dogs. They are smart. They can detect the scent of a nearby enemy, which is YOU. Upon barking at a scent, an enemy will ask, \"have you found something, boy? The enemy will then follow the dog towards Sam's path. Now, Sam has to try to take out both a suspicious dog and enemy patrol. Lastly, there is a mechanical enemy, which are drones. These gadgets are usually controlled by an enemy and look like remote-controlled toys, but are no fun. If one spots you and gets too close, KA'BOOM! To avoid that possibility, one shot will disable the drone. Another shot will make it explode. Keep in mind, if the drone is disable, a nearby enemy will report that the drone is offline and will go investigate. If the enemy is not taken out, he will re-work the drone. Also, drones can travel up stairs.GAMEPLAY:  The theme \"choose a play-style\" is the basic notion of game. There are three different play styles to choose from. The first is Assault. The player can just go guns-a-blazing. This can be very dangerous because the enemies are smart and heavily armed. Not to mention, Sam just doesn't have quite the arsenal to do fight against enemies of mass numbers, which is likely on certain missions. The next is play style is Ghost. This is my personal favorite because it consists of going through missions, while engaging enemies very quietly with quiet and non-lethal attacks. Of course, a true Ghost might be able to go through a level, without engaging an enemy at all. The last is Panther. Panther is a play-style for players, who want to be quiet, but perform lethal attacks.I would say that my play-style is a mix between Ghost and Panther. After each mission, the player will be graded for each play-style that is done. For example, if Sam goes through a mission by using a Panther play-style, points will be given. Not to mention, additional bonus points will be given if enemies are not alerted and so forth.Each one of these play-styles are made increasingly possible by the fact that Sam can now take various paths in the game. The levels are VERY open-ended. This just gives players several options to engage enemies. Just think of the Assassin's Creed series! Players can get their Ezio on by traversing up and across walls, pipes, and rooftops. Sam can also climb through windows. Bonuses can be attained by finding these hidden paths, too.Sam's movements are fluid and swift. Sliding into cover is very easy. This is very to similar to how it is done inArmy of TWO The Devil's Cartel. Just aim at the surface and a cover icon will come up. Just press the X button and he'll just easily slide quickly to cover. Sam's hand-to-hand attacks are brutal, rather lethal or non-lethal. The animations of non-lethal take-downs are a thing to see. Either Sam was slamming an enemy's head on a surface, snatching him out of enemy sight and finishing him with a hard punch or swiftly sliding an enemy across a horizontal surface and swiftly punching his lights out. The lethal attacks are cool, too. Snatching enemies and snapping their necks or slashing their throats makes Sam a very dangerous character. Sam can also perform lethal or non-lethal hand-to-hand attacks on the run. For example, Sam alerted an enemy, and before he could scream, \"I see him\", the enemy was quickly punched him down, while running.Like 360'sTom Clancy's Splinter Cell Conviction, Sam can mark up to three targets. Just aim at the desired target and a red triangle will appear. However, if the enemy is too far, the triangle turns white. Upon the command, Sam will execute a slow-motion assassination of the desired targets. Targets can be marked from behind doors, as well. In addition, Sam can also mark and execute targets on the run, as well. Be warned! If Sam marks a target with a helmet, a triangle icon with a circle will appear. This means, Sam has to find another means of taking THAT target out.GRAPHICS/VISUALS: The game only has a 720p output. However, the graphics look surprisingly better than the indication. Landscapes and characters look very good and sharp, as well. Keep in mind; this is a Ubisoft game, so expect so smudged-looking textures on some levels.SIDE OPS: The game actually has many side missions, which can be done via solo, solo/co-op, or co-op only. These missions are presented by various members of your team and can really test your play-styles to the max. For example, there was one mission, which Sam had to go to an opium farm and take out each enemy in the compound. A number of remaining enemies were seen on the upper-right corner. After each enemy was taken out, the number decreased. With that being said, if enemies are alerted, the number would double. For example, Sam once had to take out 11 enemies in the compound. An enemy was alerted and the number increased to 29. Uh, oh! Another mission had me to take out 20 waves of enemies. One mission had me to obtain three files. Of course, enemies were in my path. This mission would not allow me to even be spotted by an enemy or game over.SOUND: To the chagrin of many Splinter Cell fans, the voice of Same Fisher is played by actor Eric Johnson, who's known for playing on Smallville, Rookie Blue, and Legends of the Fall. It doesn't hurt the game, but I miss Michael Ironside, though. Characters speak very loud and clearly. The game's sound is in Dolby Digital surround sound. In addition, each weapon, gadget, and action has its own realistic and distinctive sound.SPIES VS. MERCS: This infamous multi-player game returns. Spies are the hackers and Mercs are the preventers. Gameplay must be taken slowly, ESPECIALLY if the player is a Merc. Watch your corners. The Spies can just wait in the shadows and take enemies out. Of course, the game has many features that other multiplayers have, such killstreaks, weapon, and character upgrades.VERDICT: This game has it all. A cinematic storyline, upgrades, versatile gameplay, and fluid movements of the character make Blacklist a must-own. The wait was well worth it. Of course, that is just my opinion. Experience Blacklist for yourself!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2013"}

Crouching down, I peeked around the corner and saw my target down the corridor. I was fresh out of grenades, trickery was my only remaining option. Then I remembered the switch on the wall. I turned off the hallway lights, and the guard decided to come over and check it out. His rifle was slung low...big mistake. Before he knew what was happening, I sprang from my hiding place and took him out - my karambit was the quickest thing he never saw.\"This is just a small taste of what goes through my mind while playing Splinter Cell: Blacklist. And it only gets better.+ PROS:+ Engaging storyline+ Lots and lots of unlockable weapons & gear to customize+ Several ways to earn $ for upgrades+ Single player missions, co-op missions, Spies vs. Mercs missions, Gone Dark missions, and even a mobile app \"SC Spider-Bot\"+ Customize your difficulty level - Rookie, Normal, Realistic or Perfectionist- CONS- Glitch on Briggs' 4th co-op mission- Occasional glitches on co-op and Spies vs. MercsPLOT:In this game we play as Sam Fisher, a well-seasoned covert operative. A terrorist group which call themselves \"The Engineers\" are planning several escalating attacks on US interests (called The Blacklist). They will only stop their attacks if the U.S. government agrees to recall all American troops deployed abroad.President Caldwell has tasked Sam with hunting down the Engineers and putting a stop to their plans. His base of operations is a cargo plane codenamed \"Paladin\", and Sam has a few allies on his 4th Echelon team: Charlie Cole, Isaac Briggs and Anna 'Grim' Gr&iacute;msd&oacute;ttir.GAMEPLAY:This is a 3rd person shooter with stealth gameplay. Sam's tasks vary from level to level - on some he has to completely avoid detection, others he needs to pacify all targets, and others he needs to retrieve items or disable security devices. Sam also has some optional level objectives: he can choose to pick up intel in the form of USB devices called Dead Drops, or capture a High Value Target, or hack a Blacklist computer.Sometimes you might find yourself as another character shooting missiles or sniping from above, but for the most part, you'll be playing as Sam Fisher - have goggles, will travel.There are some extra gameplay missions which can only be completed with a cooperative player. While in co-op mode, you can rescue your teammate if they get injured, and vice versa. To toughen the game up a bit, there are some parts in co-op mode where you're separated from your partner and you have to be self-reliant. If you get wounded or captured, they can't help you.The first \"preview\" mission roped me right in to the story. It gave a full tutorial on how to move my character, how to interact with the environment, how to stay out of sight and how to take down my enemies. The storyline was very rich and kept me interested from the first grenade in Guam to the last gunshot in Site F. It's one thing to read a political thriller, it's quite another to experience it through the mindset of a seasoned operative, and Splinter Cell accomplishes this brilliantly.You can upgrade the Paladin command center to unlock gameplay improvements such as health upgrades, radar views, prototype weapons, intel locations, faster regenerations for coop and single player, custom loadout slots, black market weapons, and even in-field customization.The improvements don't stop with Paladin - you can customize your player for the style of gameplay you want!If you're itching to earn a Ghost rating and want to leave nothing but shadows, you can load up on proximity shock land mines and sleeping gas, wear your stealth nanofiber suit and use a crossbow with noisemaker bolts to confuse and distract your foes.For the Rambo-style players who want an Assault rating (meaning shoot everything with a pulse), you're covered too. I personally recommend incendiary grenades, ceramic plate armor, and the SC-15 pistol, with armor piercing ammunition and an accurized barrel.You can create 3 customized suit loadouts for the main game, and there are also several unlockable upgrades for the online games.If the main game and side missions aren't enough to whet your appetite, give Spies vs. Mercs a try. This is an online matchup between a team of spies or mercenaries - there are 6 online gameplay modes (some of which are locked until you level up). You are given a map and a task to complete in the allotted timeframe...You could be a mercenary out to steal intel from the spies, and you have to protect yourself and your teammates to bring the data home. Or, you could be a spy trying to hack into a data terminal and you have to rely on your teammates to protect you from getting killed by a gunshot or a vicious drone. At the end of the match, you're graded on the success/failure of your team, the # of kills you performed, any bonuses you may have earned, and so forth. Leveling up your character earns battle tokens, which are needed to unlock upgrades for Spies vs. Mercs.There are daily challenges and weekly challenges to earn more in-game currency for upgrades, and you can also earn money for completing other challenges, such as knocking out 3 people with a gas grenade, or using lethal hand-to-hand combat.TROPHIES:There are 48 trophies to earn in this game. If a player sticks to the main storyline only, there's roughly 11 trophies to earn. However, it benefits the player to complete the extra missions from Kobin, Grim, Charlie and Briggs so they can get better weapons and armor to suit their style of gamepay. None of the trophies struck me as particularly difficult to earn, but the most tedious one was \"Enhanced Lethality Demonstrated\". Thankfully, there are several videos online to walk you through it. Trophy hunters can earn the Platinum in about a month or less.I will note that 6 upgrades for your spy/merc are not available until reaching level 51-56 in multiplayer - so there's incentive to keep playing after the Platinum trophy has been earned.PROS:As I mentioned previously, the storyline was excellent. While I improved my gameplay, I found myself geniunely caring about the characters and understanding their motivations, whether they agreed with Sam's ideals or not. To me, this wasn't just a game of \"shoot everything that moves\".There are SO MANY WAYS to earn extra money in this game. There are over 100 combined gameplay challenges for single player mode as well as co-op modes. From loud gun headshots to putting dogs to sleep, from breaching door charges to sneaking past cameras, there is no shortage of ways to put upgrade money into your pockets. If you have friends that play this game, you can beat their high scores on missions and earn even MORE money.This is the first time I have played an app on my cell phone which ties into a PS3 game, and it was very fun, not to mention addictive. I downloaded SC Spider-Bot onto my android phone - I could play Ghost, Panther or Assault style, just like the regular game, but I play as a little robot. I decided to complete all the Ghost missions and within a few days, I had unlocked Alpha Goggles and Boots for use in my regular game. I could also switch the points I earned into in-game currency, which was a nice touch.I really enjoyed the daily \"Gone Dark\" missions. These were a nice change of pace from the regular gameplay, they have the same dynamic as \"Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego\". You are given a report regarding terrorist activities, and you have to try and figure out where to go next. If you guess right, you get another clue. At the end, you need to make a decision and if you make the right one, your score multiplier increases by 0.5% - over time, this will lead to more and more money for your upgrades.Splinter Cell: Blacklist understands that you might have troubles getting through some of the harder missions, so they allow you 4 different levels of difficulty, which can be changed in the pause menu during the mission. However, completing a level on Perfectionist difficulty with a Ghost rating will earn you the most money...so it's in your best interest to learn to move like a ninja if you want to level up quickly.Rambo time comes later.CONS:To be honest, I didn't have very many negative experiences with this game. The only item which caused me a bit of annoyance was a glitch at the end of Brigg's last mission.**SLIGHT SPOILERS BELOW**During the \"Abandoned City\" mission, there is a segment near the end where Briggs and Sam are sitting on the ground shooting at their enemies. My co-op partner died, and when we started from our last checkpoint, the enemies stopped spawning and the level couldn't be completed. This happened both when I joined the level, and when I was the host player. It's been reported to Ubisoft, so hopefully this will be fixed when the next patch comes out. If this happens, your only option is to restart the level.**SPOILERS OVER**There were occasional glitches during Spies vs. Mercs: In a game of Extraction, one of my teammates dropped the intel on a set of stairs and it couldn't be picked up by any other player...no matter what we tried. In another a game of Blacklist where I played a Merc, no one could tell which terminal was getting hacked until it was over 60% complete. The only other glitches I found were on co-op  missions and they were relatively minor, flickering on one side of the screen or a phantom grenade explosion graphic that appeared out of nowhere. All in all, most of the glitches I came across weren't game-breakers.WHAT WOULD I IMPROVE?I'm a total sucker for branching storylines in games, and Splinter Cell Blacklist would have benefited from such a dynamic. Every mission in this game can be completed successfully, but what if the player completed a mission but failed in their task? This could have led to certain missions being either available or unavailable. With all the extra money Sam earns for completing missions, he could use some of that to bribe people into giving up information on Blacklist activities. Or, maybe he could have \"purchased\" information from some of Charlie's contacts to unlock shortcuts through levels (door codes, vent access, something like that).SPECIAL PRAISE:Whoever decided to put in the \"Call Sarah\" option after each mission. This part of the game is not necessary at all, but it added a layer of depth to Sam Fisher which I wasn't expecting. When a solo mission is completed, Sam can call his daughter from Paladin and check on her, makes sure she's ok, and only hangs up after he tells her he loves her. It shows me Sam Fisher isn't all business, he also cares about family.So to whoever added that in...thank you.FINAL THOUGHTS:This game was an extremely pleasant experience. I would start my mornings completing a Gone Dark mission, and increase my earnings multiplier before I went to work. During my lunch hour, I'd play the SC Spider-bot game on my phone. When I got home, I'd either work on completing a few missions on Ghost/Panther/Assault style, or I'd earn some Battle Tokens in Spies vs. Mercs. In short, my days started and ended with Splinter Cell.I didn't mind the replacement of Michael Ironside's voice with Eric Johnson - It's true, Michael Ironside has a very deep and gravelly voice which commands respect...but I was totally okay with the switch to Eric Johnson's voice. There's an eerie calmness when I heard Sam Fisher speak; whether he talked to a colleague or interrogated a known terrorist with a folding chair - Eric Johnson took his role very seriously, and it shows in the final product.For people who love unlocking and upgrading weapons and gear to create the ultimate covert ops warrior, this is a great game to sink your teeth into. I highly recommend Splinter Cell: Blacklist to anyone who is a fan of the stealth genre of games. If you likedHitman: Absolution, you'll really enjoy this one.**Thanks again to AUB_FAN for the Perfectionist run-through assistance!**","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2013"}

Taking advantage of the flexibility and power of the Wii and Wii Remote,New Super Mario Bros. Wiimanages to preserve the retro experience that fans love about the series, while adding new game features. Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiplayers can now navigate the side-scrolling worlds alone as before or invite up to three others to join them at the same time, on the same level, at any point in the game for competitive and cooperative multiplayer fun. With the multiplayer mode, the newest installment of the most popular video game franchise is designed to bring yet another type of family entertainment into living rooms and engage groups of friends in fast-pacedSuper Mario Bros.fun.Controller Choices Via the Wii RemoteIn another nod to the series' Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) roots, the Wii Remote controller used withNew Super Mario Bros. Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs. In addition, players can access powerups with their choice of either the push of a button, or by shaking the Wii remote, again demonstrating the perfect merging of classic gameplay and modern game design which isNew Super Mario Bros. Wii.Key Game FeaturesNew Super Mario Bros. Wiioffers a combination of cooperation and competition. Players can pick each other up to save them from danger or toss them into it.Supports 2-4 players in multiplayer mode.Mario, Luigi and two Toads are all playable characters, while many others from the Mushroom Kingdom make appearances throughout the game. Players can even ride different Yoshi characters and use their tongues to swallow enemies &ndash; or their fellow players.In some areas, players use the motion abilities of the Wii Remote controller. The first player to reach a seesaw might make it tilt to help his or her character reach a higher platform &ndash; and then tilt it incorrectly just to mess with other players.New items include the propeller suit, which will shoot players high into the sky with just a shake of the Wii Remote and Mario&rsquo;s new ability to transform into Penguin Mario.At the end of each stage during the simultaneous multiplayer mode, players are ranked based on their score, the coins collected and the number of enemies defeated.","reviewerName":"Sumbudy \"buriedatlantis\"","summary":"Nostalgia can only take a game so far...","reviewText":"... but the sheer fun is what brings it home.  Sure, playing this game took me back to playing the original NES games when I was a wee lad; same gameplay, ect, but I'm almost positive that I would find New Super Mario Bros. Wii a blast if I'd never had any inkling of what the plumbing siblings from Brooklyn were all about.  Make no mistake, Mario has been a fixture in gaming for eons and its not because of the mustache (though let's be honest, the mustache doesn't hurt), it's because they are consistently top quality games.  This one is no different. From the vibrant graphics and colors to the familiar and effective gameplay, this game is very addictive.  The level design is most excellent as I entered each world wondering what other kind of wacky situations the game designers could possibly get the Mario Bros. and their Toad pals into and was never let down.  Yes, there are difficult levels.  It might take a few frustrating tries to get some levels figured out, but once you do and conquer that bad boy, it is immensely satisfying.  This is simply the Mario Way.And multiplayer, ah yes, multiplayer.  What a wonderful creation that has been.  There's nothing more fun than sitting down with a buddy and plowing through a rousing game of Mario Bros.  And at the same time, there's nothing more frustrating than sitting down with a buddy (or significant other) and dying your way through Mario Bros.  Just a word to the wise; if you head into a game with someone with a few less years of experience at the joystick, go with patience.  Loads of patience.  I'd hate to see good marriages break up over a mustached plumber in red overalls.  To be fair though, once I changed my mindset from \"go in to win!\" to \"let's just have some fun\", playing with the wife was indeed fun.It's cool that the game lets you use the controller like an old school NES controller, but this too can have frustrations.  Maybe I'm just not as nimble with the fingers as I used to be or I've grown more accustomed to analog sticks, but the D-Pad feels a little small and it can be annoying when trying to hit the \"down\" button and going sideways or vice-versa.  Just a minor quibble though that doesn't take away from the fact that this game is just sheer fun for the whole family.How it compares to other modern Mario games just varies on your mileage, I suppose.  I think I may find Mario Galaxy a bit more fun, but the wife definitely prefers good ol' Side Scroller Mario.  In the end, for me, just give me a fun game with that crazy plumber in the tripped out Mushroom Kingdom, and I'm sure I can find a reason to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0009UC6AI","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Great series, should not be passed up","reviewText":"If you are hardcore into \"shock thrills\", gore, zombies, guns, and grotesque monsters that mirror our psychological inner demons yet can be bashed over the head with a board until they leak blood everywhere Fatal Frame 3 may not be for you. My first introduction of the series was when I watched one of my female friends play Fatal Frame 2 and honestly at the time I wasn't scared.The thing is with a fatal frame game you actually have to play it to be frightened by it. It is definetly not a game that makes you jump when your friend is at the helm.First of all let me admit I'm not a \"long time fan\" of the series. I have not seen or played Fatal frame 1 and I only know about Mio and her twin sister by having warched my friend go through Fatal Frame 2. Anotherwords my opinion here is non biased. I'm not trying to \"hype up\" Fatal Frame 3.So what can a first time camera obscura photographer tell you about his first interactive experience? It was horrifying and I mean that in the most flattering sense.For fans of the other two games FF 3 does tie into what has already been estabalished. Miku is the girl who lost her brother in Fatal Frame 1 and is an \"assistant\" to Rei who is the main character. Rei has her own tale of loss. Her boy friend Yuu died in a tragic car accident. After Rei believed to see his \"ghost\" she became a paranormal investigator. Lastly there is Kei, an occult researcher who was a friend of Yuu and who is the uncle of Mio and her twin. Is is estabalished right away how the characters fit into the overall plot. Even if you have not played the previous games you are given a wealth of information.The game revolves around a mysterious tattooed priestess and the manor of sleep. The only good thing about this other worldly place is that it is said you can go there to visit with loved ones that have long since died. However beyond that the old occupants of the manor were apart of a sinister cult whom sacrificed maidens to prevent a type of \"nightmare reality\" from crossing over into normal existence. Poor Rei begins having the tattoo of the priestess and soon her and the other two protagonists find themselves fighting for their lives each time they visit the mansion in their dreams.First I must say \"ghosts\" are hard to fight. You have an enemy with the basic intelligence of a human being and atop that they can \"teleport\" quickly and phase through walls. Luckily there is variety. Young shrine maidens have stakes and hammers and one of their most disturbing attacks is to nail your foot or ankle to the floor. The \"men in white\" come at you with hatchets and knives or try to simply grab you. As you can well guess even being touched with a ghost will sap your health. Luckily you can upgrade both your camera and its' lenses. A flash for example can knock spirits back and Miku can literally slow a ghost's movement making getting their \"snap shots\" easier.If you have not played any Fatal Frame the combat goes into first person mode. Runes around your lens ratio will start to light up and that is symbolic of your attack meter charging. To do alot of damage you want the apparitions as close as possible when you take their picture. Yup, finally there is a survival horror franchise that sadistically makes having the enemy close a prime requisite.When you lower your camera or get hit by a ghost you automatically go into 3rd person and I highly suggest that if a poltergeist or phantom suddenly \"disappears\" that you briefly lower your camera, get your bearings, and try to pin point where the next attack will come from.Believe it or not none of this is as frustrating as it sounds and each time you defeat a spirit you get blue \"ghost orbs\" or \"spirit points\" to level up both your camera AND your diffirent lenses.As expeted each character has merits and flaws. Kei is athletic and good both at running and hiding. His spirit power is weak luckily he eventually gets his own camera obscura so he can fight back. Kei also has the most health. Miku is neat because she can crawl into smaller places and she has the most spirit potential. She can double charge her spirit \"zapping\" power through her camera and she can slow enemies down. Rei is the traditional \"average\" yet \"well balanced\" main character and her main merit is having the largest capture lens ratio.The manor itself is interesting and the puzzles are a bit challenging but not frusterating. You will do alot of back-tracking for keys or rolls of film to play in the projector room to glean more disturbing revelations. Normally this would damper my enjoyment but I found I liked repeatedly going to different places because they all were well designed and very ambient. This might be one of the few games that makes \"return visits\" to certain areas fun as opposed to tidous.As I said before every character has good motivations. They all have \"loved ones\" they are trying to save from the manor and Rei has the additional motivation of finding a cure for the tattoo curse.Each time you awake in Rei's house you are allowed to recover health, develop pictures taken in the manor, replenish film and herb supplies, and talk with Miku to exchange information. You will also get letters from Kei. While it may seem like you are safe here, a ghost does eventually begin haunting your abode though from what I've seen so far she is mischievous yet harmless. This may change later in the game but I'm unsure.The only glaringly bad flaw with Fatal Frame 3 is the \"english dubbing\" but I would not let something as insignificant as bad lip synching ruin the whole game for you.I'd love to go so much more into depth about the \"unique ghost bosses\",folk-lore erriness, and every snowy or shadowy crevice of the cold manor of sleep but I think I'll leave those things for you the reader to discover!Pros+ Subtle in the gore department yet still manages to make you uneasy and afraid.+ An original take on \"fighting enemies\".+Wonderful story line that does much to tie up loose ends from the other 2 games.+ Being able to play as 3 characters all which are unique.+ Besides for the shrine maidens and men in white the other apparitions are all varied, frightening, and have interesting attack patterns.+ Spot on controls+ Great atmosphere and sound effects.Cons- The females have odd mannerisms when running sometimes.- You sorta get the impression Rei and Miku are well off just by interacting with their home. If you like \"average blue collar citizens\" as your heroes of choice this might present a problem.-Bad dubbing (lip synching)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2008"}

I have what used to be a 60GB model, recently upgraded to 320GB - the gold standard.As compared to the 60GB model:______________________________________________+ less expensive (I paid $599 for my 60GB PS3)+ 33% more storage+ needs less power+ dual shock controller (rumble)- no memory card interfaces- 2 USB ports vs. 4 USB ports on the 60GB- no PS2 compatibility______________________________________________This model comes with an 80GB drive. This is nice because, most would agree, 80GB is more than 60GB. If you feel that the extra 20GB is a big deal, maybe you should think again. I upgraded my 60GB to 320GB because I was about to run out of space, with only 10GB or so left. One month or so later, I'm using more than 80GB already - just downloaded the Ratchet and Clank minigame from PSN and it alone needs about 3GB. My advice is to buy this model and upgrade it yourself. It's (relatively) easy and you can find a lot of advice if you Google for it.If you are on the upgrade path, $80 would buy you a 320GB drive. I used theWestern Digital WD3200BEVT 320 GB Scorpio Sata 5400 Rpm 8MB 2.5 inchmyself but that was back in June/July and I paid about $150 then; you could get much larger drives for less now. 500GB drives are available for less than $100 and you should try to get one of those if you are planning to store lots of videos. One that I tested would be the 500GB 2.5\" Sata Drive which replaced my laptop's 60GB little drive and I helped a friend upgrade his own PS3 with. The nice thing about upgrading your disk is that you are also going to be left with a perfectly good 80GB or $160GB drive which you can place into a cheap enclosure, and theStarTech AT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosureworked for me. I am using the free leftover drive as a backup device for family photos.Upgrading the disk is (relatively) easy and you can find a lot of advice on the Net. Search for \"PlayStation 3 Hard Drive Upgrade (HOWTO)\" for videos that should help you decide if you are comfortable with upgrading. If upgrading is the first thing you do (before installing games or uploading personal files), everything becomes very easy because you need not worry about backups or restores. I upgraded my box in a couple of hours WITH the backup/restore steps.The lack of memory card interfaces is annoying but you can get around it. Copy your stuff to a USB drive or flash drive and... problem solved. You can then upload your things through the USB. It's somewhat inconvenient but it's no big deal.My old (10 months) 60GB model has 4 USB slots and I am using all of them. One for the PS3 Eye (camera), a second has a wireless keyboard dongle, the third is where the racing wheel plugs in and the last one I use to charge controllers. Can you live with 2 slots? I suppose you can but there's going to be some plugging/unplugging if you begin adding peripherals. I suppose you could get one of those USB ports multiplexers. They're ugly but... it's doable.PS2 compatibility... can't get it. Sorry. I don't play PS2 games but my kids do. In fact, they just bought some Sonic game a couple of days ago. I was surprised but... de gustibus. They're also playing Kingdom Hearts and Destroy All Humans.This model comes with a couple of improvements over the gold standard. It burns less electricity, which is a good thing for the rain forests, keeping them cool and maybe you save a few dollars on your electric bill. And, of course you get the advanced controller.Briefly:- If you are planning to upgrade, the 80GB model is the way to go because it is selling for $100 less than the larger disk version and you can use the savings to pay for your disk upgrade- Get yourself a USB port multiplexer if you need more than 2 ports- Transfer your photos to flash drives to get around the missing memory card interfaces- Or or, even better, to address both the USB and the memory card issues, get thePlaystation 3 Media Hub+for 2 extra USB ports AND a card reader- Keep your PS2 if you have one and still wish to play PS2 games in the future.- Enjoy your new PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2008"}

What fun gameplay and memories I was in for...As everyone and their mother knows, Sonic 1's plot is that the evil Dr. Robotnik is not only capturing many small innocent animals and turning them into evil robots, but plans to take over Mobius (their planet) and turn it from forests and clean air to factories and smelly air (I'll spare you the New Jersey joke). It is now up to Sonic to defeat Robotnik and make everything right again.Although Sonic 2 remains my favorite, this is without a doubt a close second. I know the graphics may seem somewhat dated today, but for 1991, this was pretty damn good. Bright, vibrant colors, and great atmosphere (love the city skyline in Star Light Zone). It goes from a bright, sunny atmosphere (Sun Light Zone) to a big industrial factory (Scrap Brain). Along the way, there are various icons that Sonic can smash open, and each one has a special power that Sonic can use to his benefit; 10 rings, super speed, temporary invincibility, a shield, and the holy grail of them all: the 1-up. The game also has catchy music. Okay, it's 2004 now, and we can hear actual bands in our games, but back then, we had video game music, and it was good and easy to tune out if need be. Also, in this game, you must collect 7 chaos emeralds in these weird, spinning worlds, and defeat robot enemies by jumping on them.It's a fun, classic game that brings back lots of memories for me (I remember how great it felt to finally get to the next zone).

The graphics looked sub-par, and I couldn't hit anything.  I just started and got creamed in the first level.  The learning curve of such of game was too intense.  Car combat is so simple, why should it take a while to get used to it?  Anyway, with no advancement and no visual aesthetics, I quickly dismissed this game.Fortunately, I came back to it.  I grew accustomed to the drab, gray graphics, I figured out some strategy, and I switched the difficulty to easy.  What happened amazed me.  This game which I thought was terrible turned out to be pretty good.You get to choose between around 12 different characters.  Each character pretty much goes through the same levels, so once you've been through a few characters, you've seen all the levels in the game.  Each character controls another car, and more importantly, gives you a cool movie describing his or her ordeal.These movies are what make the game.  Though very, very short (nothing close to Final Fantasy X), these little 30-second clips are disturbing, intense, dark, and simply amazing.  The credits, with a montage of the various cut scenes played to Rolling Stone's \"Fade to Black\" is worth the price of this relatively inexpensive game alone.Even though the graphics could have been better, and the game easier, playing a few characters is worth it.  Though I would love to see all the movies, the game gets pretty repetitive.  Despite these flaws, I recommend this game.Pros:MoviesEnding CreditsInteresting gameplayInteresting charactersDifficulty levelsSimple gameCons:Too gray and drabTakes forever to kill a vehicleInitial learning curveNot enough levels - repetitiveHours to complete: 6 hours for the first character, 2-4 hours for additional characters (12 characters total)Difficulty: Medium (for easy level)Frustration: Medium (mostly from the beginning)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2002"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"romevi","summary":"Years of enjoyment.","reviewText":"Project Revolution. That was the title given to the Wii before \"Wii\" was revealed to a mocking world. But it would leave other consoles of that generation in the dust sales-wise (though I love my PS3 to death). The controls would be considered revolutionary, but we all know that when the console released they weren't exactly what we thought they'd be. The MotionPlus rectified the issue, but few games of merit utilized the feature.Upon release, it was seen as a party machine, a new form of the karaoke machine, if you will. Many members of my extended family had one, and plenty of friends had one too. My first experiences with the Wii as a gaming machine rather than a party machine were from a roommate's loaner. Because the Wii was backwards compatible with GCN discs, I got to play the NES Zelda and Ocarina of Time to completion for the first time (thanks to the Collector's Edition). Galaxy was the first title on the Wii I played in full, and it took my breath away. I was hooked.Of course, like many, I was confused as all heck when I found out the remote didn't generate 1:1 accuracy, especially when I played the Wii version of Twilight Princess for the first time, but I got on just fine. In fact, most of the games I played I ended up using another controller, like the GameCube or Classic Controller (and Pro when it was released). Only for games that required it, like both Galaxys, did I use the remote and nunchuk combination.At that time, I was a senior in undergrad, and the years prior I never let my gaming interfere with my education. But the Wii and DS destroyed that rule. After graduation, because I couldn't get a full-time job right away, I had to settle and wait for a while before buying my own console. It's funny, though, as I already owned Twilight Princess (Wii version) and Brawl for quite some time.Finally, my sister realized she wanted to get one too and we split the cost in July of 2008. This was when the Wii, over a year after its release, was still pretty popular and hard to find. We had to call our local Target almost every morning for two weeks before we landed one. I was eager to get one as I never really owned a Nintendo console as a kid, having only a hand-me-down NES which rarely worked. I was impatient to play all the Ninty games I missed out on.It's a fantastic system with a buffet of a library able to satiate any gamer's fancy. The gamer like me? There's Zelda, Metroid, and even the \"kiddy\" games like Mario. It's because of the Wii and its backward-capabilities that I'm a huge Mario/Nintendo fan, and Zelda has become one of my favorite game series--alongside Final Fantasy (pre-XII). Also, when I purchased it, I still lived at home and my kid sister and I had a blast playing games together. In fact, she's currently borrowing it right now and plays hours on end of Mario Kart and Wii Sports.One would think that with the Wii U available it may be a bit hard to sell the Wii, but that'd be wrong. The Wii is still priced competitively, and is probably the biggest bang for your buck if you want to play first-party titles. I have a setup of the Wii and PS3 and couldn't be happier.Of course, even from its launch, the Wii isn't known for its powerful graphics. Blame the hardware limitations; even if you get component cables it won't look that much better. In fact, on a flat screen LED or LCD TV it looks actually *worse* with component cables because there's so much jaggedness. I remember plugging in component cables for the first time on my new (at the time) Toshiba LCD and was appalled when playing New Super Mario Bros. Wii. I had upgraded my tube from an old 32\" CRT Zenith and the Wii looked better on that with composite cables. But you always can go the way of the Dolphin.So, in 2014, is getting the Wii worth it? It depends; how caught up are you with Nintendo games? Sure, you can get a Wii U, but there aren't as many games on it as there are on the Wii if you get just the older, cheaper console, especially if you get the older GCN-compatible model. I invested heavily in peripherals, so that made my gaming experience much more enjoyable and competitive.I used the white GameCube controller and WaveBird for Brawl and Mario Kart, as well of course for any GameCube titles. For the Virtual Console I used primarily the Classic Controller and its variant the Pro, and I imported the Club Nintendo of Japan Super Famicom controller for the Wii. For fighting games and arcade titles that used a digital signal rather than analog (e.g., Tatsunoko vs. Capcom), I used Hori's arcade stick. So my experience may or may not differ from yours.Even today I think it's worth getting. There's at least ten solid titles for any kind of gamer. Sure, there aren't many M-rated games on the platform, but that's not why I got it. I consider myself a gamer whose sole intention is to enjoy every and all kinds of games available; I'm not a fanboy of any brand, and am open to try any games from the `70s and `80s to today. That's why I got a Nintendo console: to play all the games available on it that I missed in the years they were released. I can enjoy arcade and NES titles as well as the limited number of N64 emulated classics (I say \"emulated\" because it's not the same thing as playing on the good ol' N64). I have a 3DS now and play that more often than the Wii, but I still have a number of games I haven't completed to which I plan on returning; once those are out of the way, the Wii U will be my next purchase.Thus ends my review. I guess this isn't as much a review as it is a catalog of my experiences with the console the past half-decade, but I couldn't write it any other way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2014"}

With the revolutionary Wii console, however, Nintendo instead chose to showcase the movement-based action of the system by packaging the console with Wii Sports.  The game consists of five sports that players can try out:Baseball: Quite fun, and the difficulty level goes up as you improve, making for engaging hours of gameplay.Bowling: Much like the real sport, Wii bowling can be parts incredibly fulfilling and incredibly maddening, as one millimeter of wrist turn will register with the system and change your roll.Tennis: Not being a big tennis fan, I play this game the least, but my brother has had hours of fun with it.Golf: Once you learn the mechanics of the swing mechanism, this could become the most addictive part of the game for you, as (like real golf) it looks so simple until you try it!Boxing: This one really gets you moving, as you duck, dodge, jab, and strike at your virtual opponent with the Wii controller and Wii nunchuck.There is also a Wii Fitness Test mode that, while not at all indicative of your physical fitness level as it claims to be, does give you a good indication of how you stack up to your friends.Overall, Wii Sports is a fun, engaging little game that will bring out the competitive juices in all gamers, whether you are a young child or senior citizen.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2008"}

Now some 25 years later (and 20 years after the last game in the series) Kid Icarus rises again in Kid Icarus Uprising for the Nintendo 3DS.  Once again you take control of the Angelic hero, Pit, as he battles against the evil forces of Medusa who wants to destroy mankind.Let's not kid ourselves; this is an important game to Nintendo.  More than any other console maker, Nintendo thrives on its core characters like Zelsa, Mario Bros., Metroid, and Donkey Kong and Kid Icarus had to be a good game to take its place among those Nintendo stalwarts, and while its not a perfect game, it certainly succeeds in just about every area. Developed by Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai and his Project Sora team, Kid Icarus Uprising is a game that combines standard shooter play, rail shooter parts in the air and third-person platforming action when it's on the ground.  Now this might seem like it might make for a jumbled mess of styles but it all blends together smoothly.Based on Greek Mythology, albeit a lite-version of the myths, Kid Icarus is both whimsical yet exciting.  The game delivers equal amounts of action and laughs throughout, and witty banter abounds in the games fantastic voice dialog. The characters often break down the so-called 4th barrier and freely admit that they are in a game.  Pit has no wings of his own so relies on gaining his flying ability from Palutena, the Goddess of Light.The sections in the air are your rail shooting sections where Pit's forward movement is controlled by the game leaving you to dodge enemy attacks and take aim with his weapons.  These sections almost feel like an old style sci-fi game like Galaga or Defender where you shoot and dodge and dodge and shoot.  These sections are just fantastic and feature breathtaking level design.  Since you're utilizing the circle pad and stylus, the game comes packed with a plastic stand to mount your 3DS.  Admittedly using the stand isn't going to be comfortable for every player so Nintendo has included a liberal number of options for customizing the control scheme to fit any player's needs.The ground sections are mainly platform play and also give you greater control over Pit.  Pit will utilize both missile and melee weapons as he tackles a huge array of enemies that have their unique strengths and weaknesses.  There are even parts where you have Pit climb into various vehicles including a mech which sticks out like a sore thumb in this setting but is a lot of fun.  The platforming sections can be a little less forgiving than the aerial sections as some narrow walkways and tough jumps can leave you falling to your death.  There are nine weapon classes, each featuring a variety of weapons. Cannons feature slow but powerful long-ranged shots, while clubs let you deflect shots back at your opponents. Other types range from blades and staffs to claws and bows. Each weapon has its own stats and there's a ton of customizing that you can do as well with the fusion system.  Weapons can be fused together to create new, more powerful weapons.  With the aid of a simple grid, you can view the results of possible weapon fusions and decide which weapons to fuse to create something new.The single-player campaign can take 10 - 12 hours to complete and then you can try your hand at multi-player.  The versus mode is playable either online or locally, and allows you to take your hard-earned weapons and powers into battle, either in teams or in a free-for-all. Free-for-all features up to six players going head-to-head trying to kill one another in deathmatch style play.  There's also a Light Vs. Dark team mode.  Here, teams kill each other until one team's life gauge is used up at which point the player who died last transforms into an angel.  Now you have to protect your angel trying to deplete the other team's life gauge.  Light Vs. Dark features a number of different options to change up the gameplay.Kid Icarus is a gorgeous game loaded with charm, humor, and fast-paced action.  It's control system is a little dicey but its one of the few weaknesses in this rebirth of a longtime Nintendo favorite.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B005J5K9UW","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"An entertaining marriage of glam and gore","reviewText":"Lollipop Chainsaw is one of those rare games that is a sheer spectacle, defined solely by its intoxicating imagery and firmly established tone. Games of this type, however, commonly tend to encounter that little problem when the gimmick of the shiny surface eventually wears off and the gameplay becomes responsible for reeling in players for the long haul. As most critics have already told many of you, the game is certainly not fantastic, but it really shouldn't be passed up either. Developed by Grasshopper Manufacture as a resulting collaboration of game designer Goichi Suda and filmmaker James Gunn, the game inevitably arrived amidst a sea of comparisons, whether they be Goichi Suda's games (Killer7, Shadows of the Damned, No More Heroes, not to mention his partial involvement in Super Smash Bros. Brawl) or Gunn's movies (Dawn of the Dead, Slither, Super). While this game certainly features dark, twisted undertones echoing both developers' respective creativities, I'll warn everyone beforehand that making too many comparisons to the spectacle that is Lollipop Chainsaw would be unwise. No, this game deserves to be analyzed in its own light, within the \"confines\" of its own bewildering, nonsensical universe.In a nutshell, the game is a mish-mash concoction of scantily clad cheerleaders, zombie apocalypse gore, and lots and lots of rainbows and sparkles. It treads a very unique line between bloody hack-and-slash and simplistic childlike glee. If its creative team didn't draw you in, its explosive concept most likely will. The concept is this: blonde, busty, lollipop-loving cheerleader Juliet Starling awakens on the morning of her eighteenth birthday only to discover the beginning of a zombie apocalypse in her town, as hordes of her classmates transform into the undead and roam the city in search of human flesh. Luckily for her, she just so happens to come from a family of professional zombie hunters, something she hasn't yet revealed to her not-so-long-term boyfriend Nick Carlyle. As she heads out to meet up with him this same morning, he's attacked and bitten by one of the zombies. In order to prevent him from becoming a living corpse himself, Juliet severs his body from the neck down and casts a spell to keep him alive as a disembodied head (a nifty trick she picked up via zombie hunting excursions past, surely). Armed with a keychain of her boyfriend's head and an enormous chainsaw adorned with pink hearts, Juliet sets out to defeat the zombies and find out who's behind all this apocalyptic brouhaha.The combat system is predominantly combo-based, as Juliet strings together various attacks to cripple the undead offenders. Cheerleading-themed pom-pom bashes and kicks make for swift, light attacks that can be quickly strung together to stun enemies, while heavy chainsaw slashes tend to be slower but deal heavier damage. The primary goal is to get zombies \"groggy,\" at which point they'll be temporarily stunned as stars circle their heads, and become much more vulnerable to attack. Pom-pom and cheerleading attacks excel at getting zombies groggy or pushing them back, while chainsaw slashes are usually what finish them off. Each bloody slash of Juliet's chainsaw is accompanied by flurries of sparkles, rainbows, and hearts, a plucky and pretty hilarious contrast to the game's mega-violence. As you proceed through the game, defeat zombies and save citizens from zombie attacks, you'll be awarded gold and platinum coins, the in-game currency which can be used to purchase new combos and attacks, health or strength boosts, and more. You'll also collect various flavors of lollipops throughout the stages; you can hold five maximum at one time, as each one can instantly recover a portion of Juliet's health as needed.Juliet's chainsaw will eventually become adorned with new equipment and features, allowing her to perform different types of stunts and abilities for hacking up zombies. My personal favorite is the Chainsaw Dash, which allows her to sprint forward at full speed while mowing down zombies in her way, all the while using boost panels to make high jumps across platforms and collect coins and other goodies. You'll also eventually be able to use Nick's head to attack zombies, or even place it on headless zombie bodies to briefly gain control of them. Lollipop Chainsaw's boss battles are generally quite memorable, as punky, wild-haired \"zombie rock gods\" enter various phases and initiate wild attack patterns.As Juliet kills zombies, she builds star meter, displayed at the bottom left of the screen. Once it's filled, you can activate Star Soul mode at your leisure, at which point Juliet glows with a rainbowy light, temporarily gaining invincibility and super-strength, set giddily to the soundtrack of Toni Basil's \"Mickey.\" Star Soul mode makes for some of the flashiest, most addictive gameplay offered here-it's a shame the feature is somewhat under-utilized. Another nice feature is \"Sparkle Hunting,\" which activates when Juliet flashily destroys three or more zombies. This triggers a cutscene of Juliet within a glittering background, and you'll be awarded coins depending on how impressive your attack combo was (this also substantially boosts your score/rating). Star Soul mode and Sparkle Hunting oftentimes go hand in hand, as more devastating combos and damage outputs are easier when Star Soul is active.There are also a variety of options for customization, as you'll over time be able to change Juliet's outfits and even build the soundtrack playlist of your choosing as you play through the stages. The game's spunky soundtrack is among its brightest assets, featuring a cheeky blend of old-school pop, electro-punk and nu-metal. Mindless Self Indulgence, Skrillex, Sleigh Bells, MSTRKRFT, Dead or Alive, Joan Jett, and even 50's pop quartet The Chordettes are just some examples of the vast variety of musical acts you'll be enjoying throughout this game. The soundtrack compliments the extreme irony/silliness of the plot, and helps remind you that Lollipop Chainsaw never once requests to be taken seriously (important to remember, given that certain aspects of the game, particularly the heavy sexualizing of Juliet's character and the accompanying insults hurled her way by other characters, may offend certain players who aren't open to such humor; and be warned, you'll be seeing quite a bit of Juliet's chest and panties).While this should all sound like a great deal of joyous fun (which it mostly is), Lollipop Chainsaw's missteps can be quite glaring. The nastiest offenders are some of the awkwardly-designed mini-games, which you'll be forced to play through to advance through certain stages. Some of these diversions from the ordinary hack-and-slash gameplay can be fun and add some nice variety, but they're mostly obnoxious buzzkills that harshly stall the momentum. Some examples include weirdly-structured bouts of zombie-themed basketball and baseball, in which you have to destroy zombies in a specific way to score a certain amount of points within a brief time limit, or protect a base runner from oncoming zombies with a chainsaw machinegun that can be awfully hard to aim/control. What ultimately renders these mini-games big stinkers is the fact that you die if you lose, meaning your score and final stage rating can be totally screwed over not because you died at the hands of enemy attacks, but because you lost a wonky mini-game. These really should have been left out and at their worst are totally infuriating.Additionally, this game is comparatively speaking extremely short; the basic campaign should take most players only between five to eight hours total, and the replay factor can really dwindle from there, since there's no real online play or post-game content. However, the aforementioned end-of-stage ratings are uploaded to national leaderboards, so if you want to get really hardcore you do have the option of competing for the highest scores and see how you rank against other players (or Juliet's dad, the in-game `high score' standard). As previously mentioned, however, these rankings plummet if you die, meaning no matter how many zombies you defeat or goodies you sniff out and unlock, the mini-games can troll you into oblivion. Another of this game's biggest problems is its occasionally terrible camera angling-there's nothing worse than being cornered by hordes of enemies and suddenly having your screen view shift to a random close-up of a wall, which happens far more than it should here. You can manually move the camera, but there are times when you can't, and even when you can the movement tends to be slow, awkward and can be dangerously distracting in intense combat sequences.Speaking of the combat, although it can make for fluid fun and fantastic visuals, some players may notice that certain chainsaw attacks are slow and clunky, and some animations are required to finish before new attacks can be initiated, which can be a big problem in major zombie hordes. In addition to this, certain powerful combos aren't unlocked until near the game's end, many of which really should've just been available from the start to allow for wider variation from the simple, clunky attacks you'll have to rely on early on (which can ironically make the difficulty level go in reverse as you progressively have more to utilize). This certainly doesn't make or break the game, but it can take more getting used to than some may prefer, depending on personal play styles.Offsetting many of these flaws is the snappy script and dialogue; regardless of its ups and downs, a big goofy smile will be plastered on most players' faces throughout a vast majority of this game, not only because of the bedazzling aesthetics, but because much of the character banter is genuinely hilarious. Juliet somehow manages to be ditzy and witty all at the same time, while Nick is highly endearing as a wisecracking head; the two will banter continuously throughout the stages, and there's no shortage of random gags. Most of the characters are real gems as well, including Juliet's badass zombie-hunting sisters and the consistently entertaining zombie rock gods. The voice acting is also quite memorable, with Juliet being voiced by the well-known Tara Strong (Rugrats, Powerpuff Girls, Princess Mononoke, Teen Titans) and Michael Rosenbaum (Smallville, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Batman Beyond) as Nick. The storyline, despite its absurdity, also comes together as something surely to develop into a major cult classic (I particularly liked the concept of the universe being split into three realms, and the explanation of the zombies escaping from the \"Rotten World\").As I said at the very beginning, this game is indeed a total spectacle, dedicated to blissful fun and entertainment, and that's what has to be understood from the get-go. Its sole purpose is to entertain and bewilder, and that it does very well. This game is designed for laughter and cheap thrills, of which it does offer many. Although it's arguably shorter and occasionally clunkier than it should be, it's such a wild, glitzy ride that it really has to be experienced by most gamers. I'm anticipating a big cult following and a great deal of cosplay inspiration to come. Who knew lollipops and chainsaws were such a nice match?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2012"}

Couse \"darkman1969\"","summary":"Quit using the F bomb already!","reviewText":"OK.  So here is the deal.  I'm a gamer.  I'm an older gamer that now has kids that like to game.  Yes, we have several family friendly games, and then we have some M rated games like COD.  So I expect violence and a fair share of it when I play it.  What really throws me for a loop is the amount of profanity in the game.  Yes, I know it is disclosed on the box and that way parents can make an \"informed\" decision.  I'm starting to think now that I would like to see how many times a specific profanity word is used. Parents let me tell you, in this game, the F bomb is used a lot.  Enough to catch my attention and I've used it a fair amount in my earlier days.So bash me all you want about letting my 14 year old see this kind of violence and yet I'm worried about the language.  Actually, I think most kids understand that the violence they see on screen is completely fake and doesn't translate into the real world.  Let's give our kids some credit for that.  Words, however, are a different story.  That language is used by some everyday and not used by others.  However, the constant repetition of the F bomb, over and over is completely over the top and useless in the game.  It adds absolutely nothing to the story.  Zero.From a game standpoint, it is a decent game.  Graphics are good, AI seems to a bit more difficult and you get thrown into a lot of different situations rather than just being boots on the ground.  It was however, a little difficult to follow along with what was actually playing out.So my plea to developers is if you can have an option to tone down the violence (gore, etc), do the same for the language.  It can't be that hard to program in.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2011"}

And most of the time you CANNOT SKIP THEM.  They are at the beginning of each missing, in the missions, every chance they get - another cut scene.  At least give me the chance to skip them EVERY TIME - and not just on rare occassion.  Sorry, but because of that, 1 star.  Without that, the game is probably 3.5 star.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}
