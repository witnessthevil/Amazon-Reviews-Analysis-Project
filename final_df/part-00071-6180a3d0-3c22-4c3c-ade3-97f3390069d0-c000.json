{"product_name":"B0050SYZ2G","description":"","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"A surprisingly mediocre follow up to an all-time classic","reviewText":"It really pains me to write this review, because I was a hugely vocal fan of the original Kinect Sports. In fact, it was the game that convinced me to buy an Xbox 360. In many ways it was the perfect showcase for the Kinect's potential for virtual reality and video game exercise.The best analogy I can come up with for Kinect Sports Season Two is that Kinect Sports Season Two is to the original as the movie The Matrix Reloaded is to The Matrix. On its own merits it's not a horrible game, but when compared to the iconic original there's just something really lacking.Much of the feel of Kinect Sports Season Two is carried over the original, for better and worse. The graphics are still cartoony and your Kinect avatar is still there. There's still a loud and exuberant announcer with a quasi-European accent. After gameplay, you're still treated to videos of yourself looking silly.There are some interesting improvements. For all the sports you have the option of competing as a single player against the Xbox, head-to-head against another human, or online through Xbox Live. There's also a mini-game associated with each sport.What's completely different, of course, is that there are six new sports. Some of them are excellent, others not so much so. I'll provide my take on each.1) FOOTBALL: This is a \"simulation\" of American football. I put the word simulation in quotation marks because this isn't exactly John Madden Football.You start out by receiving an opening kick. There's no challenge in this, you just raise your hand when you're ready to receive it. Then you run in place as opponents try to tackle you. Oddly, there's no way to break nor block tackles--you just keep running in place as fast as you can until someone takes you down (In fact, I found just flailing my arms was good enough).Whoever designed the game either didn't understand or decided to take liberties with the rules of football. In real football, you try to advance 10 yards in four downs by rushing or passing. In this game, there's no rushing, only passing. And you have to move down the whole field in four downs and score a touchdown or a field goal.In order to pass, you need to choose a play from a \"playbook\" (or have the coach call it). The \"plays\" are all simple patterns that all end up with one receiver to your left, one in front of you, and one to your right.To start play, you're brought to a screen where you're the quarterback in back of your offensive line. You need to crouch down and then jump up (or say \"Ready, Hike\") to receive the snap. When a little green icon appears over one of the three receivers' heads, you need to make a passing motion with your arm in that receiver's direction. Time it right, and you make a completion. Once that happens, you run in place at breakneck speed again to try to gain more yardage.Once you score or if there's a turnover on \"downs\", the system will simulate your opponent's drive (you don't play defense). The opponent will either score or punt, and then it's your turn again. Score more than your opponent and you win the game.All and all, I thought the game was fun enough, and all that running in place was certainly good exercise. But there was just so much potential lost. At the end of the day, this was a game that really didn't use the Kinect's capabilities as well as it could have to come close to simulating the real sport, whether it was letting you catch a football, evade a tackle, run a pattern, or throw a football in something other than three general directions. I give the football portion 3.5 of 5 stars for fun, but it could easily have been more.2) BASEBALL: In this game, you play offense and defense in a quick baseball game.To bat, you stand with your side to the TV, and assume a batting stance. A ball is pitched toward you, and you swing an imaginary bat. If you make contact and hit a single you have to run in place as fast as you can (but strangely, this isn't needed if you hit a double, triple, or home run). Worse, whether you run fast or slow it doesn't seem to affect the speed of the on-screen player. In another case where the game developer clearly didn't understand the rules of baseball, you have to slide into first base (this doesn't happen in real baseball).To pitch, you make a throwing action towards the TV. There are two types of pitches, a fastball (where you make a throwing action to the TV) and a curveball (where you make a throwing action across your chest. You can control the speed of the pitch by how fast your arm movement is. There's no defense or fielding, except in the case where a batter hits a fly ball directly to one of your players, in which case the player reaches his left arm out and catches the ball (seemingly in the same place each time, again not much of a challenge).Sadly, I found playing baseball in this game to be a bit tedious and contrived. In some ways, the game shows the limitations of the Kinect; while the Kinect excels in games that require full body motion detection such as dancing games, it's at a bit of a disadvantage to systems like the Wii and PS3 for games that simulate holding an object like a sword or a bat (where the game needs to detect things like speed, angle and torque). The Kinect is certainly capable of this (all a developer needs to do is have the player hold a stick), but unfortunately we don't see it in Kinect Sports Season Two.Overall, baseball gets an unfortunate 2 of 5 stars from me, although again the running in place gives some decent exercise.3) DARTS: This is where things start to turn around a bit. You start out by telling the Xbox where your TV is--above your head, at face level, or below.From there, you're treated to a pretty realistic game of darts. To play, you hold your hand up as if you're holding a dart. A \"cross hair\" will appear on screen corresponding to your hand (and it's extremely sensitive). You \"aim\" your dart by moving your hand back, and you release it by moving your hand forward. The ensuing action feels much like genuine darts.The rules are traditional. You start with 501 points and need to get down to exactly zero by scoring points on the dart board, which are subtracted from your point total. Some parts of the dartboard are worth more than others. In you find this a bit confusing don't worry--the program tells you exactly which part of the board you should be aiming for.I'd say the overall feel of this game is excellent and really feels like real darts at times. Although I won't lie--there were some times when I'd be thrusting my hand forward and the system didn't even recognize me, or worse, causing my shot to go awry. I never really felt in 100% control of the dart as I would be in real life. Still, this one is 4 out of 5 for fun for being a realistic simulation.4) GOLF: Here you can choose a 9 hole, 3 hole, or 1 hole competition. You choose different courses. To play, you stand with your side to the TV. Aiming your shot is extremely non-intuitive--you need to step forward or back to pivot your character's aim. And you really have no context with which to swing.As for the swing, as long as you pull back and swing with one fluid motion, the game will let it fly, even if your actual technique is horrible or non-existent. Overall, I think the same gripe with golf that I have about baseball (and which I'll have later about tennis). Since you're not holding a controller, the Xbox will just interpret any wild swing you make with your hands as a swing. Sadly, I didn't find golf very realistic; in fact, if you're not careful it had the potential to ruin a real golf swing. The golf game here may appeal to very casual players who have never picked up a golf ball, but otherwise is forgettable. 2 of 5 stars.5) SKIING: This one was a bright spot. The only other video game skiing I've done has been in games like Wii Fit Plus and We Ski which use the Wii Balance Board. In all those games, the balance board was just too sensitive and inaccurate to simulate skiing. With Kinect Sports Season Two, your body is the controller. To pass through gates, you lean to the side. To build speed, you crouch and lean forward. When you see a green zone, you jump to earn points.Overall, this was a game that truly showed what the Kinect is capable of. 5 of 5 stars.6) TENNIS: Finally, we come to Tennis. Again, with the Kinect's potential, you'd think that a tennis game would allow you a lot of great simulation--the ability to serve and volley, the ability to chase down shots, and so on.But sadly, your range of actions is again extremely limited to serving, basic backhand, basic forehand, and no running or volleying. Even your swing speed doesn't seem to make a difference. About the most complex it gets is hitting a slice (or as they describe it \"slowing the ball down\") by swinging your arms from high to low. And as I said, there's something \"missing\" when playing without a controller or at least a prop in your hand so the system could detect racquet angle, type of shot, etc. Without these things, I'd give Tennis 3 of 5 stars.To sum up, I'd give Kinect Sports Season Two a solid 3.5 stars (which on Amazon I'll round up to 4). It has some very bright spots and carries over much of what made its predecessor successful. But there just seems to be a lot of missed opportunity as far as innovation and pushing the platform and the series forward goes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2011"}

{"product_name":"B006MBZZSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Christopher Engel","summary":"Mostly an improvement over the original, but not in every respect","reviewText":"Mk2 is certainly a whole lot different from the original, in large part due to its M rating, completely redone battle system, 3D models to replace animated 2D ones during story sequences, more content, more endings, and generally, a lot more stuff.Mk2 can be summed up very quickly to compare to its predecessor, as both are founded on the same premise: A metaphor for the console war between Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, along with the ever-increasing threat of piracy from Arfoire (get it? R4?). The game was designed to be totally off-the-wall. The original was very entertaining in that the writing was superb, and very funny, constantly jabbing at parts of the video game industry combined with a multitude of breaks with the fourth wall, with the characters essentially knowing they're part of an RPG. You played not really for the fights or even the main story as much as you wanted to see whatever they could come up with next to parody, as they touched on virtually everything in the game industry. The whole thing was about humor, and to some extent, fanservice and flash. It was T-rated fanservice, sure, but it was fun, and the battle system, while very simple, was well-crafted and left room for creativity.Mk2 is kind of like the original to the power of three. This game takes the original premise and runs the whole field with it. The opening sequence alone shows you why this game has an M rating, with less-than-subtle erotic animation of the scantily-clad CPUs in erotic bondage poses, complete with Gainax boob-bouncing and some extreme sexual innuendo.Oh, yeah, about that sexual innuendo. I'll say it right out: A *lot* of it has to do with lolis, and there is no ambiguity about that whatsoever. You'll even find quests in which your job is to find ingredients for a team to make potions that will create, and this is a quote from the game itself, \"lolis with big knockers\". While the original kept its T rating intact, Mk2 throws all pretense out, complete with borderline-illegal loli fanservice. They don't even try to cover up that it's loli by saying they're older than they really look, which is what developers often do. One of the main villains is obsessed with Lowee's (the Wii's area) two CPU Candidates, Ram and Rom, who are two very small, young girls, one being exceptionally shy and timid, the other a little less so.And when I say this particular villain is obsessed with these two lolis, I mean he flat-out says he wants to molest, lick, play with sexually, and possibly rape them. There's even a reference to his being a \"cunning linguist\", and he states clearly that he doesn't accept anyone who is past puberty. Further, some of this he even does, clearly getting off on it while the two girls are sickened. He raves nonstop of his completely unrestrained pedophilia, which isn't the slightest bit censored (hello, M rating!).Oh, and here's icing on the cake about Ram and Rom: One of the endings involves an event that I literally didn't think they would go through with. I thought there had to be some way to get around what they were insinuating what was going to happen to both of them. I thought that to show that kind of thing was simply illegal. Apparently not, since the entire scene plays out without holding back in the slightest. It *will* make you at least a little uneasy as it plays out, especially because this particular scene does not involve any humor whatsoever, but tragedy and horror--it's meant to stir your emotions in ways almost all media doesn't dare. This particular tragedy is something I thought could not be shown in video games, or practically any type of media. I was floored that they went through with the scene, and further floored *when things just keep getting worse when you think they can't possibly get any worse*.One major drawback that immediately turned me off was that the amount of voice acting has diminished very significantly. While they thankfully brought back all the VAs from the previous game, who all did a spectacular job in their roles, it seems random as to what scenes get voiced or not. Many scenes, even critical story scenes, do not have voice-overs, which is downright puzzling, and it definitely detracts from the scenes. The original included nearly every story sequence having voice acting, but here, even story sequences often don't get any. It's pretty lame. Still, the quality's there.In terms of humor, you can tell it's not quite as inspired as the first. It has its moments, for sure, and it gets a lot of those moments by pushing the boundaries. Sometimes it even goes for very dark humor. There's about five times as much sexual humor, but it's done in a way in which the characters on-screen are typically unhappy to be shown on your television screen that way, with several sequences where the fourth wall is broken--not only is it broken, but another character announces that things must be getting bad, because the fourth wall was just broken, as she announces. The original generally had better writing, in no small part because Neptune was designed to be humorous, but our CPU Candidate here, the main character Nepgear, has no sense of humor at all, and most jokes are at her expense. But it still doesn't work the way Neptune really drove the story for us in the original, and Nepgear isn't as entertaining as Neptune was.This is, however, mostly a typical RPG, and you may need to grind as well as farm to complete quests. There are two types of quests outside of the story, and two only: Collect a certain number of items, or defeat a particular enemy or enemies. Drop rates do apply, so you may slay five of the enemy who have a chance of dropping the item you need, and yet still, sometimes none will drop at all. Most mechanics in the game are typical RPG-fare, although it's still done well. It's great that enemies are visible on the map, so you can dodge as many as you want, should you choose to, which is particularly helpful if all you're doing is going around gathering herbs or something, or looking for a very specific enemy. The combat system, while more entertaining than the first, isn't quite right in that the transformations are now totally worthless, their cost far outweighing the benefits involved. Costing a whopping 100 SP to transform at all with a serious drain on the gauge every turn you're transformed, you're almost always better off spending it on a special move in your normal form. The only time you can really use your transformations is if you've saved up SP in a single dungeon before a boss fight, but even then, at some point in the game you will acquire a skill that involves all four party members doing a team move that will almost always be a one-hit kill or very close to one, even for late-game bosses. If you combine this skill with the True Goddess Aegis item that removes the damage cap to above 9999, the damage is often around 30,000 per hit...for 15 hits every time you use this skill, which will be instantaneous death to any enemy you come across, bar none. It's a sure-fire way to win any fight if you prepare ahead of time with 100 SP to spare for all of your characters at the beginning of every fight.I think I've touched on the most important parts: Fanservice in this game has gone to level 11, warranting very well its M rating, particularly with the clearly pedophilic recurring side-antagonist openly sexually harassing and sometimes abusing the two youngest CPU Candidates, Ram and Rom, who look to be maybe nine or ten years old each. The game pushes its concept even further than the first, although not always with success, as it's just not quite as funny.One final note I'd like to make is that the developers has included a somewhat difficult-to-obtain and surprisingly lengthy bonus chapter immediately before the final boss. This chapter isn't exactly difficult to unlock since the conditions are fairly straightforward, and you can even wait until almost the very end of the game to meet the requirements, but it's definitely time-consuming, and if you're not going for it, there's no way you'll accidentally get it. However, know that if you choose to unlock this new chapter, get ready for a complete and total 180 in the mood. What was once a game based in humor is now based in raw, unrestrained tragedy, one that does not follow the rules of this kind of thing. The game will suddenly become horrifically dark, and words can't describe the sheer shock value of some of the things that happen during this replacement ending chapter. To describe it without spoilers is impossible, since the entire story suddenly takes a new turn, and any mention of any event, even hinting at it, would spoil it. Let's just say you're in for a hell of a depressing ending beyond all measure should you choose this route. We're talking witnessing children suffering violently (complete with English voice-overs that somehow make it worse, considering the manga theme), suicide, forced murder, mass murder, one particular character smiling and asking you to kill her (considering the importance of this character and how familiar you are with her and her story by now, this scene is just shocking), cries for help that only end in slow, drawn-out tragedy, and plenty more you simply will not expect in a million years in a game like this. The scene when a particular character takes you outside to make pleasant small talk while you're already in a traumatized state from the events unfolding, and then casually smiles and asks you to kill her so she doesn't have to do it herself, along with everything that follows, will blow your mind to hell and back.So, there you go. It's worth it, for sure, if the premise interests you, no question. It tops the first in almost all aspects, and is an excellent successor.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2012"}

This game ain't any crap like get a shotgun and blow someone away, but timing, patience and skill. Sometimes it CAN get very frustrating when there are a bunch of guys with cleavers chasing you for miles and all you have is a plastic bag.But now to the good stuff. This game got the hype from video game magazines and video game stuff BUT I never saw any warnings in the papers of this game like they do to Grand Theft Auto. Don't get me wrong, this game is violent in a fun way. Thats why fun is 5 stars, but it ain't as popular as Grand theft Auto, so nervous parents aren't calling the government to try to stop violent video games, even though it's the same company. Well, whatever...You are a guy named Cash and they have killed you. This director guy is taping you, and you are the next \"target\" in the brutal blood sport of Carcer City. So he puts you in the middle of nowhere with a paper bag and tells to go kill the people trying to kill you. Sounds like a useless, no plotted horror movie where people go around wasting each other, or is it???It is actually a somewhat stealth game, (This ain't no SOCOM), and you must hide from the killers trying to kill you. If you are stealthy enough to sneak up on the fool with an axe, you will get a more \"bloody\" kill then if you ran up to him screaming like a idiot. The better you sneak up, then you may do a \"combo\" with the axe instead of just chopping him. But as in all games, as the levels get harder, you ain't worried about that and more worried about running away and not getting brutally murdered.Now this game was kind of good, and it's not for little kids who throw up when they scrape their arm, but any age group from 14 UP can handle the gore. Just watch an old horror movie, this will look like nothing. But this game is good for ONCE and ONCE ONLY. If they make another game where you go around killing murderers for sport again, it will be horrible and even more stupid then they almost made this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2004"}

I could care less about a story. You want a good story watch a movie or read a book. So I wasn't bothered much by the fact that the game has a terrible story.The graphics though are impressive. Very slick. Good lighting, textures and particle effects. Some of the rocks formations that should have a rough flat texture appeared as glossy plastic though and some of the textures were repetitious, but that is forgivable.The gameplay is ok. The game is supposed to be focused on the use of the glaive though I found it difficult to use and underpowered. 9 times out of 10 I was walking around with the shotgun.The controls are terrible! This is what really did it in for me! They are terrible. Using the sixaxis for controlling the motion of the glaive is pointless. A novel idea but ineffective. What I found worked best was to use the analog stick. Unfortunately I couldn't always use it. For some reason half of the time I was forced by the game to use the motion detection of the sixaxis.Second beef with the controls is when enemies get too close and latch on, you have to shake the sixaxis to get them off. The sixaxis motion control is a wii rip off and is pointless. I wish developers would stop using it. Then once you shake the enemy off it's near impossible to aim at them to shot. Shooting from the hip never seems to hit them and even if you are pointed right at them and you zoom in for a shot the camera angle always sets you looking away from the target. By the time you get a shot off you are dead or seriously hurting.Last but not least, consistency. This was ok. The game got progressively more difficult and seemed to keep the same level of quality throughout the game, until the final boss battle. WTF??? The game jumped from hard difficulty to Extreme Ridiculously Hard. It was like one last slap in the face by the developers. Nice guys.Bottom-line, it's worth $20 that it's selling for. Not much more though.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"The Duck of Indeed","summary":"The Nintendo 64","reviewText":"The Nintendo 64 is a lot of fun, and it is well-made, too.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"bone thug! \"gaming/wrestling fan\"","summary":"Great RPG even though I'm not a Starwars fan","reviewText":"People are complaining about the attack system, it's an RPG like Final Fantasy.

Bringing together both the hack 'n' slash nature of those games, along with the loot and more, they've made an RPG that is more in the vein of Dragon Age: Origins. Not only does Lord of the Rings: War in the North successfully pull off the Lord of the Rings universe with aplomb, it is a fantastic RPG for even gamers that don't care about Lord of the Rings.Pros:- Beautifully Detailed - This game won't blow you away on a technical level, but the small details matter and they're so well done. You feel like you're in the Lord of the Rings universe and have control of events instead of living through a linear, more traditional gameplay experience. Character models are decently rendered, but the environments shine and look great. The rain effect is really nice and you'll see rain on your character when he walks outside.- Loot Galore - Similar to Snowblind's previous games, Lord of the Rings: War in the North has a lot to collect. Any loot addicts will be satisfied with this game.- RPG Perfection - As I already mentioned, you'll be looting a lot in this game, but it also has dialog trees, skills, etc. It's a true RPG, not merely an action game.- Superb Audio - Both the voice acting and soundtrack are grade A stuff. \"Epic\" is the right word.- Fun Combat - It's both fluid and enjoyable. The combat is simple and doesn't have much depth, however it's still very good.Cons:- Some Small Hiccups - There are a few graphical oddities and such, however it's all pretty minor and nothing to be concerned about.This is the Lord of the Rings game you've been waiting for. If you're an RPG fan that was disappointed in Dragon Age 2, Lord of the Rings: War in the North is definitely for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"J. Shafer","summary":"Overpriced and overhyped pile of mediocrity","reviewText":"ODST begins sometime during the events of Halo 2 when the Covenant are attacking the city of New Mombasa.  A squad of ODSTs are sent to drop into the heat of battle and help with the defense of the city.  Before they know what happens, a Coevenant ship goes into slip-space, causing a massive shock wave throughout the sky and sending the ODSTs everywhere.  You, the rookie, immediately get knocked out upon landing and wake up 6 hours later in a partially ruined city with Covenant running about.  Its up to you to find your squad and find out what happened.The title basically says everything about my opinion on this game.  The price is too high, the game was overhyped, and in return it gives so little which in the end is not that great as everyone is making it out to be.  The campaign is about the proper length for a game, but thats assuming what difficulty your on and if your doing this on co-op.  I went through on Heroic (second highest difficulty) by myself and it took me around 8-10 hours to beat.  I later went through on Legendary (hardest difficulty) with 3 other people and blew through the campaign in less than 3 hours and it was just patheticly easy compared to the somewhat hard time I had by myself.  In fact the campaign could have been shortened if the free-roam was taken out.  During the free-roam section, you play as the rookie and walk around to initiate missions where you flashback to what happened during the 6 hours the rookie was gone and play as one of your fellow soldiers.  The fact that the rookie basically does nothing until the end undermines the entire character and making him serve no real purpose at all.  You could have just thrown a few more cut-scenes in instead of the free-roam aspect and you would have had the same game.  The free-roam sections arent that great ethier and theres hardly any collectiables (30) to find at all.The real selling point for this game was the new firefight mode which is basically Horde from Gears of War 2 with a Halo skin slapped on, but with a few tweaks.  Its just you with up to 3 other people against an unlimited amount of enemies untill the party loses all of their lives.  While it was fun at first, a few things started to take away any shred of fun this might have had.  First off, theres no matchmaking.  If you play it by yourself, it becomes incredibly boring very fast, so your forced to find other people to play if.  If you have no one else to play with, your basically screwed, because it would have been so hard on Bungies part to add matchmaking in.  Another problem are the skulls.  What the skulls do is just add another effect to the enemies to make them stronger, like double health or the ability to dodge grenades better, but the two that ruin this game are catch and black eye.  As described by the game, catch makes the enemies \"love to throw grenades.\"  You could have said \"overly infatuated with\" and it still wouldnt be an acurate description because once its turned on, I cant even walk 2 feet before 20 grenades are in my face.  It makes fighting back harder because it feels like im running through a mine field.  The skull black eye makes it so that you have to melee to get your \"shield\" back.  If you want to win this game, you have to play smart, and running into a large group of enemies mass spamming grenades at you just so you can punch someone 5 times to get your \"shield\" back is not a smart idea.  Also you cant turn any of the skulls off which makes it even more annoying and they never turn on at random which makes the game predictable and boring.The game could have also had around [...] taken off if the Halo 3 multiplayer didnt come with it.  Yeah, because I bought this game in order to play an entirely different one.  It requires you have live in order to play it so if you dont have live, your screwed over again, but the fact still remains that this extra disk was basically pointless.  Instead of adding more content to the game I want to play, they tack on something else that I dont want while simultaniously smacking anyone in the face if they bought all of the halo 3 map packs before this.If your thinking about getting this game, wait for a price drop because it is not worth [...] and instead should be 30 to 40 at the most.  Your better off just renting it for the weekend for [...]instead because this game has little replay value to it ethier and any that it might have had gets ruined by firefight.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2009"}
{"product_name":"B003Q9RG9K","description":"","reviewerName":"Allen Tran \"SOPA & NDAA D=\"","summary":"Excellent VC game for the PSP","reviewText":"I brought a newer version of the PSP just for this game, and it was worth it.COMBAT:The combat is very much the same the same as the first game. You get command points that lets you move your pawns -- five CP, five moves. Action points are associated with CP, with the first move, your pawn will have full motion, after each CP is spent on the same pawn, they will have less AP/mobility. By pawns, I mean soldiers.It is turn-by-turn in a sense, but a single turn can end the battle. If waiting for the AI to move is painful, you can change the enemy's turn speed to NORMAL or FAST or INSTANT. I recommend FAST, it will shave hours off your game time. INSTANT provides very little enemy detail and will keep you on your toes.Units have few (cover) options -- being out in the open, up in the rarely found guard towers, hiding in grass, taking cover behind sandbags, or moving the armored vehicle around as a shield.The combat is based off range, weaponry, perks/potentials, cover, and (weather) conditions. You shoot the enemy, if they're still standing, then they'll shoot back. Sometimes you'll duck or they'll duck. Usually only ACES or ELITES duck, and that's if you're facing them head-on. Explosives will not induce return fire, but any movement afterward the attack will.Moving in the enemy's weapon range and view will get you caught in suppressive fire, this rule applies to the enemy as well if they're caught in your unit's vision/weapon range on their turn to move.CUSTOMIZATION:You can adjust just about anything, here's a listMain character's class (Scout, Shock Trooper, Engineer, Lancer, Armored Technician)Soldier development, like Scout to Sniper to Anti-Tank Sniper.Perks/PotentialsTank/APCWeaponsUnits that will go out (Groups/Deployment)The only problem is, when doing escort missions, you get an APC suited to the difficulty level. So the millions of dollars you've spent on that super-duper-devastating APC will be moot.STORY:The story didn't wow me. It's pretty easy to figure out since I've played VC I and I'm accustomed to Japanese genericnism. Punks to heroes. Twists and turns. Nothing mind blowing.But, the character scenes are fun to watch and each character has a back story and special mission that'll unlock new potentials/perks and bring the unit to be more friendly with AVAN, your main character.Sadly Notable Things:Shock Troopers are extremely devastating if you're using them. The maps are smaller in VC II than the first one, so the limited AP isn't so limited anymore. With a COMMANDO, a high-end Shock Trooper, you can easily capture a enemy base camp with a few CP. The flamethrower is devastating, it'll go right through cover and roast doggy-guarding units covering a camp. Sometimes the AI will stack five scouts to defend a camp, a flamethrower will kill them all, allowing you to take the camp with ease.Gunners are quite useless. Their range is far too wide and when the enemy uses them it's a miracle if a bullet hits you. Strangely enough, after switching the AI turn speed to FAST, their gunners became much more effective when attacking. The redeeming point of gunners is to defend camps/POI, they have a 50-shot clip and their range is condensed into heavily suppressive fire.Engineers are a joke. Spend enough on your tank's armor and you won't need them. Later in the game, the only units capable of damaging an upgraded tank are the same units that can easily-EASILY kill an engineer within moments. Then, if you do use engineers enough, they can play musical instruments or medics. But. They're still so weak/worthless that anyone can take them out.Armored Techs are quite worthless, but when at their peak... They're devastating. I have one that's at the end of the upgrade chain. Apparently it has 600-something damage for its attacks. Yeah. Insane.Scouts are... okay. I never really used them until I got them juiced up with gear, but they're weak in attack/defense. But great in mobility. Doesn't matter if they die so easily though.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"S. Posey","summary":"The Best Batman Game If Not Best Comic Game Ever Made","reviewText":"Batman - The Caped Crusader, The Dark Knight, Bruce Wayne...he has many names, but no good video games. Sure, games have been created in the vain attempt to capitalize off of a movie or during a comic book resurgence period, but rarely did these games ever amount to anything more than a filler Christmas game that a loved one can get for the gamer in their life. With the recent release of \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\", Rocksteady went out on a limb to create something we have rarely seen this generation of games, a good comic book game. Would their attempts at recreating the Dark Knight go off without a hitch or would The Batman be destined for video game failure?Before looking at the game, you need to look at the source. Batman: Arkham Asylum takes place in, you guessed it, Arkham Asylum. The Elizabeth Arkham Asylum for the Criminally Insane was first published in a comic in 1974 with Batman #258. Back then it was considered \"Arkham Hospital\" and it wasn't until 1989 when Grant Morrison and Dave McKean wrote \"Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth\" that it took on it's extremely dark counterpart that we see in the video game. Arkham is where most of Batman's bad guys go when they are too dangerous, both to themselves and others, to house in a normal facility. At times, Batman himself flirts with thoughts that he too many be insane, he does wear a Bat costume as Joker points out. It's this source material that the developers at Rocksteady went out to reproduce. By talking with the creators of the comics and by doing extensive reading on their own part, I can say without a shadow of a doubt that they nailed it. The world, the characters...everything! They nailed it and they did it flawlessly. If they would have botched the environment the game took place in, they would have lost a lot of the credibility that the game was going for. By appealing to hardcore Batman fans like myself, as well as newcomers to the series who may not know much about the history, they were able to create a world that you don't need to have any history with to succeed, but if you do, good for you. With the environment taken care of, the developers then had to get another critical aspect of the universe right...the story.Batman, after subduing Joker in a battle somewhere in Gotham, throws him in the Batmobile and takes him to Arkham to be locked up. When he arrives, he is greeted by Police Commissioner Gordon and the staff of Arkham Asylum. As you progress through the halls to Joker's lockup area, you're treated to Joker's ramblings and muses mostly directed at you. With any Batman novel or video game, you know things will eventually have to go wrong, and they do. Joker escapes and you are left alone to fend for yourself in a place that hates and fears the Batman. Joker will eventually enlist the help of some of Batman's more famous foes - Poison Ivy, Harley Quinn, Bane, Killer Croc, Scarecrow, and others. With their help, Joker plans to completely overrun the facility and finally break \"The Bat\" along the way. It's left up to you to make sure this doesn't happen and that all patients are returned to their cells and subdued.The story is straight out of a comic and the developers did a wonderful job translating it to a game. The pacing is perfect and you really are left guessing what the heck could happen next. Another thing straight out of the comic is the gameplay/fighting. Batman is a master of hand to hand combat. Having trained in China and with Special Forces, he has learned to harness the power of his body to act as a sort of weapon. Batman never uses guns and despises them so don't expect to be walking into a room guns blazing. You're going to have to wait for the Punisher to come out with a good game before that can happen. Combat is handles in two distinct ways in the game. Hand to hand mode occurs when you want to get up in guy's faces and just take them down through brute force. Since Batman is a master of martial arts, feel free to take down 8-12 enemies at a time without breaking a sweat. You can't focus all of your attention on one baddy though. You need to seamlessly move from one enemy to the next, knocking them around and making sure you don't get hit from behind. In the beginning of the game this is really simple, but as lead pipes and tasers are introduced to the mix, you'll find that additional strategy is needed to really be successful with the hand to hand mechanics. The other gameplay mechanic is the invisible predator mode. This is a flashy name for stealth in Arkham Asylum. Batman has something that is called Detective Vision. When you turn this on, you can see an outline of all enemies in your vicinity as well as some other features that allow you to solve puzzles. The color coded enemies represent the different types - those without guns, and those with. Whenever you encounter enemies with guns you have to approach the situation in a totally different way that before. Arkham Asylum is littered with gargoyle heads throughout it's halls and these will act as your perches to spy and slip around the room unknown. Always begin each fight by watching the enemies' movements and then making a move, because one false step will almost always mean death. A couple blows from a machine gun will kill Batman if you're not careful. Batman is able to glide from the rafters, throw batarangs at enemies, and through upgrades, perform moves that will never get old no matter how many times you do them. The developers really put a lot of time into the fighting mechanics of the game and it shows. Batman is a badass, and you are going to love playing as him.You may have noticed that I don't have anything negative to say about the game. It's true, the game is really good, but it does have a couple down points that deserve mentioning for all fairness. Detective Mode, which incredibly useful, is also a downpoint of the game. It's really easy to use detective mode way too much and end up missing a lot of the cool atmospheric details. Crumbling walls, blood splatters on the wall, and ivy's vines climbing slowly up a prison wall can all be missed if you're too busy in detective vision mode. Sometimes it almost feels cheap to use it constantly and you may find yourself purposefully turning it off from time to time. I'm not sure how they could have done it any better, but it is a shame that you will miss certain things because of it. Another downpoint of the game is the villains. Sure, I love me some Killer Croc and Scarecrow, but what about the other big names? My personal favorite baddy in the Batman Rogue's gallery is Two Face. You'll walk by his cell, but he's no where to be found. Same with Penguin, you'll see a poster with him on it, but he's nowhere to be found. Harley Quinn is necessary for the story and she used to be an employee at Arkham, so I can see while she is there, but Victor Zsasz? I feel like more enemies should have made an appearance. I mean, the prison was taken over and nobody escaped off of the island, so they were somewhere there. Shouldn't I have come across them? Eh, it's not a big complaint, and hopefully we'll see them in the possibly sequel.It's easy to assume that Batman Arkham Asylum is going to be a cheap gimmick of a game that is feeding off of the license of the Batman franchise. We've almost come to expect that this sort of thing is an industry norm. But don't be fooled by such thinking. Batman Arkham Asylum is a masterfully crafted game that will amaze you with the depth of it's story and the careful execution of it's gameplay. There's a lot of game here, most of which I didn't even get to talk about in this short review. From the Riddler Trophies that are scattered around the world to collect and earn experience to the audio files you can find for each prison inmate describing their first days within Arkham, collectors beware...you will become obsessed. So, the real reason you're reading this review...should you get this game? My honest answer is a whole hearted yes. It's the best comic book video game I have ever played and one of my top games of 2009. You can tell the developers really took the time and effort to make the game world come to life. It's dark, it's gritty, and at times really difficult, but not past the means of enjoyment. When you finish the game and collect all of the Riddler trophies, there's even more game left to complete. Challenge Rooms exist outside of the main story to let you complete objectives within time frames and point totals to get on leaderboards. It's a nice touch and adds to the game's value. So, even if you aren't a fan of Batman or comics in general, you'll still get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. If you're looking to learn more about Batman or get into the comic, this is a great place to start. The lore is all here and you will certainly learn a lot along the way. I can't wait to see what Rocksteady do with the sequal to this game. The sky is literally the limit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2010"}

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"A Far Cry From Paradise","reviewText":"A lot has happened to First Person Shooters in 12 years. We've gone from the \"3D\" mazes of Hell on Earth to the 3D rendered parody of 1960's Europe, from two dimensional Nazis shouting \"Halt\" to intricate threats against Gordon Freeman between textured Marines. To be honest, things have threatened to run out of steam more than once.After about three years of sequelitis, rehash rash, and multiplayer madness in the market, a studio comes out of left field with a solid, semi-original solo shooter salve.*Far Cry* by German developers Crytek plays like a million straight-to-video adventure movies starring Stephen Baldwin. It has a cheesy plot and bad acting. But its graphic engine alone demonstrates a bigger budget and longer running time than all those videos combined. It comes with an army of mercenaries, monsters, and attack helicopters strung across a Micronesian archipelago once occupied by the Japanese military.*Far Cry* steals from the best. It has the basic plot and human foes of *Half-Life*; the creepy textures and hideous beasts of* Doom II*; the weapons of the *Rainbow Six* series; the silly dialogue of *No One Lives Forever*; the tactical sensibility of *Call of Duty*; and the heroine, sidekick, and villain of *Red Faction*. Every step the character takes stirs echoes of the great titles upon whose shoulders *Far Cry* stands.It stands alongside *NOLF2*, *AvP2* and *Half-Life* as one of the few titles I've played where I needed to use most of the hardware I came across; *FC* also limits the player's inventory to a marginally more realistic set of four weapon slots, plus 6 grenades of each type and unlimited rocks. The suppressed MP5 is actually suppressed and was invaluable for stealth kills. The Pancor proved an unparalleled close-quarters killer. Grenades did a decent job of killing or stunning roomfuls of enemies. Only the rocket launcher seemed wasted, its rockets far too slow to sink boats or knock helicopters out of the sky.Helicopters, mercenaries, and monsters alike do their best not to be at the receiving end of your barrels. Hit location, helmets, and body armor forces players to make head shots. The enemy strafes, ducks, leaps, and chucks grenades. Through my binoculars and sniper scope, I have seen guards wave distant allies for help, activate alarms, and shout warnings when they see a comrade fall or hear suspicious noises. More than once, I have sniped a fixed machine gunner only to be blindsided when a hidden guard ran up and seized the weapon.However challenging *FC's* enemies, most are not too difficult to beat. Even before the game was released, it picked up a reputation for cheating AI and poor player character fire control. This rep has been spread by some players since, and is absolute nonsense at least on \"Medium\" mode. If one tries to play in the style of *Quake* or *Painkiller*, yes it is very difficult to survive all the enemy fire when you foolishly charge down the beaten path with guns blazing. If one uses the lush and smart level design for cover and concealment, scouting the area well with binoculars and \"cry vision\" goggles, and then luring the enemy into choke points or picking them off at long range, then one will win. Contrary to some claims, the enemy couldn't spot me a hundred yards away and pick me off the instant I peeked around the corner. I was often able to sneak around enemies or snipe them before they could rush my position.It's a testament to the great realism of this game (aside from the mutants); players who grow complacent and wander around dirt trails will be killed, while players who crawl through the brush will survive. And what brush: *FC* has hands down the best level design since... well, uh... ever. Aside from the multiple paths available in many areas, every room, glade, and pool of water drips with atmosphere. And rust. Lots of rust. And stains and steam and sunbeams. Paradise may have gone wrong, but it looks right.Not everything is right about *Far Cry*-the only game to get close to everything right was *Half-Life* and innovations since then eclipse that title. *FC* has separate key bindings for selecting and throwing grenades, an invaluable feature showcased in *Max Payne 2* which allows the player to chuck without deselecting their primary weapon and leaving themselves vulnerable to an enemy charge. Players can crouch, drop prone, lean, and activate different vision options. *FC* also has a ladder climbing routine that significantly reduces ladder casualties while increasing realism; walking into a ladder automatically causes the player to holster his or her weapon and mount; the player still controls up or down movement.Bugs and annoying tweaks may spoil the control. Game reloads often stick the character a few feet in the air, occasionally clipping him right out of the map. Sometimes, the saved games won't appear in the menu, and one has to quit and restart to make them appear. Climbing ladders or stair too slowly or when crouched can prevent the character from passing through. Stuff slides downhill very easily. And even on my AMD 64 FX-51 with an ATI 9800 pro, the game lagged at the \"High\" texture setting.The most infamous issue would be the lack of a quick save key binding. *FC* does have a \"quick\" save function available through the console: hit \"~\" and then type \"\\save_game\" followed by a space and then a number, then hit \"Enter\" and \"~\". Activating the console does not pause the game so don't do it in the middle of a firefight.In the end, *Far Cry* is all about firefights. Don't expect anything along the lines of the *NOLF* series as far as non-lethal missions go. Do expect a lot of sneaking and gawking around a game which has presaged both *Doom 3* and *Half-Life 2*. Welcome to Paradise-it can be hell, but it's also fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2004"}

I'm going to sum up the entirety of the game in a couple sentences. Story is not memorable and doesn't even make you want to pay attention. Campaign is boring and forgettable, run and plant a charge there, now escort the hostage here, mission completed. Multiplayer.....is the campaign. Yep they were to lazy so they just made the campaign so people can join in. Who would have thought a game so focused on teamwork would have some of the worst AI(artificial intelligence)ever in a game. Almost every time I have to switch classes to get a bomb plant or hack a computer. It's just annoying when your down and a medic will walk right past you into the line of fire. Now onto what makes me laugh, the S.M.A.R.T system of the game. It's supposed to be a big thing where you can just hold a button and hop over rails and climb over walls. It's slow as ever,about everytime I try to run over something it doesn't allow me because it's to \"high\". If your going to shower your game with praise about your smart system than maybe it should be a little more specific with what you can jump over. Last and final complaint goes with the running. The games supposed to be all about running around and sliding, there's even a line in the loading screen that says \"run more than shoot\", I find that hard to when you'd be a lot more successfull just defending or escorting a hostage. This game sucks. I'm not even going to finish it for the Achievement points. If any other reviews praise this game they are either regretting buying it and don't wanna admit that it sucks or their just trolls trying to get you to waste your money. Don't rent this game. Don't buy this game. Don't even borrow this game from a friend. Complete waste of time save your money for something better. I only rented.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}

The voice acting couldn't be better and the rage Kratos feels can be felt as much as it can be played (Rage of Sparta).  My only irritation about the game itself is that GOW2 has too many puzzles that take way too much time and, if not done correctly, can lead to someone like myself wanting to just end the game (as with the ending battle with Zeus) or a just end a scene for the sake of ending it, not for the joy.

{"product_name":"B000TI836G","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"A Decent, Under-Rated Game","reviewText":"Clearly, emotions run high about the quality of this game.  What bothers me is that most of the negative reviews can be summed up like this:  \"OMG!!! Medal of Honor is NOT Call of Duty!  I am soooo surprised and outraged!\"  All I can ask is what exactly were you expecting?Clearly, this game is not Call of Duty.  It is its own game, plain and simple.  Does it borrow from COD?  Yes, just as COD borrowed from every game that came before it.  Let's start with the single player.  I have never cared much for COD's single player campaigns because they are just too over the top.  COD single player has ever spawning enemies that continue to spawn until you push past the right \"pressure point\" on the map. The thousands of enemies and relentless pace make COD's single player experience seem like an arcade shooting game.  I always thought MW2 would have been great if it would just stop and take a breath, instead of always trying to one-up itself with one set piece after another.This MOA's single player does indeed take a breath and try and give you a chance to absorb and take in what is happening to you. The SP campaign is far more intense than MW2's campaign.  It seems more realistic and down to earth, and the sound is simply astonishing.  Playing MOA is like playing the war movie \"Black Hawk Down,\" realistic, intimate, and emotional.  Playing COD single player is more like playing a James Bond movie - over the top, a bit silly, and never intended to be in-depth or meaningful.The MP is similar to MW2 in ways, but overall it is not as quick moving and arcade-like.  It feels more the old school online days of PC gaming with the original Battlefield series once it moved away from WWII.  Everything seems to move a bit slower.  I can understand why much younger players hate it.  If you have only played at the lightening quick pace of MW2, with its lack of cover and run and gun play style, the MOA MP is quite a shock.  It is still fast paced, but the character models and their pace of movement is probably 25-30% slower than what you get with COD.  The learning curve is punishing as well - expect to be killed quickly for the first few hours until you get used to the new culture.  You cannot dash about in this multiplayer with g18 pistols akimbo and own everyone. Move without cover and some thought, and expect to die. And die you will. You will be punished and die for dashing about mindlessly because the MP in this game is filled with snipers.  There are countless sniping points in the various maps that really restrict open movement.  And since there is no kill-cam like in MW2, good luck trying to find your most-hated sniper's nesting spot.  But, once again, you just have to adjust yout play style from MW2.  One drawback of the MOA maps is the fact that spawn points can be camped.  And overhead death from above, like mortars and rockets (like kill-streak rewards in MW2) can be dialed in right on top of a spawn point.  And the spawn points tend to be in the same places, unlike MW2's rotating spawn system.  The pros (like nice draw distances, pretty, unique looking maps) tend to outweigh the cons (sniping, spawn camping, general sluggishness) and make this a fun online experience.  It is not without its irritations, but it is still fun if you come in patient and open-minded.I bought this intending to only play the SP and quickly sell it back, because I figure once Nov. 6 rolls around you will hear nothing but crickets chirping online in this game because the world will be online in Black Ops.  But, the multiplayer kind of sucked me in so I will probably keep it for a while now. To all you spawn-camping snipers out there, live it up while you can! I suspect once Black Ops is released you will only have each other to snipe at.It is probably safest to try before you buy with this game, given the mixed feelings everyone seem to has about it.  Or, pick up a used copy from here.  Just go in with an open mind and not assume that if it is not an exact clone of the COD series it has somehow failed.  Just as most movies are just a slightly different flavor than the one before it, so is the case with MOA.  It's not groundbreaking nor revolutionary, but deserves to be loved, hated or tolerated as its own game. If you want something different than what's out there right now, it is unique enough to give a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2010"}

If your a vidio games expert like me then you alredy played the priveous Metal of Honor games and you know that they all take place in World War 2- well not this one!!!!!!! This one take place in MODERN TIMES!!!!!!!!  I don't know where they got this idea from but it is absolutely COOL and BADA$$ and TOTALLY ORIGINAL!!!!!!!  I can only imagine the GENIEUS who was sitting there at the vidio game meeting one day who was all like \"Hey boys, now just bear with me here- this idear is completely out of the blue.  What if we make the new vidio game in MODERN TIME insted of in World War2???  It would be warfare, but like MODERN Warfare instead of olden times warfare!!!!!!!\"  Whoever that genieus was, he was a GENIEIUS for coming up with this idear all on his own with no insperation and he should win the vidio game maker of the YEAR aword!!!In this MODERN Warfare game, (I still don't know where they get this idear!!!!)  you get to play as a member of TEAR ONE forces who are the first ones to go into a forin country and grow they beards out and wear TURBINES and blend in with the local Tallibands! But allso you shoot mashine guns ALOT of them know what I saying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The guns handle real good and shoot lots of enemies and make big-a$$ gun sounds which is totally RAD and not GAYE at all.  The grafficks are so photorealistical that when my babymomma came in she thought I was watching the news or a movie or something by stephen spielburg!!!!!!If you know anything about me you know that where I reely shine is on MULTEPLAYER!!!

Right away I got into the lobbie and into the game and start powning noobs and yelling things like \"YOU'RE MOM!!!!!!\" and \"YOUR GAY!!!!!!!\" and shooting kids and calling them \"Son\" so that they know I am souperier to them which is a sykological trick that I learn from listening to gangsta rap and watching MTV because I am a ALFA MALE not some LOOSER who gets powned, I GIVE the powns!!!The best thing about multeplayer is that the maps are super SUPER small, so you get tons of kills all the time and that's good because I need constant stimalation or I get bored with a vidio game.  Also each game only last about 5 minutes each which is good because i have no attention span I need things to move fast and be bright and pretty and get lots of kills and be over and move on because I am a ALFA MALE teen who need tons of kills cuz it make me feel TOTALLY RAD abotu myself!!!  So if you like this game as much as I do then you must be JUST LIKE ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!To summarise, METAL OF HONOR is the best game I ever play in my LIVE!!!

Using a fine-tuned accelerometer and gyroscope, the Pro Elite Wireless can sense your movements and translate them into the game. This gives you more direct, lifelike control over the events in your game. To get the most out of SIXAXIS-heavy games like Warhawk and Heavenly Sword, you'll need the Pro Elite Wireless Controller.Rumble Feedback for Immersive GameplayFully supporting rumble feedback, the Pro Elite Wireless uses two vibrating motors on either side of the controller to create a rumbling sensation at certain moments during the game. This makes yaour gaming experience even more immersive, as you're able to feel every gunshot and explosion in visceral detail.The Pro Elite Wireless Controller is backed by a two-year warranty.

This is a controller you should use if you enjoy using analogue sticks similar to the xbox 360 or you have large hands and frequently bump your thumbs on the Dualshock3.  Here is what I've liked/disliked about the controller since picking it up.Like:-Wireless-6-axis Support, along with rumble function-Bulkier controller-Hand Grips work well for sweaty palms and those with \"hand salsa\" problems-Touch-Sensitive Triggers-Battery life is same as standard PS3 controller-Excellent D-PadDislike:-Led Lights are worthless, cannot tell the player number whatsoever-Analogue sticks have a sticky adhesive on them, could eventually transfer to the buttons and make them stick tooInitially I got the dreaded \"dead zone\" in the analogue sticks similar to what other reviewers got.  However once I followed directions and synced the controller to the receiver, the dead zone was gone. I played MW2, Bad Company 2, and Borderlands without a hitch in multi-player.  My scores were generally the same as before, however in Borderlands, I noticed the controller required a bit more finesse when turning left.  I'm not sure if this is a software or hardware issue, as Bad Company and MW2 didn't have this problem.I was really skeptical about purchasing this controller due to all the reviews about the dead zone, however I think it just boils down to not syncing the controller correctly, and kids expecting 3rd party products to magically turn them into better competitive gamers.  While this doesn't surpass the quality of the original dual shock, it definitely works well enough for a 360 clone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2010"}

This one has excellent graphics, the all new revert trick to add continutation to vert tricks. And the uniqueness of the Playstation2 one out of Gamecube and Xbox's version is that this one has online play. The main consumer will not be able to go online with this until August 2002. Since the release of it, the online was working. You need to buy a ethernet hub that connected to your DSL/Cable modem that will go into the Playstation2 USB ports. The online play is really fun. You can play Trick Attack mode against the hottest skaters in the United States, and represent where you at! (Yeah New York!) You can also play up to 2-8 players online at anytime. Configuration is very easy too. The offline mode is rather easy to veteran Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 players. They subtraction of the money collection makes it much more simpler than the PSone versions. The collection of SKATE is present as ever. You can still collect new decks, but you can't earn them, you have to find them. Since the game is so high-tech, you have to interact with peole who are in the area, just like in Dave Mirra's Pro BMX 2 for PS2. There are 8 levels in the game. When you complete the final level, you get a hidden level called \"Cruise Ship\". If you beat the game, you get cheats. Every time you complete the game, you get more goodies. You can also unlock 3 classic Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 levels which have been revamped for the console. \"Warehouse\", \"Burnside\", and \"Roswell\" are present in the game. There is a revamped Create-A-Character, which let you be more involved with your character. There is a Create-Your-Own-Skatepark feature just like THPS2. It isn't really updated, so I don't really use it. Our favorite, the DVD skate movies are present in the option menu. You can collect even more and better videos than THPS2. There is a personal, 2 minute video for every pro skater featured, showing them doing tricks, and telling about their lives. There is my personal favorite, 4 all new, never before seen bail videos. They have videos of Kelly Slater, for Kelly Slater's Pro Surfer, Neversoft skate-boarders and others. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 is must have extreme sports game until Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 is being released...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00149ILCK","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"The Saboteur - Pandemic's Swan Song","reviewText":"The Saboteur is a release that saddens me when I think about it, as it was Pandemic's final game as a game developer; the sad part about all of it is that it was also their best game they've ever put out, and it was just an incredible game in its own right. Take an open world, throw in an interesting premise and storyline, layer on fabulous art direction, then throw in a variety of gameplay mechanics that just click when you're in control. While it took inspiration from other games in the genre, it combined them, put its own spin on things, and in the end it ended up being one of the most interesting and refreshing games in the genre.The story in The Saboteur is really well done. It provides an interesting protagonist that has some good banter with other characters and himself. In addition, the antagonist seems like such a mean and cocky fellow, so you can't wait to get revenge on him. Without spoiling this delight, I'll just say that it all ties up beautifully.The gameplay is open world, like you'd expect out of Grand Theft Auto, and it has climbing, like you'd see in games like Infamous and Assassin's Creed; however, it's important to state that The Saboteur has a feel all its own, and I actually like the way everything plays. It's more arcade-like and not super realistic, so everything is pretty easy to control. Climbing around this beautiful world is quite fun, as is the driving, which handles very well. There are some really nice cinematic set piece moments in this game that will make your jaw drop.The art direction is one amazing thing about The Saboteur, because it's not only sharp, but it's both beautiful and unique, too. You start out in a beautifully detailed black and white world. The world is bleak and incredibly detailed. The rain effects look downright stunning in black and white. As you take down the Nazi control, you bring back color to the world.The Saboteur has a few little hiccups along the way, as there's some glitches here and there, but it's important to note that they're ultimately very minor and do not sour this overwhelmingly incredible experience. If you missed out on it and haven't given it the time of day yet, please, please, please, give this gem a chance.4.5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2011"}

It wasn't great, but it was fun and entertaining enough to keep my attention until the end.  Lost Planet 2 is, in my opinion, garbage.  I only put about 2 hours into this steaming pile and simply couldn't force myself to spend another minute on it.  I truly felt like I was wasting precious moments of my life that I'd never see again.  For whatever reason, Capcom has decided to structure their games around co-op gameplay.  Now, co-op is fantastic as an option, but when it is the basis of the entire game it seems to take away from the campaign experience - especially that of 1-player.  Capcom has done this with other titles with the same effect (REF Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City).  So, for starters, if you are looking for a one player action/adventure/shooter campaign you should probably pass this game up.  In fact, if you are looking for any entertainment whatsoever you should probably pass this game up.  Aside from the fairly decent visuals and relatively well done ambient audio, there is little to brag about with this title.  Enemies are recycled ad-nauseum - even though you'll enounter different types of creatures, they all seem to be based on the same model.  This makes the enemies seem repetitive.  The characters are dressed in ridiculous looking outfits.  Customization of your character is allowed, but very limited.  No matter how you tweak the outfit, you still end up looking like a douche with a propeller for a backpack.  There is also the addition of an \"anchor\", which is sort of an extendable gripping mechanism ala Bionic Commando.  It's used for climbing small hills and it's pretty much useless after that.  Do yourself a favor and save your money.  Unless the price point falls under $10 or a friend loans it to you or you find it in a donation bin somewhere, pass it up.PROS- Decent visuals- Pretty good ambient audioCONS- Waste of your time.

Fable 2 is a good game, worth all the praise that it has received.  At the same time, it has some major flaws that hold it back from being a truly amazing experience.First, the good:Graphics: The art style is beautiful.  This game won't get an award for best graphics, but they're still very good.Combat: The combat is fun and addictive.  You have melee, magic, and ranged.  You can mix it up or use just one and max them out by earning Experience Points.Side quests: So much to do other than the main story, and they don't feel repetitive.  Adds a lot of replay value to the game.Now the bad:Story: Way too short, the ending is a total let down.  Within the story there are several parts that are nothing more than fetch missions, which is horribly annoying.Save issues: I haven't had any, but read the reviews to see about loss of game data.All in all I think the game is great, but the little things matter, and in this game it cost it dearly.  If you like RPG's, you owe it to yourself to at least rent it (the story can be completed in 6-8 hours).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2008"}

I have been very well pleased with the game. I wil admit that there is some similarity in all the WWII games but how innovative can you be with that subject. COD 3 is an entertaining  game with many hours of play required to finish. It is great for people who like FPS games. My only objection, as has been stated in other reveiws, is the cut scene problem. They are way too long and there is not way to skip them. Also if you quit the game then start it back from the last checkpoint, you are subjected to the last cut scene before that point. It really gets quite annoying. Most games with cut scenes offer a way to skip them. I can't address multiplayer or online play since I don't participate in either.

{"product_name":"B0037LTTRO","description":"","reviewerName":"B. McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Very involving and diverse game...","reviewText":"Overview:This 3rd person action shooter is very involving. A good story that keeps you going and flows through to the end. The campaign is not too short and changes it up as you go along, and you can co-op through the entire thing. The MP is very detailed with a number of different maps to start with in addition to guerilla mode which is a little twist on the normal.Single Player:Playing through the campaign to me was a lot of fun. I would try different tactics and ways of attacking an objective to see if I could eliminate the opposition as quickly and efficiently as possible. Most missions you can choose your route and execute your plans however you would like. If you don't want to use stealth you don't have to in most situations, although there are a couple of sequences where you cannot have any alarms (so you can either take them out silently/coordinated attacks or you can avoid them all together). Even though you have \"active camo\" if you are moving within their vision or too noisy they will see/hear you.The game looks really good, great maps and environments. I especially enjoyed the things that would break from the norm, using the UCV (unmanned combat vehicle, basically a mobile mortar platform), the gunship sequences, and getting to play with all the fun gadgets and unlockable attachments. There are weapon challenges, tactical challenges, etc. for each mission that are diffcult to achieve. Unfortunately there is NO match-making system for the co-op campaign. Also, when you start a mission, if a buddy comes online after there is no \"drop-in\" option.MP:Each team is made up of two 4-man squads. You can spawn on your squad or at your spawn point. There are 3-classes to choose from that have their own advantages. Scout- sniper, has coaking ability. Engineer- intel expert, can spot enemies with sensor grenades, UAV, etc. Rifleman- explosives, extra armor class. There are several different game modes: Siege (no respawn), Sabotage (plant the bomb), Conflict (changing objectives that are worth points), and Decoy (hack the bases to find the real base and attack it). The single-player also unlocks addition weapons for MP.Guerrilla Mode / Co-op Survival:The twist on your survival mode. You have to infiltrate an area, neutralize the threats and then hold your ground until you can advance to the next area. As you make it through the waves, support options are made available. Gun turrets, air strikes, etc. Very fun for 4-players. Unfortunately, again, there is no match-making for Co-op.Gunsmith:In singleplayer/MP gives you the option of changing up your attachments, paint, and internals of each weapon you bring to the fight. In singleplayer most of the options are already unlocked, but some you have to gain by finishing tactical objectives on certain missions. For MP, some unlocks come from the campaign, while most are from ranking up and gaining tokens to unlock certain attachments. Each class also has \"decision points\" which are free unlocks, but you can only pick one from two options. For example: Engineer's first is between the UAV and the hacking tool. Sniper's first is between a custom sniper scope and a thermal scope. Rifleman's first is between the smoke GL and an underbarrel stun round. If you go to Uplay, there's an unlockable that gives you BOTH at one decision point of your choosing.Outside Interaction:--There was a 'prequel' that came out, you can view it on youtube (GHOST RECON: ALPHA)--Download the mobile App, it allows for you to modify your weapons in the gunsmith on the fly. Also gives you 6 free unlocks for MP. I tried it out for Android and works really well. You can use it in \"Free Mode\" or \"Sync Mode\" which allows for your customizations to be uploaded to your game next time you play.--Try out the FaceBook App, it gives a couple of unlocks and some gun skins.--The Ghost Recon Network site also gives you some unlocks for the game if you have played previous TomClancy titles, enter certain code words, played the FB app, etc.Summary:A lot of options here for replayability and for the completionist. I'm definitely going to go through the missions again and try to knock out the weapon and tactical objectives that I missed. That and will have to play through with some friends to try the co-op aspects. In addition to gaining ranks in the MP so I can unlock some more crazy weapons and abilities.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2012"}

I'm too consumed by this overwhelming game. From the moment I landed on Talon IV and saw the world around me I knew that this game would be huge, and it has owned my soul ever since. I still can't help but feel overwhelmed by this simply amazing game. Metroid Prime is the definitive Metroid game, and being a die-hard fan of Super Metroid that is saying quite a lot. I'm surprised to see how well this game works, from the bomb jumps to the hidden secrets, to the exploration, and feeling of claustrophobia. Everything that has made Metroid so cool in the past is present and accounted for in 3D.Graphically the game is breath taking. I cannot think of a better-looking game out there, this exceeds even Resident Evil, and it runs at a smooth and constant 60 frames per second. I always thought that the one advantage the XBox had over GameCube was reflective and metallic surfaces, this is no longer the case, as Metroid Prime exceeds even the greatest XBox efforts in every aspect.The sound effects are amazing, and the story (obtained through liberal application of the scan visor) is surprisingly deep and, yet again overwhelming. The music is MIDI, but unlike Star Fox its something I appreciate, as many of the tunes have a nostalgic relevance as the game uses the same MIDI, or slightly remixed Midis from previous games, as well as some new tunes that get stuck in your head just as easily. Very atmospheric, very cool.All in all I can't give this game any less than a perfect score. It's been eight years since we've had a new Metroid game, and it's been eight years well worth the wait. Do not hesitate to buy this game, if you don't have a GameCube to play it on go buy one! Trust me, you do not want to miss this epic adventure!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2002"}

Unlike Diablo, Torchlight is much more friendly to those new to the genre.  It even improves on Diablo in some ways.  I'm still amazed I can leave this game at any point and return exactly where I left off.  The graphics are beautiful and each dungeon looks different from the last.  At it's heart it's a dungeon crawl, meaning you wander through a maze of passageways slashing baddies that attack you while searching for items to advance the game.  You have a choice of three characters, your basic warrior, mage, and archer class and each has their own set of skills that can be boosted for maximum effectiveness when battling the baddies in the dungeon.  What this means is there is little replayability as far as the different dungeons is concerned, yet as long as you enjoy the experience of the dungeon crawl you'll find your experience much different while playing as a mage versus a warrior and so on.  The choices of different spells and specialized talents are numerous, not to mention the many secret areas in the dungeons, making it unlikely you will play the same game twice.You have four difficulty levels to choose from and even if you're new to the genre, I recommend you don't play on easy mode unless you want no challenge whatsoever.  Even on the moderate levels, being killed results in little penalty; maybe a loss of some gold or being forced to start at the beginning of the level.  You also have the choice of an animal companion (dog or cat) that assists you both in battles and in carrying the items you pick up along the way.  A nice bonus is the ability to see your character progress as he or she is outfitted with increasingly powerful items as you move through the game.  It's fun to see your character develop.Having not yet completed my first run completely I can already say this game is money well spent; especially at the discounted price compared to other titles.  I recently purchased a new computer system so I immediately bought some high-performance titles to show off the graphics card.  Still, it is Torchlight I keep coming back to regularly.  An addicting, but more importantly, fun adventure and highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001CM62UM","description":"Thanks to Square-Enix, the original Star Ocean has finally made it to the United States in the form of Star Ocean: First Departure. A PSP remake of Star Ocean, which was never released in the U.S., First Departure adds several new elements, including all new backgrounds and a tweaked battle system, while still preserving the exciting storyline and themes of the original.Star Ocean: First Departure has been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes.View larger.Enter battle with basic melee attacks, special arts, or spellsView larger.In battle, you can control a character while the AI handles your teammates.View larger.Back to the BeginningIt is Space Date 346, and in a sleepy town on the planet Roak, defense-force members Roddick, Millie, and Dorn are on yet another dull patrol when a mysterious plague begins turning people to stone. Fortunately, Ronyx and Ilia, members of a Terran Alliance reconnaissance mission, beam down to the surface just in time. They explain that the plague is actually a biological weapon, and they take the defense-force to the space vessel to discuss how to save Roak from this mysterious attack.The majority of this role-playing game (RPG) actually takes place in the past, because the party realizes that the only way to save the people of Roak is to collect a particular genetic sample from the Roak of old. The game play of First Departure is fairly traditional RPG that has you moving about the world map on your journey, traversing towns and dungeons, progressing the plot as you go.Choose the Right StrategyYou enter battle either using basic melee attacks, special arts that require MP points and that can grow more powerful with use, or spells that also require MP points but take time to cast and can be interrupted before completion.Tactics let you set strategy commands for your characters before they enter battle and can be changed in the middle of battle. All characters will fight according to their set strategy, with different situations requiring different strategies.Private actions are sometimes offered as a character approaches a town on the world map. These private actions depend on timing as well as which characters you have with you as you enter town.. The outcome of these private actions will affect subsequent private actions, for better or worse.All New Artwork and New CharactersStar Ocean: First Departure uses a slightly altered version of the engine used for Star Ocean: The Second Story, but with many similar features. However, the pre-rendered backgrounds and 3D battle fields have been given new artwork and animated cut-scenes, and new playable characters have been added.First Departure has been given a much more dynamic battle system, letting you control a character while the AI handles your teammates. During battle, characters can move freely about the field, executing normal attacks with the X button, and performing special attacks with the L or R triggers. What's more, you can switch characters at any time with a quick press of the Circle button.First Departure also features an item creation system that lets you create new weapons and items to help you in battle, and an extensive skill system for developing your character as you play. You can boost certain party attributes, spending SP on skills to increase your fighters' speed in battle, for example, or spend points that develop your item creation ability and raise your character's strength.","reviewerName":"Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"","summary":"The game that started a franchise.... regurgitated","reviewText":"I first played the Star Ocean franchise way back when Star Ocean: Second Story was released for the PS2 in the 90's. I had never played the first Star Ocean title. Now, re-released for the PSP, this game has been given a graphics overhaul and some nice anime cutscenes, in hopes of entertaining old fans and introducing new ones to the colorful Star Ocean franchise.GameplayThe Star Ocean franchise is known for the deep level of gameplay mechanics that is offered within each game. A plethora of sidequests and character crafting skills can take hours by themselves, and if the gamer has taken the time to acquire enough funds for the characters, you could literally spend hours not even touching the main story. First Departure is no different in this aspect, with crafting skills (playing music, cooking, etc) and side quests galore. However, I cannot shake the feeling that Squaresoft and Tri-Ace took the skin and game engine from the second game and simply slapped the story and characters from the first. The games are very similar.That is not to say that the game is not fun. The live-action battle system is a refreshing change from the menu-driven battles that litter many RPGs. Sadly, most battles can be won by simply smashing the X button repeatedly. You have the option to set the other characters within your party on auto attack (this is the default setting), and simply choose their attack style from a set of option (go all out, conserve mana, etc). The AI for your teammates is good, and the healer in your party (Millie), is solid and very effective.In regard to your party, the Star Ocean mechanic of recruiting members is still very strong. As with Second Story, the ability to gain a character for your party varies based upon your actions within the game. And the actions required vary depending upon the character. For example: if you want a certain character, you may have to travel to a certain town at a certain time. Or, maybe you cannot recruit another character. None of these clues are readily obvious, either. Sometimes you stumble upon a character by accident. But more often than not, you will probably need to review a FAQ or strategy guide if you want a specific character for your party.The frustrating aspects of the game center around the learning curve and the travel times. In most RPGs, there is a steady levelling pace from each point in the story to the next. In this title, you are forced to grind (that is, run around in an area looking for monsters to kill for an unspecified timeframe) for several levels in between each event, or you will wipe. And we are not talking 3 or 4 levels. In some instances, you need 5-10, if not more, to successfully traverse the next dungeon. While a dedicated RPGer will not mind this, to the casual gamer, this may be enough to put down the game for good. Combine this with the sketchy encounter rate, and you can almost consider throwing your PSP in frustration. In one area you may encounter monsters every few steps. In others, you can travel quite a distance before you will have a fight. This lack of a steady encounter mechanic can make the relatively simple task of grinding a chore.The other frustration, travel time, can be a blessing or a curse, depending on the level of reality you want in your gaming. However, having to spend 5-10 minutes to travel from one destination to the next is annoying. I admit, I have not beaten the game yet, and you may eventually acquire some sort of a vehicle allowing you to travel faster. In the early parts of the game, you run along from one town to the next, spending an indeterminate amount of time before you may reach your destination. If you are looking to do a bit of adventuring on your work break and only have 15 minutes to play before you have to put your PSP on sleep mode, you may spend the bulk of your time travelling, and accomplish little to nothing. For that reason, I recommend setting aside a good amount of time if you want to advance the story.StoryThe story is not exactly epic, but it is interesting and will keep you entertained. The characters all have unique personalities, and the voiceovers are well done. The translation from Japanese to English is top notch, and you will not encounter any odd phrases that make little to no sense. If you are familiar with the second Star Ocean game, this title is the prequel, documenting the adventures of the father of the hero of the second game. In short, an unknown race of aliens are attempting to create a super weapon, and they have released a bioweapon on a planet which turns the people to stone. There is no known cure. The main character, Roddick (which is not the father), must try to save his friend. At this point, the story unfolds, and a mixture of science fiction and fantasy pepper the tale. You will find yourself confused with the odd terminology at times, as the story does make the presumption you are familiar with the Star Ocean universe (no pun intended). However, once you have played for a while, you will enjoy yourself.Graphics and SoundThe game mixes rendered 3D environments with 2D sprite characters. This may irritate some gamers who may balk at the low-tech approach, but the world is colorful and interesting. The towns have great detail and are interesting to explore, if confusing. The only real complaint is the overworld, which is lackluster and generic. The towns looks like boxes with minor detail, and the environmental details (grass, trees), have horrible texturing and color. Fortunately, though, the gameplay mostly involves running in dungeons and/or cities, so this minor complaint shouldn't deter you.The sound is very good, with decent music. The voiceovers are top-notch, with unique voices for each character. Combat is very annoying, with the characters announcing the name of each attack they are using every time they use it. As every important conversation involves text bubbles or dubbing, you don't have to play with the sound, and turning the sound off eliminates the need to hear the annoying combat announcements. Still, the ambiance of the music and hearing the conversations adds a nice element to the game, so it is your choice if you want to mute your PSP.OverallIn short, I recommend this game for someone who either likes the Star Ocean franchise or is a devoted RPGer. If you are a casual gamer you may end up enjoying this game, but the amount of time you would need to invest to explore every aspect is high. Not to mention if you wanted to play with every possible character for your party you would need to replay the story several times over. For this reason, the replay value is high. Between the story, the gameplay, and the depth of the crafting system, the game is definitely fun. If you never played this game when it was first released (like me), it is also worth picking up to see the first adventure within the Star Ocean series, and also to understand Claude's references to his father from the second game (that comment is specifically for you RPG junkies who played Second Story). Overall, if you are craving a good RPG fix that doesn't involve endless combat menus, this title is for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}

The story is great for a game like this. You're a cop chasing down a twisted mass murderer. Walking through one of the handful of creepy environments with nothing but a lead pipe or one of the many other melee weapons in the game is intense and often times just down right frightening. The combat system is simple but works and is fun. It mainly boils down to blocking and then striking while your opponent is dazed but the fights are fun and intense especially when there are multiple enemies. It then becomes unpredictable when you make another enemy hit another and they begin fighting each other. The game is short, however. And, even though the game doesn't look bad it deffinetly isn't a visually strong game. It is one of the early games of the xbox 360.

Since then, government forces have managed to control the zombie threat and Leon has become a Federal agent. When the President's daughter is kidnapped, Leon tracks her to a remote, hidden fortress in Europe - where he'll relive the horror he faced six years before.

I love this game. When I first played it, I was amazed by how much Resident Evil changed. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing. I absolutely love zombies, but I also feel a series has to evolve in order to hold people's attention.Either way, what I liked about this game was the new inventory system, which lets you organize your items. Also, the addition of many different types of weapons is cool.A lot of people criticize this game for not being as scary as the other ones. Well for me, I was never really as scared of the other ones as I was with this one. But that's just me.This game comes with cool extras. You can rewatch scenes, play the Mercenaries (a minigame in which you have to kill as many enemies in a set time), and even play an extra scenario as another character. As cheap as this game is, it is definitely worth a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2011"}

Its a better take than the PC version and I agree with that. If you like the old Diablo game then this is exactly what your getting although it's a slightly more pretty version of the game.Notes on co-op:- Inventory screens only come up for one player at a time. Slightly annoying.- The radial wheel for choosing inventory items takes a bit of getting used to but the menu system is rather well done.- Gold is not necessarily shared by both players.- Experience seems to be shared up to a point of level difference. (Level 1 vs Level 6 characters).- No camera issues at all. Zero.

I have been a fan of all Medal Of Honor since The first ones on ps1. Since then they really have not changed much but i like they way they are so that doesnt bother me. This is a great game with an alright campagin. I mean, there are only like five missions/operations but each one is quite long. There are three modes to play on, casual, normal, or expert each giving you achievements if you beat it. Expert is pretty hard to do though. But the graphics in this game are outstanding for 2007. Medal of honor never had the best graphics but they really did take a huge step now. If you were a fan of the ps2 MOH games then you should get this one. It is not like the older ones though. The older ones are straight forward basicly the whole time and you just run shoot, and do objectives while this one is parachuting in at the begining of each operation and landing where ever you want in the battlefield. Pretty cool. There are skill drop locations in each one too that are pretty hard to get to. So i guess wherever you want to land is where ever you start. Just get to the closest green smoke and your objective will be shown. You get to upgrade each and every weapon and each time you upgrade them it gets better. To upgrade you just kill people with it, headshots and killing lots of people with one grenade racks the meter up quite a bit. The campagin should keep you busy for quite a long time depending on diffuculty and it is worth playing all the way throgh. Great graphics and story. The only thing is that the person that you play as like never talks and its like a silent trip through the whole game. Not many cutscenes at all and its like you are a different guy every time you play unlike Call of Duty. The multiplayer is quite fun and half of achievements come from it. The only thing is there is like no maps at all but it is a good one. If you are a MOH fan, then get it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"An excellent game, but is too short","reviewText":"The Good: Terrific design, awesome bosses, great story, great mythology, solid combatThe Bad: Weak puzzles, very short, very hard, feels unfinished slightlyThe first thing you will notice when you play Dante's Inferno is that it's a bold game. The game is one of the darkest, nastiest, most mature games ever created and it makes Christianity look like a damned fool. The game is about a man named Dante who is a crusader and betrays his love Beatrice. Upon his return to Florence he sees her dead and watches as Lucifer takes her into hell and Dante follows.The story is pretty good and keeps you interested, but its predictable. The game goes extremely deep in Christian and Greek mythology and pulls out names only hardcore followers would know, but enough of the story let's get to game play.The game has a pretty damn solid combat system. You use your scythe as your main weapons and you have a cross projectile attack. You can do aerial combat, launch enemies into the air, and use your magic. You can unlock moves by following the holy or unholy paths (which doesn't actually affect the story) and each tree has a different set of moves. You can have four different magic items equipped and all are useful and powerful. You can also find relics throughout the game that benefit Dante in certain ways. For example one relic allows Dante to have more powerful throw attacks, one lets him instantly break fountains, one lets him take less damage etc. These are found by talking to Virgil or in secret areas. Anyways, the combat system is fluid, fast, and powerful and very deadly. If you feel you are getting womped you can use your Redemption meter which is kind of like Rage of the Titans in God of War.When it comes to exploration Inferno both satisfies and disappoints. The game has you descending into the 9 circles of hell and each is harder, deadly, and more brutal. Some levels are pretty epic like The City of Dis, Limbo, and some disappoint like Lust (just an ascending tower), and Gluttony (just fight Cerberus and a few baddies and your down to the next level). The levels are varied in length and I wish they would have been fleshed out more. Puzzle solving is pretty rare and when you do get some puzzles they are pretty easy to solve.One thing I have to get straight is that the game is pretty epic. Not God of War epic but enough to keep it very cinematic. There are QTE's in the game such as when you take down a minotaur to ride it, take down bosses etc. You can punish or absolve most enemies to get feed your tree paths, there are famous historical figures that you find throughout the game that you can punish or absolve upon reading what they ended up in hell for.The game's visual style is very impressive. Its what you think hell wold look like...dark, disgusting, and evil. The Gluttony level is a good example since you are walking through intestines, bile, puke, and so forth. The Lust level has female enemies wombs coming out of them to attack you. A giant Cleopatra with tongues coming out of her nippies and evil babies...yes its bizarre, but it works and its amazing to look at.The game is also extremely difficult even on the easy setting. Wave after wave of enemies come at you from all directions, bosses are extremely hard to beat, and the game can be very frustrating often. However, the game's major flaws are mainly the length, difficulty, and the fact that the levels weren't developed to their fullest potential.DIVINE EDITION: Exclusively to the PS3 is the Divine Edition which includes a different cover, full digital version of Dante's Inferno, and a free code for the Trials of St. Lucia (which still is not out yet). All of this for the same $60 price tag. The only disappointment was there was no special book that came with the game that included the Inferno. Reading the poem in a small window that is over 30 chapters long is not fun at all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0053BCMAC","description":"","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"It is becoming my favorite Paper Mario game","reviewText":"Okay, so the game isn't as advanced as past games. The only NPCs are Toads, you don't level up, and the storyline isn't exactly a cliffhanger. Big deal, get over it. This is a handheld title, not a full blown console RPG. Honestly, I think it is hilariously amusing and really quite enjoyable as well as creative. The new gimmick is using a sticker based battle system, which is really unique and involves a lot of strategy. Use a sticker and its gone unless you find another one. The stickers have a wide range of attacks, from classic jump or hammer attacks all the way to throwing sombreros and kicking Koopa shells. What makes the battle system so fun is are the new \"things\", which are non-paper 3D objects. They can range from a pair of high heels (complete with a spotlight and saxophone solo as they crush the enemies) to soda cans (which is shaken up and then opened to spray the enemies) or even one of those Japanese cats (flies using a rocket booster and then lands on the enemies with a \"meow\"). I always love finding new things, it really increases the replay value. Also, I don't think I've ever seen the characters actually mention being made of paper. While the story is relatively simple, the jokes are rather amusing (Mario, I got folded 256 times!). In fact, the whole world seems to be a giant origami diorama, with toads unfolding their town, cardboard mountains collapsing, even a giant origami Yoshi sphinx. Even better, you get the brand new ability to \"paperize\" stuff, which basically means adding or removing objects from the world (like covering up a fan with a sticker or removing the fountain to save a trapped Toad). It really is the most creative Paper Mario I've seen so far and is an entirely different game all together.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2013"}

Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"A bit of a reach","reviewText":"I've been playing Halo since the very first installment of the franchise, through 2 and 3, and concluding with the rushed ODST.  Halo: Reach is the culmination of all that has come before.Like the later iterations of Halo games, there is both a shield system that recharges over time and health that can be restored through health packs. Additionally, there are armor abilities: jetpack, camouflage, sprint, and a shield. Multiplayer is expansive but basically the same game we've come to expect, capable of supporting large groups of combatants on even larger battlefields.  Where Gears of War is about crowded, dirty in-your-face fighting, Halo has always been about leaping across massive fields to engage your enemy from a distance.  The title \"reach\" is appropriate.  Speaking of Gears of War, the Firefight multiplayer option shows the game's influence, which is Halo's version of Horde mode.After being underwhelmed by Halo 3: ODST's single-player campaign, I was curious if Halo: Reach would do any better.  The campaign setting is a bold move, taking place in 2552 before the very first Halo: Combat Evolved game. Humanity is in losing the war with the alien Covenant and is slowly retrenching as it evacuates over 700 million civilians off of the planet known as Reach.Our heroes are Noble Team, the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) special forces unit that consists of Spartan supersoldiers. The team is led by Carter-A259 (Freddy Bosche), the handsome but grim leader of the group. His second is Kat-B320 (Alona Tal), the only female on the team who has a cybernetic arm. There's also giant-with-a-heart-of-gold heavy weapons specialist Jorge-052 (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), marksman Jun-A266 (Sunil Malhotra), and the bad attitude skull-faced Emile-A239 (Jamie Hector).  You play Noble Six, who like Master Chief never takes off his helmet but does have a few speaking parts.  We know that Master Chief was the last of his kind at the beginning of Halo, so things aren't going to go well for these soldiers.Noble Team goes on a series of increasingly futile missions, rescuing top secret data from research bases, evacuating important civilians, and delaying attacks long enough for civilian transports to escape. Along the way, Noble Team falls apart a little at a time.Despite the improved graphics, better AI, and new gizmos, this is still the same Halo we know and love.  It also means there's still no bathrooms of note, every room is huge, and despite civilians running around in confusion the entire city of New Alexandria looks more like a shopping mall than any place people actually might live.  Halo is about big, open spaces, but as a setting it never actually feels inhabited by anyone before you begin playing.The voice actors are a mixed bag. The design team obviously tried hard to make the characters culturally diverse, but that unfortunately left us with Kat sporting a dull monotone Russian accent.  As she has the most speaking parts, this makes for some terrible dialogue.  I was relieved when Kat finally died.What Halo: Reach does right is high drama.  I've always felt that Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori's stirring score was much too epic for a first-person shooter like Halo, but Halo: Reach lives up to the promise of its music.  Reach's music rises to a crescendo that is both stirring and heartbreaking.There's a surprise twist near the end of the game that makes Halo: Reach personal and firmly ties it to the other installments. And after the game ends, there's a post-credits sequence that makes it all the more poignant. Halo: Reach takes the franchise about as far as it can go without substantially altering what was originally a world that existed simply for jumping-and-gunning.  It's a great send off for the franchise, but for players accustomed to Gears of War's innovations like using cover, it's a bit of a reach.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2012"}

Death everywhere.  Kids getting killed, and kids doing some killing... not something I want my 13 year old playing.But for the adult gamer, for me, it was a new experience which is always welcome.  Here are some thoughts in no particular order.1) it is not really a game in the normal sense.  It is much more like an interactive book.  You get to make some decisions and they will alter your game world slightly but the basic progression of plot appears to me to be unavoidable so think of it as the telling of a story.2) I could not stop playing.  This is good and bad.  Done in a few days because I was up way too late every night in order to keep going for as long as possible.3) not a lot of replay value that I can see.  How many books have you read twice?  Not too many I'd wager.4) in general there is usually one long puzzle to solve for each scene and the progression of steps to solve a puzzle seems singular.  You do things in a particular order and there is little if any variation.  Indeed, items you examine will not show various options until you have gone through a specific set of steps.  Thus you often have to go back to items you visited previously after you \"figure something out\" related to the item.  But your can't short circuit this with your intelligence.  You need to take the game character through the motions so that he figures it out.5) there is no REWIND button so when you make a mistake and your episode auto-saves past that point there is no turning back.  Coupled with the sometimes way-too-short timed dialogs where you have to pick an option within a limited amount of time, you easily make mistakes by getting dialog choices you don't really want but can't now undo.  This is my biggest gripe I suppose.  Sometimes you have barely enough time to read your choices, much less consider the consequences of each before you pick one.6) a new gaming experience.  Though I am sure there are many \"interactive book\" type games out there, this was my first.  As such I much enjoyed the new experience.  However, it won't be my favorite style of game so I likely will not be purchasing too many of its type.Overall, if you are OK with the dark theme, and have not yet experienced an \"interactive book\" style game, then I'd grab it once it goes on sale.Hail Flavius!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2013"}

David Swan","summary":"Nintendo hits another one out of the park","reviewText":"The brothers Mario have been reunited again following the fantastic `Superstar Saga' and this time they're joined by their own baby versions. They may be tiny and they may occasionally cry fountains of tears but that doesn't stop them from being formable fighters who can hold their own with their adult counterparts. The hook in `Partners in Time' is the time traveling between the past and present versions of the Toadstool kingdom. The Kingdom of the past has been attacked by aliens, the adult princess has been kidnapped (shock) and the Cobalt Star (the McGuffin of the story) has been broken into various pieces that need to be retrieved.`Partners in Time' carries on that tradition of legitimately funny scripting set by `Superstar Saga' and most of the play mechanics remain the same. Much like the RPG console versions the handheld games are all about timing. Fights are turn based affairs requiring the player to time out strikes and defends. Players with difficulty getting the rhythm down may find themselves having some difficulties. Each creature type has a slightly different pattern and sometimes multiple attack sequences. It can take some fast reflexes but like most Nintendo games `Partners in Time' is designed to be beaten even by players with modest skills. One of the issues I have is the fact that it can be very difficult to manage all four brothers during combat even after hours of practice. It's actually even harder when the adult and baby version are separated because the adults uses X and Y while the babies use B and A. I found it challenging to get used one set of buttons and suddenly switch to the other especially when you need to switch between adults and babies quickly.The Mario RPG's have always taken an aesthetic minimalist approach. There are five adjustable character attributes including the enigmatic `Stache'. The brothers can wear one pair of overalls and one badge to help boost stats or give special bonus abilities. Like every RPG made since the dawn of time the brothers will have an ever increasing (and potent) selection of items to choose from as the game progresses. If complexity is your bag the Mario RPG's may disappoint. It's all about simplicity. If anything Partners simplifies the experience even more by creating a more linear experience over `Superstar Saga'. The various collectible bean types have now been eliminated in favor of the generic `bean' so no more bean drinks.The DS system has been on such a roll of late and `Partners in Time' is just one more five star game in a growing library of great DS games. With this game and Mario Kart Nintendo has really had a great winter season.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00HGLLRV2","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"Casual Gamer Opinion","reviewText":"I am an older casual gamer.  I bought myself a PS3 two years ago but quickly got bored because I couldn't get into any games other than golf and Wipeout.  I tried Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, and Need For Speed Most Wanted.  The system also came bundled with Uncharted.  Nothing captivated me enough to play more than an hour or two at most.  Afterward,  I'd place the game down and never play it again.  That wasn't the case with Infamous because this game is FUN! I honestly expected to feel the same way as I did with previous games but this game has just the right amount of everything I find interesting.  I found myself grabbing this game during every free moment.First, the story.  The basic theme is that a bus crashes in a small suburb of Seattle and a few conduits (or bio-terrorists, depending on who's side you're on), escape.  Our protagonist inadvertently exposes himself to one of these conduits and inherits conduit powers.  I won't spoil the story beyond that but it involves a trek to Seattle which leads to lots of fighting and tons of side missions that are actually fun and interesting.  I usually found the side missions in games like GTA and Saints Row to be boring and felt like they interrupted the main missions more than enhanced them.  The side missions in Infamous all mesh perfectly together and feel more like one big cohesive unit rather than disjointed individual pieces.  Another factor that jacks up the excitement level is the acquiring of additional and stronger powers.  You start out with smoke but gather other powers as the game progresses.  The graphics of this game are jaw-dropping for a console and must be seen to be believed on the PS4. Once again, I won't spoil it by revealing all the powers you can acquire, but you will enjoy collecting them, trust me.  By game's end, I acquired every power and upgrade possible for my karma selection.  Speaking of karma, you're forced to choose wether you want to follow the good or bad karma storyline at the beginning of the game.  The choices you make will affect your karma level which ultimately affects your abilities and upgrades.  I completed the game on good karma and I'm about to replay it on the bad karma selection.If you're a casual gamer like me who really needs a special game that sets itself apart from the pack, this is the one.

I got it the instant it came out on the Xbox 360 (pre- PC) and I loved it. It was like NOTHING else and it was brilliant. When the first sequel came out multiplatform (PS3 and PC got it same day as 360) I was there Day One as well. I watched as newcomer PS3 fanboys that had been trashing the game/series/license jumped on and some that claimed to have hated the first said they now loved it. Many others said it was too confusing and boring (obviously they hadn't played the first one so they were lost and rightfully so- BioWare had their hand forced by their new masters- EA) The sales were very low on ME2 on the PS3 because of the lack of the first Mass Effect. but at least they had something.I say ALL that because we're talking about ME3- the final chapter in a trilogy. If you want to experience, TRULY experience the ME series- buy it on Xbox 360 or PC. It's the only way to fully grasp the magnitude of the game. There is not only nothing wrong with the ME3 ending, but I thought it was truly brilliant. When I see the level of anger and low ratings on the stars here- it makes me furious. Any PS3 gamers or 'just coming in' 360 or PC gamers shouldn't be allowed to complain about a 3rd game in a trilogy they didn't play all the way through. And I'd say that you new buyers that read this- Don't Start Here. Buy ME1, beat it, then 2, beat it, then 3... beat it. It makes all the difference in the galaxy.And as for that ending that is so mixed up in the so called community. It's very thought invoking. There aren't monster explosions. There aren't fireworks. This makes it somehow NOT for kiddies, and that makes it bad??? it's a great ending. If you're a reader- especially if you've read the ME books- you'll really love the ending as much as I did. It makes you think. It makes you earn it and it's worth every second of it (and every praise the media has given it). These angry kids or just plain ignorant adults acting like kids, shouldn't be a reason to miss out on this amazing game.If you have Kinect- you'll love it with this game. It adds a whole new level of fun to the game. If you don't have Kinect- think about it. If you can pick up the Col. Ed. do it; the extra content is great and well worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"abe \"starman\"","summary":"FINALY!A COWBOY GAME!","reviewText":"this game is pretty cool.ive been waiting since forever for a down and out shoot em up and rip em down cowboy game like this  ever since my imagination was  born.theres everything youd want in an old west video game like showdowns,saloons,whisky,brothels,and of course really big boo boos.the blood and guts was a bit more than i expected.and i dont know what the inventors of this game have against carnies but MAN!

{"product_name":"B002673XJA","reviewerName":"Pecos Bill","summary":"This game is a train wreck.","reviewText":"This game is baffling.Normally, I can tell you that Cryptic is a game company that releases a solid game engine with a good, if shallow game design.  They've never been a company that releases \"epic\" games but what they've done in the past has at least been fun with some interesting gameplay elements and decent design ideas, fully implemented.With Star Trek Online, I can't say that.  The game is basically a wreck.  There's a good engine behind it, good artwork, some good \"look and feel\" of Star Trek but so very much of this game is poorly designed, poorly thought out and apparently hastily thrown together in ways that often make no sense.  Whoever designed this game should, for their own good, go back to whatever they were doing previously and never be allowed near game design again.  What they have done here is simply terrible.  There's probably a law against what they have done here.The skills are a mess.  At some point they're going to have to sit down and redesign them.  The skill system itself isn't bad but the actual skills you can train up are poorly defined and poorly thought out.  Some of them are clearly a waste to train in.  It's like they came up with a list of 10 good skills that made sense, realized they needed a lot more than that and just threw down the first things that came to mind, whether it was a good idea or not, whether it made sense or not.Federation gameplay is not very well thought out.  You will frequently find yourself alone in your ship wasting entire legions of what should be far more powerful enemy ships.  Granted this is standard MMORPG fare (\"You must kill 30 of the dangerous Bugbeasts of Blatterthorp!  Their teeth are razor sharp!  Their eyes can kill a man just by.... oh, you're back already?  Already killed all 30?  Huh.  Well nevermind then.\") but it's just a bit more inexcusable to use that old formula in a game that's supposed to be Star Trek.  Yes, the Enterprise was a powerful ship but no, it never went off and killed 5 squadrons of 3 Klingon Birds of Prey singlehandedly.  You'll do this in roughly every other mission in Star Trek Online, however.  By the time you make it to level 10 you'll probably have been responsible for killing what must have been thousands of alien crewmen because you've killed so very many ships.Basically, a good Star Trek RPG is going to have to innovate a little bit when it comes to mission design and Cryptic clearly did not do that.  They followed the usual MMORPG one-man-army hack-and-slash model and it just doesn't make sense for this setting.  The combat mechanics are fun and interesting but the actual design of the content is just....thoughtless.And while this game has a playable Klingon faction and PvP between the Federation and the Klingons, it's very poorly designed and rampant with bugs.  Cryptic did say that Klingon content was going to be \"spartan\" but they should have said \"broken and poorly designed\".  The PvP game design actually has taken a step backwards from Champions Online, which I also find baffling.  The game makes no effort to ensure that the teams are even before starting a match; most maps are simply 5v5 deathmatches; what maps have mechanics behind them are unintuitive (just you go on and try to figure out how you can tell when a capturable point has really been captured).  Klingons themselves still have broken vendors limiting their access to gear a full 3 weeks after release.  I mean, I understand that Klingon content is \"spartan\" but you guys can't even get the VENDORS checked out and working properly after 3 weeks?  That's just terrible.And endgame content - Cryptic's motto for game development has always been \"what do you mean, 'endgame content'?\"  It's just not something they do.  I have long since come to accept that.  Normally what you do in a Cryptic game is roll 8 different characters and level them up because there's great diversity in character builds but Star Trek Online doesn't even have that.  It has no apparent endgame, you only get 3 character slots and even if you had more than 3 you probably wouldn't have much use for it.And for all this they're talking about \"microtransactions\", using real money for in-game perks and extras and they're selling \"lifetime subscriptions\".  Hey buddy, this game isn't really even worth what I already paid for it.  I'm sure not paying more anytime soon and I doubt I'll continue my subscription into the second month, much less pay for a lifetime!  Cryptic needs to stop talking about how they're going to get more money from us and start seriously addressing why this game is so terrible and what they plan to do about it.  I don't want more videos with more voiceovers and more misrepresentation of game content.  I want to see some serious talk, and Cryptic hasn't been doing that.Basically this game is a train wreck.It's sophomoric.  That's the best word for it.  It's like amateur hour in there.  Totally mindless game design rushed through to completion delivering a product reminiscent of a college student who has remembered he has a 10 page paper due tomorrow after a night of heavy drinking.Maybe it was rushed.  Maybe the designer wears his pants on his head.  I don't know what, exactly, the root cause is.  But it's terrible.  Good engine.  Good graphics and sound.  Some good mechanics in there.  Bizarrely bad design elements and gameplay.  I'm frankly baffled that a game company with 3 other MMORPGs under its belt would release something this bad.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}

I thought that Bill Gates was trying to monopolize my beloved pastime, the holy hobby of video games. So I didn't play it, that is, until my friend made me play Halo in the Spring of 2002.My mind was instantly changed.Halo is not just another video game, it's more of an experience that on higher difficulty levels, you don't just play, you survive. The story is well-planned and well-paced, the weapons are oh-so-cool, the digital surround sound helps to hear behind you (online challengers don't stand a chance), the music is stirring and epic, and the graphics are simply jaw-dropping. Nothing I've played in the past year has put these essential components together quite like Bungie Studios has with Halo. Single player missions are a blast, and you actually feel like you are a super-soldier fighting an alien menace on a strange artificial ring-world in the middle of who-knows-where. But playing by yourself misses the thrill of this game completely.Anyone with broadband access can use GameSpy Arcade, download the necessary components, cheaply purchase extra equipment, and go online to show the world what you are made of. Multiplayer separates the kids from the adults more than any other console game I have EVER played. To survive, you must be strategic, yet ruthless. You must know the levels, know how to hide, know how to shoot accurately, and know how to move effectively. Once you take some time to master these skills, you feel like you've accomplished something great...Oh, and if you have friends with copies of Halo, use the biggest room you have to link up 4 XBoxes for 16-player deathmatches (the one catch, every 'Box has to have its own TV). Trust me, nothing brings friends together like 8-on-8 Team Combat. You run to the shotgun room to take care of the weapons cache, Friend #1 runs to the Rocket Launcher for heavy artillery, Friend #2 takes up a sniper position with Active Camouflage (think Predator), Friend #3 waits at the end of the bridge with Fragmentation Grenades, Friend #4 packs a Plasma Rifle to slow down enemies and destroy their shields, Friends #5 and #6 secure medical packs for the squad, while #7 and #8 go freelance and be bait/avengers. And that's just an example of the Slayer mode, where the most kills wins. You've got King of the Hill modes, Capture the Flag, Oddball (he/team that holds the ball for the longest amount of time wins), Races and more. And it's not just mindless killing, all these modes require team strategy and underatanding of the playing field terrain.

Kingdom Hearts 2 takes place 1 year after the events from the original game and this game doesn't dissapoint. ONe thing that is going to be obviously when u first play the game is that there is a new hero name Roxas. Roxas is actually the half of Sora(the main character) and he is trying to figure out why these weird dreams and questionable events are happening to him. THE BEGIINING of the game is kind of slow at first until u pick up a keyblade be cause the begining of the story with Roxas is a 3 hour tutorial of all the things ur gonna run into in the game. I'm not gonna spoil da story but this game is way superior to the original.First of all is the UNBELEIVABLE battle system which is 5x better then da first. The basic Magic and regular atacks are there but there is something called a DRIVE system which allows Sora to transform into a twice as better fighter. Another thing is being able to weild two keyblades, this was an amazing surprise because it was so much fun and much faster to kill when u have two keyblades. ALSO i cannot forget about the new Action command with the triangle button, a much faster way to talk to people ,open up chests, and counter measurement combos. The only thing I didn't like about was the summoning spells-Stitch and Chicken Little I mean nobody cares about these disney characters let alone having an important role such as this in the game.The Music is doned by the one and only Utada Hikaru, which once again comes up with an amazing theme/ending song that is both fitting and satisfying for the game. The orchestra is also breathtaking to the wonderful music for Hollow Bastion to the light hearted beat for Twilight Town. Also the other thing that is upgraded is the Gummi Ship thing. Unlike the first one which was frustrating and a real annoyance, this one is very fun in fact. The battle system is extremely fast at times that it is so confusin yet very authentic. Square Enix was planning to make this more than another mini game, but actually part of the game perse'.THE STORY IS NOT OVER YET-Encounter even more Disney heroes and villians-Travel to amazing worlds you've never experienced-Use powerful new techniques, magic and combination attacks-EWxperience and adventure larger and deeper than beforeENJOY THE GAME THAT WILL SUCK MANY HOURS FROM YOUR LIFE!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2006"}

It has everything a fan of the movie could want. It's like being in the movie, the graphics,detail and gameplay is just perfect. The games only problem is that it sorta rushes itself , I mean the 4th board and you're in Moria already fighting the cave troll. Plus after that part, you're out of Moria without even fighting the Belrog or even seeing it in a  cut movie seen for that matter. Think they cut that out because you can't play as Gandalf and since he's a big part of that part it wouldn't make sense I guess to play it without being him.  Speaking of the cut scenes it's great how it jumps from the actual live action scenes in the movie to the games version of those scenes before each level.Well anyway it's too bad you can't be Gandalf, as that'd be pretty cool. Can't be Frodo either but I'm glad because all through the Moria scene you hear nothing but Frodo whining stuff like &quot;help me Gandalf&quot;, so he's pretty wimpy, lol. You can be Aragorn, Legolis or Gimli though. All in all this game is pretty fun but hard too as you have so many orcs coming at you at once. I read a review that said the game is too short and that you can beat it in 5 hours. Well you have to be really good to beat this game in one day as it's really challenging.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Not Quite There.","reviewText":"I have played and own the original two Tenchu games, and this is been by far the most challenging of the three.  The addition of the new skills gained by the original two characters and the addition of Tesshu is great.  The controls are still a bit on the sticky side of things, but overall, still the same as the original.  The weapons and control actually resembles the second Tenchu rather than the first.  The level design has also been drastically improved, featuring different environments and designed to actually look somewhat realistic.  Additionally, from a level design standpoint, the use of boss fights as an initial startoff (and ending in others -- and sometimes both) is actually inventive.  However, the movements of the characters are still a wee bit awkward, making them look like they're constipated (e.g., the characters in The Getaway).  Even the bosses are better -- making good use of the bosses from the second Tenchu and adding some more.  For example, Onikage and Tatsmaru return as bosses. Even the head honcho resembles the head boss in the first Tenchu, which is entertainment in of itself.  The stealth animations are particularly cool, especially Tesshu's.  The storyline is still similar to the originals, like a bad martial arts B-movie...The criticisms lie in two things.  First, the AI of the enemy is still catatonic.  If you expect Splinter Cell, this isn't it.  Second, sometimes, the fighting system works against you and not for you.  The collision factor is sometimes a bit weak.The ending of this game mentions that the story will continue, but hopefully, in the next and future additions, they make some more improvements game-wise.  The use of shadows and even sound, as Splinter Cell does, would greatly improve this game as well.  Overall, this game is a keeper...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2003"}

When this game first came out, it seemed to be the only thing people talked about.  Yet today, with 5 Mario Parties in the collection, this one still is wonderful for being the base roots.Just like any of the other Mario Parties, you choose which character you'd like to be, Mario, Luigi, ect.  The object of the game is to go around the board and collect Stars.  Stars come at a price, 20 coins.  To get 20 coins, you must win mini games or land on blue spots.  This is like an advanced board game for the N64, but with a twist.  In addition to the board game aspect of this game, after everyone takes 1 turn a mini game takes place.Competitions in this mini game include:Everyone against eachother1 Vs 32 Vs 2This is where the intense fun comes on.  You and your friends button smash, spin the analog stick to your hearts content.  As a matter of fact, so much button smashing (fast taps on the buttons)takes place that gloves came out for this game to protect your hand.  Be warned, if you're too competitive with this particular Mario Party, you may wind up with a blistered palm or sore fingers.It's overall pure fun.  Games can last for hours and hours if you really want.  Though playing a board game on a console sounds dull, this game completely opposite of that!If you want a great N64 game...this is a must buy.If you are interested in this game, but don't want to play an older console anymore or don't have a N64, I recommend Mario Party 4 and 5 for the Nintendo Gamecube.  Exceptionally fun, with  quite a bit less dangerous button smashing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2004"}

It became so big, that every single thing had to be topped off to the next level of excitement, and so on down the line.With Mario Party for Nintendo 64, they had absolutely no idea of how successful it has become. The game features your choice of six characters to choose from, Wario, Mario, Peach a.k.a. Princess Toadstool, Yoshi, Luigi, and Donkey Kong. The object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by winning several different types of games including Tug O' War, where it is 1 player vs. 3 players, Bombs Away, where you have to try stay on a floating island for 30 seconds, without getting the shock from cannon shots coming, and there is Deep Sea Divers, where you have to collect as many treasure chests as possible, without losing your breath. There are also six different kinds of boards to play the game on, as well as two very special hidden boards, so look out.It is a shame that most games didn't seem to be like Mario Party.

Uncharted 2 fixed many gameplay mechanics that weren't as refined in Drake's Fortune. I won't argue otherwise. However, despite getting a more polished sequel -- which is still one of the best games out there -- Uncharted: Drake's Fortune will always remain my favorite in this great series.You ask why this is my favorite if the sequel improved upon fundamental gameplay mechanics? Because this wasn't a globetrotting adventure, but a more self-contained story that includes the jungle environment, a fun story with the most consistent cast of characters to date, etc. The problem I have with the stories in the sequels is that they never felt as compact and tight as Drake's Fortune. Don't get me wrong, they're still great, but Drake's Fortune is pretty much the Indiana Jones game I always wanted.With beautiful graphics, a tremendously told story, and fun gameplay -- which was, arguably, improved in sequels -- Drake's Fortune will always be my favorite Uncharted.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

Little Deviants is COMPLETE garbage. I played it one, I was so bored. Its even weirder than Little Big Planet, but at least Little Big Planet is FUN! Wouldn't even buy it for $10. The case it comes with is actually really good. Not worth $50 or even $25 though. I REALLY should have waited... That is just the bundle though. The SYSTEM is... AMAZING! I'm LOVING it! Even with its currently slim library of games, I currently have Little Deviants, Uncharted Golden Abyss, which I have played through about 4 times, and Unit 13, of which I have platinum. Also Motorstorm RC, of which I am 1 trophy away from platinum, and I won't get it cause its the Pitwall one. Anyways, I was going to get Resistance, but heard of the shoddy reviews its been getting, and decided to wait until it is substantially cheaper. Although, I do have Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified, Assassins Creed III: Liberation, and Need For Speed: Most Wanted on my list for games to get... I'm hoping for more. But other than the games, the system itself is brilliant, the screen is beautiful, the analogue sticks are... decent, and the touch screen is very responsive. Best screen on any portable device I've ever seen, in looks and touch. The analogue sticks are good, but not PS3 quality. I can tell first person shooters will be difficult to play, Uncharted was a bit awkward, but Unit 13 was good due to the HIGH aim assist. They will, however, be great for racers. Motorstorm RC was great, and Asphalt demo played really well with them. The battery is NOT nearly as bad as its made to be. I've gone more than 5 hours playing Uncharted without a charge. That was, of course, when wireless communications were disabled, but still, that game is quite demanding. Well, all in all, the system is solid, and I would say once the game library expands, then the system is a must buy for any gamer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2012"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

The explosion destroys a few blocks of the city, and leaves the government to quarantine the city. After the explosion, Cole receives some superhero powers which make him both hated and loved by many. Not only is he able to shoot electricity from his hands, but he can jump from 10-story tall buildings without being hurt. For the most part, inFamous is a game with a very interesting story that is told through personal conversations, narration and the game's very unique comic book style cutscenes which are a great change of pace. The thing that separated inFamous from many other superhero games is the karma system, which allows you to make at the moment decisions between thinking about only self-gain, or about everybody else. The karma system works well, and playing through the game as both a Hero and Infamous really shows the contrast between the choice between thoughtful and selfish. Not only do your decisions affect the way you look, but they also change how the city looks and what kind of abilities you can use.Throughout the course of the game, you have the ability to use electricity in many different ways, such as firing electrical grenades and shooting electricity rockets. The use of special abilities requires the consumption of energy, which is replenished by drawing power from the cities many sources of electricity. Not only does drawing energy replenish the energy meter, but it also heals Cole's health. The game also features a terrific platforming mechanic similar to the Assassin's Creed and Uncharted titles. Climbing up buildings and scaling walls has never been so satisfying, but at the same time can be a little too slow during some of the more complex missions. The core gameplay of inFamous is very satisfying, and really works well with the highly detailed city, and the mission-based progression that the game follows.Controls:One of the most outstanding elements of inFamous are the spot-on controls. Cole is very easy to control and moving about the city is both fun and exhilarating. Both the offensive and defensive abilities are very quick to reply to controller inputs, and make for some very intense gameplay. Reflecting rockets with the shockwave ability on a dime is one of the many scenarios that play out and help fortify the fact that the game just feels great.Graphics:inFamous isn't a particularly great-looking game, but the level of detail is commendable. The textures throughout the city are great for the most part, and many of the buildings and objects are rich with detail. The character models are good but could have used some work, and the facial animations are some of the worst I have seen in years. Also, some textures in the game just aren't up to par with the other textures. Not to mention that there is a lot of visual pop-in, and the water is very poor-looking. With that said, excluding character animation, the game looks good and the visual effects are definitely one of the finer qualities of the game.Sound:The storytelling of inFamous is mostly done through audio and thankfully the quality of the voice-acting is great. Many veteran voice-actors such as Phil LaMarr made their way into the game, and did a great job of giving the characters life. The sound effects of the game are great and really bring out the essence of the game world. To top that off, the music is well-orchestrated and sets a tone throughout the game.Replay Value:inFamous is relatively short and can usually be beaten in about 12-hours. The game doesn't have multi-player, but does have a lot of things to find and unlock. Finding all 350 shards and finishing all of the game's side-missions takes a great deal of time. Also, the ability to play as both good and evil means that playing it a second time is a must, and that combined with all of the things to find and do makes for about a 30-35 hour experience.Rating:Story: 9.0Gameplay: 8.5Graphics: 8.0Controls: 9.5Sound: 9.5Replay Value: 8.5Overall: 8.8Own, Rent, Avoid:Own: Not only is inFamous a fun game to play, but the story is compelling. inFamous is a must-try for every Playstation 3 owner.Last Thoughts:inFamous is arguably the best superhero video game made to date. Not only is it easy to jump into, but is fun for just about everyone. The combat is somewhat limited but satisfying, and coupled with the great story makes for a terrific experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"S P","summary":"Spectacular Fanservice","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past introduced many of the great traditions of the series with its release for the Super Famicom (Super Nintendo) on November 21, 1991 in Japan. Now that world comes full circle with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, released for the Nintendo 3DS on November 22, 2013 in North America.NOSTALGIAThe references to and carryovers from A Link to the Past make this game incredibly special. They are tastefully incorporated to leave a balance between nostalgic content and fresh content. I didn't feel like I was playing A Link to the Past again - rather, I felt this was a new game inspired by the original. If you enjoyed A Link to the Past you may literally scream with delight when you encounter certain carryovers from that game.STORYI think of Zelda games as retellings of the same basic story: literally, Link saving Zelda from Ganon; figuratively, the danger of greed and power, and the importance of courage. The plot here is familiar, along similar lines as A Link to the Past; Ocarina of Time follows a similar pattern. It can sometimes be too simplistic, but is deeper than with most handheld Zelda games. The ending is astoundingly good. It's one of my favorites from the series.CHARACTERSThe people that call Hyrule their home are well thought out and usually likable, although some can seem rather childish and simple. More so than in many Zelda games, they are engaging to speak with, encouraging you to venture outside the main quest. I spent a good amount of time in a village just going door to door and talking to people. There is a healthy mix of old stars - seeing some cameos from old characters made me absolutely delighted. The game also introduces a large cast of new characters, which keeps things interesting.ITEMSA Link Between Worlds features a clever system that marks a departure from other games. Instead of finding items in the dungeons, you can rent and purchase them from a store. This system is refreshing simply because it's different. While I would probably not want it as a mainstay of the series, it provides a nice break from the regular method of finding items.COLLECTION QUESTSA staple of the series, collection quests are back and as engaging as always. You'll find yourself collecting 100 of a certain thing - encouraging you to venture across the land to find where they're all located. It's a clever way of encouraging exploration. While they are often found in plain sight some are rather tricky to get to, forcing you to use your special abilities and problem solving skills.MUSICThe music is superb as with every title in the series. Many of the tunes from A Link to the Past are brought back, but in a remixed form that makes them fresh and modern. Tracks are well-suited to the areas in which they play. The overworld themes stay true to the original while adding a depth not possible in the days of the Super Nintendo.GRAPHICSSuperb. They fit the game extremely well. They may look cartoony but are sophisticated and carefully drawn. It's something of a cross between top-down sprite graphics from The Minish Cap and cel-shaded 3D graphics from The Wind Waker. While you can see similarities between this style and the style of the previous DS Zelda titles (Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks), this style seems more mature.The game incorporates 3D throughout making for sumptuous views on the 3DS screen. Puzzles also take advantage of depth perception. You'll want to play with the 3D slider one, both to solve puzzles and simply to take in the world in such a magnificent way.CONTROLSA Link Between Worlds was clearly designed hand in hand with the 3DS hardware. Controls are smooth and responsive - much better than A Link to the Past. You control movement using the Circle Pad (an analog stick), giving you much more precision and control than with an eight-directional D-pad. Link also moves more easily, walking and turning in a more fluid way. Simply walking around is a joy to itself. The control mappings also feel intentional, with the D-pad actually serving a unique role (viewing other areas of the screen) rather than duplicating the functionality of the analog stick. The touch screen isn't used much, but it's useful for inventory management and map viewing. Gone is any control gimmickry - the controls are designed to the task at hand rather than to show off the capabilities of the system.LENGTHMy only considerable gripe with this game is the length. I wanted the game to last several dozen hours but I finished in a bit less than twenty. Those twenty hours were absolutely joyful and packed with adventure - which is all the more reason I wish the game was longer. The content after the game will keep you busy for a while, but you can conceivably be finished with everything you want to do by 30 hours. On the positive side, this title lacks the filler content that made Skyward Sword and Spirit Tracks feel interminable. The game doesn't last longer than it needs to, meaning that what does exist is carefully thought out and exceedingly well executed.CONCLUSIONPut simply, I had enormous fun with this game. It's packed with nostalgic references and is a sheer joy to play. The puzzles are interesting, the storyline is appealing, and the attention to detail is superb. Play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"It comes close to portable gaming perfection","reviewText":"We've been a PS3 household ever since the 60GB version came about so, with two pre-teens in the house, we were ripe for a PSP adoption. We actually bought the Ratchet & Clank Pack for a few dollars more because one of my kids was a fan of the game.The Core Pack includes the following:- The PSP 3000 itself in shiny black (a fingerprint magnet)- Manual, promos, registration card, etc.Given the PSP's built-in Wi-Fi and its PS3 integration you can do quite a few things out of the box if you have Wi-Fi or a PS3 but, for a better gaming experience you are going to need a memory stick and, of course, some games. Our bundle came with a 1GB Memory Stick Pro Duo card but we are planning to store a few movies when taking it on the road so we ordered an 8GB. Movies take about 0.5GB. We can still use the 1GB that came with the bundle in a camera.First impressions:I was surprised of how good and versatile and elegant this little console can be. It has most of the PS3 buttons, including one analog joystick, the display is large and bright, the resolution is good (480x272), and it responds quickly to controls. It appears to be solidly built. Unlike prior models, this one comes with a built-in microphone while the sound output can be either through the internal speakers headphones (not included). After charging the battery, my kid was up and running and happy in no time. But, let me proceed with a more structured discussion.Stand alone operation (disconnected):The PSP 3000 will play games or movies delivered on UMD discs or off a Memory Stick card. In addition, it will display photos and play music stored on the Memory card.Networking and Internet connectivity:The built-in Wi-Fi allows the PSP 3000 to access the Playstation Netowork and Playstation Store directly. Off the box, there is an Internet browser, a Search (the Internet) function, several Internet Radio applications and the ability to use the PSP as a Skype phone for as long as one has a Skype account and the PSP happens to be within the range of a Wi-Fi hotspot.PS3 Integration:After the PSP is paired with the PS3, the PS3 can 'push' video, photos, music and even PSP games downloaded from the Playstation Store when connected through a USB wire. When wireless, the PSP can basically take over the PS3 - actually display the PS3's own screen and display photos stored on the PS3, play music stored on the PS3. Movie play is not supported.Interestingly, when playing music, it's possible to play it on the PSP's on speakers/headphones or have the PS3 play it itself, the PSP therefore acting as a remote control device.I suspect that additional capabilities exist that I am not aware of yet.PC integration:Through a USB connection, the PC will see the PSP's memory card as an attached drive. This will allow for music, photo or movie files to be transferred directly to the PSP.Room for improvement:The PSP 3000 comes very close to being the perfect portable game-playing (and more) machine, at least in the Sony universe. Perfection would be achieved if the 'keyboard' interface were improved - it's awful now - if it had touch screen capabilities and if file transfers from the PS3 were possible wirelessly. Also on the wish list, I hope that there were more legal 'digital copy' movies available for the PSP.Rating:It's a 4.5 stars plus, rounded up to 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2009"}

My first full use of this was listening to \"When will Jesus Bring the Pork Chops\" by George Carlin while watching the back gate of paddock area during a racing event that had temperatures as high as a hundred and ten.  While in a dorm laundry mat during another away trip I passed the time tear assing around Liberty City.When the PSP debut in 2005 (wow, has it really been seven years?) the PSP also debut a new media format, the Universal Media Disc. Just like the Minidisc was a miniature CD, the UMD is a miniature DVD that can hold almost 2 gigabytes of information (1.8 gigs dual layer), large enough to hold a two and half hour movie. Lack internal memory storage, the PSP uses the Memory Stick Duo to hold information that can store up to 32 gigs of data.The graphics of a typical PSP game where somewhere between a PS1 and a PS2. Outside of game cut scenes , if there are any, characters' faces are frozen and the decals are minimal, hair rarely swings in the breeze or movement and most hands are like mittens with finger lines. Fluid dynamic are hit or miss, water, and fire are not impressive but can still pass with some degree. However blood effects really suffer, M-rated games that relay on gore are only able to generate a thick red mist. But it's not all gloom. The PlayStation Online Store (access only through Media Go) has many of the popular original PS1 games like \"Syphon Filter\", \"Metal Gear Solid\" and \"Wing Commander IV\" for sale.Despite all the PSP limitations and short comings, it's still has a good collection of games. There are dozens spin offs for Sony's exclusive titles like \"Grand Theft Auto\", \"Final Fantasy\", and \"God of War\", with a good sections of PSP exclusive titles and ports of other games.If there is one bad thing about the PSP, it is its battery. Power is gobbled up through game and movie watching, sucking the battery life to just three hour, but with MP3 blaring you can make it last up to seven hours.I will still use my PSP primary as a MP3 player, but at some point, when I have the disposable income, I will buy a PS Vita.It's been a good trip.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BRQN2EM","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Presidential Chaos","reviewText":"Over the course of the past week, I've done several things that I have never even thought possible in video games. Piloting a spaceship and shooting down enemies as Haddaway's \"What Is Love\" blasts into my ears. Running up the side of a building to face down enemies while wielding elemental superpowers and a laser sword that disintegrates all that it touches. And, oh yes, using a gun powered by dubstep to blow apart the inside of a 1950's sitcom. So many new experiences, but not from several games. Because these past few weeks, I've only been playing \"Saints Row IV\", and it's already one of my favorite games of this generation.After the events of the fiercely entertaining but ultimately flawed \"Saints Row The Third\", the player-created leader of the Saints (known only as The Boss) has somehow found his or her self in the position of POTUS. But players don't have much time to bask in presidential glory, because within the first 20 minutes, Earth is invaded by aliens, the White House is blown up, and you're slapped in a computer simulation of a 1950's sitcom. Once you break up, you find Earth has been blown up, and the only way to get even with the alien menace is to get inside a simulation of Steelport, Stilwater, and other locations. Oh, yeah, you also have superpowers this time around. As in, almost every conceivable type of power you can think of.If this story sounds a bit silly, please let me dispel that thought. The writers have crafted something that is not only a bit silly, but instead is downright stupid, immature, and borderline nonsensical. However, it is because of this that it is an unparalleled success in the industry. Most games that attempt comedy do it in the entirely wrong ways. \"Portal 2\" is the most recent success, and even that was only marginally amusing to me. SRIV takes the gonzo approach of sending up anything and everything, including itself. The most ludicrous movies, pop culture from multiple decades, and especially video games are sent up in the most loving method imaginable.Not only that, but the story itself isn't half-bad. Aping elements from \"Mass Effect\", \"The Matrix\", and \"They Live\", the narrative is equally as compelling as it is ridiculous. Not only that, but it's filled with some of the most likable characters in video game history. Most major characters from every SR game are here, including Johnny Gat, Kinzie Kensington, Shaundi (both SR2 and SR3 versions of her), Ben King... and many, many more. Not only that, but the narrative directly recalls events, locales, and even minor in-game brands from all games. In terms of a great narrative, excellent characters, and ingenious fan service, SRIV is an unparalleled success.Same goes for the gameplay. When players aren't walking around the hub world of the ship, or immersed in a side simulation, they're running free in the relatively large virtual Steelport. And I do mean \"free.\" This time around, with the superpowers thrown into the mix, the open world feels as if it's positively brimming with possibilities. Do you fly a jet to bomb a swarm of enemies, or freeze them with your powers from hundreds of feet in the air? Do you plow through cars in a take or sports car, or use your super speed to plow through them? Shotguns or telekinesis? Grenades or a tank? If you like variety, then you're in luck, because there's virtually no wrong way to go about playing this game. It takes the best elements from every open-world game this generation and mixes it into the brimming pot, resulting in a zesty blend of varied action.That's not the only good news, however. With THQ's somewhat oppressive grip on the franchise loosed, Volition no longer has to slice off content and sell it off as DLC. Instead, this game offers a daunting amount of things to do and to unlock in any given playthrough. Your minimap will be absolutely flooded with side-quests, side-missions, activities, and little trinkets to pick up. As a longtime gamer, I was floored by the amount of variety and depth the game offered, with far more content than \"Grand Theft Auto IV\" and \"Far Cry 3\", and seemingly as much as any given Bethesda game. For a game that many people dismiss as \"too silly\", that's a pretty big accomplishment.All this, and the game sounds great too. The voice actors are all over-the-top and ridiculous, especially Daniel Dae Kim as Johnny Gat, Natalie Lander as Kinzie, and JB Blanc as the delightfully villainous Zinyak. On top of that, Keith David plays himself in one of the best self-lampooning performances I've ever heard, and Roddy Piper shows up as himself during a mission that is based, verbatim, off of the climax of \"They Live.\" On top of this, the soundtrack is incredible. On top of the score, which covers almost every conceivable genre, the 109 licensed tracks are stellar. Aerosmith, Kendrick Lamar, OutKast, Stan Bush, Junkie XL, Biz Markie... the list goes on. Once again, \"variety\" is the best word that can be used to describe your experience with the music and voice acting.I've saved the worst for last, because it really seems like a trivial complaint in the face of everything else. But it must be said: this game isn't really the best in the graphics department, at least on consoles. While it certainly isn't horrible to look at, the game suffers from some low-res textures in a lot of areas, and the shading in the game is a bit dark, which makes it hard to see every little detail of your custom character at times. It seems to me that the disc is so full of content that it had to take a hit somewhere, and that \"somewhere\" was in the visuals. Again, these are not bad graphics by a long shot, but it certainly isn't as pretty to look at as, say, \"Saints Row The Third.\"Hopefully, though, you're not a graphics snob (and if you are, just play it on the PC), because you'd be a fool to pass this game up for such a trivial reason. In all my years of playing video games, no other interactive experience has made me cackle with as much glee, amusement, and unbridled joy as \"Saints Row IV.\" It is, from start to explosive finish, something that must be played to be believed. Every little twist and turn of the experience, your expectations are toyed with. Volition, not content to be great at one thing, decided to through almost every genre of game at the wall and see what stuck. Luckily for us, it all stuck, and what we're left with is one of those rare games that I will say, without a doubt, is worth the full 60 bucks.\"Saints Row IV\", despite some graphical and technical issues, is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played, and one of this years finest. If you want to bust a gut while busting caps, then this is the game for you.Plot: 10Gameplay: 9.5Graphics: 8.5Sound: 10Overall: 9.5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000E0VMVM","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"A nice continuation,but a bit too far into left field (minor spoilers)","reviewText":"So, with the X-box 360 becoming affordable even proud retro geezers like me will move  on soon. However that is not to say the ps-2 is useless or obsolete especially when it comes to worthwhile RPGS. One of the best and most sadly under appreciated rpg franchise is Shadow-Hearts. With adult themes, an alternate history set in our world, slap stick humor, weird allies, and references that the characters actually think about \"sex\" it was sort of the  \"anti-final fantasy\". It also introduced the judgement ring system, an exciting slice of probability that made you time each button press on the wheel of fortune carefully. The ring of fate added an exciting twist to the usual turn based formula and you did have to pay attention a lot more instead of just punching in a command. The judgement ring was also  used for bartering with merchants for discounts and starting with SH Covenant you could string combos together between characters.From the New-World is the newest in the series. How does it stack up? I'd say its' definitely worth having and a charming odd gem just like its' predecessors. However those of us that loved the tragic yet bitter sweet relationship between Yuri and Alice Elliot do feel a bit sad to see them go. It had to happen, Yuri cannot fight evil forever and the good ending from covenant suggested he found a way to change fate and be with Alice at long last. A hero deserves to \"retire\" after two lengthy quests of fighting his own inner demons and the forces of malice around him.The immediate problem I had with ftnw was I couldn't relate to the young spirited detective Johnny Garland as much as I could to Yuri. Yuri was a man. He'd swear, he'd drink, and before he was even in love with Alice he wanted to get in her pants. He was a nice guy sure, but he was a realistic nice guy. Johnny on the other hand is only 16 (hard to believe a 16 year old would be a detective) and he was definitely tailored for younger players. This is not \"bad\" entirely. Its' just people that were fans of the other two slightly more serious and mature games might be put off at first.If anything ftnw gives you a few unexpected surprises. First of all Johnny is not a harmonixer. That honor belongs to Shania and I kept debating if in fact she was the lead. She is also a better fighter so Johnny seems weaker by comparison.So what is all this about? Johnny was in a tragic accident and lost his father and twin sister in a nasty blaze. Though he could have lived off his father's inheritance he chose to be a detective instead. Why? Apparently Johnny has lost many of his memories and he surmises being a super sleuth will dig something up. In the mean-time Shania and her stoic gun toting warrior companion Natan spend time as bounty hunters hunting malice creatures. As expected Johnny's first case to find someone that evaded paying his bail turns into a terrifying encounter with the denizens of the abyss. Shania and Natan save Johnny and things grow from there.Is this story as strong as Covenant's? While I can say it does get better it is definitely more \"cliche\" though not on an entirely negative note. As before ftnw is a fan of weaving an alternate history and this time the time line is set during the great depression. You will help Al Capone escape from prison, interact with Elliot Ness the detective, trek through the Grand Canyon to help Shania get another fusion form and to help Natan capture big foot, save everyone's favorite little eccentric wizard Roger Bacon from Area 51, and confront mad college professors that create \"monsters\" in their spare time just for kicks.  As you see there are subtle nods to the first two games.Perhaps the thing that upset me the most is the most enigmatic alluring characters are the bad guys or npcs. Al Capone's younger sister Edna is soft spoken, kind hearted, and sexy as hell in her tight red dress yet though she could have been a great healer akin to Alice she is reduced to nothing more than a plot piece. Killer is a red haired Yuri look-alike but disappointingly he is not tied to Yuri in any way. Lady likewise looks exactly like Alice Elliot yet she is opposed to you during every step of your journey and likewise is not tied to the other games save for very obscure references. I'm not saying that the characters you do get are crap, but the most interesting and well thought out ones pitch for the other team. Basically you will feel like you are the \"under dog coach\" left with the people no one else wanted and you are expected to make them into a formidable fighting force.While Ricardo the guitar-gun toting musician, Natan, and Shania all are pretty serious and have  decent motivations to stay with you the other half of the team is comic relief. There is Old Frank the vigilante American ninja, Mao a drunken master giant cat, and Joachim's cute yet unruly little vampire sister Hilda that unlocks different abilities by using \"calories\" to become \"thin\" or \"fat\". If you thought the previous cast was \"odd\" suffice it to say you have not seen nothing yet!Luckily even the silly characters have beneficial abilities in battle and everyone has their own side missions to power up their abilities.The play mechanics add charging stocks but other-wise the judgement ring system is near identical. To me, stringing combos together was much easier this time and I enjoyed how you had to think about what types of attacks would temporarily knock down and disable enemies.In the end ftnw is still fun to play and keeps you curious about what is around the next bin. While I do think Nautilis/X-seed were a bit over excessive with the cheesy humor that alone does not warrant calling ftnw a bad game. Unless you are a jaded elitist that expects every incarnation of the series to be like the first two games you should enjoy this one immensely!Pros.+ An interesting new alternate history set during the great depression.+ Ring system keeps the game play as fun and addictive as ever.+ Interacting with historic icons such as Al Capone and Elliot Ness.+ The out-door level designs are beautiful.+Mostly great voice acting and music throughout.+ Shania is drop dead sexy. Say what you will but for us guys that is a great incentive!Cons- Not as many fusion forms. Luckily they can all be upgraded through totem fetishes.- Some of the characters could have been \"subtly humorous\" instead of \"outright ridiculous\".- Story line may seem a bit weaker to serious fans.- Johnny while lovable in his own right has a very difficult time filling Yuri's shoes.- Towns are as small and cramped as ever. This doesn't make sense in places such as Chicago and New York that should be sprawling metropolises.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2008"}

There was never anyone online to play it with, none of my friends heard of it and some of the missions were too hard for me to do by myself (I was a noob to that kind of game).  Quickly it caught on and in the past few years, seems like everyone has now played Borderlands and someone is always online to play with and go kill some bandits!  When a sequel was officially announced by 2K and Gearbox, everyone woke up to how truly awesome the series is.Now the sequel came out, since day 1 I've been playing it at least once a day.  There is like 10 times more guns and loot.  One of the codes I got for preordering gives me a higher chance of enemies dropping rare items so as early levels I had stuff that required level 20 or something.  The graphics are still the comic style Borderlands had, just a little better and more detail in things.  The coolest things I noticed is the sounds of walking.  I know it sounds weird, but I have a good headset and especially in the snow, sounds ultra realistic.This game is much harder than the first.  The new creatures and new types of enemies they added require almost to play with at least 1 other person with a different class.  The skill tree expansion is great.  The badass skill points are great.  There's almost nothing about this game I can complain about.  I used to get frustrated when I died so much, but having my buddy play with me, we're unstoppable.

It feels a type of hard plastic material, but not metal at all. The strap in itself is a bit on the weaker side, but the details on the ring make up for it. It is a very well made product.

I'll discuss the different modes of the game in their respective sections below:CAMPAIGN:MW2 provides an epic single-player campaign that provides lots of action, a good story, and lots of replay value. You mostly play as 2 characters, Sgt. Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson, a member of Task Force 141, an elite force used for hazardous missions, and Pvt. James Ramirez, a US Army Ranger. The story is set in the near future, 5 years after Call of Duty 4. Many favorite characters return, and lots of new ones are added as well. The campaign is a decent size, and the missions are lots of fun, except two that I simply hated, especially on Veteran. Veteran difficulty is pretty hard, but I'm just a decent player and completed it in under a week. There is one mission of the game that has sparked a lot of controversy, where you play as an undercover CIA agent working with terrorists. You kill mostly innocent civilians in that level, and it is very disturbing, in my opinion. I recommend skipping it when the notification comes up, but you can also skip it any time during the level. It does not count against you completion or achievement-wise if you do skip it. It is sort of a major part of the plot, so if you skip it, I recommend going online to research what happened during that level and why a specific event happened after it. The graphics of this game are top-notch, and are probably better then MW3, in my opinion. There is a lot of variety in the campaign, so it'll keep you entertained for a long time. There are also intel items hidden throughout the campaign, and I recommend looking up a guide online on where to find them if you can't yourself. There is also a bonus mission unlocked upon Campaign completion, and I think that it's very interesting and fun.SPEC OPS:A cool new added feature in MW2 is Spec Ops, where you, by yourself or with a friend, try to complete 23 missions that are normally related to the campaign (they don't spoil it). They mostly involve objectives such as killing a specific number of enemies, beating the race in a specific amount of time, getting to an LZ zone, or disarming bombs. There is lots of variety, and they are all very fun. You also can earn up to 3 Stars for completing the missions, and you can earn up to three, depending on what difficulty you did it on (Regular, Hardened, or Veteran) or, in some cases, in what time you completed an objective. They are pretty fun by yourself, but it is definitely more fun if you play with a friend, especially on the harder missions.MULTIPLAYER:This is one of the most fun things in this game. Classic multiplayer has returned, mostly similar to COD4, but adding loads of new features too. The killstreaks have changed a lot, featuring 15 of them, including new ones such as Care Package (an airdropped crate rewarding you with a random killstreak or ammo), EMP (disables enemy electronics, such as red dot sights and UAVs), and the scariest one for me, Tactical Nuke (ends the game with a bang, winning the game for your team regardless of your points). They're not unlocked all at once, though. When you progress through the different levels, you can unlock ones of your choice. Many new weapons and customization options have been added, such as Heartbeat Sensors, FMJ bullets, and even camo for yoour weapon. This mode provides seemingly endless hours of entertainment. One really annoying thing about it though, if you want to invite a friend to a party, you can't have them in the party while you're playing a game. This is very annoying if a friend is playing another game, so you can't talk to them unless they're playing with you. This is a small con though, and the pros outweigh it.OVERVIEW:MW2 provides you with an excellent campaign, fun spec ops, and addicting multiplayer. It's really a no-brainer to buy this, especially since it's $20-$30.

I would too, judging from what I heard about it from them. I don't think there's any comparison. I'd GLADLY pay the money for it.I would really hate it if they adopted a free online system like PSN, cause that would mean it wouldn't be nearly as awesome as it is now.

{"product_name":"B00A750QIE","description":"","reviewerName":"Fish Hunter \"Eddie\"","summary":"Franchise Mode","reviewText":"I play Franchise Mode 99% of the time and nd this appears to leave a LOT to be desired.  Have only played through 2017.  There are so many differences than with 2012.  This review is exclusively about Franchise mode.PLAYER ACQUISITION:In previous editions player acquisition was based primarily on potential and rating in 5 categories (overall, contact, power, fielding, speed) (A-F).  They've now changed it.  Ratings now are primarily numeric 0-99.  For example, Granderson is about 58 contact vs righties and 48 contact vs lefties.  Power is about 68 vs rigties and 58 vs lefties.  The only alpha grade is given to potential.PRODUCTIONThe numeric grade is ok to me because it does give you a value of what the player should be doing.  However, when Matt Harvey is a 97 overall and goes through seasons with an over 5 ERA there's a problem.  Granderson hitting 217 with 31 homes seems accurate.  Most of my pitchers are mid 80's with ERA's over 4.00 and 5.00.  I am seeing a few with that are under that.AGINGGranderson retired at age 36.  I've never seen anyone retire prior to 38 in other editions and usually between 39-41.  Pitcher Alcevedo went from 94 to 79 over two seasons age 33 & 34.  You'll also see declines in potential.  Had one pitcher get to the bigs as an 85 with B potentiall at age 28.  After the season he was an 81 with C potential.SCOUTINGCompletely changed and not for the better.  Any scout can sout any region.  Your scouting period is only start  of the season to the draft in early June.  Not enough time especially now that you have to &#34;discover&#34;&#34; player before you can actually scout him.  You can give your scouts directives to scout a particular position in a region with particular skills (Speed, Fielding, Contact, etc).  When you go to draft it will tell you how thoroughly a player is scouted.  However, the accuracy of that scout may be off some based on the scouts ability.  My big beef:  I AM SUPPOSED TO CHECK MY SCOUTS DAILY to issue orders if necessary. I'm in franchise mode.  Sometimes I want to skip a couple months but can't because I'll missing obtaining info for the draft. Usually I play two games of every month. Now I go Sunday to Sunday one week at a time, then check my scouts. Would rather the old system where I set which positions to scout and the scouts just did their job.  Set it and forget it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2014"}

I loved the NES Contras (Contra, Super C), the Super NES &quot;Alien Wars&quot; entry (which is my personal favorite Contra to this day), the game boy Operation: C adventure, and Sega's Contra: Hard Corps comes so close to beating out Contra III as my favorite Contra game.  I was saddened, however, after the PSX &quot;attempts&quot; at recreating the Contra franchise... I didn't mind so much that it was 3-D (well, the second game because Konami had promised a 2-D sequel but only the first level was...), but the Contra feeling was lost in those attempts.  It was missing the spark the others had.  When I heard Contra was coming for PS2, I was very skeptical.Needlesstosay, after playing and defeating the game, it was A LOT better than satirical ol' me expected.THE GOODContra's back with a fusion of 2-D and 3-D elements.  The backgrounds are AWESOME and there are several things to watch out for.  The enemies keep coming back at you like nobody's business and the multiplayer option makes it all the better.  The storyline involves one of the two heroes (assuming two, considering Contra III was two-player) from the Alien Wars going insane and becoming the final boss.  All in all, Contra's back with a vengeance.The best aspect:  IT WAS REALLY HARD.  No spoonfeeding, no bad voice acting, no stupid plotholes!  THIS GAME WAS HARD AND REMINISCENT OF THE OLD SCHOOL CONTRA!  Excellent flavors of alien buttkicking.  If you hate this game, it is because you are a fan boy and are blind to cool games.THE BADThe only bad that immediately becomes apparent is the music, which is non sensical heavy metal riffs one after the other.  I love heavy metal, but the material here isn't that great.  Otherwise, not anything that places a critical detriment to the game.OVERALLYOU MUST HAVE THIS PS2 GAME.  IT'S AWESOME, simply put.  You will like this especially if you're a fan of Contra.  Of course, this game was made by the same creators that did the original games (the team that did the PSX failed attempts weren't the same team... needlesstosay, they also did the below average Castlevania installments for the N64).

The game starts out in a tram(sound familiar) and then all hell breaks loose down at black mesa for an unkown cause.  Im sorry, but I do not think that the original half life is even that good, so when this expansion pack came out i was not that excited for it.  Though I wasn't that enthusiastic I picked it up, and once i started playing I officially lost my taste for all half life games.  Even a novice gamer could finish this game in a matter of 4-6 hours of casual playing.  No complex puzzles, terrible sound, terrible graphics even with the new high definition pack, and way to much of the slide effect when walking.  Overall this game is short and leaves gamers unfulfilled, though it does contain opposing force, i still feel the 30 dollar price tag is way to much for a game with uncountable faults.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2001"}
{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"Alucard \"xNosferatux\"","summary":"This is what an ACTION ADVENTURE Combo should be","reviewText":"I preordered this game because it looked promising, and I was familiar with the series. Now that I have played this game, I can safely say that it is an amazing action/adventure game that marks a great beginning to Lara Croft.For starters, the game has beautiful graphics. The environment around you along with the lighting do a great job of making you feel like Lara is really stranded in an island. The cinematography pushes the game to the next level by creating great shots that make the action move along. Lara's outfit changes as the game progresses, which is great because you do not want to have a pretty looking Lara walk around throughout the whole game like nothing has happened despite falling, getting shot, etc.The sound is great. It continues to move the action. The soundtrack is pretty good too, especially Lara's song.I give HUGE KUDOS to Crystal Dynamics for revamping Lara. She no longer has to show off her \"assets\" to prove she can get someone's attention. Her origin story is nicely done. You can see the change from a young adult uncertain about some of her abilities to a more mature woman ready to do anything to survive. This is what makes this new Lara compelling. She is forced to grow up, and she becomes a great female lead without having to show off her body like the past Laras did. I honestly like this Lara better. The past Laras were good...I cannot discredit them, but this new Lara proves that there's strength and beauty in using your head and...guns hahaha without having to be overly sexualized. The voice acting for Lara is very well done as well.The story is great and suits the whole idea of Tomb Raider. Also, exploring is great...what kind of game would this be if you could not raid tombs? lol I thoroughly enjoyed the little puzzles to get from point a to b and discover new tombs.My only pet peeve was that quick time events were used a bit...not as bad as Resident evil 5 or 6. So, it didn't become overwhelming, but I hope that they do not overdo it in a sequel.Overall, this game is amazing. It truly is an action/adventure game unlike other games that claim that combo. The new Lara is a good heroine with great qualities and a good origin story. Congrats again to Crystal Dynamics for the choices that they made, and I hope Square Enix continues to support this franchise in this current path. Would love to see what else they have in store for a potential sequel!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could.

{"product_name":"B002I098JE","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"I am so ashamed of myself . . .","reviewText":"I rented this to try it first. I only play the MP portion of this franchise. I loaded the disk, joined a game, and immediately thought to myself \"wow, this is exactly the same as the last COD.\" Within the first few minutes, on a map I had never played before, I killed five enemy players in a row before I was killed. This was not because I am a highly skilled player (far from it) - it is because this game is so exactly familiar to its previous versions that I was able to just apply my hundreds of hours of prior COD play to this COD version. Sure, the maps are all new. But it doesn't matter - if you just keep moving and shooting like in all the prior CODs you can still be competitive.The graphics are almost the same as prior versions - maybe even a little lower quality. It could also be that they just look so familiar by now that they no longer \"pop.\" The maps are all the same standard, generic, \"fight in the ruins,\" \"fight in the snow,\" \"fight in building to building\" stuff we have all seen so many, many times before. I was certainly let down in the lack of innovation. The COD franchise can sing all they want about how \"revolutionary\" this version is - that is pure marketing BS.The weapons are the same, the game play is the same. But I kept it and played it a second night. Then I kept it and played it a third night. Then I finally returned the rental and went and bought my own copy.This is where my profound shame comes in. I know the game is tired. I know it lacks all innovation. I know the developers should be ashamed that they marketed this game as a \"new\" game when it is really Black Ops 2.5, and COD 3.5. But, damn it - it still sucked me in and I am still having fun playing the multiplayer.I have engaged in some soul searching as to why this is. The best analogy I can come up with is my favorite restaurant. Every time I go there I order my favorite dish. I would be sad if they took it off the menu. I know and expect it will taste exactly the same as it has every other time I order it and that is exactly why I order again and again. Its the same with fast food franchises - I expect it will be the exact same food regardless of which franchise I order it in, anywhere in the world.Apparently this tired, dying, franchise is one of my favorites. I have played all the MW series. I have played both Black Ops. Each time I lament the lack of innovation, the lack of change, yet I still plop down my money and sink countless hours into it. I am a game developer's dream customer.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"S.

I also tried various Xbox games, but none were as good as Ninja Gaiden.  Well I can honestly say that this game is as much fun, if not more, than Ninja Gaiden.  The graphics are not quite as good as Ninja Gaiden on my 94\" diagonal projection system, but I am trying to get the Gamecube component cables to improve the picture quality.  Gameplay is good.  The contols are well designed and the game is not too hard and not too easy.  Save points seem fairly spaced.  One caveat is that you can buy guns, health, but not ammunition.  This forces you to choose your weapon to match your opponent and use it wisely to conserve ammo.  I highly recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2005"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

From the first moment I watched Vault 13's cartoon door slide shut in the Fallout 1 (1997)intro I was hooked on this amazing post-nuclear apocalyptic world inhabited by the Vault Dweller, Super Mutants, cyber-punk Raiders, and the enigmatic Brotherhood of Steel. The series is known for its retro-futuristic look, using art deco of the 1950's in everything from the look of clothes and billboards to the designs of some of the cars you'll find scattered across the wastes, gory body explosions, as well as for its biting sense of dark humor. Having played Fallout 1 & 2 and Fallout Tactics repeatedly I was very much looking forward to Fallout3. Like others I was a bit concerned since I consider the Fallout franchise as firmly belonging to the good people of (the now defunct) Black Isle Studios. But Bethesda picked up the reins and really ran forward with it in a stunning way, let me tell you. I was also a bit antsy about picking up this game as a number of the initial reviews indicated there were terrible bug issues involved, thus my prolonged wait before purchasing.The setting for Fallout3 is that 200 years after the nukes flew one of the last Vaults (a series of underground fallout shelters in which humanity's best and brightest were kept safe from radiation and would, in theory, emerge years afterwards to restart civilization), Vault 101, to open its doors to the Wastes. The game begins with your birth and introduction to your dad, voiced by Liam Neeson. As time passes in the Vault you grow to maturity, taking on a job, a love interest in the Overseer's daughter, Amata, and an inquisitive nature like Dad's. Then one morning you're awakened by a panicked Amata informing you that your Dad has opened the Vault's seals and has exited the Vault against the Overseer's wishes. What's worse is that the guards are on their way to kill you and are hot on Amata's heels. Forced to leave the Vault prematurely the player is then thrust into the post-nuclear wasteland of Washington DC. And this is where the game really picks up steam of it's own accord and just runs like a finely tuned machine.The player uses the trademarked S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system to track attributes (that's Strength, Perception, Endurance, Charisma, Intelligence, Agility, and Luck) as well as a fairly diverse skill set system (Energy Weapons, Lockpicking, Science, etc). At it's heart Fallout 3, like it's predecessors, is a very hardcore RPG, but this particular one is also designed as somewhat of a shooter. And the fusion of the two is very well done. The player is allowed to either shoot at enemies in the traditional aim/shoot method using the target pipper or they can use the new V.A.T.S. system (Vault-Assisted Targetting System), which basically allows the player to stop time and pick out specific areas on the enemy target, like limbs, torso, and head. Depending upon how many Action Points you have you can fire more shots. That, in turn, is contingent upon how many points one places in Agility. Everything meshes together like this in the SPECIAL system, and it's an utterly fantastic way to super-specialize your character to whatever play style you like. I like to play the Brainiac who is pretty good with a Laser Rifle and a set of Lockpicks. Others might like the highly mobile Thief with a knack for quietly subduing enemies with a knife, while others might just like to play buff monsters who just blow through the game by putting their fists through opponents on a regular basis. The sky is the limit, and all Fallout games (Fallout3 is no different in this regard) allow that kind of latitude towards players. In addition to this, previous Fallout games were designed so that every 3 levels the player was given a \"Perk\", or a special boon given to them from a long list of Perks which would help them in their travels (and usually combat). Here the player receives a Perk every level. I like!Some more items about the game. First off the play area is absolutely *vast*, or at least is made to feel that way. Yes, one could theoretically walk from one side of the play area to the other in about 30 minutes (barring encounters) but don't let this mislead you. There are dozens of secret nooks and crannies just waiting to be explored and it pays to do so. On top of this the quest system is fairly well done. One can always follow the primary quest to its completion, although I would definitely recommend some of the side quests as they add an incredible amount of flavor to the game. Some of the quests are not \"official\" ones and require usually that you go to a certain NPC and turn in a certain type of asset (Scrap Metal, Sugar Bombs, etc) for small amounts of exp. and money.Exploration is an absolute must with Fallout3. For my money it simply did not get better than the Mall, and the Technology Museum in particular. I think this was supposed to be representative of the Smithsonian's Air and Space museum but sort of cobbled together it and the American History museum. Either way seeing the remains of the Wright Flyer, the \"Virgo II\" Lunar Lander, and a P-51 Mustang hanging from the ceiling was a rush, and I spent the several hours I spent inside walking from display to display and reading all of the notes on the various items which once occupied those spaces. I actually sat down to watch the little mini-movie in the Planetarium before the fool thing went kaput. :) There are parts of the Mall I still haven't been to (the Capitol Building remains unexplored for me)...the White House *should* be there somewhere, but I was not able to find it. I did find Arlington and spent some time looking around there as well, and you'll find that just looking around the ruins of what once was can be a somber and somewhat sobering experience. I felt actual sadness at some of the ruins of the landmarks I came across, having visited a number of them in my trips to DC in the past. It is a powerful game that can pull off evoking an emotion from you of this type, and I've come across very few that can successfully do it.The PipBoy arm attachment is just plain handy and I found the night-light function to be useful beyond words. And I absolutely loved listening to 1950's era period music while I played the game, and it doesn't get much better than having two Ink Spots songs in the lineup. I wonder if there might be a way to add songs to the playlist manually. Does anyone know? If you do, please leave a comment!The game is not without it's fair share of problems though. Bullet point time! (SPOILERS AHEAD!)-The player level caps at 20. This just plain sucks. Previous Fallout games were such that one could theoretically get to level 99 if they really wanted to (and had a gargantuan level of patience) and there were a ton of benefits to doing so. Here the player has no choice...once you hit 20 you're done.-The dark humor which was so prevalent in the first two games is almost non-existent here. Don't get me wrong, occasionally you'll find the zippy one-liner to fire off at an NPC during a conversation but it's nowhere near as common, and that detracts from the game for me. Gallows humor is part and parcel with Fallout and when it's not there it doesn't feel right.-Some of the quests aren't quite working right. The one which comes immediately to mind is the Tenpenny Tower quest, in which you have to convince the rich denizens of the closed community of Tenpenny Tower to take on 3 Ghouls (super irradiated humans with extended lifespans but unfortunately hideous appearance). The quest requires that I spend time telling people that they either let the Ghouls move in or they move out. Uh..who am I to be ordering them about like this? They have a right to live there in whatever fashion they want and it is *not* my place to push my opinion on them so forcefully.  Meanwhile they have legitimate concerns about Ghouls moving into the tower, primarily their receiving physical harm (or worse) at the hands of the Ghouls. I convince them to let the Ghouls move in and what happens? The Ghouls end up killing every one of them! I felt sick when I realized what had happened. The folks at Bethesda were trying to make a political statement about \"bigots\" and \"racists\" but unintentionally proved that the same \"bigots\" were absolutely right about their misgivings. Any attempt to \"fix\" the problem (killing the offending and completely unrepentant Ghouls) results in my having lost Karma. Hello? I'm sorry, but this quest alone really torqued me in a way that few other games or quests have done in a very long time and I needed to air it.-Some of the Energy Weapons are a tad bit underpowered. A Laser Pistol should attack with at least a 10. Bare minimum. But it has the same stopping power as a 10mm Pistol. Now that's not right. *shakes head*. The Plasma Rifle makes up for this a great deal, and the Alien Blaster is like a handheld howitzer. But those are fairly uncommon weapons and this doesn't make up for what feels like a serious issue with calculating prospective damage.-The ending is very anti-climactic. The last leg of the game involves the player joining the Brotherhood of Steel and following them through southern DC in what can only be described as one of the most magnificent displays of battlefield mayhem I've ever had on my PC. I loaded it up again just so I could experience the giant Robot saying \"Die Communists!\" and \"Communism is a temporary setback!\" as it inexorably rampaged through Enclave lines (I think I was pumping my fist repeatedly in the air during this segment and laughing gleefully and chanting, \"USA! USA! USA!\" :D). This is then followed by a thoroughly underwhelming ending in which it's quite likely the player is going to end up sacrificing themselves to make sure that Project Purity succeeds. And the fruit of my 40-50 hours of labor? A brief 3-4 minute slide show describing how my sacrifice enabled the eventual rebuilding of humanity. Uh...if I just helped ensure unlimited fresh water for the wastes and I've been forced to look at nothing but shades of grey and brown for the entire game, then I am all but *entitled* to see the bluish splash of fresh water and not just shown the door.All problems aside though Fallout3 is a wonderful game which I could not help but love. During my 40+ hours of play I remember thinking, \"this is just the most fun I have had with a PC game in a really long time\". I'm told that there will very soon be downloadable content which will raise the level cap to 30 (an improvement, but not a \"fix\") and includes several new quests. The Fallout Universe is so rife with opportunity and potential that it's an absolute wonder to me that no one has yet made a Fallout MMORPG. This game is surely made for that kind of thing. I consider this to be a worthy heir to the Fallout series and hope to see more of the same in the future!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2009"}

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect.

Dead or Alive 3 was nothing but an over-hyped T&A; button mash, and Mortal Kombat was quite possibly the most disappointing of of them all, if only because it was so overhyped by the developers and fans.  But Soul Calibur 2 has stormed onto the scene, and has essentially re-ignited the dying flame of the fighting game genre.The graphics in the XBox version are outstanding, every bit as good, if not better than the original Soul Calibur.  All the characters look realistic and life-like, though some have anime-inspired overly exaggerated facial features, and most of the women have unrealistically exaggerated anatomical features.  The characters move and breathe and flex so vividly that its hard to beleive you're playing a video game and not watching a movie.The gameplay is as good as ever.  Some reviewers seem to think that the effort necessary to unlock extra fighters and gameplay modes makes this game bad...clearly these people have no idea what makes a good game and shouldn't be wasting other people's time with their nonsense ranting.  There are tons of features to unlock in the game, which makes for TREMENDOUS replay value.  Weapon Master Mode, a method of gameplay dating back to the first game, Soul Blade for the Playstation, has you take any character you choose through missions with certain criteria that must be met in order for you to advance.  Winning these missions earns money and experience.  From here, you can buy up to 10 extra weapons per character, including an ultimate weapon and a joke weapon, and you can also purchase new costumes, demonstrations, and gameplay modes.  This mode will also allow you to unlock other fighters as you go along.The story in the game is decent, but is not as detailed as the previous game.  Character stories are short and lack detail, and endings are utterly pointless in most cases, barely even coinciding with the story of the character.  Beating the game with a character opens up a gallery mode that allows you to view the fighter, their arena, their story and their voice acting.Some modes that open up include variations of Time Attack, and Survival.  Overall, the vast amount of gameplay modes will keep you playing for weeks, possibly months on end.  The challenge of mastering a character alone takes weeks, since the moves and characters themselves are so complex.Great features aside, there are some problems.  For starters, some of the characters in this installment are very unlikable.  Todd McFarlane characters Necrid and system-exclusive Spawn are so out of place that its almost embarassing to see them in the game.  Necrid looks like he belongs in a game that takes place about a billion years in the future on another planet, and Spawn...he just doesn't fit in.  Spawn brings cheap moves into the game, such as flying and fireballs.  Those are best left to games like Mortal Kombat or Street Fighters, not a game like Soul Calibur.  As much as I love Spawn, and despite the fact that I bought the X-Box version in favor of him over the other 2 character, he really does not belong in this game at all.  Three U.S. exclusive characters are also included, but none are particularly interesting.  Lizardman returns, and two series veterans(as well as personal favorites of mine), Hwang and Rock, have been replaced by generic, boring characters Assassin and Berzerker.The music in this game is terrible.  Compared to the first game, the music just feels uninspired and boring.  I often shut the music off and put on my Soul Calibur 1 soundtrack cd instead.  Alot of the arenas, although detailed, lack style.  None of the arenas in this game can even compare to some of the ones in the previous game, such as the Venice arena, the Colloseum arena, and many others.  The only thing that sets these arenas apart is a new feature in the game: some arenas have walls and many are uniquely structured, making for a challenge.  Making use of Wall combos is a fun new strategy and is a whole new aspect to learn.Some characters, such as newcomer Talim, are very frustrating characters.  Talim is one of a few characters who are VERY unbalanced compared to others...she has an infinite combo string that, once connected, cannot be broken and will gaurantee a loss.  Most other new characters are interesting however, though again have been rehashed from earlier characters.Overall Soul Calibur 2 is a fantastic game.  Where most fighting games get so boring they aren't even worth playing after a week, Soul Calibur 2 will keep you interested for a long, long time.  It could have benefit from the ability to use the scenario situations from Weapon Master Mode in the 2 player games, but its ok, since the gmae is fun enough by itself.  The sheer amount of unlockables and variety of one player modes will keep you entertained for weeks, and the fun of 2 player battles never ceases.  I highly recommend this to any fighting game fan, since it is better than any of the games currently out there, and will be the best fighter for a long time to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00006M3R6","description":"Metroid Fusionis a side-scrolling action game that's more in line with the series' NES origin than its GameCube contemporary, the first-person action gameMetroid Prime. In this one, players take the bounty hunter Samus on an extermination mission through a research facility to kill X parasites--nasty creatures that absorb and assimilate the powers of their host. After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable.

Regardless of that, you won't need Super Metroid as a history lesson... even though that would be a fun lesson.There's an intro before you start the game that tells you everything you need to know, but right from the start if you have any familiarity with other games in the series, you will know that the suit is different.  Well, don't worry too much.  All the signature moves are here, plus a new one that lets you grab onto ledges.  Doesn't sound like much, but that does change the dynamics of level design.  While I'm not a fan of the rather claustrophobic space station setting, you shouldn't worry that much as there will still be some interesting environments... even if most of them are not as open as in previous games, such as Super Metroid.Anyway, the control scheme is surprisingly good here.  Despite lacking two buttons compared to the previous game, this game makes do with what the GBA has.  The R button allows you to switch to missles, and unlike Super Metroid's cumbersome \"always on\" setup, Fusion has made the button a toggle.  Even better, if you have power bombs the game is smart enough to know if you are in ball form and go to power bombs instead of missles, so switching weapons is easy.Visuals are good too, and there're lots of little touches you may not notice the first time through that add something to it.Sound is okay, but there's are a few issues here.  Some of the sound effects, especially one for the power bomb, can be annoying in a way that almost hurts your ears due to the shear volume of it.  Though, as far as I know, that may be the only one to worry about.  Music is good, though not the masterpiece that Super Metroid's soundtrack was.  Still, it usually fits the mood perfectly, and there are some tracks that scare me to the core when listening to them at night (same can be said for some of the events related to some enemies, most notably the SA-X).Sadly, the game can be a bit on the short side, but for what it's worth Metroid Fusion is a memorable entry in the series, and easily recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2004"}

If I knew then what I know now, I would have paid 60 for it. The fact is, Yakuza 3 is one of the gems of the system.I don't know about the Japanese version, or the cuts that were made. I would assume that the dating mini-game is expanded considerably. If this is the case, it's one of the best things Sega could have done. Maybe Mahjongg was fun, though.Anyway, this is a review of the AMERICAN version of Yakuza, dependent only on the content found there. And that content, despite the cuts, is vast, and it is mostly excellent. Of course you have the main game, which is a great combination of JRPG and Final Fight (not Grand Theft Auto, as many people have claimed). Let's start with the fighting: it is excellent. Arcade-style brawler action really hits the spot. The controls are mostly tight, the moves are simple enough to allow for progress into the game, and complex enough to keep the player from getting bored. Even after over 300 random encounters, I still find myself enjoying the action. The finishing moves are great, the counter-attacks are fantastic, and the HEAT system (which I won't explain here - think of it as the special move system) is fantastic. I never get tired of seeing my character kick the crap out of enemies using special moves.The bosses are generally difficult (at least on Hard difficulty), and require significantly better technique than the random encounter. Bosses fight differently, so don't expect that the same tactics will work all the time (although I find the dash-punch combo is pretty much unstoppable, as long as you're patient).The JRPG aspect might put off some potential players, but I think it's great. It's equal parts hilariously cheesy and gripping. I won't spoil story, but you'll see what I mean. Dialogue can drag on, however, and because the game's language is Japanese, you are pretty much forced to sit and read subtitles continuously. I don't find it bad at all, but buyer beware - if you don't like your games talky, you might want to look elsewhere.On top of the main game are numerous minigames, and for the most part, they are a blast. I thoroughly enjoyed the pool and golf minigames, and the karaoke rhythm game is hilarious. A fishing minigame seems almost required in Japanese RPGs, and this one is actually pretty fun. There are also batting cage minigames, darts, an arcade, etc. These aren't quite as fun as the two I mentioned, but they are well above passable. All in all, they paid attention to the minigames, and it shows. Woven into many of these mingames are subplots. There is a long hitman mission that essentially has you fighting some extra bosses. This is OK, but I found it tiresome after 10 extra bosses or so. There are also random stories which can be engaged by talking to people on the street. These are a mixed bag. Most of them end up involving a standard random fight at the end, which is somewhat unexciting. There are a few exceptions (I enjoyed the movie subplot, e.g.), but all in all, the fun lies mostly in finding these missions, not playing them. There are other collectables in the game (e.g. there are 100 locker keys hidden across the two cities, and many of these are nigh impossible to find on your own), but this mostly wraps up the game description.All in all, I love this game. So, why the star deduction? Well, there are certain elements that just don't cut it. There are numerous chase scenes in the game. I hate them (particularly at night time). Generally, they require you to memorize the terrain in order to catch the perpetrator, and this really lacks the heart-pounding excitement you would expect. In one particularly odious encounter, I was trying to avoid cops, but kept running the wrong path. It didn't really matter, as I could just retry the whole thing, so what's the point?The camera often betrays you. There is no devoted \"lock-on\" within the game. Rather, you can take a fighting stance, which kind of targets your punches. The problem is that at times, the camera will just drift and you can't see your opponent. At times, the bosses can be cruel, and losing track of them can really hurt you. In the same vein, the computer just cheats sometimes. Occasionally, you will be forced to go through QTEs while fighting bosses. These themselves are fine, but the problem is that they govern cut scenes. Too often, the cut scene drags a bit, and when you regain full control of your character, the enemy has already launched into a combo. Cheap as hell, but what are you going to do?The in-game map is a real problem It would have been nice to be able to place points on your map for particular hotspots. Instead, I find that I have to constantly return to the map in the pause menu. This map itself is not particularly user-friendly, mind you, but it's a real pain to constantly refer to this thing, and you'll be doing it a lot.But all in all, you really can't go wrong with this one, particularly for the current sweet price. I would highly recommend it overall, and I hope that Persona 5 takes a cue from this for its in-town interactions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2011"}

For the first time, drivers explore new competitive kart possibilities, such as soaring through the skies or plunging to the depths of the sea. New courses, strategic new abilities and customizable karts bring the racing excitement to new heights.","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Lucky Number Seven","reviewText":"I'm an unabashed lover of everything relating to Mario Kart. Ever since I was a little kid, I've been deeply in love with the franchise, following every entry religiously. The newest game was one of my primary motivators for buying Nintendo's newest handheld, and now that I've been able to play it, my satisfaction is hard to put into words. But that's what reviews are for, and thus, the rest of this review will tell you why I personally love Mario Kart 7, and why I think you will too.By now, you know the tried-and-true MK formula. You pick your driver, pick your kart, pick your course and then you're off to the races. But what glorious races they are this time around. Following the precedent set by Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart Wii, there are 32 courses, half of them new, half of them from previous entries. Nintendo really did a great job selecting and crafting tracks in MK7, because they eliminated the ever-looming factor of cheap, irritating courses that have lingered over the series. Sure, Rainbow Road still makes you furious, and yes, the SNES stages are slightly more bland than others, but overall it's a great selection. Special accolades should be bestowed upon Rainbow Road and the two \"Wii Sports Resort\"-inspired courses for their new implementation of a long-term race. Instead of being divided into laps, these courses are split up into sections, and are a true test of skill for people who get used to taking advantage of a track via repetition. They house long, continuous races, which I wouldn't mind seeing in the series later on down the line.What the game has in balanced courses, though, it lacks immensely in balanced racing mechanics. This has always been a staple of the franchise, but it rears it's ugly head a bit too many times for my liking in this entry. Computer-controlled opponents seem to speed up at a moment's notice in the game, simply because the engine wants them to and not because they SHOULD. I've watched cars with dreadful speed and worse acceleration routinely pull ahead of everybody without the aid of any items, and routinely fall into the same slot. MK's habit of roulette-picking who's going to place where for every race in a cup is a design quirk that's been in the franchise for almost twenty years, and it's downright baffling why they wouldn't randomize the winners and make the races more unpredictable. For a game that prides itself on being zany, it sure seems like something that would make sense.The items this time around feel somewhat split with fairness. Sure, red and blue turtle shells hitting you and knocking you down a few slots are annoying occurrences, but it's pretty much par for the course with this series. The same goes with vision-blocking Blooper ink and soul-crushing hits from somebody with an Invincibility Star. Even cheaper items like Bullet Bills have been fine-tuned to feel less unfair. However, what's irritating about the items in MK7 is the unbelievable rate some characters in Single Player mode get them. There was an instance when I got hit by a red turtle shell, blinded, then sent sailing off the course by an AI that purposefully swerved OUT OF HIS WAY to hit me. And how could I forget the classic time I got hit by a blue turtle shell, blinded by ink, then promptly slammed with another shell?All of this would be jolly good if the AI actually got damaged by items like they ought to at times, but sadly, that's not the case. In one race, I was being tailed by a racer, and dropped a banana peel right ON them, yet they weren't effected. Even more irritating was the time I smacked an AI directly with a fireball, but even as it made the animation for the character being hit, they didn't stall or spin out. They just kept on driving like nothing had happened. Don't take this warning too seriously, because it happens primarily on the harder difficulty setting, and even then the events are few and far in-between, but it's a frustrating thing to deal with when it happens nonetheless.This factor is taken out in online multiplayer, which is back and better than ever. A lot of critics have taken aim at the fact that MK7 doesn't have separate servers, or leagues, or any of the bells and whistles associated with typical online games. Those complaints seem kind of ridiculous considering the fun simplicity the series is associated with. What we have here is racing with other people; nothing more, nothing less. Sure, there's your License, where your points are added or detracted depending on the outcome of your races, but it's nothing to get competitive over. The competition belongs on the race track. Nintendo saw that and followed suit, and for that, I give them mad props.Nintendo's the best developer for their own systems, so it stands to reason that this game would look absolutely gorgeous. But not only does it look good, it runs as smooth as butter. There are no framerate jitters or hiccups to distract from the fun, frantic action. The colorful, varied worlds that the developers put work into crafting come across crystal-clear on the 3DS screen, and are a joy to play and replay. It should also be pointed out that that the 3D effects are some of the least obtrusive on the system so far. Races are given an extra layer of depth by keeping the slider turned on, and only certain effects such Bullet Bills and Blooper ink flies out of the screen at you. The whole graphical experience is rather wonderful, and one of the best I've seen on a handheld.Mario Kart 7, for better or worse, keeps up with series traditions. But when one really gets down to it, the positives of this game far outweigh the negatives. I've had more fun with this than I have with other handheld titles this year, and a new online game is always welcome to the 3DS. By sticking with the sometimes euphoric, sometimes cruel, but always fun formula they've followed for almost two decades, Nintendo has come out with a game that you'll hate at times, but love to do so all the while. But most importantly, you'll keep playing for hours and hours, just to win that one last race.Gameplay: B+Graphics: ASound: AMultiplayer: A-Overall: A-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}

Here players step into the unlucky shoes of a penguin called a Prinny and 999 of his comrades as you slash your way through various Netherworld areas in side-scrolling service to the Demon Lord Etna. Although the mission that you are saddled with is ridiculously comic, the action you face is not, so you're given 1,000 lives to work with and you can use everything you find on the battlefield to help you survive and succeed.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Classic side-scrolling action.View larger.Challenging difficulty levels.View larger.Multiple vehicles &amp; aircraft.View larger.The StoryPrinnies are the reincarnated souls of evil humans trapped in purgatory. Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"Lesa B.

The controller does feel a little like the Wii's nun chuck controller but that's to be expected as well so no surprises there,  the controller fits snugly in your hand without feeling slippery or that it's going to drop to the ground by accident though I wish it did come with a wrist strap  though but I'm sure we can buy a $2.00 dollar strap later on if need be so nothing to worrisome to think about for anyone.  The buttons are stationed at easily accessible areas on the controller so no fighting to try and hit any of them during a gunfight or hardcore fighting level,  and setting it up for your PS3 console was as easy as it was with the Motion controllers which again was very appreciative son no headaches of having to hit a connect button on the remote and than on the gaming console trying to make them read each other an the like.  So is this worth getting right now?,  I say that at most it would have to be up to the buyer while again there aren't any games that really need the navigation controller right now it does help knowing that you already own it when a game does finally comes out and your not stuck having to try and scrounge for money or hurrying to the gaming store to buy one because you find out that the game needs the navigation controller after all..","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2010"}

Much of this criticism revolves around multiplayer mode. However, my review will be rather different - it is my opinion that the appeal to multiplayer gaming is what ruined the game in the first place. Infinity Ward made it rather clear that it was their intent to publish MW2 with the multiplayer gamer in mind, which is rather evident, as the quality of play (controls, physics, etc.) have been dumbed down to suit the numb, mindless \"run 'n gun\" playing habits of the typical multiplayer gamer. Realism most definitely took a step down with this chapter in the series - that being said, the blatant cliffhanger in the end couldn't make it more obvious that they intend to milk the Modern Warfare game for all it is worth, putting out sequel after sequel. On that note, the shortness of the game is quite disappointing. Furthermore the crafting of the story completely falls apart during the second half - the beginning was quite well developed, however it only serves to tease you into finishing. The quality of development that went into the design of the last few levels only shows the laziness and rushed nature of the game, reminiscent of the \"realism\" (or lack thereof) of games of the distant past: poor texture quality, physics-defying cantilevered walkways along cliffs, and no background to speak of.The \"Spec Ops\" challenge levels are even worse - just a bunch of filler material that fit into the run 'n gun system - a bunch of cartoonish arcade-style levels.I suppose I will throw in a few kind words - the graphics are gorgeous!I should have maintained some self-control and waited a few months longer for the price to drop - $60 simply isn't worth it**EDIT: speaking of price, it is quite obvious that the price of this game is being fixed and artificially kept high - it has been available for quite some time now, and the price has never adjusted.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"Please, don't believe the hype!","reviewText":"Now, everyone will have you believing that Grand Theft Auto IV is the single greatest game ever made, or that it's hands down Gane of the Year, or that Rockstar has reinvented the wheel with GTA 4, here. Well, as a HUGE San Andreas fan and an owner of most Rockstar games out there (except for Manhunt), I'm here to tell you that Grand Theft Auto IV is about 90% overrated hype and about 10% gameplay. No, GTAIV isn't outright bad or anything. It's just not what it used to be. Mostly, I mean, fun. At face value, this is Grand Theft Auto on the new gen systems. But besides that, it's a more-realistic, but less fun GTA.I guess, that's the biggest problem with GTA IV. Set in an alternate universe New York City, Rockstar strives to make GTA about as real as an experience as it can be, but in reality, it's not. Really, what it is, is a better looking version of GTA with a bunch of new \"more realistic\" features. I'll start with the positives, first. GTA looks very, very good. Not even close to Photo-realistic, but good. The graphics and lighting and weather effects are good enough to warrant being on the 360 or PS3. Now, while I was expecting \"Gran Turismo\" style realism here, that's not what I got, but still, the game looks nice. But now, for everything else.There are many \"improvements\" to the game that supposedly enhances the experience, but they really only suck the fun out of the game as I mentioned earlier. Just about everything is \"enhanced\" to have the realism effect, but it only makes the game frustrating. Breaking into cars is a pain and now takes almost as much time as it would in real-life. You have to break open the window, unlock the door, climb inside, and hotwire the car from the inside to get it going. While I was surprised to find this task quicker than I expected, it still hurts you in desperate situations when you need a car right away, which are in many missions. I hated the \"system\" so much, I never bothered to steal a parked car more than once in this game. The system is actually more of a theft deterent than anything!Next, we come to the driving. Good God, the driving is probably the most *frustrating* thing EVER! Acceleration is simple enough, especially on the 360 controller. But just about everything else is horrible! Driving in this game, I can say honestly, is MUCH harder than actually driving in real life. The brakes are crazy and I don't know just how long it takes the average player to get used to driving, but I'm still struggling not to crash into people and walls and stuff! I have to drive like an old lady just to avoid bumping into the police cars which are quite literally on every other block in the game.And when you DO get in trouble... oh man! GTA IV has a slight improvement on the old system in which you can now evade the police by simply outrunning them, even if you are beyond one star. In the old games, you could outrun the police with one star, but not with anything higher. In GTA IV, you have a circumference area that the cops chase you in. Drive out of their circumference, and you escape them. But it sounds simpler than it is. The more wanted levels you get, the larger the area the cops chase you in. And with simply two stars, the \"area of pursuit\" becomes hard to get out of. By a full-on six, the circumference is literally the size of an entire Liberty City borough! I found this out when I tried to sneak into Algonquin (Manhattan). They have Pay N' Sprays still, but they're virtually useless now. The time you'll need them most, you won't be able to use them cause if the cops see you enter one, it's effect becomes null and void. And over two stars will have police swarming on you. And make no mistake, Liberty City's finest are three times as vicious as those San Andreas donut-munchers. The police are vicious on you, and their A.I. is quite enhanced and far more intelligent than before. Heck, a cop will shoot you even if you're unarmed and only have one star! To make matters worse, your car no longer provides you with adequate protection. Cops and other enemies can shoot you THROUGH your windshield! Before, your car just got damaged some. Now, you can quite easily die even in your car, and there's no real way to duck for cover inside, either. This is what I mean when I say the fun is sucked out of the game in favor for \"realism.\"The controls of the game are often needlessly complicated, even with all things not involving cars. Doing a simple thing like running while trying to keep the camera fixed on you involve all your available fingers. The shooting is supposedly \"improved\" but it's not. I actually never found issue with GTA: San Andreas' shooting and targeting system, but many people did. Either way, the auto-targeting in GTA IV is flawed, at best, and as you'd expect, the targeting itself has no idea who you actually want to target. It's more like you targeting whoever *IT* makes you target! Yeah, it's a problem. What's worse is how much stronger the enemies are now. It takes a minimum of six shots with a pistol to take down ONE guy! And it's not like you get a lot of ammo with that pistol! You can't afford to waste a single bullet. What's worse is, limb-specific damage seems to be gone, entirely. Whether you aim center mass, or go for the head execution style, it'll still take the same number of bullets to take down a guy. Well, doesn't that just suck?Now, some more things about the game. The story, itself, is pretty subjective. You'll either get into it, or like me, become quickly bored with it. It's like the same old GTA-style story missions, only it's more \"Been there, done that\", which is disapointing considering the use of the foreigner Niko Bellic opened up a lot of storyline possibilites. But about your first hour into the game, you'll already be playing guard dog to a bunch of people you just met. Your cousin, Roman, is a pain in the butt, but everyone else is even worse. Why do I have to take orders from all these people I barely know? I expected more out of GTA IV, but this is the same old crap, man. What's worse is, the main story seriously ruins all of the \"free roaming\" fun you used to have in GTA! Because of your new, stupid cell phone (with the questionable gray background and black text color scheme which makes it hard enough just to read messages) you'll constantly be getting calls from people and will have to drop everything to help out in vital missions that are important to the story. You'd think a guy with no real job would have more free time. The only real side quest you'll get to have in the beginning is dating the cute and lonely Michelle. If only nice-looking women were this desperate and easy to please in real life. The dates have been upgraded a little bit, giving you the control in what to do, which includes fine dining, playing games like bowling and pool, the arts & theater, going drinking, and other activities. Sadly, the dates are pretty boring and have a \"what's the point?\" feel to them. As much as I like Michelle, even \"Warm Coffee\" isn't worth driving all around Broker all day long boring myself to death.The size of Liberty City is about maybe half or one-third the size of San Andreas. But considering Liberty is all city, it's pretty impressive. Like I said, you'll often be so busy helping random people, you won't have to much time to explore around (without purposely avoiding missions because you know you aren't going to save anything.) You start off in crappy Broker (Brooklyn) and will have to earn your way to Algonquin and the rest of Liberty City, just like before. That sucks though, because I expected this time to be different, and I wanted to explore everything right away. Rockstar before had said they were taking out all bikes and air vehicles from the game, but I guess, have changed their mind since then. There are a few number of bikes, one speedboat, and the rare, single helicopter in GTA IV. There are also lots of cars in the new Liberty City as well, but quite honestly, most the vehicles have very little relevance in this game and they take a backside to the story. The feeling you had in San Andreas of \"Ooh! I like that car! Lemme go steal that and add it to my collection!\" is gone entirely from this game. Anything you drive is about as equally important/unimportant. Maybe it's because you don't have any garages to put them in? Or any money to afford really modding them, if that's even possible in this game? Or maybe it's because trying to get them is such a pain, even if you manage to avoid the police catching you? At least, they have talking GPS in them, but (and I can't believe I'm defending THIS game, but) I personally like the GPS system in Saint's Row better.Liberty City now has a huge amount of radio stations (like, 18, I think), but none of the music is on par with the older GTA's. I guess that's because GTA IV takes place in 2008, and it's hard to know what current songs are guaranteed hits in the present. Or maybe it's because music is such crap, nowadays? So, you have a wide variety of music, but no history of what's \"good\" or not helping you out, here. To sum it up, the music just isn't that good, but at least, it's very, very diverse. There's everything ranging from the familiar Hip Hop and Rock stations, to Latino Music and International Funk. And yes, the parody Talk Radio stations are back to, but to be honest, there aren't NEARLY as funny as they were on the West Coast in San Andreas. There's also custom TV and Internet sites in the game, as well, but to be honest, I never quite got around to checking them out. I mean, all that extra crap is great, but it's really just a distraction and it's utterly pointless to have in the game. It's not like it helps you DO anything. And just to bring it up, there's almost NOTHING in all of new Liberty City to remind you that this is a Grand Theft Auto game. All of the GTA staples and landmarks are gone. Well, at least they kept Cluckin' Bell around, but other than that, there's no familiar names or chains or shops from the GTA universe. It's like they all started going bankrupt in the 16 years since San Andreas, and went completely out of business in the seven years since GTA III. It makes the new Liberty City that much more unfamiliar, but then again, I guess some people would call that \"enhancing the experience\" for Niko Bellic, new to Liberty City.So to recap, GTA IV is a new, more real experience in the GTA world, but that sucks any and all fun and excitement out of the game. No, Rockstar did not reinvent the wheel here, and this is, without a doubt NOT \"Game of the Decade\" or the \"Game of Our Generation.\" The little 13-year old boys posting reviews on here need to stop saying that! It's not true! Let's just all call this what it is: GTA on the new consoles. It's no greater or better than simply that. Everything they tried to \"enhance\" for a realer experience just makes the game tedious and tiresome, including your stupid behind cell phone, which I hate! I wish I could just chuck it somewhere! The controls are complicated and confusing, especially for driving. The graphics and interactivity in Liberty City are nice, but not exactly \"on the next level\" of anything. Free roaming is just about dead due to the story constantly keeping you busy, and the missions are old and familiar, but not in a good way. The weapons system is bad with it's targeting, and even fist fighting is a real pain. Fighting was simple and effective in San Andreas. Here, you're looking at three minute fights just to take down one fat slob. I mean, three minutes??? See, that's TOO realistic! The music is so-so at best, and just about everything in the game feels more like a chore than fun. I think because in older GTA's, the storyline wasn't as relevant, leaving you space to do whatever you felt like inbetween, sort of like the weekend from the work week. But now, it's like, everyday is a work day, and I think it's because Rockstar tries to push the story as being SO important and such a driving force in GTA IV. Yeah, I can tell that it was carefully crafted and polished, but it does NOT rank on the level of The Godfather or Scarface. So, no. This isn't an \"interactive movie,\" as some overzealous fans of the game posting reviews will have you believe. The story's okay for a video game, but it's a video game story. It's not exactly good enough to stand on it's own. I really dislike it.I SO wanted to believe the hype, but I also knew that not having a GTA game in four years would leave a lot of people expecting and wanting more (and believing they got it with this). All GTA IV is, is Grand Theft Auto: Part Four. It's not the Second Coming of video games, or anything rabid fanboys and fangirls will have you believe. Personally, it's not really worth the four year wait or anything, but it's not like it's a horrible game. It's just not that fun, anymore, and the ones who'll play it days on end, will buy it, no matter what anyone tells them. But if you're on the fence, like I was, I would have no problem at all telling you to wait a few months till it drops down in price. It's not THAT spectactular.Don't believe the hype and don't drink the GTA Kool Aid. If this game REALLY did have a budget of $100 million, than I'm betting $75 million of that went to advertising, feeding the hype machine, and paying off notable gaming sites for unjust Perfect 10 scores. This ISN'T a Perfect Ten game, and I'd give it a 7 or 8 out of 10, if Amazon had that kind of scale. This is easily the most realistic out of the GTA series, but FAR from the most entertaining, no matter how many fake TV shows and websites arre in the game. The main content is what matters most, and GTA IV fails on all accounts when it comes to this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"The long awaited sequel delivers","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing story, memorable characters, subtle details really stand out, superb graphics, fun online playThe Bad: Crappy car handling, minor control issues, online lags more than it should, nothing earth shattering but perfectedI remember playing GTA III when it first came out. I didn't have a PS2 yet and I went over to a friend's house and played it for hours every single day. While we mostly just messed around it was something I never played before and was just so addictive. Thankfully GTA IV goes back to it's roots and brings us to good ol' Liberty City. You play as none other than Niko Bellic who is a Russian immigrant who came to LC with his cousin Roman to start a new life. The game's main attractions are it's story for once. GTA IV has a superb story that makes you want to keep playing. Gone are the lukewarm stories from previous GTAs where only the main character is the main attraction with just OK side characters. In previous GTAs you never really got a good feeling of the employers due to the lack built up story. You were just in and out of the short cut scenes only knowing what to really do. This kind of was solved in San Andreas, but even then only a select few were really fleshed out. In IV you feel every character in the game and there are tons of plot twists and it really keeps the game fresh through every single mission.On another note, the graphics are amazing. While not Assassin's Creed or BioShock amazing they're really good. It's mainly the subtle details though such as people now put their blinkers on, cars are damaged in real time now with realistic physics so half broken fenders and bumpers sway as you turn the car, the paint can get scraped up, crowd AI is more efficient (yet not by much), better enemy AI (still not by much), further draw distance, everything has high-res textures, bump mapping and the whole next-gen works. There are a few things that they stripped away such as the whole working out system, swimming underwater (you can still swim though!), and territories. There are other subtle details such as the internet you can now use. It's a virtual made up internet, but it's still as funny as hell and has a dating system (yes it's still here) implemented on the dating website. You can get emails for side missions from employers as well. You can now take taxis around the city and either watch them drive your skip it if you want. This really helps a lot if you are tired of driving everywhere. There is also a new route system where the game will plot the safest and most legal course to your destination. Red is a target, blue is a friendly, green is a waypoint you made on your map, and yellow is an objective. This is probably one of the better additions because it keeps your from getting lost during time sensitive missions.Another thing is the revamped wanted system. You now have flashing \"zones\" for every star. The more stars the bigger the circle will get on your radar that you have to escape. Cops are now showed as flashing blue and red blips and copters are now flashing X's. While we're talking about characters again the voice acting is amazing. I really felt like I was watching bits of a movie every time there was a cut scene. The characters are really fleshed out here every...single...one. You'll remember every character in the 60+ hour game and that's a really hard thing to achieve. Rockstar really went the extra 20 miles with this game and you can just feel it.The game is huge as well, while not as huge as San Andreas it's about as big as GTA III yet it's also big as in taller as well. You can fly planes, and copters again in here and while it's a lot easier than San Andreas it's still not very fun. Speaking of controls they are more refined this time and the auto aim is a lot better yet there's still that stupid camera! Switching targets is NOT very easy. You have to press the right stick EXACTLY left or right or you won't switch targets. Whenever you do lock on Niko always aims for the wrong persons and ends with cheap deaths and what have you. The cars are also a big pain because they just don't feel right. They all feel really heavy and they slide way too much no matter what car you use. You try to put the brakes on and your car will slide and slide and you'll miss your turn, and the same goes for the handbrake. You hit it and your car spins out a few times no matter how good you are with the handling. I found this very annoying with the driving missions because it would lead to cheap and frustrating failures.Apart from all this the game as 16 player Xbox LIVE support. You have tons of game modes from deathmatch, to cops and robbers. In cops and robbers it's pretty self explanatory. You all get in a car and try to kill each other. This is also very fun yet annoying because the game can lag a lot especially with people who have crappy connections. It also may take awhile to start a game due to everyone wanting 16 players and they just won't start the game. Aside from the minor issues GTA IV is probably game of the year worthy, but it doesn't do anything as ground breaking as GTA III did. It just perfects it 100% this time and gives us what we've always wanted. The perfect GTA game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

The action is very deep and complex which in my opinion makes this one of the best action adventure games ever made. The game may be very difficult for most people who play it, even on the easiest level. Fortunantly, I was able to get all the way to chapter 14 which was overwhelmingly difficult.

In those days the essence of the game was to move the players about a game board, fighting battles, collecting treasure, and finding clues. Origin's Ultima series was the grandparent of these games - immensely entertaining, but essentially two-dimensional. Among its heirs were the first games in the Final Fantasy line.This was also a time when computer capabilities and capacity seemed to double every few months. Final Fantasy VII is the result of an inevitable synergy between technology and imagination. Players found themselves in a three-dimensional world where they could wander at will. They were playing with characters that were not only more animated and lifelike, but also had something that resembled personalities. In a very real sense, FFVII changed the gaming landscape, and RPGs reached a new level of credibility.What is inside is the story of Cloud Strife; an ex-soldier turned mercenary who is drawn into the struggle between Avalanche, a revolutionary group, and Shinra, a rapacious company that is rapidly draining the resources of the planet. Starting out in the city Midgar the battle moves back and forth across the planet, as Cloud gathers team members, accessories and power. Everyone has a history, often mysterious, and an important role to play.Eventually it becomes clear that the real enemy is a laboratory experiment gone horribly wrong. Shinra's effort to produce supermen has created Sephiroth, who has become one of the legendary villains of the gaming world. Physically beautiful, his mind has been ruined by his knowledge of what he is, and his goal has become the destruction of the world.The plot is remarkably rich. Within the main story arc are many smaller stories that build the players understanding of the nature of each of the characters. There seem to be an unending number of weapons, powers, and monsters. More than enough material for many replays. The graphics are a bit primitive for our time, but were startling when this game first came out. As your imagination adapts to the imagery, the game becomes truly engaging on many levels. Final Fantasy VII is still one of the best of its genre, Whether you are a student of gaming or an aficionado, it belongs on your shelf.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2004"}

I loved it from one end to the other, and even went out of my way to beat it completely.You can see plenty of reviews that will give you the story--let's instead take a look at the gameplay.  Jak & Daxter is a \"platformer\", meaning you spend a lot of time jumping up and down on various stair-step parts of each level.  The monotony is broken up by side quests:  for example, helping a farmer herd cattle, or shooing pigeons away from a series of monuments.There are also changes to gameplay:  \"end bosses\" that require you to crack the pattern to beat them.  There are \"riding\" stages where you're on a small skimmer, and even these have diversity:  sometimes you're racing some bad guys, sometimes you're racing the clock.  Last, you collect \"Precursor Orbs\" as you go, which you can trade for Power Cells, the core collectable of the game.  Precursor Orbs are hidden all over the place, as are Power Cells that don't need to be bartered for--they're just waiting to be discovered.  It's not easy, but the important part is, when you fail, you know why, and you feel driven to try again, just one more time.  A good game makes you really feel like you've earned something that's hard-to-get, not like you had to wrestle it out of the programmer's hands.  You don't have to collect every Precursor Orb, nor do you have to find every Power Cell...but if you do, you get a special ending to the game.Probably the most important point to Jak and Daxter is that little \"E\" on the package: the game is rated \"E\" for \"Everyone\", and it truly does live up to that claim.  It's hard for me to find games that I can enjoy, and still share with my 8 year old daughter, but she loves this game, too.  It's unfortunate that the second game went in the \"T\" (Teen) direction--it just doesn't seem right for Jak to start using shotguns and rocket launchers--but at least we have this one, and I would recommend it for the whole family.For the record, I played Jak & Daxter on a PS3.

Basically games like this are for people who just wanna drive, which can be quite fun, yet takes a special person to really just sit and have a mid paced race. No, its not Motorstorm, or Burnout, its just a beautiful looking game with all kinds of customizable cars to unlock and have fun with. I played the demo, went through it a couple times, had some fun and watched the replay, enjoyed it, then deleted it. I think games like these should be cheaper or just made downloadable on consoles. The graphics are definitely top notch, and some of the best looking on any console to date, hense why it was up for best graphics technical this year. Also when you hit things the dents stay, or scruff up your car which makes for a realistic ride overall. I can only recommend this game to fans of car and driver magazine, because basically you make your dream car, and have a little race with it, thats pretty much it. So for the fans of driving its great, for hardcore racing fans, stick with Burnout, Motorstorms, or even the off road seris of games.

Those will probably come down the line with MGS4 and FF13. However, when one is conflicted as to what game to start playing with their PS3, Resistance is probably the best choice.The graphics are good. The cinematics are mostly done with the high-end graphics of the PS3, and the character models are definetly something to see. The environments can seem simple at times, with nearly empty rooms filled with square boxes and stuff. It isn't until you are outside shooting at masses of enemies between buses or in fogged out gray areas that you really get to experience the game.The gameplay itself isnt bad. The enemies utilize cover, and will hit you if they shoot at you. You however, can't really utilize cover. You can't peak around corners or cover up to a wall. This is a feature they really should of added. The guns though make up for it. They all do different things, and its up there with Half-Life 2.The single player game is good to see what the game is about, but it feels like it was made for multiplayer. The multiplayer portion is very smooth. It supports up to 40 people, but even a few players in a grimy, gray environment can really make things interesting.I would highly recommend Resistance to people who want to test out their PS3. In the future though, this one might not stand the test of time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2006"}

The online aspect has been really buggy so far, with unacceptable lag.My biggest disappointment, however, was with the level design and the overall feel of the game.  Whereas the levels in BF1942 (and its expansion packs) were brilliant and really conveyed a sheer sense of epic conflict, the levels here are 1)WAY too dark, 2)Too cramped and 3)Boring.  I realize that the battlefields of vietnam were different from WWII, but all the levels end up looking exactly the same: hilly jungle.

In this game you mainly act out battles that are hinted at from the movie, along with verious duels from the movie. What's unique is that strategy is needed when combating enemies and some normal enemies can actually pose a nice fun challenge. Also you have the ability to make your characters attacks more powerful as the you play the game more which is welcome. The controls are good and the levels are very intersting even though some take awhile. The bonus games are pretty intersting as well.However, there are times where it feels as though enemies are too smart to combat, such as the duels where the enemies unleash very powerful attacks and can heal faster then you can. These situations can be quite frustrating and I've had my share of putting the control away because I couldn't beat some enemies.

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Yuri Cunha \"Juggalo\"","summary":"Will you survive the nightmare?","reviewText":"Raccoon City, 1998 - S.T.A.R.S. is sent to the Arklay Mountains, northwest Raccoon City, because many witnesses said that strange things were attacking people from the mountains. The first team sent, the Bravo Team, disappeared, contact was lost. The other team who stood there, the Alpha Team, got worried, and went to the mountains to find them, but they didn't find. They just found some hungry dogs. Unfortunately, one of them ate one of the team members, Joseph Frost. The rest of the team ran into a house, looking like a mansion. The first thing they notice is that someone is missing, someone is out there. They decided to stay in the mansion, but they didn't know that the mansion was way more dangerous than outside.- Graphics: This game is different from everything. While I was playing, nobody thought it was a game. \"What movie are you watching?\".- Controller: It's not that difficult to use, but I prefer using the + Control Pad than the normal Control Pad, it's easier. But it's not hard to use the Control Stick...- Fun: It depends of you... It has heads exploding, scary things... It has some puzzles and can really scare you. If you like fear, then you'll think it's fun... And there's also some good \"extras\" when you finish the game, such as clothes, new modes...- Educative: Huh... It depends also... It's not the BEST game children could play because of the violence, blood and words like \"....\" and \".....\". But if your kids like horror and you don't really think bad words would make any difference (just like I do), it's fine.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"G.

Halo Reach was better than this, too.My biggest grip with this game is that you are still stuck with running around like a stiff cardboard throughout the game in an arcade-like manner. In this day and age of Call of Duty and Battlefield you would think that the makers of Halo would realize that the video gaming world has evolved. No longer are you stuck with just running and shooting a la classic Doom. We can now crouch or go prone for the more effective shot. Yes, I know that Master Chief is wearing an armor but if he can make a slight crouch then he can at least go prone. I found myself trying to crouch or go prone to make strategic shots only to find myself doing a slight crouch that does not help me much. I felt like I was still playing Halo 1.My second biggest grip is that the save points seem to be designed to lengthen the game artificially. You could wipe out a whole swarm of enemies and then be taken out by the final one and have to start all over again. You cannot save at any time. You have to get to a save point and those are set so that you have to clear the whole swarm before you can progress to the next stage. And, no, I am not a terrible player. I am able to play with the best of them on online shooter games. I have completed some of the most difficult games out there. This game is by no means a difficult game. In fact, it is actually one of the easiest games. I just don't like the lack of a good save point system. I do have a life after all. I am not one of those thirty year-old slackers still living with his parents and playing video games all day while munching on delivery pizzas because he's too lazy to buy groceries and cook a meal.Continuing on the unevolved nature of this game, the old wonky controls of the Warthog is back. Driving this buggy is like a buggy ride straight out of an old Nintendo game. With games like Project Gotham Racing and Gran Turismo you would think that they would have learned a little about fun driving. But no, they are still using the same mechanics.Speaking of mechanics, there is a lack of cover-and-shoot mechanics in this game. Again, as I have stated, we have games like Call of Duty and Battlefield that have done this for years already. When will Halo catch up?Finally, on to the online portion. Wait, I don't have Xbox Live Gold. Why? Because I refuse to pay a toll fee just to be invited to play online in the Xbox Live universe. I find that to be a rip off considering that on Playstation 3 it is FREE. So what do I do? I only purchase games for the Playstation 3 if I just have to play the online portion of the game that I already paid for. I used to purchase Xbox Live Gold until I got the Playstation 3 and noticed that the graphics and service is all the same. The only difference is that Xbox Live charges for you just to play on their network. At 60 dollars a year, you can expect to have spent three hundred dollars (almost the cost of the console) if you kept it for five years.In summation, if you are looking for a new Halo experience, you're not going to get it here. But if you are looking for more of Halo 1, look no further.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00002STGN","reviewerName":"theboombody","summary":"A New Look","reviewText":"What I like most about this game is the new look of the weapons and monsters.  This was the first Doom game to really look different.  The new weapons and monsters have an awesome design.  The only ones that I think looked better in the original are the Lost Souls and Cacodemons.  Every other monster is streamlined to look real nice.The final monster at the end is some kind of big ugly rat thing.  An interesting new character.The levels are pretty darn complicated, I think even moreso than the previous Doom games.  It might only be because it's harder to cheat on this game than the computer Doom games.I thought the music and atmosphere made the game creepy, and the goofy skipped-frame way the monsters moved made the game funny.  It's an interesting mix.This game is fun to play.  If you like Doom, you'll like this.  There's cool levels and secrets just like in every Doom game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2005"}
{"product_name":"B003171CEW","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"Realistic, But Frustrating","reviewText":"I'm new to \"The Show\" so I don't know exactly what previous versions had as features and gameplay. I used to play MVP 2005 which is considered by most who play it, the best of it's kind. In any case I am not a big sports video game player, but I have played a few and I've been gaming for over 20 years. I'm also a fan of baseball which led me to buy this game. What MLB 10 The Show brings to the table is some professionalism that is otherwise lacking in sports games. However, it's littered with few large flaws that really tarnish it from being a great game.Positives-Graphics look very good, which is expected-Game has just about every type of feature you could imagine: full trade capability, player progression, batting practice, pitching practice, many managing modes from playing every inning to just picking who is playing to simulating the games-Motion and animation are very believable especially with the hits and pitches-Ultra realistic play: errors are made, injuries occur and it is genuinely as close as you'll get to the majors without having to play through the farm leaguesSmall Issues-Baserunning and consequently picking people off is more complex than it needs to be-Overall controls could be simplified for a more streamlined experience-Needs full tutorials (or even tutorial games) instead of tips-Pitching calls are sometimes way off. Balls are generally called correctly, but I've had strike zones cut in half by the umpire.Large Issues-The game is VERY hard even on rookie settings (I tried the extremes just to see what would change); I played five full games on rookie or veteran and lost every one by multiple runs.-User settings though supposedly saved and loaded, have to be re-adjusted every single game. I've tried to fix this several different ways and it doesn't work.-Batting is just plain mistimed and this is everything in baseball; if you're even 1/10th of a second late on a fastball it could mean the difference between a pop-up and a home run. It's almost as if they slow the ball down right as it approaches the plate. I'm early on almost every pitch even when I slow down my swing.-The game just isn't fun. After improving my team to be the 6th ranked team in the league facing the bottom half and I was still losing by a lot.-There is tons of dead time even put on fastest speed they tend to add replays, commentary and just unnecessary footage to the game. Sometimes in between innings if there's been a pitching change they'll just show each of the players standing there. Foul balls have to fall and bounce or hit the wall before play can resume.Would I recommend this game to anyone? Only to the most hardcore sports people that happen to do gaming on the side. It makes it feel like you're really trying to hit a major league pitch. For those who want a simulation - great. For the rest of us who play games for FUN you may want to avoid it. It's not just a challenge to play the game, it's a chore. If it's still difficult to hit the ball on \"noob\" settings then something went wrong with the development. And as an avid gamer, this is sad to see because the idea is so intrepid but the execution is lacking.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2011"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game. In addition, characters from the first game will return as long as they were not killed off by the player in the first game. On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games a they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

I played Mass Effect 1 and contrary to some glitches and tedious gameplay elements, IT LITERALLY BLEW MY MIND. So to me Mass Effect 2 was a MUST. I have played it twice now and here is what I think.PROS.WELL DESIGNED CHOICE/KARMA GAMEPLAY: Just like Mass Effect 1, this game has wonderful cause-effect gameplay. Throughout the games you will have to make many choices and this choices will have major effect on your character development and on the story. Depending on your choices your character can be renegade, paragon or someone in between. Unlike Mass Effect 1, these choices will many times be imposed upon you. In other words, you will just be exploring the open world and all of the sudden, the main story interrupts you and will make you make difficult decisions. To me, this was amazing. This on the spot make choice plot makes the story so much more real, relevant and impactive. Furthermore, other than dialogue, even during the cutscenes you can perform paragon/renegade type of action. This experience was simply mind-blowing to me.BETTER RUNNING GAMEPLAY AND SMOOTH CRISPY CLEAR GRAPHICS: To me Mass Effect 1 was great, but it had a bit choppy graphics and glitch gameplay. They have fixed it up big times in Mass Effect 2. (Don't get me wrong there are still glitches see CONS section). When I first saw the Mass Effect 2 footage in HD on my 360, my eyes simply couldn't believe it. Trust me, you will have no complain here in this department.AWESOME COMBAT MECHANICS:  Compared to 1, they greatly improved combat system in this game. It feels smoother, you can perform different moves easier and most importantly, combination you can use with your team/allies is just unbelievable. You have more classes to choose from compared to first and I just LOVED VANGUARD AND SENTINEL CLASSES. You will love the powers you will get to use. Oh did I mention, you can also choose from your allies special powers.PLENTY OF ALLIES AND LOYALTY MISSIONS: There are so many different allies you can acquire and choose from in this game. Acquiring each ally is a mission. Plus, if you want your ally to become loyal to you, there will be a separate mission. Once they become loyal, you can unlock their special power and it will also have a huge impact on the story. Now the question is can you make everyone loyal to you? I will just let you find out. While it is possible, unless you make the right choices, it will be difficult.NEW WEAPONS AND POWERS: Loved the VANGUARD and SENTINEL class provided biotic and tech powers. Also, some of the heavy weapons were pretty cool. Also liked how you could upgrade your weapons and powers by research and alloy discoveries.PRETTY GOOD STORY: Not as good as the first one, but this game still does have a pretty good story. While the creators have done a wonderful job with stories for each ally character, the central story is somewhat straightforward. However, they are also setting this game for a sequel (not a spoiler, it has been known for ages now), so that might be the reason the story is the way it is (really don't want to spoil it for you).OPEN WORLD GAMEPLAY: Just like first one you are free to explore galaxy and go where ever you want to go, do what ever you want to do first. Story will impose upon you as stated before, but again it will only make the experience more real. I love the way they have hidden the missions in open world exploration.BETTER ACHIEVEMENTS: Mass Effect 1 achievement kinda force you to do things you may not want to do (for example keep the same ally through out the game, become a perfect paragon or renegade, etc.). In this game, the way achievement system is set up, it will make you explore more and experiment more.VARIETY IN BOSSES AND ENEMIES: Loved how most of the missions include a boss. While few of them are pushovers, most of them will provide you with decent challenge. Furthermore, compared to Mass Effect 1, there is greater variety of enemies and eliminating them will require you to different strategies and powers. This will prevent the gameplay from being redundant.FREE DLCs: There are some awesome free downloadable content for this game. Some of them should have been released with the game (see cons.)CONS.LESS EXPLORATION: There are a lot of story based mission and ally based loyalty missions; however, there are amazingly few side missions. (Don't get me wrong, the game will still take a while finish. My first finish was 45 hrs when I decided to explore everything). And these side missions are ridiculously short and straight forward.NO VEHICLE: What the hell? After you download a DLC, there are four or five vehicle based missions; however, the game doesn't have vehicle based exploration. I agree climbing rocks and hills with space vehicle was torturous at times in Mass Effect 1, but still there were many planets where it was fun. Why remove that?DIMINISHED RPG ELEMENT: Mass Effect 1 kinda had convoluted level up system(if you do manually) and tedious  weapon upgrade/achieve system. They improved that in Mass Effect 2 by making it extremely simple. Now you no longer have much choices when it comes to guns. Your choice of power can be maxed in no time (you will still have hard time maxing multiple powers/traits). And experience is mainly give at the end of the mission vs experience you gained by doing each and every single action/ killing each and every enemy in Mass Effect 1. The system did feel a bit more organized and easy to use, but I kinda miss Mass Effect 1 RPG element.So contrary to minor issues I mentioned in CONS., they have GREATLY IMPROVED THE GAME. If you liked Mass Effect 1, if you like RPG, if you like space/sci fy genre, YOU MUST NOT MISS OUT ON THIS ONE. You will love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2010"}

This game had beautiful graphics, new enemies, hard bosses, a humor story, devastating Bros moves, a new villain helping Bowser, and this time Luigi is turning a giant instead of Bowser. The controls are almost same like the last Mario and Luigi DS games, but you will use the control stick instead the control pad, and some Luiginary attacks and Bros moves require you to move the 3DS to make the attack powerful. For the first time, Mario will go inside Luigi's dreams. Inside Luigi's dreams, Mario will met Dreamy Luigi instead of Luigi, they can learn new devastating attacks called Luiginary attacks, an attack where Mario uses a stack of Dreamy Luigis to attack his enemies, touching Luigi's face can be hilarious like touching Mario's face from Super Mario 64, but it can be helpful for Mario to get to places that he can't reach, and they can learn new moves that they learn from the real world. I was disgusted and furious when I saw several negative reviews from Anti-Nintendo fanboys, Xbox fanboys, PS3 fanboys, and Vita fanboys who are whining and complaining about Mario and Luigi Dream Team is too childish and too hard, and Mario is not a annual game like Call of Duty.

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Sonic's major step into 3D","reviewText":"How complicated must it be for Sega to make a game on a console that's still in development at the same time? And yet, the final game is a smash hit that happens to be pretty top-notch. They've pulled through then, I guess.The game lets you choose to play as 6 different characters (However, you unlock them by playing as Sonic first). We have Sonic (of course), Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E103 Omega, and....Big the Cat...Each of the characters have their own gameplay mechanics, as well as goals and certain levels. Below is the fun factor for each character.Sonic - The levels are actually pretty straightforward. You simply go from start to finish. And boy was it fun.. It's actually pretty close to the Genesis Sonic games, but in 3D. Collect rings, bash robots, you know..The good stuff. Plus, there are some new level-specific gameplay mechanics included, like Twinkle Park's bumper car riding, and Sky Chase's airplane combat! You may as well buy this game just for Sonic alone. After all, as the title character, he has the most levels to go through.Tails - More or less like Sonic's gameplay except he has to race Sonic (later, Eggman, in Speed Highway) in each level. It's not as bad as it may sound, because it only just keeps the pace going, which is great, and don't you think it's kind of exciting to find shortcuts when flying?Knuckles - Rather than going from start to finish, Knuckles has to find 3 Emeralds in each level. So how do you do so? You glide around the place and see if an Emerald is picked up on a radar (REALLY helpful), and they could be hidden in enemies or other places. The only minor (And only MINOR) downside with Knuckles is that there are only about 1 (or 2?) Emeralds throughout the game that could only be found by digging into the ground. I was expecting Knuckles's digging upgrade to be used a bit more specifically for finding Emeralds.Amy - She isn't as fast as the above 3 characters, but she still isn't a bad pick. Although having the same robot chase her throughout levels is a little cringe-inducing, Amy plays pretty well, as she can attack with her massive hammer.E103 Omega - Alright. Who expected a robot to be playable in a Sonic game? I certainly haven't, but I'm glad I am. Omega's gameplay involves massive deals of weaponry, as well as being able to hover later on, and do certain tasks in the levels. In Final Egg, for example, you must destroy Sonic dolls. In Emerald Coast, you catch Froggy. In other levels, you must go destoy other Omega robots! I absolutely love playing as this thing, as much as I love playing as the first 3 characters.Big - Big is a pretty lame downside to this game. He's slow, and you have to go fishing for things. It's as fun as described, and I certainly don't want to go back to playing as him. Sadly, you have to beat the game as all characters if you want to fight the actual last boss, Perfect Chaos, so........That pretty much covers up the characters. As for everything else, the level design is magnificent and lovingly crafted. Plus, the graphics are awesome for the time, and the soundtrack rocks!However, Sonic Adventure is not without flaws. The cutscenes aren't amazing, and while the story is nicely done, some bits of dialogue are a bother (THAT'S A CHAOS EMERALD! - Says Knuckles as 2 Chaos Emeralds have been spotted). Oh, yeah, and there's Big the Cat. Nevertheless, these are, of course, minor problems, as the game is so much fun that you'd hardly think about them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYXSW","description":"","reviewerName":"Jared Castle \"Oregon writer\"","summary":"Blazing Saddles for the Kinect!! Lots of fun, lots of laughs!","reviewText":"Bless the development team at Twisted Pixel for a brilliant use of the Kinect system and a wholly original story and game that injects the most humor and silliness into The Wild West since Mel Brooks'Blazing Saddles. This game is great fun and one of the most enjoyable Kinect experiences we've had to date.I purchased downloadable versions of \"The Gunstringer\" and \"Fruit Ninja Kinect\" for my sons, ages 9 and 7. I had already read several reviews, so I knew going in that the game campaign is relatively short. Some reviewers describe it as a `weekend game' because all of the levels can be completed in less than 4-8 hours. There's replay value here, especially if you swap controls in the two-player mode.While the campaign is short, it is grueling nonetheless. Controls require you to use your left hand to control the marionette's strings. Your right hand controls the Gunstringer's pistol, wave your hand over targets and recoiling back to your shoulder to fire - as many as six shots at a time. In two-player mode, the second player controls the Gunstringer's other pistol. You might not think all that waving about would get tiring, yet the game offers players the option of pulling up a few chairs if players grow tired standing.You advance the Gunstringer through 2D and 3D environments, jumping over traps while you sight and shoot targets along the path. Timing some of the jumps is tricky since it requires you to flick your left hand higher in the air as if you were lifting the marionette into the air. That said, the controls are simple, intuitive and (most importantly) responsive.One caveat is that the \"T\" rating is for bawdy humor, i.e. sexually suggestive themes. The review from the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) provides these details:\"The game also contains some suggestive dialogue and depictions: a female character is depicted with exaggerated-sized breasts and protruding cleavage; a character appears to be straddling an alligator in a sexual manner (e.g., \"[T]he lumberjack would later claim that he was only wrasslin' the gator . . . but the Gunstringer had seen the truth of it in their eyes.\"); the dialogue contains some sexual jokes and innuendo (e.g., \"[T]he brothel Madame, whose magnificent yabbos notwithstanding, he had marked for death\" and \"The train was about to make its last and final stop at the bottom of Dry Hump Canyon.\"). A reference to peyote is also contained in dialogue.\"The suggestive jokes went over my sons' heads. Older children and teenagers will no doubt catch and understand the underlying humor.In summary, I highly recommend Gunstringer over the ubiquitous sports titles flooding the Kinect market. Twisted Pixel brings a fresh and funny approach to the Kinect. I can't wait to see what they produce next.Rating: Five stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must have.Metal Gear Solidis one of the all-time greats.

Solid Snake is definitely one of the most, if not the most, coolest video game characters of all time. When I first started this game, I was really nervous, thinking all of this sneaking around in the middle of a heavily armed base would be impossible for me to do without getting caught every 2 minutes. But, I turned out to be better at stealth than I thought (I guess I have my game &quot;Tenchu: Stealth Assassins&quot; to thank for that). This game was not only full of action, but the story was the best one I've ever come across in a video game: it was unsurpassable until the sequel came out! The enemies were really cool too, especially the Cyborg Ninja, Vulcan Raven, and the totally badass Liquid Snake.All I have left to say is, get this game.

Phasing.We saw phasing in Wrath at several points, but for the most part the remainder of Wrath was \"persistent world\" content, where the actions of the player do not have a permanent impact on the game world.  This has been a feature of MMOs from the beginning, mostly for technical reasons, but now we have a new paradigm where phasing can be broadly used to convey story development in a changing world throughout the experience of the game.  When phasing is coupled together with creative use of cut scenes, the MMO experience has just been moved a lot closer to the kind of story-telling capability once considered impossible in MMORPGs.  Again, this was present in small-ish doses in Wrath, but here it's full-blown, and it changes the nature of the MMO player experience in such a fundamental way as to simply raise, again, the expectations bar for games of this type.It seems crazy that this kind of innovation is taking place in the context of a game which is 6+ years old, now, and which continues to eschew the otherwise seemingly ubiquitous obsession in computer gaming with state-of-the-art bleeding edge graphical quality.  But Blizzard has managed to reset the expectations bar, again.As for the rest, you can read it well in other reviews.  New races with fun, phased, starting zones and leveling areas.  A comprehensive \"redo\" of the original areas from the 2004 game, making leveling a new character a significantly new experience in many zones.  Raising the level cap to 85, adding some new abilities, streamlining talent trees further and so on.  More than enough content to have fun with for quite some time for everyone other than the most eager beavers who chew through content like starving wolves.As for the complaints about the dumbing down, the fundamental point is this:  Blizzard's idea when making WoW, principally, was to try to make the MMO experience more *fun* and accessible to more players.  They succeeded in this, even though the original design featured more of the \"traditional\" MMO elements due to some of the design team coming from some of these earlier MMOs.  Over the years, the game design has been tweaked and tweaked, pretty much each time in the direction of more fun and accessibility, and less drag/grind/un-fun.  This has always created tension with the MMORPG elite crowd, who wants a game design that rewards the time rich by punishing, relatively, the time poor.  And WoW catered to this, to some degree, when the game was first released, at least at the level cap.  However, over the years, this has been gradually changed so that the game has been redesigned to allow more fun and accessibility to more players -- after all, WoW is truly the first \"mass market MMO\" in the West.  Cataclysm is another major step in this direction, no doubt, which is why some of the elite type players are not happy with it.  And if you are one of those players, then you know what you are getting into with WoW and its expansions.  However, if you are more of a mainstream player, Cataclysm will be a treat for you and yours to enjoy for some time to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2010"}

In addition to an updated soundtrack, fans of the blue hero will also find a cache of unlockable bonus features that include 30 minutes of anime (PlayStation 2 version), producer interviews (GameCube version) and a history of the series.","reviewerName":"Ryan Sil. (Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"A collection of games that never went out of style","reviewText":"The MegaMan series has been one of the best video game series for the NES, and for great reason. It had precise controls, amazing graphics, and fantastic gameplay that will keep you entertained. The series even went on to MegaMan 7 for the Super Nintendo and MegaMan 8 for the Playstation, although those games don't hold much appeal compared to the NES games (They are still good games though).Now you get to experience all eight games (Before 9 and 10) from the original series and two arcade games that are also fun to play. You gotta love the bonus content packed in here, too. The interviews, the pictures, etc....I think it should come to little surprise that the NES games are 8-Bit thrills. MegaMan 2 and 3 are probably the highlights of this disc, due to how fans argue about which MegaMan is better: 2 or 3. One thing that sets off some fans, however, is that the A and B button controls are swapped in Anniversary Collection. But how does that change the experiences for these NES classics? It doesn't change a thing. All you gotta know is: These games are classics, and you must play them.MegaMan 7 and 8 kinda slip away from the NES games' style. For instance, the intro and ending for MegaMan 8 are anime-styled. And there's just something that is missing from the two games that the NES games have. Who knows what it is, but I think it's the feel of an 8-Bit MegaMan title. Nonetheless, the two games are still pretty good.Now to talk about the arcade games. I do manage to find an Ultracade cabinet with MegaMan: The Power Battle built-in, but I don't see a lot of ones that feature MegaMan 2: The Power Fighters.Power Battle allows you to play through 6 robot masters and 2 Wily bosses. You can choose to play a course selection of either MegaMan 1-2, MegaMan 3-6, or MegaMan 7 (8 wasn't made yet when this game came out). As you may already know, the game takes the bosses from the mentioned games and it has you fight them to move on. It's kind of like how the NES games do it, except without the stages themselves, and only the boss battles. MegaMan: The Power Battle is actually an easy game, but, like all the other MegaMans in this collection, it's still a good game. Co-op multiplayer is the best part of this game. You can play with a friend and together you can defeat Dr. Wily and his robots.MegaMan 2: The Power Fighters is a bit more challenging than Power Battle. Now you don't get to choose which robots to face from certain games. You're given the ones that are just shown depending on which mission you chose to do. It plays similarly to Power Battle, despite those things.Overall, this is one awesome game collection. MegaMan fans should definitely pick this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2011"}

Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

The graphics, specially in dialog are gorgeous. Once you get to combat, they're good, but not gorgeous even thou everything is created using the game's engine. The story is very well done and intriguing. I found myself enjoying the dialog so much I felt I was watching a movie. Now the bad things: The shooting controls are just awkward. It wants to be gears of war in the combat mechanics and fails miserably in the attempt. Another game I'm playing these days, Uncharted Drakes fortune, completely rips off the GOW mechanics as well, but the execution is perfect. So if you're going to rip some game off, at least do it well. The shooting controls and mechanics just  feel clunky and uncomfortable. Using the sniper rifle is an exercise in futility. The screen shakes so much you're aiming all over the place and \"No diazepam for you!\" is the motto of the designer Nazis. The rest of the game just feels S L O W. I found myself constantly wondering which way to go. I  just beat Call of duty 4. The difficulty setting in that one was perfect. Want to figure out where to go by yourself? fine. It's your choice. Not a hard core explorer? No problem. They will take you by the hand the whole game. In this one is pretty much a couple of clues on the map, which is like 5 button pushes away if you need it, and pretty much you're on your on. Did I mention S L O W?If you're an RPG fan, you'll love this game. If any of what I mentioned before makes you hesitate, rent if first. This is a AAA title and there's a lot of quality here.

I missed Zevran, Morrigan and others quite a bit, especially since Bioware seemed to forget Morrigan would play a part like they said she would.You feel trapped in Kirkwall, and yes the game's side quests can keep you busy, but it's repetitive. For an elaborate RPG, that's inexcusable. The first game immersed me in the whole of Ferelden, and I could go anywhere and the freedom felt real (not on an Elder Scrolls level, but still nice).It was fun for a bit, but overall I couldn't care less for the Champion of Kirkwall, or Kirkwall itself for that matter.

Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail.

However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy. It  also means that diligent gamers may findPikmina rather short game.At the end of your gaming day,Pikminis one of the best games on the  GameCube.--Mark BrooksPros:Very innovative and originalGorgeous graphicsGreat sound and musicAmazing blend of action and strategyCons:Time limit causes players to repeat tasksExperienced strategy gamers may findPikminends too quicklyDifficult to control camera during tense moments","reviewerName":"Edward \"war02orc\"","summary":"Definately a welcome addition to the gamecube","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying that Pikmin is not only for little kids.

Emerge from the tiniest of villages into a sweeping tale of danger and war, chronicling your rise from a peasant to a full-fledged hero of the Realms. The story takes place several years after the original Neverwinter Nights, and reintroduces popular characters and NPCs in a new storyline with new challenges.","reviewerName":"H. Le","summary":"AKA: Neverwinter Nights 2 BETA !!!","reviewText":"Overall, this is an excellent game that is still in the beta stage. Therefore, 1) please do not buy this game unless your gaming computer meets the recommended requirements -- not the minimum requirements - that is almost certainly not good enough.  2) even if you can run the game smoothly, be ready for bugs.  3) be sure to download all the patches: either 1.02 or 1.03 beta (they're huge)  4) Go to the NWN2 community web site and see what kind of problems are out there (there are tons of problems - some of which you surely will encounter) I won't go over them because there are simply too many to list and they happen too randomly.  That is, the few reviewers who criticized the \"whiners\" did not experience them.  On the other hand, there are a lot of non-whiners who have absolutely legitimate reasons to complain over a game that is being released at least 6 months too early. I hope to be fair to both group.With that said, please let me repeat that this is still an excellent game that has major issues.  Graphic is good but NOT spectacular considering the game being a resource hog.  Oblivion, albeit being a different type of gameplay, truly has spectacular graphic for the same system requirement.  However, we all know that games should not be based on eye candies alone but on how fun it is to play, and that is NWN 2's saving grace. Gameplay is a big improvement over NWN1.  You now have almost full control of up to 5 party members - very similar to Star Wars Knight of the Republic 2 (from the same maker, Obsidian) with a touch of Baldur's Gate gameplay thrown in, but do not expect the same level of high precision of control over party members as in Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale. But that also means that you don't have to micro-manage too much, so it's a give and take situation.  It does take a while, maybe even a great while, or maybe never, but if you can get over the camera annoyances and come to term with it, the game play can really rock as this is really a fun game.The story is excellent, though not as compelling as NWN 1.  Once you get into it, it will hook you and won't let go.  This is simply what Obsidian does best in this game (and probably all their games).  There is noticeable lack of a central character that you can immediately identify as both the antagonist and a protagonist, and develope a love/hate relationship with, such as Kreia in SWKOTOR 2 or Aribeth in NWN 1.  Regardless, it still is great story telling.Sound is also excellent but also has lot of minor setback.  To begin with, there are very good theme and backgrougd sound and music, as well as good voice acting.  The complain here is that way too much are borrowed from NWN 1.  If you ever play SWKOTOR 2, you will probably agree that the Obsidian team has plenty of musical talents that does not require borrowed-music.  Perhaps the problem here, as well, is the fact that the game is being released way too early.As is, my biggest complaint is directed at the corporate suits, AKA the new Arch-Angels of the new God: Profit, that pushes this game to release before X-mas, all for the sake of being able to make the timely offering to their newfound God. My next complaint goes to Obsidian, an extremely talented team (I've played all their games - I've been a gamer since the late 80's) that has the leverage to play hard ball, but instead, chose to bow down or (or bend over) to the Arch-Angels and take it with a smile.Lastly, I should also complain about us, the gaming community that, apparently, are beginning to think that it is OK to produce unfinished games. Please take some times to think about this.  If you have a real job, you would agree that there is no chance in hell that you can release an incomplete product that did not make it through quality control -- and worst of all, think that it is OK to do so. If you want to be more precise, then here's one: a game should easily run with the stated minimum requirement printed on the box (recommended requirements are purely for eye candies). Do your own research and you will find that is not the case with NWN2.  With that said, I will make myself a reminder to look for Atari's contact email so I can \"whine\" at the right place.In conclusion, this is an excellent game if you have the recommended gaming rig (remember: recommended - not minimum), and have the patient to deal with the bugs. Your best bet, however, is to wait a 2-3 more months for more patches to come out, and probably at cheaper price, to make it really worth it.PS. Don't even think of giving this game to some kid for X-mas if their computers don't meet the recommended stats - Oh, the disappointment! that's simply too cruel.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2006"}

There are no other video game franchises  I can think of that can deliver great stories, innovative gameplay, expert voice acting and relevant as well as post-modern writing all in one package. Time and time again, each entry of the series has changed the climate of video games. The creator Hideo Kojima is a visionary, and a genius in my book, but he has also single handedly proved that video games can be more than just a mere form of entertainment people can play, but rather an experience as well as a great expression of art. I own all the main entries of the Metal Gear franchise, but in order to play them I have to bust out the old PS2 and PSP just to play them. With this convenient collection I can now play all the games in one great bundle on one system.This collection contains all the main games in the Metal Gear Solid series directed by Hideo Kojima including:- Metal Gear- Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake- Metal Gear Solid (via download from voucher code included)- Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty- Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater- Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots- Metal Gear Solid: Peace WalkerMGS2 and 3 also include some of the bonus features included in their re-releases, Substance and Subsistence respectively. This collection also includes Metal Gear Solid VR Missions (a compilation of side missions played with the MGS1 mechanics) once again like MGS1, has to be downloaded via voucher code included in the box. Also included are 2 graphic novels which can be viewed as 2 full length movies based on the Metal Gear Solid 1 & 2. I have played and completed all of these games in the past except for VR Missions, but I appreciate the HD transfer for all games and even the trophy system which are nice. The only gripe I have with this collection is the omission of &#34;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&#34; which in my opinion is an important canonical story in the series; however the reasoning behind this was because Hideo Kojima did not direct the game himself and only served as an executive producer. Portable Ops contained some origin stories for important characters such as Roy Camball, Gray Fox and subtle hints of the creation of the Patriots. Despite that, this is the definitive collection for the Metal Gear Solid series thus far with easily over 100 hours of gameplay. If you have never played any of the Metal Gear Solid games before and are interested, this would be perfect for you: and for the MGS purists such as myself who simply wants all of the games in one convenient package than this is a great deal.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Amozarte","summary":"A fitting end to a 21 year series","reviewText":"Since MGS4 is the culmination of a 21 year long series, a review of several paragraphs seems inadequate. My first impression of the game, on the other hand, spanned only three letters: Wow! Booting the game on my HDTV, I was greeted by a stunning rendering of Solid Snake, casually puffing a smoke as the game performed its initial install.I have to pause here to mention that since so many PS3 games have hard drive installs, I consider it a characteristic of the platform. Therefore any praise or criticism should be paid to the system, not the individual games.This game begins, as one would expect, with a cutscene. The cutscenes use the game's engine so I almost didn't notice when actual play began. I say almost because unlike MGS3: Snake Eater, which deposited you in an area devoid of enemies, Snake starts this chapter feet first into a war zone.This point is subtle, but important- especially to the criticism the series has endured from people who simply aren't fans of the sneaking genre. While this game's heart still beats in tune with the stealth genre it spawned, there is plenty of action. The game's new over-the-shoulder mechanic makes this possible. Gunplay is smooth and very intuitive. Not once did I experience the frustrating, wonky alert phases of previous titles. If there is still any room for improvement, I sure don't know where it is.The implementation of the new shooting mechanic, in turn, paved the way for other gameplay options that helped add some spice to the MGS recipe and effectively prevented monotony from rearing its ugly head. Entire sections of action, with several enemies charging a room at once felt natural and fluid. Even vehicle chases, with Snake manning the weaponry, functioned so smoothly that the player was able to be immersed in the tension of the moment.And speaking of tension, there is no shortage here. One of my favourite levels challenged Snake to follow an NPC to his hideout, which sounds simple. Of course you must avoid being seen by the guards, but to add a layer of complexity, the NPC can't be detected either! You also can't let the NPC see you or he will be spooked and run off- possibly into the waiting arms of the enemy. So you must move through the area, incapacitating (or killing) enemy soldiers and clearing a path for the NPC, all the while staying out of his way until he eventually makes it to his hideout.In most games, levels like the one I just described could easily drag on and on, but not in MGS4. Here, each area lasts long enough to allow you to get comfortable, but not to the point of boredom. Just when I started to feel like I was finished with an area, I was finished with that area. To have such perfect pacing was truly a refreshing feeling.All of the game's play elements are flawless, from graphics to sound, even the new Octocamo, which automatically matches your camo to your surroundings like a chameleon. But the glue that holds it all together is the storytelling. With this game, Hideo Kojima has outdone himself. Sure, there were beautiful, moving (and long!) cutscenes but the icing on the cake was how he managed to tie the entire series together in such creative fashion. I was personally tickled by the ipod that allows you to play music from previous games instead of the normal background music. Beyond that there were flashbacks in the cutscenes, visits from familiar but forgotten characters, trips to previous locales, and even a few very satisfying surprises like... no, I won't ruin them for you.During the 25 hours it took me to reach the end, I was so captivated that I had little desire to play anything else. The ending itself was moving and bittersweet. I found myself hoping that this was not the final chapter for Solid Snake, but it is true that all good things must come to an end- and what an end! If you have any love at all for the stealth genre or the Metal Gear series, this is an absolute must-play game. In every way, it is a perfect end to a truly outstanding series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000R0URCE","reviewerName":"Scottypiper \"Scottypiper\"","summary":"A great but short Star Wars game","reviewText":"Story: the story takes place between Revenge of the Sith and a New Hope (episodes 3 and 4). Darth Vader searches Kashyyyk for a surviving Jedi, kills him and finds a boy with a strong presence in the force. He raises him as his secret apprentice named Starkiller, unknown to his Sith master, emperor Palpatine. Once the emperor discovers the apprentice, he orders Vader to kill him. Vader tosses Starkiller into space, then sends some droids to retrieve and revive him. Vader then uses Starkiller to crush a rebellion. During his mission, Starkiller rescues Jedi Master Kota, princess Organa and senator Organa. During the rescue, Starkiller learns from Kota about the way of the Jedi and Starkiller becomes their ally. During a planned meeting to form a rebellion, Vader shows up and all hell breaks loose. Vader tells Starkiller he was never meant to overthrow the emperor, but used to expose the emperor's enemies (the rebellion). Starkiller then pursues to rescue the Jedi Kota and the senators captured by Vader. You are given a choice in the ending to kill Vader or save the prisoners.Gameplay: Third-person action. Armed with a light saber and the force, you take on hordes of bad guys through various locations including space ships and the death star in the Star Wars galaxy. In the beginning, you are taking on good guys (the rebellion), after the double-cross by Vader, you take on imperial troops and droids. The force powers are good and the light saber fighting is better than Obi Wan. You can use button combos to advance your fighting.Conclusion: the controls are easy to use and comfortable. The game is awesome but my only complaint and reason for the 1 star loss is the game length. While I realize some games are to short and some games are to long (50 hours plus), this game is definitely in the to short category, with game play at around 2 hours. I prefer games to be around 10-20 hours in this generation. Most star wars fans will love this game, even in its short nature, so it's worth picking up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2011"}

High speed fun in the fastest, most visually stunning racing game ever.","reviewerName":"Jeff \"Jeff\"","summary":"The best use of Nintendo's franchise names on the Cube?","reviewText":"A little background.  I love Nintendo games.  There I said it.  I am an adult gamer, 29 years old, and I feel Nintendo's current reputation of being just for kids is totally undeserved, and in fact is a buch of hogwash started by Sony &amp; Microsoft fanatics.  I have an XBox and enjoy playing games on both that system, the GameCube, PC, and my GameBoy Advance.  No I don't own a PS2, and never have.  That being said, anyone who discounts Nintendo's systems as systems for kids, is really cheating themselves out of option of playing some of the highest quality software on the market.F-Zero GX is hardcore.  This is no joke... if you don't believe me, read other reviews on Amazon, or critics reviews elsewhere.  It is the hardest game I have played in the current generation, which in general has seen difficulty decline over the previous generation of consoles.  As games have become more mainstream, developers have been making them easier in order to entice people that may have avoided playing games in the past because they thought they were too hard.  Nintendo itself is guilty of this.  &quot;The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&quot; was significanty less difficult than its Nintendo 64 counterparts.  So was &quot;Super Mario Sunshine.&quot;  That being said, with the possible exception of &quot;Metroid Prime,&quot;  &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; is the purest form of vintage game difficulty available on GameCube.  I really think that farming this franchise out to SEGA was the best possible choice. SEGA has a hardcore reputation for building frantic, visually stunning games with higher than average difficulty.  Unfortunately for Sega, the hardcore percentage of the market used to be dominant, but as the industry grew, hardcore gamers now make up a relatively small portion of the overall gaming community.If you like difficult games, or even think you might like to give one a try, &quot;F-Zero GX&quot; is an excellent choice.  The graphics are absoulutely stunning all around.  The play control is so tight, the player will never question that when a mistake is made, it was her/his fault.  You will never blame the game because the control is flawless.  Difficulty varies... and gets significantly tougher as gameplay progresses throughout.  The game actually encourages lots of practice.  Practice will help players increase their skills.  The game is very fun and has extremely high replay value.&quot;F-Zero GX&quot; is a masterpiece collaboration of Nintendo and Sega.  This may be going out on a limb, but I enjoyed it more than any GameCube game of 2003, including &quot;Mario Kart: Double Dash&quot; for GameCube and &quot;Burnout 2: Point of Impact Developers Cut&quot; for Xbox, both of which are fabulous racing games too.Bottom Line:  If you like the &quot;F-Zero franchise&quot;, racing games, arcade style games that you can play for a few minutes or several hours, or are looking for something a little less &quot;kiddie&quot; than other games for current consoles, look no farther than &quot;F-Zero GX.&quot;  A harcore gamers dream come true.Jeff","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

Thanks to Atlus, now I can at least save lives with my stylus. Yes, the library of innovative, interactive DS games doesn't seem to be drying up, and in Trauma Center: Under the Knife, we've another quirky Japanese title that somehow makes playing games fun again.Assuming the role of Derek Stiles, a rookie surgeon, your task in Trauma Center is to save the world. Blessed with a unique gift only known as the \"healing touch\", which gives you extraordinary speed and concentration when performing a surgery, you'll take on a group of terrorists who've brought upon a mysterious, yet life-threatening virus called GUILT upon the world.Of course, as a surgeon, you won't have to take on these people head on, Street Fighter-style. Instead, each attack from the terrorists is sent to you in the form of a patient. The injured parts are revealed as close-ups on the touch screen, while you use a host of items to salvage the situation within a time limit. Obviously, the cases get more and more complicated as the game progresses, and saving the lives of these patients becomes truly a race against time, as well as the strange ailments that befall upon them.In essence, Trauma Center requires you to perform surgeries after surgeries. While this may sound a little repetitive, you probably won't even notice it in practice. The game is paced so quickly, you'd barely have any time to think about what to do next, and before you know it, you're on the job again. Sharp instincts, quick reflexes and a lot of patience are what will get you through the game. But if you're into unveiling the mystery behind GUILT and its perpetuator, you wouldn't be shortchanged too. The game did a good job of making a simple story interesting, and despite some insanely difficult to perform surgeries (and many lost lives), you'll get great satisfaction out of every soul you save.Saving lives is not exactly rocket science in Trauma Center. It basically involves selecting an item from the icons on the sides of the touch screen, and applying them to the wounded areas. For example, you can suture a wound by stroking your stylus in a zigzag fashion over a cut, or remove a foreign object from the bodies by lifting it in the correct direction by holding it and slowly dragging it away with the stylus. Your assistant will also give you instructions on the top screen on what to do, so you ought to have some ideas on how to make things work like a real surgeon, even though you may never emulate the handwriting. However, as the action gets thicker and faster, you may simply find the advice being a bother rather than help.And then they give you some cases when no one else is around to advise you.Such is the pressure of Trauma Center, I'd only recommend it to gamers who have a strong heart (no pun intended). If you're not into looking at wounds and lacerations, the game won't shock you by the quite unrealistic graphics (for the bodies and blood and what have you - the nurses, I mean, people, are generally well drawn ). But it does have the potential of making you want to throw your DS towards the wall when you fail to save yet another a life, and that's when the real problem comes in. The game is very difficult to play, and as I mentioned, you'll need a lot of patience to engage it. But at least it tries to help you concentrate on the task by toning down the audios, which may not be a plus point for some, but definitely one for me.And, if after all that I wrote, you still think you've what it takes to seek the truth behind GUILT, you should immediately turn off that episode of ER, and make an appointment with Trauma Center: Under the Knife.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2005"}

The story is a bit chaotic, but just pay attention, it wont loose you, but rather draw you in.Its a very interesting tale, and it gives Dracula more purpose than just being some blood sucking bat morphing killer.Dracula is more angry than evil I would say, which keeps him in the hero perspective. They actually skip a big chunk of history, the part where Gabriel first becomes Dracula and goes on a psychopath blood drive. The result is, we see the brotherhood storming his castle, but really have no real reason why;none other than that hes Dracula. I would have loved to have had the game where we got to play with him as the ultimate evil badass, and instead of defeating the ultimate bad guy at the end, you defeat the good guy. But that didn't happen here. That's why I say hes more angry than evil, and the story is nuts. But I love it so far.The action and fighting is really fun. More fluid and connecting than God of War.Theres a lot to scavenge for. The graphics are great. The upgrade UI is a bit wonky, but you ll get used to it.The music is the best part.

As with the earlier Mario ports, the translation is flawless, and there are a few tweaks that bring it up to date for the GBA.I first played this game and beat it many times, so sitting down to play it again was like riding a bicycle...you never really forget. I quickly adapted and remembered all the hidden portals, the hidden 1 ups, and all the extra perks that made this game so much fun. As far as the port goes, it is very similar to the one on \"Super Mario All Stars\" for SNES, but with the graphics and music slightly pumped up. The game itself needs no introduction, except for the fact that it is one of the best video games of all time. The challenge, the new improvements made on an old concept (remember, this game was a product of the late 80's video game craze), all the classic elements are still here. There are some who would complain that the GBA is just a portable SNES, but what is the problem with that? It is great to this game made available for a whole new generation.The minor quibbles I have are nothing to do with the gameplay itself, but with the \"extras\" that are included. For starters, the addition of the original arcade version of \"Super Mario Brothers\", which is the exact same one they have included on the other two Mario ports on the GBA. It would be nice to have different games to play as extras, and the same game gets pretty tiring after a while. The other annoyance is the horrible voice characterizations in the game. Mario, in his cheesiest Italian accent, says \"Mama Mia!\" when he dies, and \"Just what I needed!\" when he gets a power-up. These were amusing for about 2 seconds on the other Mario ports, and are just annoying now after hearing them a million times!This is so far the best NES/SNES port to the GBA, and I had no hesitation about purchasing it again, despite knowing the game like the back of my hand. For any fan of classic gaming, this is essential. For the uninitiated, Mario never got better than this, so this is essential! Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2003"}

{"product_name":"B0049DYNNO","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Great Games (obviously), but Mario deserves better than this!","reviewText":"Great Games (obviously), but Mario deserves better than this!Twenty five years is a long time in the entertainment industry.  Although at the time of this compilation's release (2010), Mario had actually been around thirty years, this was the twenty fifth anniversary of the debut of the SUPER MARIO series.  The real problem with this release is as far as actual game content goes it only covers the first three years of Mario's career (1985-1988, which is the time period when the four NES Mario games were made.  Though SUPER MARIO 3 came out in the US in 1990, the game had been finished and even released in Japan in 1988).Now, depending on what you want or how you look at this release, the 25th Anniversary release is either a rather cheap marketing ploy for Nintendo to make some quick cash or a good way to get all four Mario games.  I bought the title and am glad to be able to play the 16 bit remakes on the Wii, but I quite see the point that this is a rather botched release to say the least.  What should have been a true celebration of Mario and what he means to Nintendo simply becomes a budget line release with an SNES rom dumped onto a disk and given some new packaging.Now, this review is really only about the 25th anniversary release, not the games themselves.  The four titles are essential centerpoints in video gaming's early history, and stand up remarkably well, even in today's multimillion dollar budgets.  Yes, they are short and simple, but that's largely part of the charm.  Mario has always been tremendously accessible, and for those without a lot of time, Mario is great because you can pick up and play.  If you want more information on the four games I've included a portion of my original review for the SNES cart after the main review, rather than reinvent the wheel and include information on each title on this already lengthy review.Ultimately, Mario sells systems and always has.  Nintendo has learned that the hard way with the 3DS debacle.  Miyamoto himself said that they should have had SUPER MARIO 3DS LAND ready for release, as that would truly demonstrate what the 3DS could do. How many times have Nintendo sold us these same four games?  Lots.  There are obviously the original NES titles.  Then there was the SNES SUPER MARIO ALLSTARS (with the previously unreleased stateside LOST LEVELS).  Then there was the Gameboy Color release.  Then the Gameboy Advanced Classic NES series.  Then we have the Super Mario Advance series.  Then we have the Virtual Console.  And now this. (And for the record, other than the Super Mario advanced series, I have bought these four games in all these various forms).Based on Mario's pure market power, I feel Nintendo felt they were able to get away with a release like this . . . and they were right.  Supposed to be a limited print run, this release quickly sold out and a lot of people began price gouging on online market places like eBay.  The release proved so popular that Nintendo did another production run of the title.  Although this was supposed to be a \"limited edition\" run, apparently the title is still in print, as you are able to purchase this new from several online sourcesSo what's the real problem with the 25th Anniversary Release?  Well, several things.First, this is a straight port of SUPER MARIO ALLSTARS for the SNES.  And I mean just that - a STRAIGHT PORT.  In SMA you are able to change the controller options and they show SNES controllers.  It's rather odd to see the SNES controllers listed in this release.Another big problem is the tremendous waste of space on the disk.  With all the available space, Nintendo only includes an SNES rom?  Seriously? With all the space, they could have included SUPER MARIO WORLD, SUPER MARIO 64, Gameboy titles, miscellaneous early sports NES and SNES titles, even the Gamecube's SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE.  After all, this release was supposed to be a full blown celebration of Mario - he deserves better than just an SNES rom with some pretty packaging!As far as the packing goes, you do get a booklet of Mario history and a CD.  Honestly, the booklet isn't that great, with only one liners on each title from Miyamoto, Koji Kondo (the music composer), and Takashi Tezuka.  You also get a (very short) cd of Mario music as well, with lots of sound effects.  There is some interesting artwork in the booklet as well but that's about it.Honestly you get more information from online sources than what is found in the booklet, especially the Nintendo series of interviews called \"Iwata Asks\", where Nintendo President Satoru Iwata poses various questions to about different game developers regarding products.  In these you learn that the original Mario had a shooting stage (!) and the cloud levels were left over remants of that never used idea, and that the second quest in THE LEGEND OF ZELDA came about by accident, as they released they had only used half the available data on the ROM.What would have been nice, and would have curved much of the criticism that has come against this release, is either to see more content (after all, the four NES games, being NES platformers, do not take that long to complete), or, barring that, see the four NES games updated graphically.  It would have been great to play the four NES titles with NEW SUPER MARIO BROS. WII graphics.  At least it would have been new, even if it was only a graphical facelift. (Ironically, Nintendo Power criticized the original SMAS in their 1993 issue for being only a facelift with nothing really new to offer, with the exception of the first ever release of LOST LEVELS).Then the Virtual Console and download space come into the equation as well.  ALL STARS has long been in demand as a Virtual Console release, although most speculated Nintendo would most likely not release that as it may cannibalize sales of the original four 8-bit Mario titles already available for through the service.  Though I don't know how valid that is, personally I think ALLSTARS would have been better served as a Virtual Console release, and the price would have been much cheaper as well.  (As of December 2011 we still haven't gotten SUPER MARIO WORLD 2: YOSHI'S ISLAND released, which along with SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE is the only Mario title I really haven't played, although SMW2 is a Yoshi game, not a Mario game).So over all, as an celebration of Mario's career, this \"25th Anniversary Release\" comes off rather poorly, and gives the distinct impression Nintendo really didn't put that much effort (because they didn't).  Knowing the market would purchase this title without any real effort on their part, Nintendo threw the SNES ROM on the disk, gave it some minimal packaging, and wah-la, instant seller!And you know what?  They were right.  I bought my copy.  So if you want the 16-bit remakes of the four Mario titles and feel justified paying thirty to fifty bucks retail for an SNES Rom first released in 1993, go for it.  After all, it's Mario, and for family entertainment it's a great way to go.  I just wish Nintendo had given Mario a better anniversary celebration.5 stars for the games, 1 star for pure laziness and market reliance on Nintendo's part (1 star is on this release only and is no way an indictment against the games)...-----Taken from my review of the original SNES title which includes later versions included  SUPER MARIO WORLDSUPER MARIO ALLSTARS, an anthology of the first four NES Mario games for the SNES, was one of the most popular titles Nintendo released during the early 1990s.  Since these titles were such staples of the NES, it was only logical to port them to SNES with a graphical overhaul, options to save, and (for America anyway) the release of a long lost game called LOST LEVELS.  Also, depending on what version of this you get, in later releases they also packaged SUPER MARIO WORLD as well, making this a one stop shop for those looking for a Mario fix.  These are the games.SUPER MARIO BROTHERS: The single most popular game ever released, and also the most widely circulated.  Largerly responsible for saving the video game industry after the historic crash of 1984, it is now easy to forget (especially for younger gamers) how revolutionary this title was when it first came out.  8 expansive worlds, bright colourful graphics, and much more complex than the usual one-screen games that dominated in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  A real technological breakthrough and a historic landmark in gaming, even all these years later it holds up with pixel-perfect graphics and rock-solid game play.  Don't miss this one.THE LOST LEVELS: The original followup to SMB; released only in Japan.  Deemed to hard for the American markets, another game was given Mario sprites and released in America as SMB2.  This title, however, is notoriously difficult.  I always think of it as the second quest, like in the original Zelda.  If you go through all 8 levels without warping, you get to a secret world, 9, before going on to worlds A-D.  When ALLSTARS first came out, Nintendo Power had a promotion that if you got to world 9 they would send you a Mario badge.  Ah, the memories!  Still, if you really want to test your metal against incredibly difficult old-school Mario levels, this game isn't to be missed.  Lots of fun all around.  Some levels, however, make you think Shigeru Miyamoto has a sadistic streak in him.  Closet America ever got to the original 8-bit release was Super Mario Deluxe for the Game Boy Colour, though that was lacking the last five bonus levels and did not have all the same graphics as the original SMB2 did.SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2: Also known as SUPER MARIO BROTHERS USA in Japan (released in 1992 there and 1988 stateside), this is the odd man out in the series.  The game play couldn't be more different than the original SMB if they tried.  The story is Nintendo didn't think they'd be able to sell SMB2 to the American markets, so they took a pre-existing game, DOKI DOKI PANIC, changed a few sprites around, and put the Nintendo seal of approval on it.  (For those of you who have access to the original game booklet that was released with SMB2, the picture of Phanto, the guardian of the keys, is the original sprite from DOKI DOKI, and looks different than what appeared in the Mario version.  When I was little I always wondered why the sprite looked different from the game).  DOKI DOKI's story is a family's pet monkey disppeared into a book and had to be rescued.  To see the ending, you had to complete the game four times, once with each major character.  The Internet has a wealth of info on the differences between the Mario version and the original version.  What I always remember about this game is how fast it sold when it came out in 1988.  As far as game play goes, there are four selectable characters, each with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Mario, naturally, is the most well-rounded, though my brother and I always used Luigi for his jumping skills.  The levels are very odd, contributing to the overall dream-like, bizarre quality that is so inhertant in this game.  A huge smash when it was released, but easily the strangest Mario game in the canon.  Little surprise when you find out it's rather dubious origins (I was in shock when I found out about in the late 1990s).  Ironically enough, Miyamoto purportedly had much more to deal with the development of this game than the Japanese SMB2.SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 3: The best selling game ever released independently*, SMB3 greatly expanded the Mario universe with the introduction of several new enemies, Bowser's children (who was the mother, I wonder? Godzilla's ex?), and introduced cool new suites for Mario to wear.  The game play was more expansive than ever, with cool new secrets to discover and eight tremendously large worlds.  This game laid the foundation for so many other plat-formers, especially SUPER MARIO WORLD.  While SMB2 felt like a weird detour, SMB3 took Mario back to the atmosphere or the original game, taking it a thousand different directions, and coming up with one of the best games ever developed.  Although there were a few tweaks for the ALL STARS release (some levels got a few more coins to make it easy to access game secrets), like the other games this is tremdously faithful to the original NES release.  That alone makes this essential playing.SUPER MARIO WORLD: The later versions of this compilation included SUPER MARIO WORLD as well.  Taking the foundation laid down in SMB3, Nintendo created this flagship title for their pristine new 16 bit console.  Very much of a piece wtih SMB3, although eliminating all the cool suits of its predecessor, Nintendo turned in a stellar, expertly designed platformer that once again set the standards for video games everywhere.  Just like SMB3, and the other titles less so, the game eases you into its mechanics with such ease and percision that, just like the Amazon editorial says, you'll be flying and tossing fireballs and riding around in no time.  Essential gaming.  Plus you get to ride the dinosaur Yoshi and make him eat enemies!  How cool is that?Overall, one of the best carts you can have for the SNES.  The only real drawback is the original versions of the NES games weren't included.  What would have been great is after you finished each game you unlocked the original 8-bit version.  But that (minor) complaint aside, if you want to know what made early gaming so great, or want to relive a bit of nostalgia from your childhood, you can't go wrong with this title.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}

I grew up with games such as Chrono Trigger,Final Fantasy IV through X and I have been very disappointed at this gaming generation as it has become increasingly difficultto find JRPGs that are as good as the classics I grew up with, but this title shines a whole new ray of hope towards the genre.I am very happy to see that Level 5 has not only been making great RPGs for a generation, but to see that theyhave actually been improving with each oncoming game brings me hope, especially after picking up this game that has been ravedacross the RPG communities before its release today.One of the things I am happy to say about thisgame is that this has a beautiful world map with mountains, pine trees, and gives the player a feeling that he or she isactually undergoing an adventure, as opposed to linear paths followed by save points and doors. This is something thatmany RPGs I feel are lacking today, but Level 5 really outdid themselves with this!I also like how this game actually starts out in a somewhat modern, realistic town with cars, street signs, andpeople with your typical modern day homes, and all of a sudden, the main character is summoned to a magical world that no ordinary, every day citizen would know about. The game really exhibits a feel of actually being in it with such aneat start to it. One of the other things I have really enjoyed about this game are the anime cutscenes, it reallyadds quite a unique touch to it. I especially loved to actually have the option to watch the cutscenes in its intendedlanguage, Japanese. God only knows how many RPGs I have played through that I wished had the option to haveJapanese audio. I was expecting this game to be like the rest of the localized US versions of RPGs, just Englishaudio as an option, so this is quite a treat. Back to the game itself, I enjoy the real time/traditional combat system.It combines the best of both worlds. You have the enemy roaming around, and you have the option to approach it, andstart a battle, while being able to move around at all degrees during combat and selecting the attack command just likeone would with a traditional 1980's-1990's JRPG. The music has a beautiful orchestrated touch to it, while usingother old world instruments.Overall, I am very, very pleased with this game and this is certainly the kind of RPG I have been waiting for sinceI first bought my PS3 in 2007. I would highly recommend this to any RPG fan who grew up with RPGs from the 1990'slike I have.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2013"}

No matter what you do you can never go wrong with Mario and the Gang whether it's stomping baddies, playing a round of B-Ball against Bowser and his chumps, or even Tennis with Baby Bowser ... I always find them FUN, Entertaining, and never tiring. I could play a Mario game over and over and it's always just as FUN. So with that being said ... Super Mario 3D Land is just as fun. The 3D ability just enhances our chubby friend and his antics to find the Princess. One tiny issue I have is camera view. Sometimes it's hard to see around the edge of something so you tend to accidentally fall off ledges. But if you just be extra careful you'll be okay. I'd recommend this game to anyone both non-Mario Lovers and Mario Lovers alike.*** UPDATE ***I felt that I have to update my review about Super Mario 3D Land bcuz at the time I had only played a small amount of it and after re-reading the review it wasn't exactly a review but more featured a reason why Super Mario is awesome. Now for my true review ... when first playing this game you'd think OMG the levels are so short and easy to complete. You think 8 Worlds is that it ?? Oh no my mushroom consuming friend they have added TONS of unlockable levels. *SPOILER ALERT* First, you'll unlock and be able to play as Luigi but when you finish those unlocked levels ... again you think so that's it, huh ? Guess again. More levels unlock and the 3rd set of levels unlocked has 8 worlds to go through just like the first time. And let me tell you these sets of levels are pretty tricky since they no longer give you the helper leaf or item when you died multiple times. You're pretty much on your own here. Not to mention the bowser castles at the end again require you to collect more gold star coins to unlock that level. That part can be annoying and frustrating when some are hidden so well. But once you've completely finished the game and unlocked ALL secret levels you'll come to realize this game was so *pardon my french* Freakin' Awesome !! You'd tip your Mario hat at the makers and eagerly look forward to any other Mario series game that comes your way ... For example the Paper Mario 3D and Luigi's Mansion. I know I'm looking forward to those releases. Overall you might feel a bit disappointed at first but don't worry you'll put the game down with a full satisfied gaming belly. It's a MUST-HAVE for ALL 3DS owners !! Now to end this update with a jump into one of those green pipes. Bye !","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Overrated but Better Than Expected","reviewText":"The first thing that fans of the \"Toy Story 3\" videogame will say to me is, \"It wasn't made for you.  It's for a different audience.\"  Oddly enough, though, those people would be wrong.  I love the movie trilogy.  I like action/adventure platformers.  I like open-world sandbox games.So, why not a better score?Well, it basically comes down to this: The Story Mode is decent but way too short, and the Toy Box Mode (while pretty good) isn't enough to keep me playing.The 8-level Story Mode has some brilliant stages that step off the beaten path.  But a couple of the levels are just lazy, particularly the Sunnyside Day Care levels.  Honestly, parts of this Story Mode are so amazing that the weaker parts felt like insults to me.  Considering how dramatic these movies are, I was surprised they didn't try to take advantage of those thematic opportunities.  At least there are a few surprises in store.The Toy Box Mode is sure to be the favorite aspect of the \"Toy Story 3\" videogame, and rightfully so.  It takes a while to get going, because there isn't much to do while you're learning to play the game.  But then there are all sorts of toys to buy, places to explore, neat missions to accomplish, and it eventually feels like a living breathing world of toys.  I think what I missed from this Toy Box Mode, though, was a sense of urgency to continue.  Other open-world titles like \"InFamous\", \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", and \"Fallout: New Vegas\" had a narrative that compelled me to keep playing, even if I wasn't sure I really wanted to.  But with this game's Toy Box Mode, it starts to feel more like a checklist.  An amusing, colorful checklist to be sure, but because there's nothing extraordinary about the gameplay mechanics, it's just not enough.The best compliment and harshest criticism to give to the \"Toy Story 3\" videogame is that it makes you feel like you're playing with a whole bunch of toys.  When you're in the right mood, the game can be a lot of fun.  But after a while, playing with the toys isn't enough.  There has to be something more to draw you in.  Because the Story Mode doesn't use the film's drama, it's simply 8 action stages that aren't worth playing more than twice.  And the Toy Box Mode, for all of the unlockables and customization available, didn't make me feel like I'd accomplished anything.Don't get me wrong, \"Toy Story 3\" is one of the better licensed games out there, and it's surprisingly solid.  But I still don't think it's worth owning.  Just because it's better than most movie-based or TV-based garbage doesn't mean you should fork the cash.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2011"}

It's over 10 years old now, and it's still a great game to play. I mean sure, you can easily beat the game 100% in about 15 hours, give or take some. However, they released a sequel (which I have yet to pick up, hopefully I do soon), and a DS version (currently playing, definitely worth the money). However, there's something about this series that makes it unique and fun.First off, it's not just an RPG where you walk from town to town simply. You use Psynergy, the game's magic system, to solve puzzles so you can progress through the game, giving it its own unique challenge. In the beginning the puzzles are easy, but as the game goes on, you have to find equipment that gives you abilities, or you have to collect little creatures called Djinn to change your class/get different abilities.There's a wide arrange of classes in this game, and the class you are depends on what character it is, and what/how many Djinn are on each character. Sure, you could have 7 of the same Djinn on one character, or you can mix it up and put 3-4 of two different kinds on a character, giving them random stat boosts and new abilities for you to use.This game has a unique story behind each character as well, and along with awesome music, this game is definitely worth it, if you can find it that is. Usually people sell this and the 2nd game together on ebay, so if you can't find a good deal on here (usually like $15 or less), check there.

Johnson","summary":"A potentially great game nearly ruined by new developer.","reviewText":"I recently got into the whole Guitar Hero craze with Guitar Hero 2.  I never thought a game with such a simple concept could be so fun and enjoyable.  Needless to say after completing GH2, I couldn't wait for GH3 to come out.  Sadly GH3 does not have the same fun level that GH2 had.  I actually started my Guitar Hero playing \"career\" with the Demo version of GH3 on XBL.  I had an absolute blast playing the demo songs such as Pearl Jam's \"Evenflow\" and Tenacious D's \"The Metal\".  I however could not see myself paying $100 for a game (w/ the guitar) so I just continued playing those songs.  Then one day my wife's cousin brought over GHII and long story short, a few weeks later I bought GHII.  I eventually got GHIII for Christmas and here is where my review begins.First off, for those that don't know the original creators of GH and GH2 are not the same developers behind GH3.  GH3 was taken over by Neversoft and it is quite apparent that Neversoft does not quite get that the point of these types of games are to have fun.  For whatever reason, Neversoft decided that having fun is no longer important and took many things that made GH2 fun out of GH3.First off while I was able to breeze though Medium, the jump difficulty level to Hard is downright ridiculous on the final tier of songs.  I struggled through the first tiers but finally was able to make it to the final tier only to run into a brick wall with the ridiculous endless hammer on and pull of sequences.  And I do mean \"endless\"; it's nearly impossible and your fingers will beg for it to stop, but it never really does (until you fail of course).  I finally got through the last tier of songs on hard, but now I'm stuck on the impossibly hard and cheesy boss battle (more on this later).  I'm almost to the point where I'm ready to just give it up and play on quick play mode from now on because its just not fun anymore. Yes GH2 songs were also hard the first time through, but even with me failing songs and having the \"video crowd\" boo me, I never stopped having fun in addition they didn't have stupid boss battles just to make the game harder and more frustrating for no good reason.  It's been said many times, Hard and Expert is just hard for hard's sake and there is no reason for a game that is supposed to be FUN to be this frustrating.  Don't get me wrong I enjoy a challenge (i.e. Ninja Gaiden for the XBOX), but for goodness sakes, don't go overboard with it!As for the boss battles, this is probably the worst thing about the game. NeverSoft thought it would be a good idea to add \"Boss battles\" to career mode.  Basically in boss battles, you battle computer controlled guitar players like Slash and eventually the Devil himself.  Instead of star power you are given the opportunity to gain \"power ups\" to mess up your opponent. I think most are pretty cheesy, but the absolute worse is lefty flip which flips the note track forcing you to do everything backwards.  This always results in failure adding more frustration to the game.  On its own I suppose the battle mode would be fine (ie playing against a HUMAN opponent), but forcing players to do this nonsense during career mode is absolutely ridiculous.  The computer clearly has the advantage here and it's even more apparent on the higher difficulty levels.  Some people have called the bosses nothing but \"computerized beat machines\" which is a quite accurate description.  Winning boss battles especially the final one is mostly based on LUCK and how Neversoft thought this would be enjoyable is beyond me.  The new boss battle feature pretty much ruined the game on its own.  If this is going to be a permanent feature in future GH games, then I am done with the GH series.As far as the song list goes, while there are some great tracks on this game, overall, the songs on GH2 are better.  In addition, the songs are GHII are just more fun to play.  Like GH2, in GH3 you are still forced to play through all the songs in order to have them available in quick play mode.  However it is a good thing that you can unlock these songs playing ANY difficulty level because if I had to play these songs on Hard in career mode in order to play them in quick play mode, I would have stopped playing a long time ago.In summary, Neversoft really needs to go back to the drawing board and find out what Harmonix did to make the previous GH games fun because they have missed the boat here with the downright frustrating difficulty, stupid boss battles, and an overall average song list.  This is not to say GH3 is not a fun game, but it could have just been so much better and honestly I think it's a step in the wrong direction compared to GH2.  They need to make the game fun again, and pick more songs that are actually fun to play.  I am actually finding myself playing GH2 more than GH3 these days.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2008"}

To put it bluntly, it falls flat of the greatness of its predecessor, but it still dishes out more of the same great action.The story in RE5 isn't so good.You play as Chris Redfield as he ventures into Africa, alongside his newfound partner Sheva Alomar to uncover the mysteries behind an infection similar to Las Plagas from RE4. The plot has one really significant twist which fans of the series will enjoy, but aside from some neat journal entries you can find during a play through, that's pretty much it.The gameplay still features the classic over-the-shoulder action revolutionized by RE4, but at this point its feeling a bit archaic. Basically you'll run around until a swarm of enemies comes your way, then you'll stop in your tracks and liberally dispense ammo that's given out only sparingly. More freedom of movement would have worked very well, as stopping and popping doesn't really give off the intense vibe that it did in RE4 because RE5 is simply not scary in any way.Obviously the big new draw in RE5 is the co-op. With another human buddy it's reasonably fun, but when your using the AI, it can get frustrating, and it'll make you realize that the Resident Evil series really isn't suited for co-op play.But all's not bad. The core gameplay is still pretty good, and boss fights are very fun. If a game plays even slightly like Resident Evil 4, then the game is probably pretty damn fun.The graphics are excellent. Characters are superbly animated, and the graphical style is great. The game has exceptional use of motion blur, and it's all around one of the prettiest games to ever grace next-gen consoles.The sound department on the other hand isn't so hot. The game's voice overs must've been recorded with terrible quality, and the music is pretty bad too. But the sound effects themselves are okay.The story mode in RE5 will run you a respectable 12-15 hours, and you will unlock the ever awesome Mercenaries mode upon completion. It's also worth noting that Resident Evil games are pretty much always worth a second playthrough, as plenty of new goodies will be dispensed, from new costumes, to an unlimited ammo rocket launcher.It's really hard to lay a final judgment down on Resident Evil 5, because it is a solid game, but the fact that it follows up a near-perfect game doesn't help it at all. Still, archaic design choices, and minor issues aside Resident Evil 5 is a game well worth playing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"A Game Worthy of the Resident Evil Name","reviewText":"I've been playing the Resident Evil franchise since it's inception on the PS1 and have followed the series closely ever since. The pinnacle of the series in my opinion is Resident Evil 4 on the  PS2. So it's no surprise that I awaited the release of the \"next-gen\" Resident Evil game with much anticipation.I'll start by saying that Resident Evil 5 is a fantastic game - marred only slightly by some out-of-date gameplay mechanics.The setting of Resident Evil 5 takes place 10 years after the original outbreak in Racooon City. The game features two main protagonists - Chris Redfield & Sheva Alomar. Sheva is a completely new character to the series; while Chris has been featured in several RE titles. Both Chris & Sheva are part of an organization called the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA from here on) sent to Africa to investigate a possible bioterrorist incident. The story is interesting and familiar enough to likely satisfy most RE fans.Resident Evil 5 does have fantastic graphics - although certainly not the best that can be found on the PS3. But suffice to say that even the most discerning graphics aficionados will likely be pleased by RE5. The entire game is presented in 720p. RE 5 maintains the over the shoulder camera that was implemented for RE 4. The environments of the game are diverse - everything from African shanty-towns, tribal villages, mines and modern facilities.One of the best features of RE 5 is the ability to find or purchase a slew of new weaponry. Everything from low power 9mm handguns to .50 calibur hand cannons, to sniper rifles, machine guns and shotguns. The classic Resident Evil grenade launcher and rocket launcher are also present. You'll earn currency to upgrade weapons by killing enemies and finding treasures (there are 50 different treasures in total, though you can find multiple of almost each type) to sell.The entire adventure first time through will probably last the typical player 8-10 hours. Though Capcom did a great job pushing the replay value of RE 5 to new levels. After you complete the adventure the first time new difficulty levels unlock, along with the ability to use in game points to purchase infinite ammo for almost every weapon in the game. Players can also purchase alternate costumes for Chris & Sheva, along with highly detailed action figures (sounds strange but they're neat to collect) for every character in the game. Beating the game in under 5 hours will also net the player a rocket launcher with infinite ammo. The game also features 61 trophies (including DLC) that will definitely take a long while to collect.That being said, there are some things that I didn't find so great about RE 5. The first is that I feel that the game has deviated a bit too far from the original \"survival horror\" formula. The original game was about a virus that turned healthy individuals into mindless zombies. The enemies in RE 5 are smarter - they can use weapons for one - but I think that the \"feel\" of the series has changed. It's more about survival than horror in RE 5. This may not bother too many players, but as I said, I've been a fan since the beginning.The second thing I'm not a fan of is that similarly to RE 4 you cannot move your character whilst using weapons. This more than anything else seems so out of place and archaic that I was shocked when I first started playing the game. This limitation on movement has been present since the original RE on the PS1. And while it may have worked against slow moving zombies, it's a bit more unforgivable here where the enemies are much quicker. Here's hoping that Capcom implements a move-and-shoot mechanic similar to Dead Space in the next RE game.Lastly, the inventory system has actually regressed from what Capcom implemented in RE 4. In RE 5 you'll have 9 inventory slots and that's it - no upgrades are available as they were in RE 4. Two of the nine slots will likely be used up by key equipment like the bulletproof vest and melee vest leaving the player with 7 slots to carry all your weapons, ammo and healing items. I'm not suggesting that the player should be allowed to carry everything but this system seems like an unwelcome leftover from the PS1 days.All in all I think that RE 5 is a definite must-buy for this generation. Certainly fans of RE 4 will be right at home with this worthy sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005N7YR","reviewerName":"G","summary":"Incredible game!!! Bad system requirements","reviewText":"I have to say, the whole nazi killing and world war 2 thing has gotten kinda boring. A year ago, I was excited for this game's release, and I am highly dissapointed.I had also been looking forward to RTCW, and this is a very good game. I have to admit, it is fun, but the story is dull, the violence is toned down, you have to play multiplayer on Gamespy Arcade, which swarms you with advertisements the instant you open it. I am highly dissapointed to see such a great game have so many downpoints, that I actually rated the game \"so, so\"The other thing is that the system requirements are way, and I mean way, to high. The system requirements are 500mhz with 64 megs of ram. My 500mhz P3 computer with 256 megs of ram doesn't cut it. If you think that your old computer will do the job, think again. My computer has done nothing but crash and freeze day and night. This is very strange because I also have a radeon 8500 GPU, which should also have done the trick.Except for the toned down violence, the gameplay is pretty good. (This game also has relitively bad AI too). Most of the time, the blood helps you out, and you find out if you have hit the person or not. I found it annoying when I thought I would kill someone and they would just run right up to me and shoot me dead.I like the choice of weapons in the game. You have machine guns, a rocket launcher, rifles, SMG's, pistols, and some far out grenades.To sum it all up, this game is good, but with many downsides and the system requirements are too steep. Hope this helps! This should be a good game on high end computers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"drollere","summary":"addictive, colorful, humorous","reviewText":"i'm a mature gamer who bought a dozen or so games along with a new xbox just to see how the technology had evolved. (all the digital animation in recent films had piqued my interest.) having just opened grand theft auto 4 and assassin's creed, my first impression of this game was not favorable. but i've come to appreciate its unique and considerable charms. it is basically the urban sandbox, multi island, gansta life conceit of gta4, plus the rooftop play, \"assassination mission plus side missions\" concept of assassin's creed, but with a distinctively \"comix\" style of graphical design that is stylized to be less realistic, less textured, less graphically gory than either gta 4 or ac but more colorful, lively, and \"artistic\" than either. your avatar is not a thug but a maniacal police agent fighting evil and cleaning the streets, so you're not put in the position of looking at everything through gangster eyes, which is nice. however the most enjoyable innovation is a gruff voiceover guide who occasionally comments on your play (\"are you crazy?\" \"i sure love the smell of agent in the morning!\" \"you sure like to push your luck!\") along with gameplay and strategy tips; more than once his comments on my play made me laugh out loud. the avatar has physical and tactical skills that improve with use, notably the ability to leap and climb tall buildings if enough \"agility\" points are collected (these resemble the flags scattered around in assassin's creed) and the strength to lift and throw almost any detached object, from dead bodies to cement mixers, as weapons. but otherwise you have three options of play: roam the city to collect markers or perform racing stunts to improve agility; take on random firefights with street thugs to improve strength and skill, or kill off the senior members of three different crime gangs. these \"missions\" can be done in any order; each requires penetrating the gangster's lair after killing his almost endlessly spawning guards (though most do have a back entrance or rooftop way around defenders). this involves quite a lot of wearing down of the opposition, but each time you're killed and \"regenerate\", the enemy forces remain weakened, so you don't have to start the same exact mission, over and over, as happens in most games. the game physics are compelling, especially the explosions and flying objects, and the avatar has plenty of agility without cumbersome button combinations or programming limits. overall: a great game to look at, lots of fun to play, a very nice blend of humor and excitement, and no glitches in the xbox version that i could find.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2008"}

I can't compare this game to the PC version because I don't have it, but I understand that the PC version is much more difficult to control than the 360 version.First off, the graphics are absolutely amazing. I do not understand why some people are complaining about the backgrounds during missions.  They are realistic and do not appear static or repetitive to me at all.  I agree that the planets are sized incorrectly and the fact that you just bounce away from them instead of being able to approach them is somewhat annoying. However, it's a trade-off: you don't need to land on a planet, so it doesn't need to get bigger and bigger (and fill the screen) as you go through the atmosphere. If you were able to go through the atmosphere...then what would you expect to happen?  I think the designers approached this correctly, since the concept is \"space battle\".  However, an indication that you are too close to a planet and are about to be ejected would be nice too.The explosions are acceptable, if not stellar. I agree that enemy ships explode oddly, but it's realistic enough and it gets the point across. I'm just happy when I actually get to destroy a ship, because it's so hard to do so sometimes.  Which leads me to the controls...The controls for this game are seriously complex. Some of the buttons perform double-duty, and then there are combinations of buttons that perform specific duties. After first getting the game, I played at least 10-15 skirmish sessions just so I could get familiar with the game controls. You'll need the manual near you, turned to the page that describes the controller functions! The manual doesn't provide much detail about HOW to control certain things, you just need to stick with it and keep practicing. Yes, it can be frustrating at times.  However, as a positive, I'm certain having all the controls in your hand (in the form of the 360 controller) is much better than trying to manipulate everything using a combination of keyboard and mouse, and possibly a joystick/joypad if you were playing on a PC.Once you play several skirmishes, you won't be disappointed with the campaign.The campaign begins with a tutorial -- which is really important. It actually helped me identify some things that I was doing wrong in the skirmishes. The game camera will actually track an enemy once you target it, so you don't need to control the camera. Unfortunately, you'll eventually want control of the camera, and doing so breaks the lock. However, pressing the \"target\" button (RB) will allow the camera to track the enemy ship again.  Sometimes the camera angle isn't great -- for example, I need to be able to see the tractor beam when I lock it onto a ship, and sometimes the angle selected by the AI isn't perfect.Each ship moves differently. You will quickly identify your favorites, especially when playing a skirmish game. Some respond very quickly, while others are painfully slow. Surprisingly, the biggest aren't always the most powerful. My suggestion is to give up on your favorites from the shows (Voyager, Enterprise, etc.) and pick an odd ship -- you'll get better performance in most cases.  If you choose to battle as a Borg ship...good luck figuring out which side of a ship is \"forward\"...then again, do they have one?  However, there are many, many ships available, which adds to the difficulty and also to the replay value.The music is good, if somewhat repetitive -- music I would expect for something \"Trek\". Some of the soundtracks remind me of those from Star Trek II and III, while most of it sounds like Next Generation-type music.  The voice acting is great, but the cinematic sequences are slow -- ships in space, ships in dock, etc. I would have preferred animated renditions of each of the characters.The objectives for each mission are reviewable during play -- but not clearly defined up-front when the mission begins. It also lacks a mission progress indicator, so you can't tell how much further you need to go.  There's no manual save option either, so once you start a mission, you're pretty much committed to completing it or starting it over again. At the very least, I would expect it to save progress after each objective is met. However this depends on personal preference: I wouldn't want the system to save my progress if my ship was terribly damaged for example. Additionally, not everybody is trying to complete a game in 10-15 hours, and if I need to replay a mission several times, so be it.Regarding the Xbox 360 achievements for this game -- I was glad to earn 45 achievements with only a couple hours of play. However, the achievements for this game seem extremely complex, with some of them geared specifically toward online gaming.  The achievements, from my perspective, are not very \"rewarding\".Bottom line: this is a game for those who love Trek, and those who have a lot of patience!  It's a logic game, requiring you to make the right moves to reach the goal. The graphics are great. The sound is great. The controls are OK -- but they fit the Xbox 360 controller almost perfectly. I think it has a lot of replay value, especially if Xbox achievements are your thing.  It's a big game, much bigger than most have reported.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2007"}

Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game.

The opening section takes place on a Tanker being infiltrated by Solid Snake, who's on a mission to get evidence of a new Metal Gear. This acts as a 1-2 hour prologue to the main part of the game, which takes place on the \"Big Shell,\" a huge oil rig-looking structure with multiple connecting platforms and pathways. Despite the cover promptly displaying Snake's mug, what players got instead during this section was Raiden, a less gruff, less battle-weary, very \"green\" rookie soldier with distinct long white hair. I dug him. One of the things I like about Raiden is how he's introduced. At the beginning of the \"Big Shell\" mission you aren't sure who he is. Is he a clone of the Big Boss? Is he a re-imagining of Solid Snake? In proper \"MGS\" fashion, the answers only slowly reveal themselves all the way up until the closing credits. The big upgrades to gameplay over the previous game include a first-person perspective for aiming, along with useful maneuvers like hanging off the edges of structures to avoid detection, etc. There's also a fun dog tag collecting sub game where you can hold up/threaten enemies into dropping their tags that then unlock items if you collect enough. This game hinges on its story, and it's mostly thrilling all the way through, despite an ending that goes a bit off the rails. \"Sons of Liberty\" doesn't reach the greatness of the first game.

What doesn't appeal to me offline is how much this game is like every other recon game on the market. In fact, I'm surprised Ghost: Recon hasn't filed a lawsuit on Socom. Everything is that same except the logos and the button configs.You take your missions as the come and increase in rank as you beat them. It does sort of push you to do better on a mission when you get graded after you complete it, but other than that it's all the same thing to me. I start in the insertion zone. I follow the games stealth advice and take my freaking time getting to each objective. I get tired of stealth, then get spotted or shot at. Then I just rush the level and get a D. How old does this get? Very, very old.Online. Online is hell. I mean, don't get me wrong. Running all over huge maps with dozens of types of terrain and strategizing on the fly is fun. However, it will take you such a long time to get good at this since noone can just guide you through it or remain a true ally. I was so frustrated when these two Dave Chappelle-obsessed players on my team kept gunning everyone in our team down first, then proceeded to go after the other team. This and other cases of fooling around and treason left me to wonder how much fun I was supposed to be having. So, for the first time, I blame every single person online for ruining my game experience, rather than the actual game. It's just atrocious and it makes me think that everyone who gave this game 5 stars was just one of those noob-hunting jerks. I'm seriously that offended.The game mechanics are confusing sometimes, especially when you have to choose your button configurations, and the graphics are pitiful. it's a step down from smooth rendering, flat plants, and just ugly model skins.I really don't mean to sound like a jerk, but I just feel like I was completely cheated and pushed around.

{"product_name":"B00005UNWB","description":"The publishers ofGrand Theft Auto IIIare back with another game  geared towards a mature audience. But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way. Parents should note that this  game carries a Mature rating for its blood, violence, and gore.--Raymond M.

If video games are supposed to be fun, then SR3 delivers fun throughout.  SR3 has personality and far more personality than any other game.One of the things that makes SR3 great is the character customization.+You can customize the sex and ethnicity (including their voice/voice actor or actress) and everything about them.You can customize their skin, hair, body, and an exorbitant amount of clothing, outfits, sexy clothing, tattoos and even go nude (with private parts blurred out). You can change your clothing or lack of clothing at any point in the game at one of the various clothing shops or gang houses.  You can even change your entire body at one of the plastic surgeons office.  You definitely aren't stuck with a one size fits all character as you are with most other games.  You can even take and upload pictures or your character during game play to your TQM account (enable your camera in the cell phone).  You also get a wide arrange of vehicles and customizations and upgrades for your vehicles as well.+SR3 is the best and funnest open world games there is.  You access missions, side missions, vehicle thefts and assassinations in your cell phone (as well as enabling upgrades for you and your gang).  You are the leader of the Saints and you are battling against three other gangs for control of the city, in addition to the cops, and the paramilitary unit called STAG (Special Tactical Anti-Gang unit). There is a wide variety of side missions and you can replay the side activities as many times as you want.  Even though you've beaten a side mission before, for example a snatch mission or trafficking mission, the next time you play the mission, it will be different.+There are about four or five times during the game where you get to make decisions that will affect the rest of the game.  At the end of the game, you will have the decision to go one way of the other way.  When you beat the game, SR3 will take you back in time so you can play the other ending as well as play any and all other side missions and activities (SR3 will take you back in time after the credits finish rolling,OR by pressing the A button to bypass the credits).+You have a wide variety of weapons and upgrades for your weapons.+The Penetrator  is a comical and unique melee weapon.+Fart In A Jar is a classy upgrade.  It's the last upgrade for your flashbang grenade.+The Penetrator melee weapon is funny, especially if you have a female character.+Professor Genki is funny and comical relief.+You can do hostage diversions (hijacking a car with a passanger), streaking and holding up stores like in Saints Row 2.+The Morning Star gang is beautiful.+You can customize the soundtrack being played when driving or flying in vehicles.  You can create your own custom mix tape and select the songs you want from available radio stations. You can then select that the mix tape is the only \"radio\" station to be played by muting the other stations.SR3 is fun throughout, it has personality, it light-hearted and fun.  It doesn't have the bodremn, drudgery and tedium that you find in games like Skyrim, Grand Theft Auto IV, Red Dead Redemption and many other open world games.Game Notes: during the Snatch side missions, the people you are rescuing might need to be whistled at a few times before they get in the car. You need to kill the person holding them hostage (the enemy with the red circle over their head), at the very least, and the car need to be close to them and there will be plenty of other enemies who will show up immediately.  The people you're rescuing don't seem to a great sense of urgency to get the hell out of Dodge when with all the combat going on.  You'll need to have the vehicle close and whistle a 2 or 3 times sometimes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}

It has just become so repetitive that I'm bored out of my mind. Boxing it up to trade in to amazon as I write this review. I enjoyed the first act, but after that I was just not even sure what the overall objective was in the game...You drive to one spot... kill zombies... find new weapons, and maybe a new person. Drive to next spot... passanger dies because you sent them out with a weapon that they're not good with to collect gas, food, or ammo, and this just seems to be an on going thing. It's not really fun at all.I was also able to try out the herd mode because I ordered from gamestop. It's just like COD zombies without the bells and whistles. No power-ups or anything of that sort, which I kinda like... you start out in one zone, and after every few waves a new area opens up. The biggest shock about this for me was that it's only single player, the draw for COD zombies is getting your friends together to play. I also found a spot where I could hide where zombies couldn't touch me, I made it to wave 33 like this, and only died because I decided I didn't feel like playing anymore. I pretty much could have went on forever like this...So this mode is flawed, and I doubt it will ever get patched.Overall the game is just incomplete, and a letdown. I hate to admit it, but like everyone said... It's just another quick cash-in by activision.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Corey Turner \"The Musician\"","summary":"Can We Try Something, Well New?","reviewText":"Ah yes the most anticipated game for quite some time,  the legendary Halo 3.Halo 3 continues the tales of Master Chief after the anti climactic ending in Halo 2. The game takes a leap into the next generation of gaming consoles (Xbox 360 title only).With such a large leap we've seen many game series really take off into a whole new experience, Such as the Call of Duty series still grabbing appeal for its step up. Halo 3 really didn't advance too much from Halo 2's game play mechanics, or stray too much from its online multiplayer which truly isn't a bad thing (modifications make it much easier online but not much better).The story isn't so much deep as it is captivating how's that? The game throws you into amazing looking battle fields screaming for intense action, yet you battle it much like a small fire fight. With The technology of the 360 you'd think the game would serve up to its supposed \"epic factor\". To a small degree it did, but it treaded so much old ground that after the first run through the Campaign mode it feels stale. On the bright note levels have variety in them and some great cinematic sequences.The game does hold up to it's well known great in game soundtrack. The music is very plausible, and balances techno/electronic and ambient beats with rockish music from all degrees both smooth and rough. The classical orchestrated parts are truly noteworthy too. Makes for a much greater gamming experience, and proves to pump you up when the battle doesn't. Much of the classic Halo tunes have now been remodified, and being a musician myself trying to rewrite something that's hailed amazing and still keep it fresh and great isn't as easy as throwing on some new instruments and calling it genius.The game holds a lot of its emphasis in the online/multiplayer department. Online matches are competitive, enticing and generally great experiences with friends or random players. With a variety of new weapons and tactics and new 'equipment' at your disposal fragging another player has never been so satisfying. Now the multiplayer maps aren't necessarily bad, but any Halo 2 veteran will feel disappointed at the lack of creativity and devotion. Recently (as of December) three new maps have been released as Downloadable Content or DLC. This will hopefully hold fans off to the next batch of announced maps.The quality of the game is superb. Graphically it lacks as a contender against many recent graphical achievements in gaming, but the lighting effects are phenomenal. The sound as i previously mentioned top notch, the controls silky smooth, the welcoming additions,such as 4 player co-op instead of the traditional 2 player, equipment, weapons, forge create a level option, film a clip, save a photo, all great stuff.Halo only suffers from not living up to its hype. Which is fairly hard when you think about the commercials, the Discovery channel coverage, gamming article, news stations even mentioning it, ambitious countdowns, myriads of fans new and old preordering the title, the products like Mountain Dews \"Game Fuel\" being released as a marketing aid for the game. So many things made this seem like the most important game in history as if it wasn't even a game at this point, just a stir of anticipation. So while it didn't live up to this (Which i doubt anything really could) it does serve as a exceptional 360 title, and a great game to play with a group of friends.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2008"}

What makes Tekken different from other fighting games are the moves, smooth animations and the cinematic movies for each character that is used to beat the game (you also get a new fighter when you beat the game), however that becomes the point of the game, seeing these movies. Each movie unravels part of a mystery (as to why your even playing the game).

In fact if you rated this above 2, you are lying to yourself. I understand and I do believe that everybody is entitled to their own opinions, but with Duke Nukem Forever, it's painstakingly obvious on what I mean. The game is awful. And yes, I'm reviewing this for the PC version, but it's still awful. I can only have assumption that the console versions are probably the same awful level as I played and watched on the PC. This 12 year doomed to fail comatose patient should have had the plug pulled on it.I was starting to get a little excited when it became near for release time for this game. Sure some of the visuals and animations did look outdated, but I was ready to try out Duke Nukem once again when I was waiting for my demo off of Steam. I watched other videos about it and laughed with glee thinking that good 'ol Duke was making a hilarious and action packed comeback. Then came the week of release and Steam users got the demo...The beginning was hilarious, I'll give it that. For some reason I was having fun playing around the first area that is available. Clicking on random things and interacting in the bathroom and locker room was different in a sense I was giggling like a dumb 13 year old. Then you actually get to play the FPS part. After I finished the demo, I looked at my friend and said: \"we waited 12 years for a piece of crap Halo rip off?\" Immediately I deleted it off my hardrive. Then I watched and read various reviews. Kotaku, PC Gamer, Game Informer, EGM, ign.com, etc. did not have anything great to say about it either.Okay, I will point out the immediate distaste for this game. I expected to play Duke Nukem and not some Call of Duty or Halo rip off. The worse part is, Duke makes fun of the use of power armor. You walk up to vehicle that contains a very Master Chief looking power armor, then he makes the comment: \"power armor is for pussies.\" You have an \"ego meter\" that works just like Master Chief's shield bar from Halo 2. You can do or collect various random things in the game to increase the ego meter. However, almost anything you do collect for it barely raises it. Pretty much making the collecting mini game pointless. And the worst part, he can only carry two weapons like Master Chief and many many MANY other FPS games. Pretty much, the game developers, and Duke himself, just made fun of themselves. They just made fun and copied the EXACT things many other FPS titles do. And like every other FPS that tries to incorporate an obligatory driving section, and it handles awfully and does the yet obligatory, get out, do something, drive, then get out again over and over. There will be many times where the game doesn't tell you what you have to do to get past an area where enemies spawn for a certain amount. For example, drop ship fights with a rocket launcher only able to hold 5 rockets making you run to the ammo crate over and over and over.... The wise cracks from Duke are funny, but also not that funny. I mean it's nice they got the original voice actor back for this. It simply wouldn't be Duke without Jon St. John. However hearing him grunt every time Duke jumps is just stupid.All you get in this game is a 12 year old game that would have been good, well, 12 years ago. What you get is a carbon copy of games you already played with, with just Duke Nukem voicing it. This game is not worth the price when it was release and is still not worth it now. If the price is above a $5 sale off of Steam or in a Walmart bargain bin then it's still not worth the headache. This game would have been better if it was a downloadble only from PSN, Steam, or XBLA, NOT AS A FULL RETAIL GAME.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000930DOQ","description":"James Bond 007 : From Russia With Love will be the first game to put players in the universe of the classic James Bond films. Set in the original 60's Bond era, the game features movie-based missions as well as original, action-intensive sequences, a broad and deep variety of gameplay, fully-integrated vehicles, social multiplayer experiences, gorgeous women, and classic, upgradeable weapons and gadgetry with modern mechanics.","reviewerName":"N. P. Stathoulopoulos \"nick9155\"","summary":"Fun, welcome angle on EA Bond series","reviewText":"The 007 gaming crowd is a tough one to please.  It took EA a few stabs to please most fans, and they did so finely with Everything Or Nothing in 2004, still an excellent overall game.  Then came the disappointing Rogue Agent, which was like a stopgap while they developed a new game (and perhaps waited to see whom EON Productions chose to be the new filmic Bond).Now comes a game similar to EON, but with a new twist.  This time it's based on the classic Bond movie (same title), expanded with more story, and featuring the original 007, Sean Connery.  Being a good sport, Connery has lent his voice and likeness to the game, and while it's older, thicker, and more Scottish than ever (his voice, not his likeness) it's still the same actor, a move generally preferred by fans.The overall look and feel of FRWL is very similar to EON, but with some differences.  Bond looks great---a full walking, fighting, shooting Sean Connery.  However, I agree with others who note that Bond does not run, and the shooting has changed a bit to favor a more jerky target system that gives you more points for hitting specific places on the body.The game is too easy at first play.  The EA Bond games have not been particularly difficult, but this time you really need to play on 00 Agent level (highest) to get a challenge.  Otherwise, there are too many moments when bursting into a room with guns blazing will succeed.  There are also far more power-ups (armor and ammo) on the boards.  Since they bothered to include stealth movements and the incentive to do things quietly (points, etc), it's worth the challenge.  The controls for inventory and gadgets are different and not as good as EON in terms of changing on the fly.  There is no `Bond Mode', as in EON, where you could freeze time to analyze a situation for targets.  It has been replaced by a manual aiming feature that you can toggle on and off when you feel like. Moreover, yes, the game is linear, but what EA shooter is not, ultimately?  The environments look great, lots of detail---I just wish you could do more with it (open doors, blow things up, etc).  Why do some games heavily favor interaction and give so much incentive to explore boards, while others lay out exactly what you need to do and make it too easy?  Rewards for curiosity and exploration are always a good thing.The guns are good, some weaker than the previous Bond entry, others improved.  This is an interesting concept---a new engine similar to EON, with a classic, throwback setting to the game.  It's not totally clear when the game is set---the 60s, today---but it doesn't really matter.  No matter the era, Bond always has Q-Copter gadget-thingees and laser beam watches, great suits and a ridiculous car.  Also included is that awesome jetpack from the movie, lots of fun.  (No Q-Toupee, however).  The overall third-person movement and behavior will be familiar for folks who played EON and the more recent Godfather game.Finally, they've made death match available again.  (EON featured a 2P cooperative mode with unique boards).  It's also a third-player death match, something new to the series. Personally, I found Nightfire to have a solid death match, mainly because it had one of the best all-time death match weapons---the remote controlled video-screen rocket launcher that they need to bring back.Overall, yes, you can nitpick all day.  EON was better in some ways; FRWL is unique and even better in other ways.  Suffice to say, if you liked EON, this is highly recommended.  Especially now that it's so cheap, you won't have much to lose.  As usual, there is incentive to replay boards after you've finish the story missions (and there are quite a few) in order to unlock certain features.  It's another good Bond game; presumably, Daniel Craig will be appearing in the next outing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2006"}

Frye","summary":"An astounding, dynamic spy plot is backed up by respectable gameplay mechanics.","reviewText":"Sometimes, critics suprise me. While most of the time they help me choose products with reliable reviews, sometimes they disappoint me. This is the case with Alpha Protocol, a game that was praised for its RPG elements, but criticized for its weak shooting and sneaking mechanics. After buying it, I completely disagree. Alpha Protocol is one of the most underrated games of all time.The story is an ambitious one. It features an astoundingly dynamic plot that changes depending on the choices that you make. While other games have tried to do this, no game has done it as good as Alpha Protocol. These choices are timed, meaning you don't have an unlimited amount of time to think about what to do. You have to think fast. The spy theme would have been interesting alone, but these timed choices making makes it all the more awesome.For instance, early in the game, I went on a mission to intercept a weapons dealer suspected of selling weapons in the middle-east. I sneaked through the camp, and caught him. This is where the choice making began. I engaged in conversation with the man. I maintained a professional approach to the conversation. Then, as I was confronted with the next timed choice, there was an \"Execute\" option. I ended up sparing him.This brought up the question - what would have happened if I had killed him? Would he have a private army come to me to avenge his death? How would my superiors react? What would the consequences be?It's moments like these that make Alpha Protocol special. The intracies demand multiple playthroughs of the game, and I always wanted to play more to see how the game would play out if I chose a different approach.Beyond the fantastic story, the gameplay is strictly RPG. Don't expect an Uncharted-like adventure that focuses on shooting. This is a game that sticks closely to the RPG rules. That being said, the game is fantastic when it comes to basic gameplay. There are three elements of gameplay - shooting, stealth, and minigames. Each one is handled well, and are polished enough that it can compete with other shooters in the genre.Shooting probably got the most criticizing from the critics. They claimed that when you have your aiming reticule right upon the enemy's head, that doesn't mean that you will hit him. They also stated that pistols were completely inaccurate. This is where the critics messed up. I played through the game as a stealth agent, specializing in pistols. I upgraded my pistol stats at every oppertunity. I experienced no problems in my accuracy after I upgraded that tree enough.This re-introduces the fact that this game is an RPG. Don't expect to excel in pistols if you haven't applied a single upgrade to that tree. You must choose the weapons that you have upgraded your skills for.Anyways - back to shooting mechanics. The game features a standard third-person cover-shooting mechanics, similar to Uncharted or Gears of War. You can peer out of cover to shoot bad guys with a variety of weapons. The cover system is easy to use, and I have no issues with it. Overall, the shooting is pretty solid overall. As long as you can keep in mind that it is an RPG, you can easily enjoy the shooting.Same goes for stealth - your skills and upgrades in stealth will determine if you can excel in it. The skills that you unlock as you progress in stealth are more than worth the investment, and lead to you becoming the ultimate stealth warrior. My only complaint is that stealth can feel a bit basic at times. Don't expect anything too advanced, like shadows and camo. Alpha Protocol is basically about hiding behind a box, waiting for the guy to come around near you, then kill him. Stealth definitely gets more deep as you progress, but I still feel it could be a bit more deep.As for minigames, they  are incredibly easy to pick up, and I encountered no problems. There are three minigames - lockpicking, computer hacking, and alarm bypassing. Lockpicking is easy - you apply force to the pin using L2, and set the pin using R2. Computer hacking is the hardest - you must find specific combinations of letters and numbers in a data stream. May be hard to new players, but it gets easier the more you do it. Finally, alarm bypassing is also easy. It is the most fun of the minigames, and easy for new players to pick up.Overall, Alpha Protocol's RPG influenced gameplay is fantastic. Upgrading your skills is addictive, and the shooting and stealth are respectable, and a blast to play through.As for the graphics, Alpha Prtotocol is also great. Character models look fantastic, and the cutscenes look incredible. Environments look awesome, with detailed textures. However, the animations can range from good to slightly exaggerated. The best example of this is the running animation, which looks unintentionally stupid. Also, there is a lot of texture pop-in, especially when looking through menus. It takes about a second for the texture to pop-up seemingly EVERY TIME you want to view a different item. However, these flaws do little to detract from the beauty of the game. Alpha Protocol still looks great, even if it won't be going up against Uncharted anytime soon.Audio is also fantastic, with some incredible voice acting and script. The great voice acting makes the characters in the story feel more than just cardboard cutouts. The sound effects for the guns aren't anything special, but the music is fantastic, and adds to the super-spy theme - you'll feel like you're in a James Bond film.The lasting appeal of the game is phenomonal. The game is incredibly lengthy (up to 15 hours), and the decision making adds incredible value to an already deep game. I'm constantly wanting to go back and see how a different approach to the game affects the game. There is no online play, but a game as good and deep as this one doesn't need it.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Here is the review summary. It is rated on an out of ten scale.Story: 10Everything about the story reminds me of a spy film. The decision making means that each playthrough has potential to be completely different.Graphics: 8.5While the animations can be exaggerated and the pop-in is abundant, the cutscenes look fantastic and the character models look great.Audio: 10The game features an incredibly musical score, and the voice action is believable, and undeniably delivers.Gameplay: 9.5While the strictly RPG gameplay may turn off hardcore shooter fans, it will definitely appeal to the RPG fans. Polished shooting, awesome stealth, cool minigames, and an in-depth leveling mechanic - what's not to love?Lasting Appeal: 9.5While the game won't last forever, it definitely has some fantastic replay value. The impressive decision making ensures that you'll be playing Alpha Protocol for some time.Overall Score: 9.5 out of 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2011"}

Graphic engine.  It still looks great, don't get me wrong.  But when DICE updates their own engine (Frostbite 2) to make lighting and texture improvements look slick, Infinity Ward (or what's left of them after the Kotick debacle) fails to update anything significant.2.  Story.  The single player's story is wrapped up but, again, it's short.3.  Multiplayer.  My biggest gripe.  I recently played with 3 people LOCALLY on a 4-player split screen Death Match.  It looked blurry.  I'm almost ashamed to say that Black Ops actually looked a little sharper.  That's a major OUCH for me to say.  The whole \"kill confirmed\" mode, while a novelty aimed at reducing campers, is not that much more significant than, say, blades of grass in EA's Madden 12.  It's kind of an \"oooo\" for a few seconds, then I'm looking for the other novelties...and they're not there.I won't dwell on the complaints too much.  Others have done a remarkable job covering that here.  Is it a 1-star game?  No, although this game has polarized its audience unlike COD titles before.  It's 2.5 stars at best, and future releases have a long way to go to earn my trust again.  I paid under forty dollars for it, and I'm 100% glad that I didn't pay full price.  At a full price, this title would have been a travesty.Bobby Kotick is falling into the same routine again of relying on the coat-tails of previous good work to carry his cash cow forward.  The same thing was evidenced in the swan song of the Guitar Hero franchise, which Kotick had the audacity to blame DJ Hero for.  Yeah, DJ Hero killed Guitar Hero...it had nothing to do with the 3-4 releases of Guitar Hero each year.That said, COD has grown into such a monster that Kotich is unlikely to see past the black accounting values to realize that he will ultimately make a fatal error...again.  Why no one deposes this clown in his own company is beyond me.It's sad since I loved COD MW 1 & 2 immensely.  While COD MW3 provided a cathartic ending, it seems like a death rattle to me.  Infinity Ward is not the name of quality that I once knew.  Here's to hoping that they have the tenacity and legal capability of orphaning themselves from Activision...at least one can hope.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2011"}

That is what really drove me through this game.  The game play is good and there are lots of side quests to find, but the main quest is what is really awesome. Some people and critics have slammed this game for various game play reasons, but honestly it was easy to overlook the shortcomings and enjoy it. It's the first game I have played in awhile that has made it worth doing the new game plus. The 2nd play through offers a lot of content that allows you to see the events from a fresh point of view. By the way, this is not an action game so if you want awesome action go buy something else. The pacing is deliberately slow and really fits with the storyline.If you have not played this game your parents will be very disappointed in you, so play the game and make your parents proud that they have raised someone with good gaming taste.Story A+Music A+Creepy children A+Game play B+Graphics BOverall ATalking books A++Fighting in lingerie A+++","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2011"}

There is a portion of the game where you are running through buildings and along rooftops while a chopper is shooting at you, and the graphics and camera work in this game are so great it just feels like your part of a movie. I have been playing video games for over 20 years and have never seen anything like this before.This game has everything puzzle's, action, stealth, and platforming. The game does all of these things amazingly. I really cant say enough about this game. The story and voice acting are top notch.The single player campaign would by itself justify a purchase but this game also comes with a ridiculously deep multiplayer as well. My favorite is the objective Co-Op you basically play through levels of the game with 2 other people and it is so much fun. Team Deathmatch is pretty standard and I suck at it so far, but getting better. There is also another Co-Op mode where you battle groups of AI  bad guys sort of like Zombie mode in Call of Duty 5. Another mode is I think called elimination mode where if you get killed you have to sit out the rest of the round and hope your team can pull through without you. I don't really like the mode but it is a very nice change of pace you have to be careful and can't just charge around looking for people. I think it will be fun but it is such a different way to play a multiplayer shooter.This game is absolutely amazing. As I said before if you have a PS3 go out and buy this game right away!See Ya OnlinePSN: TWO1FIVE","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2009"}
{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"J. DEATS","summary":"The Wii in review from a 30 something adult","reviewText":"MY EXPERIENCEConsole is super easy to use, just piug it in and follow the on-screen instruction. You don't even have to read the manuals. Using the special controller is natural and takes only a few minutes to figure out.Here are some important tips:* The Wii Sports pack in allows you to play multiple players off a single remote on Golf and Bowling. For Tennis and Baseball you will need at least two Wii remotes to play multiplayer. Boxing is the only Wii Sports game that requires the add-on numchuck controller so if you can't find an extra numchuck don't let it ruin your day.* The Wii classic controller is a waste of money. The classic controller seves only one purpose, to work with the virtual console. The virtual console is part of the Wii on-line experiencing where you can pay to purchase classic games like Mario 64, Donkey Kong, Sonic, Bonk, etc... You can not use the classic controller with Gamecube games, however you can use a Gamecube controller in place of the classic controller, so instead of paying all that money for a classic Wii controller, just buy a few Gamecube controllers!* The Wii store is not very developed yet. The Opera web browser is not available yet (it's early Dec) and there are only a couple dozen classic gamnes to pick from at this point to use \"Wii Points\" to buy.TIPS AND BUYINGTARGET, BEST BUY, TOYS R US and CIRCUIT CITY. These retailers accepted Nintendo's charter and sticking to the plan, they are holding Wii systems when they arrive and then making them available to customers at an \"available upon request\" available date. Walmart has signs posted in their bigger stores advertising an available date for their next shipment.All retailers are also helping out their staff, making units available to employees. So if you want one, find out when new stock is arriving and be willing to wait in line. If you can't use EBay and pay out a few extra hundred for someone else's time waiting in line. If that's a problem then accept that you won't get one. Retailers aren't putting them out when stock arrives, so you can't just mozzy into a TARGET after work and expect to maybe find one, by holding the stock back retailers and preventing this from happening.* The controllers are also hard to find, but retailers are putting them out when they arrive. Often time systems arrive with the controllers, I've  noticed a trend, where there are controllers on the shelf often there are Wiis in the back being held for a specific self date. Don't try to haggle for one though, the best you can hope for is to get a date they will make them available for sale.WILL HISTORY REPEAT (PS3 to go the way of the 7800 and Neo Geo?)When Nintendo introduced the NES back in 1985 the video game industry was a bit like today. Atari was suffering because they had gotten into a rut of producing the same type of games over and over again (sound familiar Playstation fans?), in their quest to build a better game console Atari engineered the 2600's replacement, the 7800. It would have awesome graphics, it would target the high end of the market and it would cost a lot. But the 7800 was almost dead on arrival, In the early 80's game market gone stale, Nintendo released the NES, with it's packed in laser light gun and optional robot bundle, it was part gimmick, part innovation,  but unquestionably it was 100% fun.Fast forward twenty years later. Nintendo's lost their dominance, now we have professional gamers and owning the latest console is like having the latest designer sports shoes, it's a cultural thing.But just like the 80's, gamers are starting to wonder what's next. 3D graphics are now on their third (or fourth) generation, we're nearing photo realistic real-time quality. Gamers want something more than a high price tag and flashy graphics. If you would have pulled someone aside in 1984 and told them Atari is going to get their but kicked and their next system is going to flop you would be laughed at. Sony Playstation fans may do the same thing now, but what Nintendo has done with the Wii is amazing. They have turned the clock back and returned the fun to gaming, they've given us something new yet retro enough to be hip at the same time.Forget the N64 and the Gamecube, let's move back to the dominate days of the SNES, Wii isn't embarssing in the slightest, it remains Nintendo cute, but is carefully designed to be modern. In an age when professional gamers stick to suped up PCs and the consoles are getting old, Nintendo has stepped and as made the console new again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000P46NMK","description":"Assassin?s Creedis the next-gen game developed by Ubisoft Montreal that will redefine the action genre. While other games claim to be next-gen with impressive graphics and physics,Assassin?s Creedmerges technology, game design, theme, and emotions into a world where you instigate chaos and become a vulnerable, yet powerful, agent of change.The setting is 1191 AD. The Third Crusade is tearing the Holy Land apart. You, Altair, intend to stop the hostilities by suppressing both sides of the conflict.You are an Assassin, a warrior shrouded in secrecy and feared for your ruthlessness. Your actions can throw your immediate environment into chaos, and your existence will shape events during this pivotal moment in history.Key FeaturesBe an Assassin: Master the skills, tactics, and weapons of history?s deadliest and most secretive clan of warriors. Plan your attacks, strike without mercy, and fight your way to escape.Realistic and responsive environments: Crowds react to your moves and will either help or hinder you on your quests.Action with a new dimension - total freedom: Eliminate your targets wherever, whenever, and however.

Do whatever it takes to achieve your objectives.Relive the epic times of the Crusades:Assassin?s Creedimmerses you in the realistic and historical Holy Land of the 12th century, featuring life-like graphics, ambience, and the subtle, yet detailed nuances of a living world.Intense action rooted in reality: Experience heavy action blended with fluid and precise animations. Use a wide range of medieval weapons, and face your enemies in realistic swordfight duels.Next-gen gameplay: The proprietary engine developed from the ground up for the next-gen console allows organic game design featuring open gameplay, intuitive control scheme, realistic interaction with environment, and a fluid, yet sharp, combat mechanic.","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A truly great game, with just a few minor issues","reviewText":"Assassin's Creed is best described as a sandbox Splinter Cell set in the Third Crusade. The majority of the game involves sneaking around, carrying out investigations that ultimately lead you to a target that you must assassinate. The game is based in reality (conspiracy theories nonwithstanding): the targets are all based on historical figures, the scenery is right out of 1191 (and is the real star of the game, if you ask me), the weaponry is accurately portrayed, and there are no magic spells available to the player.In the game you take control of two characters: Desmond, a modern-day American, and Altair, an elite Holy Land assassin during the Crusades. The two are linked through a unique but pleasingly plausible plot device that I will not give away here. The majority of the game is from Altair's point of view.The game looks absolutely beautiful. By far my favorite moments of the game were climbing tall towers to overlook the city (a secondary objective in the game) and seeing Jerusalem or Damascus in all its splendor below me. The character models are just as good, and retain their good looks in combat as well.Combat is fairly intuitive. Players eventually gain access to four weapons, which along with their fists are mapped to the D-pad (throwing knives and the short sword are both mapped to the left d-pad, and which is used is determined by how far away the target is). The left trigger targets, the right blocks (and, in combination with X, counters), X attacks, A steps and B grabs.Combat is, unfortunately, also where almost all my gripes with the game happen. Landing a combo, counter, or mid-combat assassination will usually switch the camera to a cinematic view (during which you won't be attacked) but will keep that angle when the animation ends, which can occasionally put the camera behind a tree and block your view, leading to an early death. Switching targets can be a hassle, especially when dealing with more than three opponents simultaneously, which as the game progresses becomes the norm. Switching out of combat mode to run away is sometimes a pain too.The stealth mechanic in the game works well. People (guards included) will react based on the severity of what you do. Once discovered, players can run away, and once they break line of sight can hide in a number of fashions (like jumping into a bale of hay or blending in with a group of monks dressed similar to Altair), and after a predetermined amount of time the guards will give up pursuit and Altair can continue as normal.Leading up to the actual assassination, players have to perform two or three investigations, which involve pickpocketing, eavesdropping, interrogating or finding a fellow assassin who acts as an informant (and will give you info in exchange for taking out their assassination targets or retrieving a series of flags within a given time limit).The secondary objectives in the game are repetitive (save citizens and climb viewpoints) but are useful; viewpoints reveal the map and other objectives, and saving citizens gives you either a group of scholars (a handy hiding spot) or vigilantes (thugs that will defend you from pursuing guards), both of which come in handy after assassinations, since the whole city is on the lookout for you.There is only one difficulty setting, which actually works pretty well in this game. The save feature is strictly checkpoints and autosaves, which can be frustrating. Death will take you back to the last checkpoint (not so bad), but quitting the game will take you way back sometimes, and always takes you back to the regional headquarters, which leads to a lot of traveling back to get to where you were.As for gamerscore, there is 1000G spread over 44 achievements. All the \"secret\" achievements are plot-driven unlockables, and all are single-player achievable (there is no multiplayer here, and in fact no downloadable content other than themes and pictures). You will probably get 800 of those points just from playing through the entire game (about 20-40 hours of playtime, depending on your speed), and the rest are for collecting flags and eliminating Templar Knights, both of which are scattered througout all areas of the game. If you are looking for a pad to your gamerscore, this is a good choice.A few minor things aside, Assassin's Creed is a must-have title for the 360. It looks and plays beautifully, but since there is no DLC, multiplayer or difficulty settings the replay value is a little less than some other titles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2009"}

Gearbox has delivered on nearly every front possible with Borderlands. gameplay is extremely polished, a blast to play with controls similar to Call of Duty and near perfect hit detection for bullets/melee.comparisons to Fallout 3 are inevitable given the RPG/FPS fusion in a post apocalyptic setting, but both excel in their own areas. where fallout delivers a deep RPG experience in a massive, fully explorable wasteland with some questionable gunplay - Borderlands is more shooter focused, with 4 player co op and more polish on the FPS gamplay with mild character progression/exploration. not to mention hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of guns for your arsenal. everything from damage level/rate of fire/recoil/clip size/reload speed to elemental add-ons including fire/explosive/acid/electricity/ect varies between guns. youre almost constantly finding new gear thanks to the revolutionary random content generation system based on your level.when starting a new game you must choose 1 of 4 characters. a fast, stealthy female character - the extremely accurate sniper (deadly at long range) - the well rounded soldier character - and the tank, a beast in almost any combat situation. each character has their own advantages in battle, and a unique special attack. specials vary between a shielded turret, invisibility, an attack hawk, and berserk mode. the unique feeling of each character adds tons of replay value to an already lengthy game.the campaign plays out similar to an open world rpg, tavelling from place to place, picking up new quests and loot along the way.the cell shading graphics offer a unique flare not often seen in games, especially shooters. it may not have the detail of a game like Gears of War, but its got its own unigue style that looks great considering the size of the game and th amount of content.vehicle controls are very similar to those of halo 3, which can be a good thing or a bad thing depending on your taste.dont get me wrong, i still hold Fallout as the best game of 2008, but if you liked the ideas behind Fallout 3 and were pushed away by the questionable gunplay or the depth of RPG character progression, Borderlands may just be the game for you. its a more accessable, more polished rethinking of the RPG/FPS fusion.9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2009"}

After completing the game, I still give it 5 stars. That doesn't mean the game is perfect, just that compared to other games, it rates 5 out of 5.1) It is challenging without being frustrating. In comparison: Bioshock and Fallout 3 are both so easy (even on the hardest level) that you can play the entire games without ever dying. Halo 3 has (for me) areas which are so difficult to get past that they are more frustrating than fun. GTA4 is challenging on about the same level as Borderlands, but GTA4 makes you restart an entire mission from scratch when you die, which is frustrating and a bore. So Borderlands gets this just right.2) Autosave: I prefer to be able to save and restart from wherever I want, but short of this, Borderland's autosave works very well.3) Game controls are terrific. It is easy to aim and hit someone (usually) without having some kind of auto-lockon feature that does it for you (except the cannon when driving, and that is optional with a button press). Despite complaints on here about the vehicles, I found them at least as easy to control as those in GTA4. The only weak point is that I found holding down the left joystick to run was a pain.4) Variety of weapons keeps things interesting. I don't understand reviewers here who say that the weapons are basically all the same. You MUST keep getting more powerful weapons to survive against more powerful foes. And it isn't just that weapons are more powerful, but that they have new features, such as electrifying foes, dousing them with acid or fire, causing explosions, etc. Some of these work against certain foes and not as well against others, so carrying more than one sniper rifle, for example, pays off. I carried four different grenade mods throughout the game. The final battle requires very unique weapons to win; if you go in with just a basic machine gun (or with ANY machine gun, since you will run out of ammo), you will never win. Then there is Bloodwing, the attack bird... In comparison, in Fallout 3 (which I single out because it is so popular and a Game Of The Year), once you get the A1 plasma rifle and the Alien Blaster, you are pretty much set for the game.5) Wide variety of foes. Humanoids range from snipers and machine gun turret operators who shoot from a distance to midgets and one-armed psychopaths who run right up to you (and are hard to kill), and everything in between, which is another reason I found myself constantly changing weapons. They will also be using all kinds of weapons against you to keep you on your toes.Bug-oids for most of the game are not as challenging, especially since they are always out in open areas where if you are in a vehicle, you can blast them with unlimited cannon ammo, or you can just run over them for a quick kill. Some bugs are airborne, but still not a huge challenge.Isolated battles against giant mutant monsters are pretty good. You WILL die. More than once. The last big bug you run into is particularly challenging.6) Interesting Health/Shield options. You can use up your limited inventory space to carry health kits, but about level 15, I quit carrying them and didn't start again until about level 30.Other sources of health are pick-up health shots, Transfusion Grenades, the option to get health when Bloodwing attacks a foe, and shields which also slowly increase drained health, and when you do run out of health, you get some back if you kill a foe in the next 30 seconds or so, which is usually not that hard to do. Also, each time you level up, you are restored to full health/shields. I carried two shields: one with very high protection, and one with half the protection, but health regeneration.7) I've read complaints about a weak story line. I've never found the story lines of ANY video games to be all that compelling. Even in the hugely popular Fallout 3, the main story line is just a very small element of the game.Cons:1) Too much ammo, generally speaking. When you come across case after case of ammo and can't pick up any of it because you're already maxed out, it just isn't as much fun. Bioshock has the same flaw, but Borderlands is worse. Fallout 3 lets you pick it all up for resale later, but in F3, you eventually end up with more than any vendor has money to buy and you have more money than you can spend anyway. Halo 3 has much better control of number of weapons and ammo.2) Too much cash. You can pick up weapons (to the limit of your inventory cap) and sell them to the vending machines. You are NEVER short of cash, so if you actually can't pick up all the ammo you need, you can always buy more.3) Glitches: 3 times in the course of the entire game, my character got stuck and wouldn't move, so I had to restart from the last save, which was no big deal. A few times foes' arms and legs would be waving around through doors. And loot could sometimes be found in mid-air. Again: small deals.These are the flaws I found, and they are flaws common to many games, so I cannot downgrade Borderlands for them, so: still 5 stars. I'm looking forward to restarting the game as a different character.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2009"}

It doesn't have the same \"story\" feeling as the other games have, and instead feels more like an expansion pack with scenes that are a series of vignettes.  You follow (for the most part) a marine in the Pacific and a private in Russia, and the episodes start with a couple in the middle of the war and then leapfrog to the end.The graphics were top-notch for 2008, and the hallmark of COD games, intense and heavy combat, is there, but there's a strong feeling of been there-done that, and in the case of Second World War shooters the developers are running out of material.The Pacific campaign had a novel side episode involving a gunner in an amphibious plane, and the flamethrower is an interesting tactics changer, while the Russian campaign doesn't bring much new to the table.

{"product_name":"B0050SYY5E","description":"","reviewerName":"Ryan J \"Ryan\"","summary":"It really shows just how right Bungie got things the first time around.","reviewText":"It is hard to believe that it has been a little over 10 years since the release of the first Halo. In that time the series has accomplished a lot: successfully launched the Xbox, sold tens of millions of games, and crossed into other forms of entertainment including comics, novels, and movies. Halo is the game that Microsoft built their Xbox empire on, so it&#8217;s no surprise that the game is getting the remake treatment for its 10 year anniversary.In the past there was generally two different ways to do these re-releases. You could take the approach of games like Resident Evil 4 HD and Beyond Good and Evil HD and just port the game to modern consoles, upscale the textures a bit, and call it day. Or you could go the full remake route of games like Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes and completely remake the game on a new engine. This is the more impressive route to take, but you lose the nostalgia factor when you do it. Halo Anniversary takes a different approach, and ends up somewhere between the two.At its core, Halo Anniversary is the exact same game everyone played a decade ago. The game engine is still around and running the show. This means that all of the gameplay mechanics are exactly the same as they have always been. All of the weapons and vehicles handle the same, and all of the AI remains unchanged. For better or worse, the Covenant, Marines, and Flood all behave as they used to. Co-op is still around as well, and this time you can play over Xbox Live.So the Halo &#8220;combat puzzle&#8221; is still intact and as fun as it ever was. Each encounter provides a great challenge, with the game&#8217;s iconic selection of weapons providing the tools to solve them. Despite the game&#8217;s age, it still provides some of the most fun and challenging firefights in the series, especially on the higher difficulty settings. Halo: Combat Evolved on Legendary difficulty is certainly the most challenging of all in the series, and without ever feeling unfair. Those that played the game in the past will have a great nostalgia trip, while those new to the game will find what still is a surprisingly modern gameplay experience.On the outside though, we have a brand new graphics engine and art assets. Everything visual in the game, from the smallest rock to the largest Hunter, has had a pretty impressive makeover. Since the old game engine is still running behind the scenes, it is actually possible to switch back and forward between old and new, allowing you to actually play the original game with its original graphics. It it offers a great opportunity to see how far graphics technology for games have come in the past ten years. I had a lot of fun just switching between the two in each new area to see what they changed.All of the graphical changes are just superficial though. For example, while the elites have many times the polygons and texture resolution then they used to have, they are still the same height and width. Every rock, tree, and barricade is exactly where it used to be, the same size and facing the same direction. Everything just look a whole lot nicer. This means that the levels themselves also remained functionally untouched. The Silent Cartographer is as great as everyone remembers it, while The Library is every bit as annoying as it ever was. The updated visuals do help a bit, as there is more variety in the previously monotonous hallways of Covenant ships, and some arrows added to the floors in the Library help you stay oriented. Overall though, the levels in Halo were well designed and had a good amount on non-linearity to them that modern gamers have come to expect.All of that graphical fidelity has come at a price: frame rate. The game runs at a shaky thirty frames per second most of the time and can dip pretty low when things get frantic. Occasionally it was bad enough I actually switched back to the old visuals which runs smooth as butter. I am not sure if it is a result of running the two graphics engines or not, but it is a bit disappointing that they couldn&#8217;t have locked it down. Halo deserves better.In addition to the graphics update, the sound effects and music also got some attention. They really should have left well enough alone though. The new gun sounds are hit and miss, with some sounding truly awful. The same can also be said for the new music. As someone who played a lot of the original game, it was really distracting at first to not hear the same music and weapon effects that I remembered. It really messes with your nostalgia until you get used to the new sounds. Thankfully you can swap out the new music score for the old one. It&#8217;s too bad you can&#8217;t do the same for the weapon sound effects.The only real major disappointment in the package is the lack of Halo: Combat Evolved&#8217;s multiplayer. Instead of recreating it, we get an add-on pack for Halo Reach that consists of six maps (and one new firefight map). They have given a number of reasons for excluding the original&#8217;s multiplayer, but it really feels like it was cut due to time and budget constraints. The map pack consists of both Halo and Halo 2 classics such as Beaver Creek and Damnation. Since this is Reach multiplayer, the maps have been tweaked a bit to accommodate the various gameplay changes over the years such as jetpacks. If you already had your fill of Halo Reach online, there is not much here to bring you back.Still, Halo Anniversary is an enjoyable single-player focused remake of one of the most iconic games of the past decade. It really shows just how right Bungie got things the first time around. If you have fond memories of the original or never got a chance to play it the first time around, Anniversary is absolutely worth picking up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2013"}

The majority of the game has you walking around places looking for clues to solve simple puzzles. This is done with thumb stick moving so it makes you feel like you're \"really picking objects up\". A good example is when you have to sit down: you just push the right thumb stick down (an icon will appear on the top of the screen to show what you are going to do and what moving to make). The other half of the game is made up of mini-games with timed thumb stick moving (think of Simon Says) and L+R alternations...yeah it doesn't sound exciting but it really works and these ideas are implemented well with the ideas attached to them.On the story side it's very complex and well executed. You play as Lucas Kane who is convicted for a murder he didn't commit. You play as the 2 cops investigating the crime as well. The whole purpose of the game is the idea of playing chess against yourself. You can decide how the game is played out and actions you make early on will effect things later on. You really notice this too because later on you'll say \"Oh man I shouldn't have done that earlier!\" The game's pace flows smoothly and everything eventually comes together.Between each scene in the game you can choose which character you'll play next and this also determines the outcome. Some parts are also timed so you have a certain amount of time to hide, collect and hide evidence. If you miss one piece of evidence and someone comes to ask you questions they'll see it and get suspicious. This in turn raises their suspicion meter and you must make the right choices so you don't get busted. You also have a mental health gauge which lets you know how your character is feeling. Your choices will determine whether or not they become happier or more and more depressed leaning on suicide. You can do things from going to the bathroom, to drinking something, to even just make the right choice in a conversation to raise or lower this gauge. This plays a key part in certain scenes because some choices will completely drain your meter so you end up turning yourself in. The game is constantly changing from Lucas' childhood flashbacks, and the 3 separate characters keep things interesting.Thankfully you can beat the game in about 6-8 hours so you won't get too bored with these concepts. For the short time they work well and will keep you hooked until the very end. The great storytelling and excellent voice acting keep you hooked. Now a huge downside is the game is hideous. The animations are stiff and the textures are flat, dull, muddy, and just down right ugly. The game looks like a PS2 launch title that's how bad it looks. I played the PS2 version back when it came out and that version had some slowdown, but the Xbox version is just as ugly. There are some extras here such as making of videos, galleries, and a soundtrack (which is really good). You can unlock these by finding bonus cards in the game, but don't worry one play through and you'll get more points than you need to unlock everything. I highly suggest IP if you really want a good story. I also suggest picking this up at a game store because you can get it for less than $10 now!!! Xbox Originals charges you $15 so be warned!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"DC","summary":"Funny Game","reviewText":"I LOVE THIS GAME.

They're overdone and the pretentiousness that accompanies them and the people who like them is often too much for me to stand. That said, I was pleasantly surprised with Soul Reaver 2, because it actually did something new or least new to me. Soul Reaver 2 is basically game 3 of the Legacy of Kain series, (Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, Soul Reaver, Soul Reaver 2, Blood Omen 2 and the upcoming Legacy of Kain 2: Definace and Soul Reaver 3). In this game you play Raziel, a reborn demonic vampire. He had once been a Sarafan vampire slayer on the world of Nosgoth who, along with his brethren, had been slain then raised by Kain to be one of his lieutenants. In this world, vampires appear to be quasi-undead and are capable of evolution and change. In the first game, Kain would always metamorphose first, then years later his lieutenants would follow suit. However, this time Raziel beat him to the punch and evolved wings. His reward was to have them ripped from his body by Kain and then tossed into a roiling river- always bad news for a blood sucker.Raziel was, after years of agony, saved by the Elder Gone and reforged into what he is now- equipped with a soul destroying sword and charged with wiping out the last of the vampires and feed upon their apostate souls. Good job if you can get it, but I bet the hours are lousy. Anyway, the Elder God is basically this Cthulhu-esque squid thing that lies in a pool beneath the Nine Pillars- infinitely tall towers that gave life to and protected Nosgoth. After Ariel, the Balance Guardian, had been murdered, the pillars were corrupted by 'dark powers' and then became the seat of Kain's vampire empire for a thousand years until Raziel had been cast out. Kain had been chosen from birth to replace Ariel as Balance Guardian, but he refused, dooming Nosgoth to a slow death. Now, the story is a great deal more complex than that, but enough to give you a feel for what the games are about.Soul Reaver 2 is the shortest game of the series, and I finished it with a little help from a walkthrough, in about 30 hours. Despite the fact that Raziel is limited to about 5 geographic areas- the Sarafan Stronghold, a swamp, mountains, Janos Aurdrin's fortress and the pillars, it's amazing how varied the game makes them, because you get to visit them in different eras- past, present and future and they vary them enough that they always appear different. Within these areas are sub-sections that you can explore, but mainly you're on a quest to reforge the Soul Reaver blade with 4 elemental powers (Darkness, Light, Air and Fire), that aid you in your adventures. Each forge is a series of puzzles that must be solved to activate each elemental force to imbue the blade with a new power. The Reaver itself is a double-edged weapon, literally. While the most potent weapon in the game, it has a nasty habit of eating the souls of people you kill before Raziel can and he needs to do it to sustain his body in the Material Realm.Combat is pretty basic- Raziel can use a host of weapons other than the Reaver- swords, axes, pikes, and his claws. As he progresses, opponents get tougher and more numerous. By the last chapter you have to face down three Black Demons at the Pillars, and you'll want to use the Reaver- anything else is useless against them. Raziel's finishing moves are nicely gruesome- decapitations and impalings are the order of the day with lots of spraying viscera- I like to see that in game.This feature is probably my favorite aspect of the game. Raziel can at any time shift into the Spectral Realm, the place of souls. When he does so the geometry of the world shifts- buildings warp as the landscape alters. Here is the realm of the Sluagh- soul feeding predators. But in this realm Raziel and the Reaver no longer hunger because the Spectral Realm is saturated with excess energy. Raziel can also use it to gain access to areas in the real world- because of the geometry shift, certain things are higher in Spectral than in the Material realm, plus he can phase through locked gates. The only real downside to Spectral are the demons- they can follow you there. The demons are also some of the best designed monsters I have ever seen and their arrival in the game is pretty exciting as they warp in to confront Raziel, accompanied by a low frequency electrical buzzing sound.I never thought a Playstation 2 game could be this good. The voice acting is the best I have ever heard in a game- superb performances all around from the actors, especially Michael Bell who played Raziel, Simon Templeton who played Kain and Richard Doyle who played Moebius. Also appearing as the voice of Janos Aurdrin is Rene Auberjonois, who played Odo in Deep Space Nine. The graphics are pretty good and this is one of the few times I can't say it would look better on the PC, because the PC version is a straight port of this game. Too bad Soul Reaver 3 won't make it to the PC- with the latest batch of graphics cards it would have looked stunning. What really makes the game graphically are some of the unusually lighting effects. Sound is also really good- both the music, which is dark and brooding, and the unusual sound are all first rate. In fact, the sound is unique- not a lot of games have that going for them. Sure it's two years old, but who cares? It's a heck of a lot of fun and has probably the best story of any game I have ever played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2003"}

Garrelts","summary":"A Lot of Potential, But Ultimate Failure","reviewText":"I've read a lot of reviews here at Amazon about Battlefield: Bad Company and I'm surprised at how many positive reviews this game has.I purchased BFBC in July, 2008 after playing the excellent demo on the Playstation Network. I've had over 6 months to play the game and in that time serious issues have not been addressed by the developer - DICE Studios or Electronic Arts, the publisher of the game.The Battlefield series has always been first and foremost an online shooter. BFBC is different in 2 ways. First, it adds a single player campaign and second it features destructible environments. The single player campaign is adequate though somewhat of a distraction from the \"meat\" of the game which is clearly the online portion.The single player campaign puts you in the boots of a U.S. Army soldier assigned to the proverbial \"B-squad\". Your squad consists of delinquents, has-beens and all-around rejects from the rest of the Army. You'll have various objectives to accomplish in the war-zone you're in before being allowed to go home. The story although not compelling is entertaining and the AI characters are actually funny in parts. All in all I used the single player campaign as practice before jumping online.And online is where the game has major problems. First and foremost a game like BFBC is all about squad communication and tactics. Inexplicably the game features very, very poor voice chat support. You are limited to only speaking with members of your immediate squad (4 players total). You have no way of communicating with other members of different squads, even on the same team. Coordinating attacks or defense is severely limited because of it. Also, even through various game updates the voice chat is hopelessly broken. Some rounds you might actually get lucky and have the voice chat work only to discover it won't in the next.As if that weren't bad enough BFBC does not run stably or reliably online. Lag is so severe that the game sporadically freezes for 2-5 seconds at a time. Try playing a shooter with lag this severe and you'll quickly realize that it's a futile effort.Other problems including a complete lack of online game modes also hamper the game. Initially BFBC only included one game mode - Gold Rush. It's essentially a spin on traditional sabotage games. You are either a 'defender' or 'attacker' and must either destroy or defend crates of gold. A few months after release, BFBC was updated with a new game mode called 'Conquest'. In Conquest mode, the aim is to reduce the opposing team's tickets to zero. Killing an enemy soldier depletes one ticket per kill, while capturing control points on the map causes enemy tickets to count down.Beyond those problems I am also disappointed in the level variety in BFBC. Some levels truly shine and feature enough variety in vehicles and terrain to cater to all types of combat. Other levels are claustrophobic, poorly planned, feature no vehicles and are layered in annoying fog. The feeling I get playing the latter is that the developer quickly padded the game with extra maps sacrificing quality for quantity.I should point out that I tried resolving the various lag and voice-chat issues through EA's technical support. Unfortunately for me it seems that it's the game itself that is at fault as no one from EA was able to offer any viable solution. I'll also add that I use a broadband 6mb/sec. connection from Comcast. I play several other games online with no problems on the same PS3. It seems like the issues are entirely contained within the game itself.Overall I am of course disappointed with the game. What should have been the blockbuster title of the summer fizzled out as many players experiencing the same problems I described above have left for better games. The support from EA and DICE to BFBC has been almost non-existent leaving many gamers with an almost unplayable game. I strongly encourage anyone to rent this game before purchasing it!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2008"}

I've never had so much fun with such intense multiplayer action.  The maps are done so well as to inspire non-stop fast-paced action.  The customization adds variety, but is simple enough to not be overwhelming.  The zombie maps add hours of co-op fun with friends.  The single player campaign was a little disappointing, mostly because the AI is terrible.  But I'm looking past that since it's such a small part of an otherwise incredible game.  Definitely one of my favorites.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2012"}
