{"product_name":"B00020BV2E","reviewerName":"Robb Boutros","summary":"A Blast!!!","reviewText":"Every so often a game will come along that will take you completely by surprise. Last year it was Freedom Fighters. This year the honor goes to the game Mercenaries. It may only be January but this is probably going to be one of the top games of 2005.Mercenaries takes place in North Korea. War has broken out and the Allied Command has enlisted the help of a freelance military contractor named ExOps. As one of three operatives, you are enlisted to help out the different factions in the combat zone. All for, of course, a price.Mercenarie's standout features is it's gameplay. It combines shooting, driving and lots of what you'd call \"free roaming\". Players choose one of three characters, each with a speciality ranging from stealth to heavy weapons. In the game there is a \"Deck of 52\".Each card is a target with a bounty. When a bounty is collected it unlocks different features, such as air strikes and support options. You can also take contracts from different factions (Allies, South Koreans, Chinese, and the Russian Mafia) and time attack challenges. Each contract will affect your standing with a different faction. Anger a faction by killing it's troops and your standing will fall from \"friendly\" to \"hostile\". Even though this may seem very complicated, Mercenaries is a VERY easy game to pick up and play. There is little fumbling for the right controls for different actions. Hijacking vehicles is extremely simple. There is quite literally no learning curve.The graphics on this game are very good. Using what looks like the Star Wars: Battlefront engine, the game does a great job at depicting a war zone. As you drive down the roads you will come across different factions duking it out. One of the great features in the game is that just about EVERYTHING in the game environment is destructable. Every target of opprotunity yields a cash bonus. The sound on this game is also exceptional. This is a very well put together game visually and sound wise as well.Usually this is the part where I tell you that I do not own the Network Adaptor and haven't played this game online. However, this game has no online mode. Perhaps the sequel will have one, but right now the single player game is well worth the price of admission.Alot of people are comparing this game to SOCOM. Well there really is no comparison (if anything it more resembles Star Wars: Battlefront with some shades of Freedom Fighters). This game is very unique in design and in concept. Don't let the lack of online play disuade you either from trying this game. This game is well worth the price even with no online modes or multiplayer modes. If you're looking for a great change of pace then this game is for you. I HIGHLY recomend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2005"}

More Options. More Zombies. More Fun.","reviewText":"I got this on release day and I haven't been able to put it down. I am surprised to see such bad ratings peppered throughout the net complaining about this game. It is a game. It should be fun and crazy and challenging. I think somewhere people confused games with simulator games. All these advanced flying, shooting, and driving games came out and now everything has to be as real as possible. And if it's not, it gets a bad review. Games are supposed to be FUN!!!!Pros:+ Very fun game. Lots of big and little stuff to do. Will keep you busy for a long time.+ Better story-line and voice acting than the first game. Holds your interest.+ Well mapped out areas. Seems like an actual place tossed into a video game. Beautiful.+ Weapons are awesome. Finding various items and combining them is a lot of fun.Cons:- Sometimes too many missions at once. The phone keeps ringing, and a ringing phone has to be answered, and then you've got 5 missions to do and 30 minutes to do them in.- With 1,000 zombies on the screen the game lags a little from time to time.- Controls are a little wonky. I got use to them quick, but at first, he seemed to run too slow and I had a hard time controlling him while running through crowds of zombies.- There are the same little annoyances as the first one. Like limited life on weapons. But all those annoyances make the game more challenging and seem much less annoying in this sequel.All in all this is a very fun game with lots and lots to do. The online option is also a lot of fun, which I didn't think I would like. The story line keeps you interested and the hundreds of missions will keep you busy. Somehow Dead Rising 2 does not get as repetitive as the first game. I find it very hard to stop playing this game. The original Dead Rising had me throwing the controller against the wall. Dead Rising 2 seems more balanced with story, zombies, attention to game play, weapons, zombies, environment layout, zombies, and control.I love this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2010"}

Noire is a boring game from a company with an amazing track record.","reviewText":"First of all L.A. Noire is not a bad game but when their are so many other amazing games out there why buy just an ok game.  I will list the positve and negatives of the game in my humble opinion to help you make your own decision.Positive:1.) The facial recognition technology is amazing.  The game relies on you to pick up on facial clues to figure out if you suspect is telling the truth.2.) The game looks beautiful3.) The map within the game is big and allows you to freeing go where you want to.Negative:1.) The game is tedious and searching for clues on your suspects faces can be pretty boring.2.) The game does not have enough to do beyond the main missions.3.) The game makes you basically run around in circles.The above is my 2 cents.  Rockstar has tons of other great titles that would be better to spend your hard earned money on, like Red Dead Redemption, GTA 4 or GTA 5.Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

I play PC games, console exclusive games, and portable games.  I treat all platforms equally and only judge the content.  In addition, I'm fortunate enough to have been alive and well pre, during, and post the golden age of gaming.Visuals:The new visual direction is amazing and it works.  It's art! Everyone has their own option and some will disagree and that's OK.  But it works for me and I was impressed.  It's a blend between cel shading and the more realistic approach art direction of Twilight Princess with a touch of water paint.Sound:I really enjoyed the music scores and sound effects.  Again, it's my opinion and some will really like it and some won't.  Everyone has different tastes.Gameplay:Simply put, one of the greatest aspects of the game.  The controls work and are implemented very well.  This particular game can't be played with a regular controller because there are gameplay elements that make that impossible.  Motion controls adds another level of satisfaction that a person can't get any other way.This particular game has changed the \"Zelda formula\".  If you've played other iterations of the game, you'll notice the difference early on.  There is now a central hub from where you will branch off to complete various tasks including side quests.  In addition, the dungeon designs are genius.There is a crafting system in place that works very well.  Though it's basic in comparison to other games, it works very well and adds another level of greatness to the game.Presentation:I would love to see a Zelda game with the full glory of voice acting (some will disagree with me) but this game sticks to the traditional text bubbles.  And you know what? It still works.  Especially because of one particular reason, elaborate facial expressions.  It's done extremely well and it fits.The game interface works well but can get very clunky.  Thankfully, there is an option to make most of it invisible.In conclusion, this new Zelda game simultaneously feels new and familiar.  In my humble opinion, it's better than Ocarina of Time which makes it the greatest game ever created.If you own a Wii, this game is a \"must have\".  If you don't, this game should be the reason to purchase one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00009VE6B","description":"Play as eight characters from the acclaimed movie as you battle your way through twelve stunningly detailed environments.","reviewerName":"Mark Gilbert","summary":"A GOOD movie-based game...","reviewText":"Yor're often suprised which games are the good ones, and this is one really good game. During all the levels, your constantly fighting, so the fighting controls give you the feelling that your actually fighting. ROTK isn't one of those games where youstand there mashing the attack button hopping not to get hit. ROTK really puts it to YOUR skill. If your good, you can go through a whole level and not get hit once, but if your really bad, you'll die at the hands of the first orc you meet. Despite this its surprisingly easy to play (especialy with Legolas).As you finish each stage, the experince that you got in the stage to Level-up (10 Levels) goes to buy move up-grades. It is a good system, and it is quite fun to just sit down with a character and start hacking your way through enemies. There's just something addictive about the fighting.Another thing I should mention, is that the characters fight much the way they do in the movies. Sam and Frodo attack only to get past. Gandalf uses his great power to devistate many enemies,Aragorn fights standardly with his sword, Gimli fights powerfully but slowly with his axes, and Legolas loses none of his speed. Legolas is easily the best character especially in co-op, as you can slice up enemies, with your twin elven sabres, and in the split second it takes the next enemy to attack, you can turn around, fire and arrow at an orc trying to ambush your partner, and turn back around to smash that next enemy, all in the blink of an eye, and your controling all of it. One warning though,once you finish a level, you can't play it again with the same character untill you finish the last level (frodo's battle with gollum above mount doom) so make sure you do it right the first time, or in the case of the path of the king(Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli) play the level with your favorite character last, so they will get the better rating and experience.One more thing, Enemies are worth more experience the better you are fighting, there are four experience modes(Fair, Good, Exellent, Perfect), and the latter ones give A LOT more experience( in Path Of The Dead, one kill in Fair mode gives 75 EXP, but the same kill in Exellent mode gives 10,000 EXP)(or something like that)Lastly, the nine characters are Frodo, Samwise, Merry, Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Farimir, and GANDALF(about frigging time).Graphics - 4.5/5 (occasonal frame skips during cutscenes)Sound - 5/5 (brilliant, right out of the movies)Controls - 4.5/5 (no jump, and playing co-op can be frustrating)Overall - 4/5 (the first half, and most of the movie-segments, are out of the two towers not return of the king, but that is only the first half and it sticks to ROTK in the second half)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2003"}

As a kid I was obsessed with the original version and my n64 was  lost back about 2000-2001. So when this game was announced in 2004 on a handheld I had to get it somehow.To be honest nintendo could have released just the n64 cart on the ds with just the updated graphics and I would have been happy. However nintendo went the extra mile and added enough goodies and new stuff to make it feel like mario 64.5. The most notable change is the characters you can use. You can play as mario, Yoshi, Luigi, and Wario. Shockingly you have to start as Yoshi here and can't play as Mario tell you unlock him. Yoshi plays a lot like in yoshis island and is a odd but enjoyable character. Luigi is the best of the new characters and can jump higher and float in the air however is harder to control than mario. Mario plays just like he did on the n64 and serves as a balanced character. Wario however feels a little forced in, his ability is basically to punch blocks that the randomly added in that other characters can not destroy. Plus he doesn't jump very high.Other things new is improved graphics. Which the are nice for early ds hardware looks kinda in between n64 and gamecube. A few new levels here and there. These are more mini levels instead of full coarses but are fun to play. (I assume the might have been in the cancelled 64 2 if it were released). There is also unlockable mini games that the keys are hidden throught the castle. The games are actually really fun and remind me of the gameboy remixs of the game & watch gallary. Finally Nintendo added 30 stars to the game as well to challenge people who could play the original blindfoldedEven with all that new stuff that overloaded my nostagila filled brain at the time there is still a few things that make the original version superior. First is the controls. 64 was originally devoloped around analog stick control which was fairly new in 1996. The ds only has a dpad so it does get hard to control at times. and you have to hold the Y button to run. You can also use the touch screen but it takes a while to get used to it. Playing on a 3ds/xl helps a lot with this problem with the circle pad. Another problem is Nintendo decided to tone down the difficulty. The original was fairly challenging but this game is easy till you beat the final bowser getting all 150 stars though will still put up a fight. Also if you have played galaxy or 3d world recently this on is hard to go back to. It does show its age from time to time, unlike any other great marios.Anyway minus those problems this is on of the best video game remakes and even though i'd still recomend the original this is still a great game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2014"}

These are a remake of the original Gold and Silver for GBA, which has been called the best Pokemon games ever created. Gold and Silver brought much more to the very full Pokemon table, adding not only full-color graphics, but also gameplay elements you wouldn't think of living without today, such as the cycling clock and daily events.Pokemon HG and SS follow the same structure of every Pokemon game. Become a Pokemon trainer and battle up the ranks, beating 8 gym leaders and becoming the champion. You all know the formula, and this time around it's no different, providing many hours of beefy gaming. If you played Diamond and Pearl, you'll see no difference in the graphics here, but compared to the original Gold and Silver, they are a major upgrade from the once boxed houses now to full color vibrant cities. In addition to a greatly-needed graphics update, HG and SS provide remixes of everyone's favorite tunes, and these will be in your head forever, which is a good thing.So, if this is a remake, what's all new? Well, in addition to the revamped graphics and sound as mentioned above, HG and SS bring everything from previous Pokemon games and blend it together into a big fiesta of Pokemon extravaganza. So, you've got favorites such as the Safari Zone, Battle Frontier, but also new places from later games such as the Pal Park and the Global Terminal, a place solely for Wi-Fi trading, battling, and videos. Also, back from the original are the day-to-day events such as the bug catching contest or random people giving you items on certain days, and these are very welcomed back. Also new to HG and SS is the Pokeathlon, a big dome north of Goldenrod City where you and 3 of your Pokemon participate in stylus-based events. This wasn't possible in previous Pokemon games, and it's a lot of fun.Of course, I can't end this review without mentioning the Pokewalker, a brand new, HG and SS exclusive device, which lets you transfer a Pokemon over to the Pokewalker, and level them up and play with them in your real life. It also functions as a pedometer, and Pokemon level up by walking. You can also find Pokemon and items, and meet up with other Pokemon on other Pokewalkers. The Pokewalker is not just an excuse to get outside, but it's also a deep, fun way to take Pokemon with you wherever you go.This is a long quest, spanning two regions, 16 badges, and over 450 Pokemon to collect. If you want to collect 'em all, we're talking a very, very lengthly quest. Also this game has a high replay value thanks to the Wi-Fi functionality and day-by-day events.Pokemon HG and SS aren't just great remakes to the games everyone grew up with, but they're also a great way to get newer players into the world they may have never experienced. 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2010"}

Some of the high points of the Xbox 360 is its online service or \"Xbox Live\" as its called and the Xbox 360 controller, which is by far the superior controller and most ergonomic controller ever made.  Perfect for people with bigger hands such as myself (I often bump my thumbs together on a PS3 controller when using the analog sticks).  Along with the controller, \"Live\" is what carries the Xbox 360 to greatness, and makes it really shine.  \"Live\" enables you to play games on-line and chat with other people and compare games you and others have played for starters.  Live also keeps a score of each game you play and you can compare that to other users scores.  You can also buy and download old Xbox games, Xbox 360 games, movies, music videos, send messages to different players via voice or text, use different apps such as espn or epix, etc...at the same time pretty much everything on \"Live\" costs money even beyond the yearly fee, and you'll need net connection.  My favorite section on \"Live\" is the Xbox Arcade.  Most of these arcade and classic games are priced from $5 to $15 and can make for a lot of fun in short bursts, meaning most of these titles are usually not as expansive as full retail games, but cost a fraction of the price of a full retail game.One thing on the Xbox 360 that needs improvement is the \"Achievements\" system.  The \"Achievements\" on Xbox 360 are fun to collect but utterly useless.  Only there for showing off what you have done in games you have played.  My recommendation for making achievements worthwhile would be if you obtain a certain achievement score or a certain number of achievements then you should be rewarded with something other than a number (Gamerscore).  You should be rewarded with a free Xbox Original game or something free for your avatar, or a coupon for money off a new game, for example.  Doing that would keep people playing The Xbox 360 and it would intice people to buy a Xbox 360 and games for it.  To have achievements rather then not have them though is a good thing though, even worthless they can be fun and almost addictive to obtain them from the various games you have.  Also a quick note, there should be more games that star your created avatar, that would be cool but asking for too much I guess...Now for the bad - Its not a blu-ray player and the early models did not have built in wi-fi, both of which a well known competitor has and had, and the Xbox 360 was not that much cheaper than that said competitor.  Also the failure rate of these things made for huge headaches.  My first Xbox 360 displayed the 3 red rings, just saying \"My first Xbox 360\" is just...sad...Luckily my 360 at that time was still under warranty, but I was without it for about 2 weeks.  The graphics, when the system first came out, for most games, were not \"next gen\" by any means, and were very comparable to the PS2, graphics-wise...even with the HDMI hookup...I was sorely disapointed, for a minute, but that was then, and these days the graphics will blow you away.Last but not least The exclusives speak for themselves.  Gears of War 1, 2, and 3 - Fable 1, 2, 3, and The Halo series - beat out anything the competition brings, and the Kinect is by far the better motion game system, with its controller free interface being leaps and bounds ahead of the Wii and PS3's motion junk.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2008"}

I'm leaving the review below in tact, but have reduced my score signifigantly. The online mode is broken. Not only is it broken, but it has been in some fashion since release. If you enjoy a 10 hour campaign and co-op multiplayer, this is still a great game. But if you're like me and made this purchase 100% for competitive online, it is a massive dissapointment; and here's why:I DON'T CHEAT. EVER. Unfortunately there have been issues with the lobbies first, lag, glitches, corrections that created new glitches to now. Virtually every game is polluted with people cheating and it changes the fundamentals of the game. In my opinion, the core mechanics and feel is flawless, but the lack of a strong lobby system, clan support, even matchmaking and just being able to stay in a room with friends and not drop them half way through a match is ridiculous. With MAG out (not that great) and Battlefield soon (the DEMO and BETA were AWESOME), there is zero reason for me to continue to tolerate Activision and IW's poor implementaion of an online product that had amazing potential, but also stiff competition.***End Update***I am a console playing FPS fan. I loved Orange Box on 360, COD:MW and especially Killzone (playing almost daily since release). About 2 weeks ago I switched back to MW and played through the single player and online to get ready for MW2.The graphics got a pretty serious facelift, but I think Killzone still has an edge. The textures are about the same, but every level has more ambient sounds, colors and interactivity (shooting chickens could be an excellent drinking game). The gameplay is basically the same. There are some vehicle control scenes, but for the most part, the guns feel like extensions of COD:MW. Online, the game feels different, but that has more to do with the level of customization available.There are 3 modes: Campaign, Spec ops and Online.Campaign - Typically I don't do the single player portion. It only took about 5.5 hours and was very fun. There are a lot of set pieces, but basically you follow a line and shoot guys. It is VERY short. If you don't play online, MW2 is a rental only.Spec Ops - This is an awesome co-op mode. I played several missions and it is basically an arcade shooter that plays \"The Club\" that was out a couple years ago. You have team objectives and waves of bad guys against a timer. It manages to maintain a high level of intensity, but it's directed at the AI instead of someone else. Although it's not as large as the regular online mode, it is a nice diversion from the uber competitive online mode. If you don't like playing the competitve side of online games, this mode will offer an enormous amount of replay value to offset the short campaign mode.Online - This is what MW2 fans have been waiting for. It is similiar to MW, except larger in every single facet. There are some new game modes (Demolition, 3rd person game) a lot of new kill streak rewards including a game ending tactical nuke and sentry turrets. In order to help new players that are getting killed every 30 seconds, there are \"Deathstreaks\" that allow you to steal your opponents class, get a health boost and some other neat ideas. The \"Care Package\" is also available from the start. After 4 kills, you have an opportunity to call in a package that will randomly drop some very lame (resupply crate) and very cool (chopper gunner/AC130) otherwise difficult to earn kill rewards. Another big difference is the arcade style reward system. If you've died 5 times in a row and kill the guy who killed you last, youl'll earn points for revenge, ending the death streak and the kill. You are constantly being rewarded and unlocking new items, tags, names and guns. The customization is so deep and finishing everything will take 100's of hours. Finally, migrating hosts help avoid quitters that ruin games when their team is losing. Also, the maps have to be mentioned. Despite most (not all) action taking place with 12 players, the maps offer lots of places to go, but all have a blind spot. You can still camp in tall grass and pick people with a sniper rifle, but you are always in danger.It's not all perfect though. Unlike Killzone, there is no internal clan match system and hooking up with friends is still a hassel. Especially on PSN where there is no private voice chat. The game on release had a patch and connecing to friends in day 1 has been tough. If you are new to the game, its going to take a lot of patience if you want to get good. There are a lot of VERY GOOD players online and there can be some frustration involved. Also, the only DLC announced so far is for Spec Ops mode. I'm not a huge fan of DLC, but I was hoping for more maps as a priority. The last thing I'll mention is the scene played as a terrorist where innocents are murdered. For some people, there will be no justification. Objectively, the story is far to weak to make this \"artistic\" risk worthwhile. Infinity Ward took a gamble that I don't think was worth it and I can't think of a logical reason for bringing that kind of heat on themselves. They deserve the negative press they get.Currently, this is best console shooter on the market. I've said it before, there are only so many ways you can \"play guns\" and Infinity Ward has really added a lot to keep it fresh. With MAG and Battlefield due next year, there are at least 5 months of solid playtime here.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}

It's easy to create profiles and associate them with different applications.  Logitech provides software (download the latest version from the web site - don't use the disk, though) for easily creating macros.  You can also program scripts.  DPI range 200 to 5700 is great.  You specify DPI settings and save them with the application profiles.  Great for Photoshop because you can lower the DPI for precision work. Great for FPSs because you can lower your DPI on the fly for lining up your shots.  You can raise the DPI on the fly for quick navigation or less precise movements.  You set the number of levels of DPI and the DPI at each level in the Logitech software.  The DPI switching buttons are perfectly placed - just out of the way but easily accessible at the left edge of the left mouse button.It has a sort of rough texture, so it won't slip out of your hand while gaming.  It's definitely a different feel, but you get used to it and appreciate it in no time.I also like the ability to switch the feel of the scroll-wheel.At first, I loaded this thing up with the weights so I'd get rid of light-touch jerky movements, but after a few days, I removed all the weights.  It's nice to have the option to customize the feel of the mouse in this way, though.  I may experiment with them a little more over time, but right now I want to game.The only thing I'd change for any gaming mouse is to make the right mouse button require more force for the click (FPS bias).  When I'm surprised during a game such as MOH, I find myself mistakenly hitting the right button while pressing the left and I'm not pushing hard.  Happens when strafing while shooting as well, since the mouse is in motion.  The right mouse button could use a little more resistance in my opinion, since it is usually reserved as the zoom-in function and used less often than the left.I have large hands.  I don't claw.  I rest the pads under the base knuckles of my index and middle fingers on the back end of the mouse.  I use thumb and ring fingers for precise movements.  The ergonomics are great for this.Another great thing is it works just fine in Windows 7 64-bit and there are 64-bit drivers on the Logitech web site.  A lot of game controllers (keypads or mice) have issues with Windows 7.  This product does not.The mouse itself is solid and I'm impressed with it so far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2011"}

You play as the mayor of a town and you must raise money by doing various activities such as catching bugs, fish, crops and selling them, then you have to decide what to spend your money on and being mayor puts you in the position to spend money you earned toward yourself by buying clothes, furniture, expanding your house or toward expanding your town by building fountains, lights, bridges, buildings.The amount of things you can collect makes this game a blast and things such as bugs change depending on the month / season because the game follows real time and actually changes to night when you play at night or winter when you are playing in winter! Everyday something is different in this game, interactions with your citizens change and they sometimes have activities or chores for you to do and sometimes contests happen or your town gets visitors which really makes you want to come back and play it! You also build relationships with people and they open up to you the more you interact with them and help them out!If you have a friend you can visit their town online and help them out or do fun mini games together, if you register them as a best friend you can chat with them whenever you like in game, even if you are not in the same town! StreetPass is also really fun, if you pass someone in the real world with a New Leaf save then you can visit their house and explore and purchase items that they have collected!Overall Animal Crossing New Leaf is a great game to play for an hour or so a day, which you will want to play this game everyday as to not miss anything / see the progress on your town. Its a relaxing game that is a lot of fun and a recommend it to anyone who just wants to have fun or unwind a bit.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2013"}

WWII has been done to death. The single player mode is short, there is no story worth mentioning. The AI is stupid, every level is completely linear. If you don't move to the correct spot, you will likely have enemies respawn forever until you figure out where you should be. From a single player standpoint, WAW is a throw away.BUT...Who plays COD for single player? Bioshock or GOW2 are dynamite single player games. COD is all about online play. I went with the 360 version over the PS3 version becuase Xbox Live is typically a little smoother for me. My son and I logged in about 20 hours this weekend. The active player list hit 300k Saturday and Sunday, yet there was never any lag, no problem getting into games or slow connections. There was going to be super high demand for this game and props to Activision for being ready.The multiplayer is essentially a $60 expansion pack. COD4 wrapped in WWII (it runs on Infinity Ward's game engine). The visuals are spectacular. The maps are great - very well thought out. There is still too much camping in the free for alls and team deathmatch modes, but I don't think COD is the only game to have this issue. There is a reason the COD franchise has taken Halo's throne as the most played game on Xbox Live. The online portion of this game is tremendous fun and exceedingly well done. The only reason I can't give WAW 5 stars is becuase of the expansion pack feel. I can't wait to see what Infinity Ward has up its sleave for the true sequal to COD4.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2008"}

I'm a moderate gamer; the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review is for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) that sits on the couch and watches.This game requires a serious commitment. It timed in at close to 100 hours, and towards the end, we were so worn out that we didn't finish every mission. The game could have gone a lot quicker, we played all of the optional missions in the beginning. Towards the end, we had run out of story, and so it was getting a little tedious.Valkyria Chronicleswas amazing, and we were both disappointed when this game came out for the PSP instead of the PS3. We used aPSP Component AV Cableto play the game on the TV. Unfortunately, the picture quality was not nearly as good as the original. Neither was the story. It was still a really great game, though.The game play is similar to the first, with a few major changes. In this version, you have side stories you have to unlock for each character, ending in a mission. For each character, you also earn credits that allow you to upgrade them. This forces you to play with every character. In the original, there were characters we were more drawn to, and some characters we hardly ever played with at all.*****SPOILERS/HINTS*****Each mission gives you a type of upgrade credits, and certain credits are needed for upgrades for each character class. Go through the trouble of making a list of what each character needs for each upgrade. Towards the end, we even made groups according to who needed what, depending on what certain missions were giving as rewards. This should help you get your upgrades quicker and help you avoid replaying older missions to get low level items.After the game is over, new three star missions open up. This is additional game play, beyond the 100 plus hours it took to beat the original game. We haven't started the extra missions yet, but I can't imagine there is less than another 20 hours of new game play. They even bring in a few new characters, as well as some of the fan favorites from the first game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2011"}

If I said any more, I think I'd spoil the story so I'll stop here.Gameplay: 8/10I'd categorize this game as a stealth / shooter.  Faithful fans of the series may see these new innovations as dumbed down, and action fans may find that the new innovations assist them with the stealth gameplay.  Like previous Splinter Cell games, Sam hides in the dark.  You can shoot out lights, use EMP pulses and grenades, or flashbangs to disorient your enemies.  You also get sonar goggles late in the game, that detect enemy positions through walls (Similar to Batman: Arkham Asylum.)  Sam is also equipped with various weapons:  One pistol, and one other weapon that is a submachine gun, a shotgun, rifle...  Once you are discovered, the game becomes a shooter, causing you to rely on frag grenades and your secondary weapons to take out the bad guys.  In Splinter Cell Conviction, the game also shows a ghosted Sam if you are detected, which shows the \"last known position\" of Sam.  If you see this appear, you can expect the enemies to converge on your ghost or throw grenades.  It's best to distance yourself from this position ASAP.  The good news is that you are fast.  So if the enemies do spot you, you can quickly circle around them and flank them.  Another mechanic at your disposal is the Mark and Execute Attack.  If you take out any bad buy with a melee attack (stealth neck break, disarm, jumping down from above, pulling them through a window...) you can mark enemies.  To mark an enemy, put the cursor on them and press RB and you will see an icon above their heads.  You can mark 2 or 3 at a time depending on your gun.  Once marked, you can Execute them in slo-mo by pressing the Y button.  So, if you encounter 4 enemies, and one has his back to you, you can melee kill him.  Mark 2 of them while you are still hidden.  Head Shot Kill one of them.  Then quickly press Y to insta-kill the remaing 2 that you marked.  This technique makes Sam awfully powerful if you want to rely on this strategy.Levels: 7/10Most of the levels in the game require you to stealth around and take out bad guys.  A few of the levels are confusing, where you aren't quite sure what to do or what constitutes a \"fail.\"  Some of the levels are straight up Gears of War style action gunfights.Graphics: 6/10Splinter Cell Conviction uses the Unreal Engine.  The game looks good, not great.  But the game also does itself a disservice.  When you are stealthed, the game desaturates the colors, so the game appears dark and black and white.  If you are in the light, the game saturates the colors back to normal.  So, if you are playing correctly, the game is very dark and colorless.  This doesn't help at all in the graphics department.Sound: 8/10The music is exciting and the stealth tracks are suspenseful.  The gunfights and gear do a great job at punctuating the action.Replay Value: 8/10The Campaign is only 5-6 hours long, but the game makes up for it with their Mission Modes.  Play solo or with a friend, to enter a level and take out all of the bad guys.  If you are seen, the bad guys get reinforcements, which increases their number by about 10.  I felt that these Missions were more fun than the campaign.Maturity: MThere're head shots, a bit of realistic gun violence, no sexual situations, and CRAZY amounts of profanity.Pretty much every bad guy says stuff like, \"I'm gonna get you Fisher!  When I find you, I'm gonna **** you with a puppy that I ****** to death, then **** your grandma in the *** with it while I **** a ***** then **** a **** down your ******!!!!\"  Yeah, it's a bit much.Overall: 7/10If you're a fan of the series, you'll enjoy playing this game.  Hardcore stealth fans may be turned off by the new mechanics and shooter aspects, but these same mechanics make the game more fun for action fans.  If you are great at shooters, you could probably play this game barely using any stealth at all.Buy it if you're a fan of the series and you have friends you can play with online.Rent it if you want to play an action / stealth combo.Rent it if you liked the older Splinter Cell games, but thought they were too hard.Avoid it if you'd rather be playing Halo, Gears of War, or Call of Duty.  The strategy and pacing may be too slow for you.Avoid it if you don't like profanity.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2010"}

It also squashes cheating. I remember playing the original Diablo (pirated, btw) and going onto an MP map and instantly being ganked by some guy with some super-armor that he'd probably hex-edited.So that was stupid.I played the game once through on normal. The game is designed for people to play through the campaign multiple times to get more and more levels and stuff. I just couldn't get myself to care halfway through the second playthrough. It's completely arbitrary on the part of the game designer how *powerful* you get, and you're just getting more powerful to playthrough an area you've already played through again. So it's hard to care to get the chance to replay what you've already replayed.What I liked most was the take on Abrahamic religion. This is a story of good vs evil. There's a subtle theme of Deckard Cain being a wild-eyed holy-from-the-hills Pentacostal (at least in the first cutscnee) which I liked a lot. The look in Leah's eyes reminded me of the fear I felt when I first encountered the conservative Christianity belief of imminent apocalypse.taken deeper, it is really fascinating how the humans in Sanctuary are descendants of both Angels and Demons. It allows that humans are good and evil innately in our very makeup.The graphics are very good and the game mechanics are solid.

You can still buy shops and houses, only now you can set the price of rent and goods.  (and get good or evil points in the process)  You can also buy and upgrade each individual piece of furniture for your houses.  You can still get married, but now you can turn any house into a marriage house.  The towns look familiar, but are much bigger.  You could spend a lifetime just doing all of the side missions.  The choices are endless.You get out of it what you put into it.  If you really work to keep your wife happy, she will keep you VERY happy. ;)  (and give you children if you so choose)Not only can you buy every piece of property in the game, but you can also rename every townsperson who isn't a main character.

You can drop in and drop out almost as seamlessly as in the Lego games.  Like the Lego games you share the same screen (offline, haven't played online yet).  One of the biggest frustrations with sharing the same screen is when the 2 players go 2 different directions.

{"product_name":"B00006IR62","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Mark Hills \"Nobody gets me, I'm the wind, baby!\"","summary":"It's been a long time coming.","reviewText":"It has been a long and interesting ride with the Star Wars gaming license, with about as many games as there is sand on Tatooine. The latest offerings come in the form of a role playing game- Knights of the Old Republic. Knights is a somewhat confined and well-executed romp through perhaps the greatest franchise ever created. Games magazines are giving Knights high marks, and its well deserved, because she immersiveness of the game rivals just about every other Star Wars title from LucasArts or its stable of developers.Knights succeeds in just about every category- it is both stunning to behold and fun to play. Characters are well designed, if a little `same-ish' given that all men and women are the same height, with only superficial variances in model types. The game utilizes a bare-bones version of 3rd Edition D&amp;D at its core, but unlike Neverwinter Nights, KOTOR only uses the system as background support and the mechanics rarely if ever intrude into actual game play. What the game doesn't allow is dual or multi-classing. You can start as either a Soldier, a Scout or a Scoundrel and by 8th to 10th level, you become a Jedi. And your character can only be human. Each class has their pluses and minuses, usually in areas like Skills, Feats and allotment of Jedi powers. Unlike Neverwinter Nights, however, you control the progress of your NPCs- choosing their skills, feats, and choice of equipment and weapons that they use. The Jedi classes are almost overwhelmingly superior to their mundane counterparts, but given this is a game about Jedi during their golden age, it is to expected.KOTOR's story revolves around two former Jedi who, victorious over the Mandalorians, returned to conquer the Republic after falling to the Dark Side of the Force. They arrive at the head of a massive star fleet that no one seems to know where they got it from. It is your job to figure out how they managed to assemble such a large fleet and hopefully do something about it without succumbing to the Dark Side. (You can play through the game, making choices that will eventually determine whether you become light or dark.) Sadly, however, KOTOR's story is essentially the same as Neverwinter Nights- instead of finding four `words of power', you must collect four star map fragments that lead you to an unknown world inhabited by the remnants of an ancient race that essentially gave the galaxy hyperspace travel. And the answer to where the Sith star fleet is coming from is more akin to a Star Trek story line than that of Star Wars. None of this changes the fact that most of the events that lead up to this revelation are interesting and a whole lot of fun. The various plot twists and the `staggering' revelation about your character always keep it interesting.In Knights you travel to several worlds- you start on the city-world of Taris, Dantooine, where you begin your Jedi training, Tatooine, Kashyyyk, Mannon, and the Sith world of Korriban. There are innumerable quests that you must undertake, many with light or dark consequences, though most of which are entertaining. In these adventures you are aided by several NPCs- a Republic soldier named Carth Onasi, Bastila Shan, a prissy Jedi Sentinel, the perky Twi'lek girl, Mission Vao and her Wookie sidekick, Zaalbar, an astromech droid, Canderous Ordo- an ex-Mandalorian mercenary, a cantankerous fallen Jedi named Jolee Bindo, and HK-47, a smart-mouthed assassin droid turned translator. HK-47 steals every scene he is in with his dry, dark humor, wry condescension and quips on the limitations of so-called `meatbags' and bragging about his success as an assassin. There is also a never ending supply of equipment and gear to upgrade characters with- armor, shields, weapons and lovely flamethrowers.The combat system involves queuing up actions for each character then watching them executed on screen. You can queue up four actions, be they attacks, Force powers, healing items or stimulant injectors (potions, essentially), and each action is executed in sequence. You can pause at any time, assigning actions to your characters, targets to attack, etc. then unpause and watch everything unfold. Though a limited way to do things, it is never dull to watch and the combat sequences are well animated and very flashy. One downside is that you can't switch weapons on the fly, rather you must pause, enter a sub-menu and swap weapons out as you desire. Combat should have been a little more interactive, but since battles rarely last very long anyway, it hardly makes a difference.KOTOR's graphics are lavish and everything has that all-important Star Wars look to it. Sound effects are bang on. In this BioWare really did such a wonderful job in capturing all of the nuances of what Star Wars is all about- something Lucas can't seem to do in latest batch of prequels. This is perhaps the deepest and most Star Wars-like game since Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight, successfully capturing the best of what Star Wars is. I would have preferred a more 3rd-person-esque style of control and more freedom of movement, because though you can drive your character around the places you visit, you cannot climb, jump, swing, etc., which really would not have been that hard to accomplish within the confines of the game.Ultimately, it is a very satisfying game- huge game worlds, which while linear in nature are fun to explore, epic story and fun characters more than make up for its failings. It has some bugs that lead to system lock-ups that forced several restarts. No mention of midi-chlorians, prophecies, or `chosen one's'. It is a very romantic high adventure peppered with humor and a sense of fun - kinda what the movies are supposed to be like. What's more is that it provides 40-60 hours of fresh gameplay, making it the best Star Wars game in a long time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2004"}

I realize a lot of people say they don't like this game because of the platforming and repetition. Probably we could look at this game differently from all PoP series. It took some ideas from very old JRPG games - the setup, combined with new world jumping Tomb raider sort of fun and created a large open world. It's true this game has no epic fight like GoW and such but if you have played ICO you would understand some times a heart-taking story and stylish/beautiful game does not have to involve large battles. And in fact, when I played GoWIII, all I could think of is this is cool but has it been done over and over again?Now back to this game, I loved the open world (the first ACT game with a large open world for you to explore) and lighting seeds. Yes, the lighting seeds give players a purpose to dive into the dark (and later become very bright sunny) world. Some of them are tricky to get, and once you figure out how to reach them, it's pure joy.If you are looking for a combat focused game, this is not one for you. What shines here is the massive fantastic scenery with great color and lighting, hundred thousand feet high platforms formed ruins. The world is breathtaking sometime and I have to stop playing and simply watch. If you have great imagination and enjoy a fantasy world just similar to what FF series has created, then you will surely enjoy this game like I did.I played all five prince of Persia games and this one is my favorite.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

I am not big on driving games but when he booted up this game I wanted to play it. The game was Forza 3 and it is a game that I still play to this day. Now with a new release of a console the folks over at Turn 10 studios have released Forza 5. But is this going to be the ultimate drive experience on the Xbox One or should you drive on by?As with the previous games in this series you will be racing in various tracks in an array of supercars all over the world. But one of the newest features of this game is called the Drivatar. I could spend pages describing what this is but in a nutshell it is a copy of you. Your Drivatar will copy your driving habits, quirks and skill and can compete with other people all over the world. Just like the ad says &#8220;even when you&#8217;re sleeping it is racing&#8221; making for a very interesting concept ever unleashed on a driving game.One of the most crowning achievements of this game has to be the graphics. Forza 5 has some of the most breathtaking graphics of any racing game to date. Taking full advantage of the new Xbox One platform you will be able to see the tracks, cars and even the crowd in full detail. It feels as if you are truly behind the wheel of a supercar driving around some of the most breathtaking tracks ever created digitally.The only problem that I had with this game was that there is less content than its predecessor. Forza 4 had around 500 cars and 27 circuits while this incarnation has around 200 cars and 14 tracks. Additional tracks and cars are going to be released in monthly installments and available as a DLC for a fixed price on the marketplace. This also means at some point there is going to be a Forza 5 Ultimate edition with all of this content included. Now you don&#8217;t have to go out and get this additional content but I feel as if this is a way to nickel and dime players of Forza.If you are looking for a great racing game on launch day then Forza 5 is the way to go.

And pick up any dead birds or pieces of metal along the way...CONDEMNED is fine for an older xbox title, and can be bought for cheap. It quickly shows its age, though. Like many older FPS, you follow a distinct path in abandoned locales. The actual level designs are decent enough, and offer a good variety of settings. There's a typical office building environment, for example, but the decrepit department store is great, esp for a horror setting, with dirty mannequins standing amid old Christmas decorations.The game does succeed in evoking classic horror. Alone, you wander dimly lit corridors, with whatever weapons you can scrounge, an old pipe or a 2x4. Some baddies do literally drop out of nowhere, though plenty just amble towards you and start swinging.  A scary burning farm and a few monotone visions help with the mood.This game was probably more shocking and horror-inducing when it came out, but if you've played contemporary FPS or horror games, you won't be impressed. It's just too slow and there's not enough going on. There is a plot to follow, thought it's got some predictable elements, and you can't do anything to change it (well, except for ONE, at the very end).My biggest criticisms are typical for these older games: Not enough to actually explore. You go from point A to point B. Sometimes the areas are a little more labyrinthine, but usually not. You can open some doors but not others. Certain doors will lock behind you, forcing you to kill the boss, and then magically re-open. Outside of a few cut scenes, the only people you interact with are baddies.The biggest problem is lack of saves. There's no option to save, except at checkpoints, which are few and far between, and the game auto saves the last one for you. You can't skip cut scenes. So if you manage to die after a long walk and a big fight scene, you get to do it all over again.The combat is pretty simple; I only did melee to try to get a certain achievement. Swing, step back, block, swing again. Sometimes you get a finishing move, and can d-pad to one of four options, for a little extra viscera. There are the usual gun options, when you can find them.One of the more innovative aspects is the clue-seeking mechanic. You have several devices to follow evidence, and several others to capture (like a camera). It's a neat idea, but falls short, in that you are prompted when to use these tools, and it chooses the right tool for you. A better mechanic would be for you to decide when to use each tool, and try and find your own clues/evidence. I believe CONDEMNED 2 does something like this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

No not at all. Some would say It's a complete rip off and well... I can see that. Weather it be gaming companies or movie companies there's always that one product that shines above the rest (God Of War) and then there's that one company that thinks they are king so they have to compete with everything else. Well that's EA in a nutshell. But anyways no disrespect to Dante because I mean it's actually a kick *** experience and just as fun as playing God Of War. As good as God Of War? Never. But nonetheless Dante's Inferno holds it own with the beautiful graphics and epic story telling. The game is based loosely on the medieval poem written by Dante Alighieri and his journey through the nine circles of Hell to reclaim the soul of his beloved Beatrice from the hands of Lucifer. I'm still pretty new to the whole hack and slash genre and I like games like these so it doesn't really bother me how strikingly similar it is, it's just fun for me. Overall it was a shorter game than I expected, maybe not as in depth in terms of game play compared to God Of War but it was a satisfying play. I look forward to playing the next one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2010"}

Posey","summary":"Fable 3  -  First Impressions","reviewText":"Fable has always been a series that I've followed over the years.  I played and enjoyed the first when it was released on the original Xbox and played the second for God knows how many hours and loved every minute of it.  With the release of Fable 3, I know that I'll be spending just as much time in Albion as I have in games past.  So, after putting a good nights worth of time into the game and getting about 6 hours of gameplay in, what are my first impressions?  Keep reading to find out.Fable is a rich universe that shapes a lot of it's style from British landscapes and British dark humor (think Monty Python.)  The games always involve heroes and their rise to glory.  This title is no different in that aspect.  You begin the game as a Prince or Princess that lives within the confines of a castle in Bowerstone.  Your father is the hero from Fable 2 and your brother is currently the king of the realm.  He's an incredibly harsh ruler and after confronting him about his rules, he makes you choose between two impossible choices (seriously, it's pretty intense.)  After this, you flea the castle with your butler and mentor and decide to start a revolution to bring down your tyrannical brother.In case you weren't aware, Fable 3 is broken into 2 games so to speak.  The first involves you ammassing a rebellion to take down your brother.  The second - you take the throne and become king of Albion.  When you recruit people to help you in the battle against your brother, you make promises to them so that they help you.  When you become king and after these people help you, they are going to want you to stay true to your campaign promises.  You can do either and the game will continue.  When the credits roll, just like in Fable 2, the game isn't over.  There's still a lot left to do in the world you created and even some quests become available after completion.  So, be sure to stick around to check that out.The story sounds epic and from what I've played so far, it's going to be one hell of a ride.  Even more so than the previous titles.  Lionhead hasn't stopped there with the improvements either.  A lot has changed, some for better others for worse, but it all comes together into a single cohesive unit.  Another of these changes involves combat.  Combat in Fable used to be fast paced.  Fable 2 toned it down a little with combat being a much slower endeavor.  In Fable 3 however, the devs decided to go back to the way it was in Fable 1 and make combat flow seamlessly and fast.  Combat is comprised of three buttons and a movement stick.  Pressing X will perform melee, Y ranged (gun), and B magic.  Pointing the directional stick in any direction will make your character face that way and perform whatever action you want that way.  It sounds simple, but it's execution is flawless.  One of my favorite things to do in Fable is to use both a sword and rifle.  In Fable 3, I began combat with a group of hollow men using my sword.  I saw another enemy come up behind me and pushed the directional button back and hit the shoot button.  The prince, all in one motion, finished swinging at the guy in front, pulled out his rifle and shot the hollow man coming up behind him with the rifle...over his shoulder.  It was awesome that something so simple is handled so brilliantly in the game.  Three buttons and a directional stick work flawlessly in the game.  You need to keep in mind though, this is an RPG game with action mixed in.  You aren't going to get God of War style fight sequences.  Just the basics with some flair here and there, and Fable 3 works perfectly with that scheme.Fable 3 is a little different than the previous in the series in that it handles leveling a little differently.  As you do deeds in the world or kill enemies, you earn guild seals.  These are basically hero currency.  At certain points in the game, you are transported to a walkway leading up to the castle.  On this walkway, are a bunch of gates leading to chests.  Each time you \"level\" you unlock a gate and have access to these chests.  The chests contain things like greater attack power, better ranged power, more dyes for clothing, the ability to own a home, the ability to woo a partner into marriage, etc.  These are things that were given to you in Fable 2, but in Fable 3 you have to work for them.  I read an interview with Creative Director of Lionhead stuidios, Peter Molyneux and he said that the reason they did this was to not bombard the player with too many tasks to do at once.  Instead, they are streamed over the course of the game letting you focus on each individually.  I guess that's ok, but the only people it hurts are fans of the series.  The first thing I do in replays of Fable 2 is buy up property to get my cashflow going.  I had to wait to unlock it in Fable 3.  If you are new to the series, you won't notice the difference.Something else that's been added to the game is what the developers call \"touching.\"  Fable devs are all about creating a more personal experience and in their eyes, nothing is higher than touch.  In previous games you could make gestures, fart, kiss, belch, etc. but never hold hands.  That changes in Fable 3.  You can take your sweetheart by the hand and take a walk with her leading her to your new home or even hold the hand of a civilian as you lead them to a sacrificial offering furthering your evil deed.  It's a small change, but welcome.A question that gets asked a lot about sequential games is if you need to play the previous games to enjoy this one.  For a game like Mass Effect, the answer is yes.  That includes the same characters and a continuing story.  Fable is different in that the second game was 500 years after the first and this one is 50 years after the second.  The hero in Fable 2 is referenced as your father in the third but besides that, you don't need to know much.  Just know your father was powerful, people loved him, and he had a sprawling kingdom that he left to your evil brother.  You on the other hand, get the power to be a hero - like your dad.Fable 3 has pretty good graphics but nothing out of the ordinary.  Instead, the game thrives on it's excellent use of scenery and ambiance to create a living breathing world.  Honestly, you will feel like you are in a real world.  The world in the game is living with bright colors, humorous characters, and a bunch of people just living out their lives around you.  They react to your heroism or cower in your dastardly deeds.  You can choose to go evil or good in the game and depending on your choice, your weapons will change with you.  Do good deeds, your weapon glows white.  Kill innocents and blood will trickle from your blade.  It all works to further the game along and tell a very interesting story.Fable 3 also has a multiplayer component, but I haven't tested it out yet.  From what I know though, it's a lot better than Fable 2.  For starters, you get to use your actual character in other people's games instead of a premade character.  You get to bring back whatever you earn from someone's elses game to your game as well.  Plus, you can marry your friend on Xbox Live if you so choose and even unlock an achievement.  There's going to be a lot of uncomfortable silences in the coming months between achievement hunting friends...One thing I did notice in the game was some slowdown or lag in cutscenes and sometimes while running throughout cities.  Never in the wild, only with a lot of people on screen.  It's not a huge problem and definitely not a game breaker, just something I figured I'd mention.Another aspect of the game that may throw some people off is the lack of menus.  Peter Molyneux from Lionhead has repeatedly said how he thinks menus take the player out of the game world.  In Fable 3, you will find no menus short of the save one.  When you press start, you are transported to a room in a castle that has a Warhammer style game board map spread out on a table in front of you.  You can fast travel to all locations from this device.  In each corresponding room in the \"home base\" you will find your wardrobe on mannequins, armor and weapons laid out for view, the Xbox marketplace shop with visual items available to be seen spread out, and everything else you may need.  It's brilliant and I'm shocked it works.  It's a little odd at first because this is such a new experience but you go to the place immediately after hitting start.  There is no lag and your butler, voiced by John Cleese of Monty Python fame, is there to greet you every time letting you know you have new items.  Brilliant in my opinion.Fable 3 has been nothing short of amazing fun since I started playing it.  There is a sort of charm that the game exudes that makes it hard to not like it.  There's so many other features that I haven't touched on that you need to experience to really enjoy.  Like the job called \"Lute Hero\" which has you play a Lute - guitar hero style to earn money.  Or the crazy things you'll hear people say in pubs or while walking around the street in response to something you just did.  In the beginning of this month, I was crazy excited for Fallout New Vegas - now I can't stop thinking about Fable 3.  I even went out and bought the new novel that takes place after Fable 2 and before Fable 3.  The world of Albion is a great place to get lost in and I can't recommend this game highly enough.  Even if you've never played a prior Fable, you owe it to yourself to at least check this one out.  Action fans will find the combat to be a lot more welcoming to their crowd while RPG fans will continue to love the series for it's rich storytelling and humorous characters.  The rich world of Albion awaits.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

Another great uncharted game following the all impressive U2. Now with that being said there are a lot of things diffeent in this game. Yes it brings what we all love in the uncharted series and that is gunfire. Now with that being said there seems to be way more puzzles in this game especially early on. There are also alot of hand combat in this game. Im not talking about choosing to hand combat people but the game makes you fight people. Meaning hit triangle to counter and circle to break free. That kind of combat. There are way more puzzles and much more combat than the first two games. So if you didnt like that in the first couple games you may be a little disappointed. This game seems to be more movie ish as well. Longer cut scenes and a more blockbuster story in my opinion. The story is amazing and take place all over the globe. There is alot different in this game. Way more puzzles,Hand fighting, and cut scenes. However there is a ton of gunfire as well, Naughty dog stayed true and gave us a lot of that too. As they should, being that that is what I think most people like. Do I like this game better than the 2nd game? Only time will tell. I will have to play through it a couple more times. My initial thought is that 2 is better but im just not quiet sure just yet. Whatever the case may be naughty dog has delivered and this game even if its not better than the 2nd game still deserves a 5 out of a 5.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}

Besides five minutes of walking ain't going to kill you or anything. It's about too many similarities between Uncharted 2 and 3. There was a horse chasing scene jumping around the trucks similar to UC 2. Final bridge crumbling, same concept, entering a mythical world (either shambala or lost city) for final showdown, same concept. If you are new to this series all these are great, but to a UC veteran like me it is a little disappointing. I wanted something new, not copy and paste from previous sequel.Nevertheless, my love for this franchise is the reason I gave it a five star.

{"product_name":"B002VAWXO8","reviewerName":"Mkapa","summary":"It's a hit!","reviewText":"With all the DLC's and high quality wifi on gaming systems today, i found it somewhat surprising that they would still be pushing out these games. Why don't they simply update an older game with downloads and sell it for 10 dollars? So being that games are becoming more and more dependent on downloadable content. Their has be something to draw the player in that makes it unique from the previous installments. And we as gamers, expect more then just a shiny new graphics engine. Is a game like MLB2K10 worth spending your hard earn money on when you already have an older MLB game?The answer is yes! MLB2K10 takes the baseball sim to a whole different level. Sure you have your standard franchise mode, playoffs, home run derby etc. But 2K10 also throws an exciting new Player mode which is like a whole game in itself. A totally revamped pitching control scheme. And a more casual friendly simulation with \"hurry up\" baseball optionPitching has the player moving his analog stick in a certain pattern depending on what is dictating on the screen. The direction of the analog stick being similar to the pitch itself. For example a curveball has you spinning the stick in a 360 like motion, while a fastball is more simple. It's frustrating at first, but once you get your timing down, the learning curve isn't that bad.  The control scheme makes the experience all of the more enjoyable when you strikeout a batter. Not to mention more challenging then simply pressing a button. At times though, the controls can be stubborn as a simple tug in one direction are a slip of the thumb will cause a pitch to veer off or even a wild pitch. 2K10 has this annoying \"pitching analyzer\" thing that pops up every now but thankfully you can turn it off on options menuThe new player mode is like a game all in itself. It adds a little bit of an RPG characteristics to the game. In this mode you play as a rookie (you get to choose what position you play as well as your appearance, number, etc) that has been drafting into the MLB. You start off your career in the minors and then with every win, you gain experience and meet certain goals. Meeting certain goals will place you in a major league team faster then normal. You can eventually take your team to the world series. Have your player play in the all-star game or even make it to the hall of fame. This mode allows every player to live out their fantasy of becoming a pro baseball player. This is also cool if you just enjoy playing a particular position. If for example, you just want to hit or just want to pitch. Or it's good if you just want a more casual experience and don't have time for a nine inning baseball game.2K10 is also will update your game's roster to what its is right now in the MLB. So if say for example a certain player is replaced in real life. The game will automatically update the roster to reflect that change in the game roster. (Or you can choose to use the game's default roster) So you can play the teams as they are now. The commentators will even tell you the current stats as they are right now! You can also play current games from today. If a world series, all star game is taking place right now. 2K10 allows you play it. I haven't played online games yet so Im not sure of that experience.Music and sound is superb with a nice collection of rock and rap songs. Although 2K sports does recycle some of the previous music from other 2K sports games. Graphics are really good and detailed.A couple of years ago I swore that I would never play another 2K sports game because of the large amount of bugs in the game. (Eventually I caved in a bought this one). MLB2K7 had a freezing problem that happened so frequent that it was almost unplayable. 2K10 is a improvement over previous installments, yes there are still some bugs. I had the game freeze on me at least 2 times since buying the game a month ago. But it's still very rare to have the game crash. Likewise, rushing through the commentary will sometimes cause the batter to freeze and the only way I could get out of this was by bringing up the substitutes menu.All and all, a good game.  Haven't played \"The show\" yet so don't know if it's better","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2010"}

Sure, the store is slow (but for me, reliable) and as such, some of my games are taking longer than expected to download (300 MB files take ~1 hour).  So that makes me upset, but this will be fixed.  It's hard to rate the system on its own merits without brining gameplay into the fold.  But as a whole, Sony impressed me.  Very minimal load times between applications, video sharing, and even an additional ten dollar PSN voucher in the box... I mean, what else do they need to do to make people see they want your business?  No issues with the console for me, except for the aforementioned slow internet, which I know will be resolved.  If there is any miss, it's that my promised 500GB hard drive is more like 405GB.  I figured around 450GB so a 20% loss is unfortunate, but not enough to lower my score.

I always found the Dualshock 3 to be uncomfortable to use for very long, and it felt too light and almost fragile (though to be fair I've never had one break or anything). But the triggers were poorly done and I hated the thumbsticks, both layout and the convex nature of them. With the Dualshock 4, it's even lighter than the D3 (or so it feels) and it still retains the stick layout, but it feels much better.

{"product_name":"B004Z4ZKL6","description":"","reviewerName":"E.S.","summary":"As good as advertised!","reviewText":"I have to admit that Fifa 12 takes a very promising step in the right direction.  Anybody who buys yearly editions of sports games knows that the transition year-to-year is minimal, but when developers have competition they actually have to turn it up a notch.  2K destroys EA when it comes to NBA games and in this case, EA destorys Konami.  Don't even bother with any football games, they're a joke and EA should be ashamed of themselves.  Competition leads to better products for consumers and I hope PES is at least alive for the next few years to keep EA honest in upgrading FIFA.  Let me break down the new features and the improvements for FIFA 12.Tactical Defending: Pretty solid new feature I would say.  When defending, you have to hold the L2 button to \"mark\" the man with the ball and you now push circle to \"tackle\" him, or to hijack the ball.  This takes precise timing and know how to use.  You can't simply run around and push X, hoping the ball pops loose.  Used correctly, tactical defending can interrupt passes, break up attacks, and ultimately swing things in your favor.  If you mistime it or use it incorrectly, the man you're marking will run by you while you wiff.Player Impact Engine: Kind of gimmicky and kind of awesome.  It's basically to add \"realism\" to the pitch by showing players colliding.  Obviously it's a great feature to see rather than players running through each other or bouncing around.  However, I find it comical sometimes the way they fall over.  Running into the keeper often leads to your guy taking a face plant.Career Mode changes: They redesigned the entire layout of Career mode.  Rather than having a calendar option to see your fixtures, it's placed horizontally above the main career screen.  also, there is now multiple news feeds updating you on players' transactions, fixtures, transfer news, etc.  not necessary but it's nice to have.  Another new feature is player happiness.  Players will tell you whether they want to be played and if they're not being played enough they'll want to hand in a transfer request.  I like it because in reality players are pretty moody and demanding anyways.  The one thing that takes away from this is, using Barcelona I started Messi basically every game for the entire month and at the end I wanted to rest him.  He immediately responds, \"I see that I'm on the bench, but I want to play because I'm in good form\".  So I suppose that turns into a judgment call, whether to keep an in-form player on the pitch or rest him and risk that extra boost in rating.  Player happiness is coupled with \"Form\" which tells you how well they're playing at the moment.  Player rating boosts or deductions are dictated by the \"form\" rating.  I think at the beginning of every new month, the first four days are \"media days\" where players will tell you their happiness or unhappiness.Youth Academy: A feature I was pretty excited about.  It's like FIFA 10 where you send scouts around the globe to pick up talent.  This year you get to hire up to three scouts of various \"experience\" and \"judgment\", these ratings dependent on how much it costs to hire them.  Sending them to talent rich countries like Spain, Brazil, and etc. gives you a great shot at landing future stars.  Essentially, the each scout will hand pick a couple of players aged 14-16 and give you a range for potential player rating in the future.  This range is large at first, sometimes like 50-91.  You are given three options when evaluating players.  Keep scouting them, reject them or to sign them.  The more weeks you scout them the more info is unlocked about all of their stats and lowers the range of their potential player rating.  The longer you wait means another team can sign the player away (Arsene might hijack your youth players!Upon signing players to your youth academy (no limit to how many players you can have), your academy quickly builds their stats and you can sign them to the senior squad.Transfer day deadline: Basically the last day of the transfer window.  Great potential here, you have 10 hours to wheel-and-deal before the window closes.  It seems simple but you can negotiate for players you weren't previously after and quickly sign them in that last 10 hours.  Wasn't even trying to sign players until the deadline and was able to submit an offer, get rejected, submit a better offer, get accepted, negotiate a deal with the player and sign him at the deadline.Game play itself: I can't really comment on the game play since I haven't played it as much as needed yet.  It definitely feels different from Fifa 11 which was pretty stiff, not as much as PES, but needed work.  I like the whole \"Precision Dribbling\" feature, lets you dribble with the likes of Xavi and Iniesta.  Haven't entire figured out how to perfect it, but the feature is there.In all, this was a pretty solid upgrade from the year before.  I never expect massive overhauls of game play and features from one year to the next but the additions EA added this time around were good.  Now if only EA could buy the rights to UEFA and get all the domestic cups' rights.....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2011"}

I can't say I ADORE the way that it was implemented (almost as if it was another resource) but I did enjoy it's return.  Also, there are a lot of complexities that flesh out Civ V.  I think all the Civ games have kind of had to wait for the expansion that made them a little more playable and Gods and Kings is the expansion for this generation of Civ.Somehow, though, the game runs significantly slower, even though most of the changes aren't something you would imagine would make the game run slower.  There are crashes, too.  Yes, they're fixable, but I'm a little tired of beta testing games for developers these days.  You'd think I could get a product that would work on my flawless machine, but so often I have to search for fixes, fixes, fixes.The civs are a little smarter, but not by much.  I do enjoy the way espionage changes the way you deal with your neighboring civs.  You can steal tech, find out if someone intends to attack you, conspire against other sims with the information you've discovered.  Still, you can not-really-win a war and be offered multiple cities for almost nothing.With G&K; Civ5 is richer, deeper, more enjoyable.

Worst of all, being a sequel that comes from a long line of sequels can bring massive amounts of excess baggage from the game's predecessors that can't (or won't) be jettisoned.Having played many an RPG, I'm very pleased to say that Final Fantasy XII navigates smoothly around all these troubles. It does an excellent job of focusing on what matters most:  a rich Role-Playing Game experience that is also rather easy to use.  Having tried their hand at just about every variation of the genre, Square Enix gives us this culmination of lessons learned, and the end product is immersive, beautiful, and fun.Players used to the Final Fantasy series are also accustomed to having unique and complex capabilities as far as HOW they play.  If I were to start telling you about FFXII's Licenses, Gambits, Mists, and ESPers, chances are your head would spin--it's deep stuff.  In earlier titles like Final Fantasy VIII this was problematic:  the way you handled abilities and magical creatures who help you and special boosts to your weapons and stats was complicated and hard to keep track of.  Here however we have a smooth flow that slowly introduces you to the concepts and gives you a chance to try each one as you progress in the game.  Gameplay elements are better organized and not as dependent on each other.Perhaps one of the best features in the game is \"Gambits\":  instead of manually managing every character's every action in every turn, you can apply a certain amount of intelligence to your characters using multiple rules that you create.  This can easily be done.  For example, you can have your healer heal anyone when their health falls below 40%.  You can have a party member choose to attack the nearest enemies, or to focus on whichever enemy the leader is attacking.  You can tell a magic using character to throw certain spells based on certain events.  You can organize the Gambits to better automate actions: \"attack whatever the party leader is attacking.  Failing that, just attack the nearest enemy.\"  And with one tap of a button, you can override these behaviors at any time.Another excellent feature is Licenses.  They represent a grid of all the possible skills a character can have, and they give you a seemingly infinite depth of choices for each player:  no longer do you have to choose narrow character types, like \"Mage\", \"Fighter\", \"Healer\".  Instead you simply choose how to spend points you accumulate to pick skills, spells, and equipment for each.  Naturally, this makes character mistakes easy to remedy, and it also means replaying the game can be a very different experience every time.There are other exciting features to the gameplay that would easily double the size of this review...so let's move on to the game elements themselves.  Probably the only real limitation to this game is that it was crafted for the PlayStation 2.  Cutscenes are stunningly gorgeous, but while the in-game graphics are among the best the PS2 had to offer, this still means things look a bit blocky, edges jagged and detail a bit muddied.  When you play, you will face loading screens that transition you from one area to another, but thankfully Square occasionally fills the gaps a bit with cinematic-style transition scenes.  Moving through the story brings characters who come and go:  some are guests you have no control over.  Others join with you and become playable characters you can control.  You even have allies who may change sides, and the next thing you know you're battling your own comerades in the fight to save the world.  My only complaint in this area is that you are only allowed to take 3 of your characters \"out of the box\" at a time.  You can change back and forth any time you like, even swapping out KO'd characters for live ones, but it would be a bit more fun for me if I could have 4 characters under my control instead of 3.Things don't stop there:  while we have gorgeous artwork, a beautifully orchestrated score, rich gameplay, and a complex system with an easy learning curve, we get the rest of the package, too:  great writing.  Interesting characters with diverse backgrounds, storylines that peg the dramatic moments and bring you along on the highs and lows of the story, drawing you in to a deep and at times very complicated plot.  There are political alliances and shadow arrangments, with people shifting sides as the story goes along.If you're interested in the Final Fantasy series, Final Fantasy XII is about as good as the later titles get.  If you're already familiar with the series from earlier titles, you might be pleasantly surprised at the amount of polish that has been put on this title.  If you're completely new to the RPG genre, expect this to be fairly complicated:  read the manual closely, pay attention to tutorials, and do a little reading online to immerse yourself.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-22-2010"}

However, given who put the game out, I was actually expecting a little more polish and a little more features right out of the gate.The graphics are fantastic, far better version of a post disaster world than either Fallout or Borderlands. The weapons are all very nicely done, even the pistol. There are some minor control issues though. For example, you can only activate one \"gadget\" at a time, and have to cycle through them to activate a different one. THe problem is that some of them are pretty critical, like grenades or bandages for healing. If you have it on your bandages and see a great opportunity to throw a grenade, you have a take time to cycle to them, and you know how that goes, your opportunity for that grenade toss probably dries up because the guys are scampering around.Pretty good inventory system, since you don't have to mess around with weight. So far I haven't seen a way to sell the old components on your vehicles after you upgrade to something better. They seem to just sit there gathering dust, and all the hard earned money you spent is gone.The big complaint is about the co-op mode and the lack of a co-op campaign. This game could have easily been made for a two-player outing, but sadly they just added on some co-op missions and called it a day. They are mildly entertaining but in the end the whole mode feels tacked on and I really expected far more from Bethesda and id software. Hopefully they will make up for some of it with some DLC, but my hopes aren't high.Overall a very good game. They could have and should have done some things better, but they chose not to. I hope for another installment and further hope that they'll put in some of the features that would have made this a superb game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2011"}

If, indeed, you are a casual player...well, be prepared to train hard cause, to beat the toughest difficulties, you're going to need to.

{"product_name":"B001C6GVI6","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"Strongest Rpg of the year that deals with real issues","reviewText":"Warning: May contain very subtle minor spoilersI adored Persona 3. I owned both the original P3 and even got Fes so if you called me \"fan boy\" in this regard I'd nod vigorously. Normally it is the case of a fan to say \"Oh , nothing can beat my favorite game!\" but in the case of Persona 4 I have to kick my elitist pride in the private area and accept that p4 is better than p3 in just about every way.First thing I noticed is these seem like real kids. Chie is a tom-boy who has trouble catching the attention of guys whereas her friend Yuki is gorgeous yet is in a situation in which she feels as if her life is planned out for her. Yosuke is the typical class clown in some regards but in others he is very steadfast and devoted. Indeed all your friends have more than one layer and they struggle with many issues including  feeling trapped into roles they do not want or questioning their own sexuality.Even your character the \"silent protagonist\" has to deal with a work-a-holic uncle that is apart of the police force while having to help his adorable cousin Nanako by doing activities with her so she will not spend most of her days simply making breakfast, doing laundry, and singing the town mall's theme song.While Persona 3's characters were endearing they seemed a bit shallow. None of them had to confront skeletons such as \"Am I gay?\" or \"I know that when I'm up on that stage singing these songs everyone sees me as an easy slut.\"Whereas before \"shadows\" were just aimless monsters in Persona 4 they even manifest as darker psyches of the main characters. They must be defeated than embraced for each protagonist to awaken to their inner self. This approach makes everything a lot more personal and even the dungeons are varied representing each person trapped in the other-world instead of being monotonous floors in the same tower. \"Keys\" were also added thus certain doors or chests cannot be opened without them.One thing I'll confess is Persona 4 is harder. I got laid to waste fighting Kanji's sensitive brute shadow and before that Yuki's caged Phoenix shadow and the Contrary King like-wise dished up plenty of bruises. This time your tactics have to be really well thought out. Fortunately unlike in Persona 3 you CAN manipulate the actions of all your characters in persona 4. Just go into your tactics menu and place them under your direct control.The music is what you expect of Persona and is a mix of techno, emotional J-pop, and a bare minimum of heavier tracks. As with the other game it does well for the setting.Concerning the environments they are quite limited just like P3 however I admit they are prettier and have a rustic charm. Unlike before Inaba is truly a small town instead of a beach front city. You will see odd quirky things like a giant toad statue in the general store, a crafty fox that guards an abandoned shrine, an actual true black-smith building adorned with ancient looking armor, and there is even a fishing hole in the flood plains. While p4 may not be much bigger it did put more articulate work into the smaller details.All I can say about social links is they are more complex. Whereas before you only had to up 3 stats now there are at least 5. \"Diligence\" \"Expression\" and \"Understanding\" are brand new and now instead of only helping relationships with people in the mundane world they even add actions to your friends whom go into combat with you.As expected you go to school, take tests, celebrate holidays, and must balance all of that with trying to solve a murder mystery related to the paranormal. The only direct change is \"weather\" is an indicator of what happens instead of \"moon cycles\". Indeed the oppressive fog, symbolical metaphors for people entering the other world, and more serious atmosphere made me think briefly of Silent Hill. I'm not saying P4 is  an RPG trying to be a survival horror game but it does deal with disturbing imagery and topics P3 more or less tip-toed around.Even the beautiful nurse looked like an older Alessa Gillespie but its' safe to say these things are coincidental. Japan has often used themes of \"duality\" and \"other worlds\" in their culture so eventually anyone is going to see parallels and similarities in their works of fiction.The only thing I got confused about is some characters in P4 look like characters in P3. Dojima's partner Adachi looks and sounds exactly like Junpei. It would have been better if the designers just admitted \"Yeah this is Junpei when he got older and decided to be in law enforcement\" but in truth he is his own separate person. Naoto looks eerily similar to the main silent protagonist in P3 but as his (?) truths become known that theory is completely debunked.I know I've neglected poor Teddy the friendly bear mascot that helps you on the other side of the television as well as a few other key things but I hope I painted you an informative picture of what P4 has to offer you. It is a wonderful game even if we have seen these same graphics and many of these same mechanics in P3. It is similar to its' predecessor in all the right ways and gives you just enough innovation to show you Atlus cares about the contentment of its' fan base.Pros+Wonderful characters you get to truly care about+ More complexity added to the social link system.+ Dungeons seem less repetitive and are metaphors for each character's struggles making their exploration more interesting. Shadows likewise have more of a purpose.+ A story line that trumps and out-shines P3's in every way. In case you are wondering that is hard to do.+ Taking away evokers and metaphoric suicides which were unnecessary and giving the protagonists traditional cards similar to the classic Persona games.+ Glowing butter-fly save points! No its' not as great as having Philimon back, but it is a nice nostalgic nod to Persona 1-2.+ As a town Inaba has more charm and neat little details than your residence in P3.+Kids forced to deal with \"real issues\" other games are too squeamish to contend with.+ The oppressive fog and murder mystery motif makes P4 a lot more mature and intriguing than P3.+ Direct control of ALL characters.Cons- Cheap one-hit bosses even near the beginning of the game. Leveling up does help but grinding can get lack luster after awhile.-You feel rushed to save people from the TV world because the next time there is fog in your world that person dies and it is an automatic \"game over\". You are given a generous stretch of time between foggy days but that does not take away the pressure of a ticking clock.- Some character designs look too similar to P3 designs. This can lead to confusion and false assumptions if you are a true fan.- There are not as many ways to leave dungeons or as many mid-way points. Stock up on items you need often. This is no cat-walk.- You have less time to do things in P4. in P3 you could go out during the evening but in P3 once you return home that is it. Certain \"night shift jobs\" and your work table occasionally offer more to do, but I miss being able to go to other areas after hours such as the nightclub in P3.As a side note I'll add I sincerely hope Atlus makes P5. A game like this on a next gen system with even more ways to socialize, bigger environments, more Persona fusions, and a longer life-simulation aspect balanced with fascinating dungeons would give big companies like squareEnix a run for their money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2008"}

As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions.

{"product_name":"B00005B8FZ","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Super Mario Bros. 2 for dummies.","reviewText":"I can still remember playing Super Mario Bros 2 for the first time. It was a huge change in gameplay from the first game, where you collected coins, jumped on Goombas and Koopas, went down pipes, and took out Bowser at the end of each castle level. Instead of doing any of that, you now defeated enemies by picking them up and throwing them at each other, or by throwing vegetables or bombs at them. There weren't any pipes to go down, but now there were odd vases that had treasures in them, but didn't take you to a later part in the level. Bowser and the Koopas were replaced with little masked enemies, snakes and egg-spitting monsters. And rather than being stuck with Mario or Luigi, you could also play as Toad and Princess Toadstool. Yep, it sure didn't feel like a Mario game (that's because it really wasn't) but man did people love this one back in the day. I loved the game both on the NES and SNES where it was a part of the Super Mario All-Stars collection. Now that my daughter's gotten into gaming big time, we played through the game on the Mario All-Stars collection for the Wii, but I got her the GBA version too so she could play it on the go. I'd missed out on this version when the GBA first came out over 10 years ago, and as soon as I started the first level, I couldn't figure out what they were thinking when they made this port.Gameplay remains the same more or less, and I talked a little bit about it above. The game's still a platformer at heart, and there are 3 levels in each world (though the final world just has 2) to go through. Most of the worlds are either grasslands or desert, but there's also an ice world and one in the clouds. You run through the stage, taking out any enemies in your way, or avoiding them almost entirely. You can even roam through most of the levels in their entirety at your own leisure- there's no time limit, and the game lets you go back to the beginning as long as you have a way of getting there. In every level you'll see little bits of red grass swaying in the wind. These can be picked up with the B button, and will usually be a vegetable to throw at your enemies. Sometimes you'll get a bomb, turtle shell or 1-Up mushroom, and sometimes you'll get a magical red potion. When you throw this, it creates a door that, when opened, leads you to Sub-Space where the red grass creates coins when you pull it up, and giant mushrooms can be found that add one heart to your health. It all depends on where you throw these to get the health mushroom, and it's best to throw these in areas with lots of red grass, so you can get lots of coins, which are used in a slot machine mini-game when you clear each stage, and is a way to get extra lives. But the Sub-Space can also lead to a warp zone in certain areas, letting you travel to later worlds.Then there's the whole character selection part, which was really cool when the game first came out. You had Mario, who was the all-around average guy, with a good running speed, jumping height, and strength for pulling up vegetables at a fast pace. Luigi wasn't as strong as Mario, or fast, but has the highest jump of anyone. Princess Toadstool was the slowest, weakest and had a fairly average jump, but her main skill was that she could float around in the air for a few seconds before falling, as long as you held the A button. Toad seemed like the worst character, but when you figured out that there were differences in the strengths and speeds of the characters, and not just the jumps, he tended to be a favorite. He had has the lowest jump...but is the fastest and strongest. What's the point in having a lot of strength for picking up the vegetables? Well, when you go into a Sub-Space area with lots of coins that need to be pulled up, Toad is going to be cleaning house, and there's a great chance that you can get 9 or more coins in one go. On top of all of this, there's also a super jump ability where if you hold down on the d-pad for a few seconds, your character will glow, and they can jump much higher than they normally can. This is only really used in a few situations, but still fun to do every now and then.So if it's a fun game, with running around throwing veggies at the bad guys, what's with the 3 star rating? This GBA version has so many things added to it that it feels like they made it for people who've never played a game before. Before, if you lost a heart, you'd have to defeat a few enemies to make a little heart icon show up, then you'd have to chase after it and nab it in order to get your health back. Here, hearts are so common that you'd think they're going out of style. You get hearts from defeating two enemies or more in the same throw, can pull them up from the ground, and sometimes they're just sitting there in the stage, waiting for you to get them. It's hard to NOT die in this game. What's weird is they seemed to try and add a tiny bit of challenge by starting you out with two hearts, but one of them empty (as opposed to two full hearts in the original), but with it being so easy to get the second heart full, what's the point? There are also giant versions of some of the enemies and vegetables, making it even easier to take out big groups. I get the novelty of this, and it -is- cool to see Luigi pull up a massive turnip at first, but the game was just fine the way it was before. And guess what- the red coins that they seemingly crowbar into every other Mario game since Mario 64 are here too. They also included a point system, and a score is displayed at the top of the screen, to make it more Mario-ish I guess. But the icing on the cake for horrible things is that the characters talk. And it's not just a little bit either, no. They say something every single time you pick up and throw an item. With how often you're plucking vegetables and coins, this gets old VERY fast, to the point where I turned the volume down all the way after the first stage. The changes I do like include a new robot boss and certain revisions to levels, though there are very few of these. And as usual for the Mario Advance games, the original Mario Bros. arcade game is here to play.If you have the option to play Super Mario All-Stars on your Wii or SNES still, I recommend sticking with those and ignoring this version. A lot of the challenge is gone, and those voices are so grating that it makes you wonder why they were put in. I hate to sound like one of those old darshes that go on and on about how 'the original was better' or seems like they hate new takes on old things, but man do I not care for this game. Even if you can't get All-Stars, but have a Wii, you can get the original NES game on the Virtual Console for a very low price. Give it a go. The only difference between that and the SNES/Wii versions is the visuals and audio. It's still fun and very playable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2012"}

This is what I thought (I own and love) of the soon to be classic: Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell (actually played it)!1. Gameplay: Incredible, and so many options.  Here's the basic plot and story of the game.  There is some evil plan going on, a plan or weapon tha could cause another World War: World War III.  The U.S. drops you off as a spy, to find and destroy this weapon, person, whatever it is...you must find out and destroy it before it happends.  You are Sam Fisher, Splinter Cell.  If you are captured, you cannot reveal your link to the U.S.  Good luck Sam, may God be with you!Ok, so you are a spy, must fine and destroy whatever it is that is out there, and do it in stealth.  Being found means death for you.  Luckily, you have every gadget, weapon, and move in the book to accomplish your mission.  Now, the cool thing about Splinter Cell is first: the awsome story that you go along by.  I mean, wow, it really made this game shine.  But to go with the story is perhaps the best gameplay ever seen in a Stealth Video game.  Example:There is a leader at the other end of the room, surrounded by guards.  He knows what you need to find out; so what u do?  You have several options (which is true for almost every mission).  Shoot out the lights with your handy little gun called the \"Silencer.\"  The room is pitch black.  Now you can put on your night vision gogles (you have 2 gogles: Night and Heat Vision), sneak across the room past virtually blind guards (who basicly think the power went off since they don't know about you), knockout the leader, drag him into a closet, and interrogate him.  Find out what you need to know, then knock him out.Or...  Throw a grenade into the room, blinding the people with smoke, and killing most of them.  Use your heat gogles (which will help you see) to find people still alive and giving body heat.  Take them out and find the leader.  Make him give you the info then dispose of him as you wish (normally just knock them out).  You knock out the lights when security arrives and head out.  You are Sam Fisher!Most of the gameplay is like this.  Sometimes, when you need to figure out a code, hide behind a door, while 2 guards press the key pad.  When the door opens, and they step in, come out and put your heat gogles on.  The first keys they pushed will be the least warm, while the last one touched will still be red in sight.  Press the code, open the door, take out the guards, and intercept the e-mail.You are also eqquiped with tons of gadgets.  A camera you can stick under a door to see who your facing once entering.  Little sticky things to put on your hands and knees to climb the wall, get to the ceiling, and jump on your enemy in surprise.  So many options, gadgets, guns, and everything.  Not to mention more levels than anyone could ask for! (the whole point of the game is to not be seen, to attack blindly before they know what happend).  Can you imagine how fun this is?2. Graphics: Perhaps the greatest ever to be seen in a video game.  When you enter a kitchen, the chicken frying on the stove sizzles and steams.  The cook humms to himself, adding salt and pepper, un-aware of your presence.  The shadows, lighting, everything looks so sharp.  To give you an idea, my good friend came in when I was playing and thought I was watching some spy movie.  The people move to real life, you see people breathe in and out.  The shadows and darkness is so real, you might really think the lights went out when you shoot them.  If one is left, a lite glow will fill the room.  Your shadow trails behind you as you sneak up on a scared guard.  The graphics, like dozens of the other XBOX games, bring this game alive.  Talk to dozens of other people, reviews, websites, and you'll hear the same thing.  If you thought HALO looked good, your mouth will drop at these graphics.3. Options: So many!  You can crouch, open doors, climb walls, hide against a wall, put a gun to someones head, choke them to death, interragte them, hide a dead body in a closet, etc...  So many options during gameplay, it's almost like you really are a real spy (this game captures the feeling).  Wow, I am amazed at everything this game offered.  From graphics, sound, moves, etc...  This game has it all!For parents shopping online, trying to pick a system for their kids, know that A. This game is a must-have (basic hints: X takes out your gun, puts it back in, holding black button brings out a small menu to choose a gadget).  and that B. It is not violent: No blood, people screaming in pain and agony, guts flying, etc...  This game is clean, it's just really cool.This classic game, Splinter Cell, is a must-have for all XBOX / soon to be XBOX owners.  And NO, it is not coming to the PS2 and GC.  PS2 doesn't have the graphics power to support it, and the GC doesn't have enough buttons.Well, I hope this helped, and you finally read a decent review.  Oops, time to go.  Enjoy Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell; thx!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2002"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Gamblor","summary":"Killzone 3 Verdict from a Longtime KZ Fan","reviewText":"Hey there, guys and gals, you already know most of the essentials, so I'm just going to list some pros and cons that might help you make your decision as to whether this game is for you or not.PROS:1) The campaign contains a lot of variety; there are no seemingly endless drab corridors to shoot through ala KZ2 (and most other shooters). There are great on-rails sections, turret sections, jetpacks, and even a mech level. I never got bored of a level, which I can't say for the first two KZ releases.2) The controls are revamped and far more friendly, but the game retains a sense of weight behind the character.3) Graphics are top-notch, and environments are bright and colorful.4) The story is satisfying in its simplicity; I have read many reviews that complain about the story's lack of cohesion, but I didn't experience that at all. We know who the bad guy(s) are, we know why we're fighting, and we know where we're going. Simple, fun, and not confusing.5) The multiplayer offers a rewarding unlock system, but doesn't go overboard; this is first and foremost a class-based shooter that emphasizes role-playing and teamwork.6) The game is much easier than KZ2. I had some troubles playing KZ2, even on the easiest difficulty (I know, I'm bad.). KZ3 is much more accessible; if you want to play at your own pace and enjoy the set-pieces and level design, go ahead. The higher difficulties still pose a serious challenge.CONS:1) The campaign is short. I beat it on the easiest difficulty setting in less than 6 hours. Also, higher difficulties won't add that much more time, because there are so many on-rails levels that are timed in a sense. I imagine that a run-through on the highest difficulty might take 8-10 hours at most.2) The multiplayer has some serious downgrades from KZ2. The squad system has been gimped; there is no more squad chat, spawn-on-squad, etc. Now, it's just like a party system, where you travel from game to game with your \"squad.\" Also - the multiplayer now features matchmaking instead of a server list. This is a big downgrade; it can sometimes take 5 minutes or so to get into a game, and you can't choose what/where you want to play (ala KZ2).3) Unlike KZ1 and KZ2, the campaign doesn't feature an epic boss battle finale. I found the ending satisfying, but the lack of a real final boss battle was disappointing (however, there are some MASSIVE set pieces and battles sprinkled throughout the campaign).I hope you folks enjoy the game, or at least know enough now to make a purchase decision.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"A much brighter view of Helghan","reviewText":"Killzone 3 started off right where Killzone 2 left off. The story picks up right after Visari's death and takes place in a six month span. The story is not as compelling as the second. It just doesn't develop the characters very well and in the end they just seem like grunts that kill Higs. Rico and Sev are the exception as they do appear to have depth throughout the campaign. Those two must take orders from Captain Narville. He has absolutely no character other than he is an idiot that doesn't ever listen to his men. He is always right and they must follow his orders. The ISA forces are stuck on Helghan and must survive. Now that may sound like a bleak tale but you wouldn't know that from the environments. The second game had bleak streets and buildings where the third game is bright and colorful. With the tone of the game it should have stayed bleak and hopeless.Despite my nitpicking on tone of the graphics they look very good. They're not as mind blowing as its predecessor was but they do look realistic. The Helghan leaders faces could have been done better as they share a lot of screen time, but that is a minor complaint. They are the other side of the story. Two powerful Helghan officials are vying for Visari's thrown. They are excellently voice acted as are the other ISA soldiers. This adds a lot of believability to the characters that they play. Overall though the story falls short and never amounts to anything much more than a reason to change the environments. The ending of the story does get better but it doesn't make up for the generic story the rest of the game.The campaign itself is fun to play through. New brutal melee attacks have been added. It's really fun to stab a soldier in the eye. Be careful though because if they don't land you will simply butt them with your gun and they will kill you in one hit of there's. It's not fair at all. There are some other annoying parts of the game like invisible walls your can't shoot through but your enemies can. Along with cover that doesn't protect you at all even though it was put there to do just that, and again there is no grenade indicator.Some positives. There is a lot of variety in the missions like jetpacks,ice cutters, and even space dog fights that add some variety. The weight of your character has been taken away thankfully and you can aim instantly like most other FPSs. The campaign is fun to play through once, but because of the cons that I listed above you will die a lot and the frustration is not worth a second playthrough.The online is fun. I never played the Killzone 2 multiplayer so I can't compare them, but it is fun even for someone like me who rarely dabbles with online play. You pick from 4 classes that each have a different skill that you can upgrade. It keeps you playing and unlocking new weapons so it does suck you in. I do wish it would have launched with more maps, but I guess they can release DLC later.Overall Killzone 3 is simply a disappointment. The story is not up to par with the excellence of Killzone 2, and frustrating game play problems don't help either. This game is far from bad with gorgeous graphics and a lot of environments in the campaign, but it's far from perfect as well. I recommend you rent it to experience the campaign and try the multiplayer. Trust me you won't be picking this up anytime soon so don't buy it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2011"}

Morales","summary":"A Masterpiece, Perhaps the Best Game I've Played This Year","reviewText":"Hotel Dusk Room 215 has been in release for a few years, and though it has never had heavy mainstream popularity, a very large and growing number of hardcore and more adult/mature gamers have found this gem and come to greatly appreciate its complete ingenuity and completely unique structure. Hotel Dusk is a Nintendo DS game that uses the DS capabilities to an incredibly long range, just short of the microphone. From what I hear, it has a similar structure to Trace Memory, another DS game that is very far from the typical action/shooter/platformer we have regularly seen from this system. No, Hotel Dusk is a completely story-driven game, working almost like an interactive novel, and sure to completely grip novel mystery/thriller/suspense readers as well as more open-minded non-readers. So no, even though the game is about 80% dialogue, it is not something that will immediately turn off someone who regularly plays action games. Although, I wouldn't see most gamers under the age of, let's say, 16 giving this as much thought.Ok, onto the review. Hotel Dusk takes place in Los Angeles in 1979, and tells a story of a man named Kyle Hyde, an off-beat private detective and former NYPD police officer who now works for a sales company. Granted, his personality is very non-salesman like, he is sent to a small and rugged hotel in the middle of a rural area entitled Hotel Dusk. He is sent there to because a client asks him to locate some items left at the hotel. Kyle though reluctant, heads off and from there on he begins to have his own agenda in trying to unravel a mystery about his former partner who he had to actually shoot dead due to a bad circumstance. Kyle now believes his partner is alive, and his whereabouts have some big connection to the hotel.Once there, you will meet a various cast of characters, each with their own unique personalities and with their own business at the hotel. Although in the beginning the characters dont' necessarily catch your eye, over the span of about the first hour of game time, you will become somewhat intrigued by the events that unfold. The game consisting of 10 chapters (or more like 10 levels), you become more and more interested, and even charmed by the cast the further you play in. I would say about Chapter 3 is where you tell yourself that you simply do not want to put this one down. It plays out like a really good book, and this one is a page-turner, one you won't want to let go of. After meeting and talking to many of these people Kyle begins to make connections to his mission and how much deeper he has to go to find out the truth behind not only his former partner, but what everybody at the hotel is really up to, the secrets they hold, etc. You need to find out who you can really trust, how to respond to their questions and what are the best ways to go about \"talking\" to them. This concept is greatly (although not perfectly) incorporated into the gameplay.Hotel Dusk is a game that primarily uses the stylus, and really doesn't use the buttons for any reason other than to tap when having to scroll through more dialogue. The DS system is turned sideways, so the game plays like a book, and you use the style to do pretty much everything in the game. This includes, guiding Kyle as to where to talk (one screen showing his first-person prospective and the other you use as the map in order to guide Kyle throught the hotel). There are icons at the bottom of the screen in which you tap in order to perform certain tasks, such as going to your notebook, reviewing items, conversation summaries, but mostly to investigate certain spots in every room in which you'll tap on various objects for Kyle to investigate further - everything from cans, to pictures, to chairs, to notes and books. Investigating is the most important aspect of the game, and throughout the game you'll be put in little mini-games in which you will use the stylus to perform a task in order to further your investigation. For example, you rub it to use a nail file, to search through a garbage can, or even to write notes in your notebook for future reference.Now when it comes to people's conversations, there are certain segments where Kyle must ask questions that are pertinent to his investigation. You will tap on these questions depending on who you're talking to, and get further information to the story as a whole. At some points Kyle will be given the option to choose 1 of 2 different things to say, and almost like a 'choose your own destiny' book, you must tap on the correct line or question in order to avoid \"losing\" the game. Once you get to know various characters, you will get a feeling as to how to approach certain questions and which of the 2 choices to ask, because doing the wrong thing will scare of turn the person away, or have you kicked out of the hotel completely, thus the game ends and you need to start again from the last checkpoint.The game's puzzles and various choices are not based on the same sort of usual \"gaming logic\" that the vast majority of games have. Logic such as \"get armor key for armor lock\" or \"put the same colors together\" etc. No, this uses a VERY real world form of logic, and very real world forms of common sense, almost like what you would normally do if you were in the same exact situation. For example, at one point a character is upset because the hotel manager had to go through her things, and she says to be careful and Kyle tells himself that he better not be caught with certain items he's holding. Logic would state to IMMEDIATELY go back to your room and stash the items away so that you won't be caught with them. Me being a regular gamer, simply went ahead with these items anyway and was caught and questioned by the hotel manager. Since some of the items I was carrying were taken from the manger's own office (which I needed to investigate previously), he got angry and tossed me out of the hotel. Thus is lost the game and had to restart. This is the type of logic I mean. Anyway, as you go further you become more accustomed to this system and at the same time grow so fond of the story you simply DON'T want it to end! I can honestly say I was very upset when the game was over (although i did like the ending), and immediately had to buy the sequel to the game ('Last Window Secret of Cape West' which is sadly only in release in the UK and Japan, since Cing, the company that made this game, filed for bankruptcy, so the chances of this sequel coming to American shores may be slim to none).Anyway, with this innovative system of gaming, one becomes incredibly intrigued by the story and like I said before, does not want to put it down. Now, lots of reviews I've seen complain that the game can get too dialogue heavy. I would ignore such reviews, as the game is mostly dialogue, but the vast majority of it is necessary. Only on about 2 instances (each taking about like 3 minutes) did I find the dialogue a little bit redundant. Almost like a writer who writes a great novel but has those 2 or 3 parts in there that could have been cut out. Big deal. These parts weren't terrible, but just sort of unnecessary.But one minus I will say (and it's not really a minus per se), is that much of the game's puzzles can sort of leave you feeling clueless, and you may end up wandering all over the place with seemingly no clue as to what to do next. This is mostly due to the fact that you need to use an item you retrieved last chapter (and may have forgotten about), and need to use it on an object which you may have investigated hours ago and never really thought to go back to. This simply means that sometimes it's hard to put two and two together in this game, so you may have to resort to an online game guide. I had to do this several times because I found myself lost and without the common sense or patience to try and figure things out on my own. I did this because I really wanted to further the story which was way more intriguing than some of the puzzles. There are lots of items I didn't even end up using and clues around the hotel that were never necessary, which can sort of confuse to player even more depending on who you are.Other aspects of the game, such as the soundtrack, stand out greatly. The soundtrack to this one feels more like a mix-up of elevator music, but one that has tunes set to a more old-world style, set to relax the player and not get in the way of the gameplay. It meshes beautifully, and you may find yourself checking up these on Youtube or simply wandering certain areas to hear the great music go on and on. I for one loved the music, and look forward to other tunes the sequel will bring.The animation of this game is also brilliant. There is no audible dialogue, as this plays out more like a novel, but characters are pencil drawn in a old Noir style and move and express themselves through various frames and not smooth cartoon animations. It brings a great sense of coolness and charm to the game that can't really be cxplained unless you play it.But this aside, any gamer looking to take a break from the usual shooting things, blowing stuff up, or going off to various fantasy realms and wants something with a fantastic involving story, a GREAT soundtrack, and incredibly unique gameplay won't make a mistake by picking this title up. Given its price now it's a very affordable and very enjoyable sleeper hit.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

Well, I was walking around at blockbuster, and that exact same phenomenon happend to me. I took it home, popped it in, and began the first mission. I was at parts amazed, at parts extremely disapointed while playing &quot;007: Agent Under Fire.&quot; (by EA Games).1. Gameplay: Okay...but not very good in a lot of parts. First, it just feels too easy. You go around shooting people who don't usually shoot back. The game is based on AUTO-AIM, which really kills gameplay.  The people don't look half as good as they should, and missions overall are short and easy. There isn't much of a variety of guns. There is hardly any ammo, and for that case, what you come with isn't very much. The guns aren't very creative either. Just a handgun, maybe a rifle here or there.Vehicles: You normally control just one or two every 5 levels. One time you get to control a car with a ton of weaponry, but it's gets old after awhile. The ability though, when you have an assistant in the car, to shoot from the headroof was extremely COOL. That was one of the few places you got all kinds of guns. Vehicles are here, they're just not that common.Story: Pretty good; it actually has one at least. You must save a hostage, escape the terrorists, take out people in stealth, break into the room, etc... It actually went by a story line, but the [bad] part was Jame's girlfriend gets...2. Graphics: Decent, but not good. People's hands don't have 5 fingers, the backgrounds and guards and such don't have faces. Bullet marks disapear after going into the wall. No weather factors, collapsing buildings, etc... The graphics here were, once again, good, NOT GREAT! Better than most PS2 games, but way short of awsome!3. Sound: Probably the best part of the game. The voice acting (while people's mouths don't move when they talk) is excellent. The sounds of gun shells falling to the floor after re-loading brings the gameplay alive! The cars squel when they start fast, explosions rock the screen. Overall, it's pretty good. The music in the background is...BOND, of course. The sound was the best part of the game in my opinion, that and:Multiplayer: Very fun! The levels are fairly large, and the variety of weapons is huge! From jump packs, canons, bazukas, shot guns, snipers, handguns, etc...there are tons of guns. The game keeps score, and you can work as a team in 4-player; 2 on 2 combat! There are life vests to keep your health up, and the overall gameplay is good. I loved only one part of this game. it was the multiplayer!This game, overall, is a good game in terms of how much is costs (a twenty should cover it at most stores). Persounally, I'd buy it for the multiplayer, not the story mode. Something to chill on the couch and play with yours buds in multiplayer, or even watch someone breeze through the story in a matter of an hour or two. This game is a blast in some ways, and a MAJOR disapointment in others. I plan on buying it...maybe (after renting it for a week, not really sure).Thx!obryanstars*","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}
{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Cravens \"Loves a good story\"","summary":"For story-lovers, RPG fans, and Mass Effect junkies alike","reviewText":"This is hands-down one of the best RPGs -- no, video games -- I have ever played. I have been playing RPGs of all sorts for over 12 years now.Anyone delving into RPGs on the Xbox 360 has probably played the recent Mass Effect 3, so you'll notice I will compare this game with ME3 often at times to give you a thorough picture of this game without spoilers. Let's look at several aspects of The Witcher 2.GRAPHICS:The graphics of TW2 are excellent, with some textural setbacks. While it's no Mass Effect 3 or LA Noir, the graphics are amazing on their own. The cutscenes are well-done, too.GAMEPLAY:With so many aspects of gameplay executed so well, where do I start? The combat has a somewhat steep learning curve, but once you get the hang of it, it is SUPER satisfying. Hitting enemies feels real, like in Dark Souls. The game is a bit unforgiving (also like DS), but it's nothing you're going to throw your controller about. Typically in RPGs people tend to go toward a specific class like a mage or warrior or something similar. In this game you are wise to use all elements of magic, swordsmanship, and crafting (making bombs, traps, and potions) in steadying of sticking with just one. This gives you the feeling you are an all-around boss when it comes to taking down opponents.This game is semi-linear. Certain sections of the world open as the game progresses, and when you reach a section you are free to do as you like. However, you cannot travel to various sections as you can with galaxies/worlds in ME3. In that sense the game is more linear than the space trilogy, but the areas you traverse to are so large to explore I don't think anyone will really complain about it.The voice acting is excellent. I like how not everyone has an English accent, something very apparent in fantasy movies/video games. If you liked the voice acting in ME3 it's almost a guarantee you'll like what's in TW2.Have I mentioned the atmosphere? The dark world of TW2 feels alive, something games like Dead Space 2 and Skyrim have done well. Too many games have tried to simply rely on great graphics to make a setting, but that just doesn't work. Fortunately, this game does not suffer such problems.CHOICES:Choices play an extremely interesting role in TW2. The consequences are much more severe, and by severe I mean they really alter your story. In ME3 you can choose what Shepard will say/do, and it may affect a character or change a few cutscenes without changing the overall plot at all. However, in TW2, your plot will largely shift as a result of some of the things you have Geralt (the protagonist) do. Though, I do want to point out that while the story can change dramatically the personalities of the characters remain perfectly intact no matter your journey, which from a writing perspective I find very impressive. A friend and I started up TW2 at the same time, and already we had a couple different quest and scene options presented within the first few hours. To give you an even bigger idea, the game has sixteen different endings. Also, this game is ultra-realistic in the character department. This means you get to see how every character you must make choices about are either severely flawed or have selfish agendas they are hiding. There were very few characters that I had no deep disappointments with along the way of the plot.This leads to another interesting trait about the choices in TW2: the overall morality of the world. In ME3 it is clear which choices are right and wrong. You are given points and praises depending on how you control Shepard. In TW2, the world is dark, and morals are extremely ambiguous. You will not be rewarded or punished for what you choose. Your choices are yours and nobody in the game really gives a crap either way. This propels an interesting psychology in the role-playing experience in that it causes you to reflect on how you would actually conduct yourself if the situation were real. No judgment, right? I believe ME3 does a good job of getting you to experience the emotions of Shepard caught in a war with massive loss and sacrifice, but Mass Effect does not get the player to think about their own psyche quite like TW2. Sadly, I feel that players under a certain age won't be able to grasp and appreciate this attribute while playing TW2.STORY:The dark fantasy tale of TW2 gives much different vibes than the space opera of ME3 beyond the obvious. With ME3, I felt like I was watching a movie unfold as I was on the edge of my seat while the game progressed. With TW2, I felt like I was deeply engrossed in a book. Of course, TW2's story is heavily political like a George Martin novel. In short, if you hate anything to do with politics, you may want to steer clear of this game.In terms of character development, I noticed some stark contrasts to ME3. I feel Geralt is much better developed than Shepard, but this is probably due to the fact that Geralt's character is easy to keep consistent in a morally-ambiguous world, whereas Shepard can have quite different bits of dialogue depending on whether you choose him to be either a Paragon or Renegade. While I feel the hero is more developed in TW2, I am much more attached to the other characters in ME3 than I am in TW2. Some people may feel different, but I feel a significant attachment to Geralt that is not nearly as strong as with the other characters in this game. However, while I do love me some Commander Shepard I also can't get enough of Garrus, Ashley, or Wrex, to name a few.As I said before, TW2 is very realistic. The dialogue feels more down-to-earth than ME3, which helps make many of the characters. including Geralt, relatable and believable. Don't get me wrong, I felt the writing in all the ME games have been top-notch. All I'm saying is you'll be hard-pressed to not like the dialogue hereSOUND:I like the soundtrack of TW2, but it's nothing like an Uematsu album or Clint Mansell's work. The music here is still great, though. It really complements the medieval environment.REPLAYABILITY:Looking at single-player alone, TW2 blows ME3 away here. I did every quest you can possibly do in ME3 on my first play through, and I beat the game in 33 hours. When I put in just over 20 hours into TW2, I was a little over halfway through the plot. Couple that with the fact that sixteen different endings will warrant at least a second playthrough, and you've got plenty of reassurance your money is well-spent.A word of caution: this game is NOT for kids. This game is extremely realistic, so imagine what a conversation among a group of fraternity brothers looks like or remember the violence in a standard Mel Gibson movie to get a mental picture. Even without those things, the story is too complex for younger gamers to understand and appreciate.So there you have it. You are at a serious loss if you don't pick this up, especially if you like RPGs. I know this review was long, so I appreciate you taking the time to read it.*****UPDATE*****So after beating TW2 in 33 hours (oddly enough just like ME3) on my first play through, it seems I overestimated the game's timeline. The game follows three chapters. Chapters 1 and 2 will take 10-15+ hours each to complete depending on your play style, and chapter three, even if all side quests there are done, typically takes only about 3 hours to complete.As far as the ending, I was satisfied with what I got. I felt the events leading up to the ending were very abrupt, but considering I need to play through again and make some different choices to access parts of the world I didn't before (because of my choices on my first play through), I am more than eager to throw in another 30 or so hours into this deeply satisfying RPG.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2012"}

The nicest feature to it, are the courses, because they did not try to recreate the same old courses in the SNES and N64 versions of the game. They took ideas and concepts from Super Mario 2 and made courses from them, such as Shy Guy Ship. The old favorite courses are still in it though, like Bowser's castle and the Haunted House. The backgrounds are intensely detailed, but if you take too long to look at the scenery you might spin out, crash or lose the race.

You've just encountered your former commander, who basically used you to kill innocent people.  Your response?  You blow his ship to Kingdom Come, and crash land on a very inhospitable planet.  Your best friend is almost killed and has to be forged with advanced robotics.  Your new objective is to find and protect the very man whose life you just tried to eradicate.  Between you and him stand hordes of baddies wanting to do bad things to you.  But it's okay, because you have a lot of f****** weapons.The story to BULLETSTORM is as simple as you can get; the voice-acting is terrible, the dialogue is atrocious, and nothing makes any sense at all.  It's just the way you want it in an action game.  What you're probably looking for are graphics (remarkable), weaponry (so-so), action (lots of it, but kind of repetitive), and length (short).  If you take all of that in, you know what you're getting with BULLETSTORM--a middle-of-the-road First Person Shooter that offers nothing much new (the electric whip is cool, but BIOSHOCK beat them to it, and with a much better storyline and longer game play).  It'll satisfy for a few hours, but I recommend renting this one.  I didn't try the multiplayer (I don't do it; hate me if you want), but the repeated playing potential of this game just wasn't there for me.  It's initially interesting trying to kill baddies in different ways, but it gets old after a bit, and to be brutally honest, this storyline just isn't engaging enough to want to come back to.  Maybe when the price drops, as it eventually will, the game will be worth acquiring permanently; as it stands, BULLETSTORM is worthwhile to FPS enthusiasts, or those of you who want to spend a few hours (took me about eight, but I'm a terrible gamer and play ridiculously slow) blowing sizable holes in various lifeforms.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

It successfully combines two different genres the RPG and the puzzle game. While all of this is well and good and playing the game 2P is quite enjoyable the aspect that troubles me is the progressively more aggressive AI we're finding in these games. While I enjoy a challenge in a game this game unfairly gives the AI advantages that are certainly not \"luck\". After creating a statistical analysis of seemingly random \"drops\" after eliminating pieces I've discovered the computer is given an advantage 73% of the time while the player a mere 32%. These advantages are based on either 3+ skulls falling causing further damage or 4+ chain thus leading to another turn (or any other advantages yourself or your opponent has). While others may find it funny that I compiled this information, this type of programming from game programmers in fact malevolent and should be seen as aggressively trying to overthrow humanity.

Many cheap games available for download, including 3d and The Netflix app is free, so I use it all the time at home.The 3D really works, but you have to keep the portable somewhat steady to keep it from unfocusing, and one thing: The depth and quality of the 3d depends on the game, since they vary greatly. One game will barely make use of 3d, while others blow your butt out of the water. Two great cheap games are Cubic Ninja and the downloadable Kirby's Adventure, which is a remake of the NES title.I wish they make movies availabe in 3d in the future, for a decent price, since I'm not gonna rent a 5.99 movie, ever.

{"product_name":"B00320JDWG","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"Interesting idea marred by mediocre gameplay","reviewText":"Taking inspiration from Joseph Conrad's \"Heart Of Darkness\", Spec Ops: The Line mixes some great voice acting, compelling storytelling, and cool characters with some extremely middle-of-the-road graphics and gameplay.  As I powered through the campaign I found myself hurriedly trying to finish the chore of gameplay so I could advance the story and hear some of the characters flesh out the plot.  By the end I felt satisfied in the experience, but knew I would never return to this game again.The best aspect of this game is to pull in the player with its knack for style and atmosphere.  Most of the cut scenes are very intriguing, and if anything would make smart gamers want to go and read Conrad's \"Heart Of Darkness\" to figure out what the characters are going through.  The main character of Walker is voiced by the Michael Jordan of video game voice actors, Nolan North.  He's done voices for dozens of games in his career, but is best known for voicing Drake in the Uncharted series.  As one who has played all three Uncharted games, I have become used to his dashing, charming, and humorous asides, so to hear him becoming unravelled, swearing, and questioning his motives in The Line is very cool to hear.  There's some fantastically trippy scenes in the game where Walker (North's character) is hallucinating and seeing things that give it that much more weight by the great vocal performance.  Also, there is a memorable scene where Walker stumbles upon a village of civilian casualties that messes with his mind and doesn't skimp in showing us the horror he sees and the pain he's feeling.  This game is pretty brutal, and it's all the more engrossing for it.  The way Walker interacts with the massive brutality and violence around him is what keeps this game afloat, and is the heart and soul of the story.  North gives this game a ton of authenticity, and he deserves to mentioned.The array of weapons is impressive in The Line, and I never felt like I was at a loss to find and use whatever weapons I wanted to test out.  As a player of many war-styled games before this one, it was a nice surprise to see the variety in guns.Unfortunately, the gameplay is ho-hum, bog-standard warfare that we've seen a million times already: take cover, shoot the dumb AI enemy, throw a grenade, yell at your comrades, get yelled at yourself, rush to the checkpoint, then do it all over again.  All of this goes on in the midst of some pretty lazy graphics and clunky controls.  For instance, you have to push the same button to cover, rise from cover, and to switch cover.  Sometimes the game just can't tell what you're trying to do, and there were several times I got killed trying to take cover, but the gameplay lag had me just stand out in the open until I was shot to death.  The death meter is exactly the same as all war games are nowadays: the screen gets red when you're shot, then you take cover until it goes away.  So old, so unoriginal, and very short on ideas.  The Line also employs the use of squad based combat but it just turns out to be a nuisance like it so often is in video games.  You can yell out to your squad mates to shoot a certain target, but doing so will cause you to stand up out of cover and then not return to cover unless controlled to do so.  What, an army captain can't yell and squat at the same time?  I found myself just taking out everyone by my lonesome since my squad mates were pretty lousy shots anyway.  Which leads me to the next annoyance: constant reviving of my team mates.  When is this going to go away in video games?  CGI controlled squad mates are basically only there for me to go revive them when their ineptitude gets them killed time and time again.  It has always felt like a chore to revive a dopey computer controlled character, and it always takes me out of the action.  Please, game companies, stop doing this!  The level staging is also flat out lazy and uninspired, and I found myself cursing at the screen whenever I couldn't do something or kill something that should have been possible but was rendered impossible due to bad design.I feel that there is more to complain about here than there is to praise, but in the end I felt like the mere effort to offer an engrossing story makes this game worth playing.  Right when I felt like giving up, I'd reach the next chapter and get sucked in to the story again.  The campaign is short, about six hours or so, making this game a decent rental or $20 purchase.  The voice acting and dark plot give it a movie-type feel that works well in the stark landscape of the Dubai desert.  However, the gameplay will test the patience of any seasoned gamer used to playing war games.  War games aren't my favorite genre, and The Line certainly hasn't changed my mind about that, but the game does make me wonder why so many other war games are unable to tell a great story amidst top notch graphics and gameplay.  Here's hoping this game will inspire developers to do so.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2012"}

The list can go on,now you may be wondering why I called this a good Final Fantasy and not something more extravagant,well I'll go into that a bit later,for now lets focus on a few other things.Graphics: The first thing you'll notice as soon as you get past the nice CG opening is that this FF has been brought into full 3D,this is a huge step up from the 8-bit NES graphics of the early '90s. I did notice some slowdown on a few places on the world map,I doubt its because FF3 pushes the DS,but rather its a fault on Square Enixs side. The graphics will look dated when you compare it to FF4,but for a DS game it holds up nicely.Your probably thinking,\"I can't find a single English copy of FF3 for the NES,why is that?\" -Final Fantasy 3 was never brought to NA in the '90s,the NDS remake is FF3's first appearance in NA. (Although you can now get a fully translated FF3 on the Wii)Gameplay:Gameplay wise this is classic FF style,gone is the ATB,now its just real turn based combat,your characters attack according to who has the better stats,your characters can also be superseded by monsters with better stats. Think of this battle system like FF10's and its not to far from the mark,although if your equipment is lacking or your not in the right job,the bosses will mop the floor with you. A good idea at the start of the game would be to make everyone a Red Mage,and then branch out from there once magic less of a concern.One thing Square Enix did with FF3 was balance out the Job system,in the old version,all jobs except the 2 special once became useless near the end of the game,SE fixed this by making jobs much stronger then they once were. Nice touch if you like a particular job.Story:This is why FF3 is only a 'good' FF,the story is somewhat primitive in the character department and reverts back to FF1 in that sense (FF2 had way more character development and a better story all around),SE did add character names and unique looks for each character as well as some back story to each one,but it just doesn't help much,FF3 feels very FF1-ish with different map layout and monsters.Don't let that shy you away from this game though,it was only my opinion and I'm more of a guy who likes a game with great story (as well as lots of dialogue :D) so I'm a bit biased towards games with little story. Overall this game is cheap to buy now,so give it a try! (Tip:If you think this FF is going to be to hard,if you played FF4 DS and made it 20+hours or beat it,this game will seem like a cake walk,guaranteed!)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2010"}

So, if you want more of a challenge, try not to kill everything too much.There are plenty of quests to undertake for those who love side quests and their rewards. For those who just want to dive into the story, completing these quests is not required. Oh, and I should mention that you can save your game anywhere/anytime you want!Story:I won't give any details away, but let me just say that this game handles suspense very well. If you are an RPG fan, you will walk away pleasantly surprised. There are a couple small anime cliches at work here, but the british voice talents leant to the game, as well as the impressive script/storyline are more than enough to make you forget about these things.Graphics:Don't believe people when they say this game has awful graphics. It's for the Wii, so it should be common knowledge that it isn't going to be an HD game. Sure, that doesn't mean it's on par with the 360/PS3, but the draw distance in this game is incredible, and the graphics are very impressive considering the Wii's hardware. Plus, load times consist of just a few seconds at most.Sound:As I mentioned earlier, the british voice talents in this game are excellent. Sound effects are nice and crisp and work well within the actions of the game. For the most part music is either pleasant or catchy. I only found a couple places in the game that honestly had annoying music.Overall:I can remember the day when JRPG's were king. Since then the market has obviously gone stale, with the same formula being reused over and over again. Xenoblade Chronicles doesn't completely change everything that wasn't selling, but let's just say it changes up 96% of it. The game isn't perfect, but if you are an avid RPG fan looking for something that can literally entertain you for hours and hours, then this game is for you.Here are a couple things I did not like about the game:-Inventory system is a little clunky, especially when you are comparing potentially new gear to already equipped gear. The difference in stats can literally require some math on your part since the game doesn't have a way of factoring in modifications you've made to existing gear vs. gear that might be better if you were to equip it and apply the same modifications...-Targetting system isn't as refined as it could have been. Some people might experience zero issues, but I know that occasionally when I moved to assist an ally being attacked the game would target enemies way off in the distance that aren't even involved in the battle. This all happens despite my would-be target standing right smack in the middle of the screen. For the most part, the targetting system works, but when you need it to work fast that's when it decides to target everything but what you need it to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2012"}

The Civ series has to be one of my personal favorites, right up there with Pirates.  Sid's team does a good job of making sure game play comes first.Each version in this series has done an excellent job of redefining itself while retaining what works and trimming what doesn't.  Graphics have improved in each version and new features added, while keeping the same game play and feel.Bruce's review below does an excellent job of pointing out all of the changes and new features in this version, but I cannot stress enough how Civ IV fixes most if not all of the micromanagement issues introduced in Civ III.  I believe they retained the Governor feature that managed a given city for you in this version, but I have yet to need this feature which was a staple in the previous version.  In fact, I couldn't play CIV III without this feature enabled.One other new feature that I'd like to touch on is that of Religion.  The developers did a wonderful job of making Religion matter without having it be a political issue.  Each religion is identical in what it grants players; however the diplomatic aspects of religion can play a big part in a given game.  It's a very nice touch.  The computer's AI and diplomacy is also far superior to previous versions and it makes single play so much more enjoyable.  Civ III often turned into me against the 10 computer foes.  Everyone seemed to always be angry at you and demandanding tribute from you.  Religion helps keeps your brothers and sisters of the faith happier toward you and I've had a computer ally in almost every game played to date.Patch Patch Patch!I will say that if you purchase this game or had purchased it and found it to be slow or crashing, Get the latest patch.  On my 3.2 GHZ machine, I often experienced crashes while viewing the planet as a whole and certainly had to deal with the slowness issues many reviews have mentioned.  Since installing the 1.6 patch, the game plays fabulously!  It even exits to the desktop in a matter of 4-5 seconds now.  This used to take what seemed like minutes before the patch.A great game that you'll enjoy especially if your looking for the elusive \"Turn Based Strategy Game\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2006"}

Though I still have some of the same issues that I did with it in the beginning, my opinion has greatly changed after I returned to the game and went on to finish it, logging over 100 hours of play.Here's to an amazing, challenging, unique game to the portable final fantasy franchise. Its a must own for FF and DS rpg fans.You can read more about the \"flaws\" or rather the things that other reviewers found problematic at length in other reviews, especially those that are 3 stars or below, but I will briefly go over them... the number one issue is the 15 item limit... Each character is allowed 15 items, which wouldn't be so bad if the 15 items didn't include your spells, weapon, armor, and equipable accessory, so really, it is an 11 item limit after your equipped items, and that 11 includes the spells you choose to equip and any extra you want to carry with you. That alone constitutes over half of the items you can carry. This is a strategic element and you must choose wisely and become adept at spell and item management together, and as you continue to play the game you become more accustomed to it and appreciate the challenge. Still, when you're only working with one or two characters at certain points in the game as opposed to three or four when you can spread it out with more ease, it can be annoying. Final word on that, though, I respected the added twist once I got used to it.You can store items at local shops that will hold on to extra stuff for you. Again, it's less of an issue as you get used to tightly budgeting what items you take with you... the biggest pain is when you are on a longer mission and you run out of room to collect new items from treasure or win a new item from a battle that you would like to keep. As far as battle items won, when you are full, there is no option to swap out and discard an existing item for the new one. So, you have to be  well aware when you reach your maximum. You have 6 slots to fill with spells available for battle (although you can hold more and change your \"active\" spells).It should be noted that only purchased spells fill up item carrying space - that is, you have other spells at your disposal depending on the \"crown\" you are wearing (equivalent to a profession, and you acquire more crowns as the story progresses and you defeat bosses, as well as other crowns for accomplishing optional challenges). With the gems that you acquire from battle, you can upgrade your crowns which adds additional spells to your disposal when wearing that crown, which, again, those spells are not added to your 15 item limit. Gems can also upgrade equipment such as weapons, armor and shields, and be sold for currency (gil) in order to purchase items, spells, equipment, etc.There is a wifi multi player game option. Game battle, enemies, spells, weapons, armor etc. are also based on the elements of air, water, fire, earth, light, and dark. There are many accessories which block certain elements or statuses in battle such as paralysis, etc., upgrade certain statistics such as attack defense, magic attack, magic defense, intelligence, strength, etc.Battle is based on HP - Hit Points, and also partially based on \"AP\" level (an acronym for \"Attack Points\")... Your AP level acts as both your spell and attack points, and you have a max of 5 AP. Stronger spells cost more AP, and you regenerate AP each turn. You can also use the item \"Ether\" - This regenerates your AP more quickly. A weapon attack takes only one AP point, whereas spells vary depending on their power. Sometimes you get caught in a bind where you have a character that has run out of AP during battle, in which you must choose the \"Boost\" command, which also doubles as defend, and allows you to regenerate AP.The world map kind of stinks... it offers little help, as it is too general and small and often slightly inaccurate as to your exact location. You only start with a partial world map.Overall, this is an 8 or 8.5. I rally enjoyed it despite some initial disappointment.If you're going to include a world map you can access, make it something that marks towns, caves, etc., and isn't tiny. The world map in this game shows your location on this tiny image and doesn't indicate anything else useful. Plus, one of my favorite things about RPG's are maps. When a games map or mapping system stinks, it can almost ruin the game for me (although not that bad in this case).All in all, the game deserves a better review than my original one, so that's what I decided to do. This game is worth buying for any turn based RPG fan, Final Fantasy fan, and DS RPG'er. A lot of fun overall.PS the comments below are based on my original review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HIC8","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A Solid Beginning For a Solid MMO...","reviewText":"When it comes to MMOs it is tough to judge how long it might last, or what the future might bring.  Because of this is RIFT worth my money?  Or is it one in many passing MMOs?** AT FIRST GLANCE **What impressed me about RIFT the moment I installed the game is just how polished the product is.  From installation, account activation to overall performance of the game client and servers... RIFT really made my jaw drop.  It is rare to see a MMO launch in such a polished state and Trion Worlds nailed it perfectly!  There is a polish about this game that you can feel.  Menus, skill trees, graphical options, server stability(ping), very stable gameplay when in mass crowds.  RIFT handles exceptionally well bringing a few unique aspects to the MMO genre while sharing aspects of other games; bringing us to GAMEPLAY** GAMEPLAY **RIFT handles like a typical fantasy MMO.  Pick a faction, pick a class, pick a race.  Customize and off you go! If you played any fantasy MMO before then you should feel right at home with the setup.  Soon into the game you will notice elements of WoW, Warhammer: Online, even a little Lord of the Rings Online.  Your character has the ability to learn 3 \"souls\" which act like classes.  For example as a MAGE you might run with Necromancer / Warlock / Elementalist.  Pick 1 tree as a main, the other 2 become supporting souls.  Like any MMO once you get your class it becomes \"THE GRIND\"; taking quests to gain experience and items.  Spend your skill points, run dungeons etc.  Does RIFT bring anything new to the Genre?  YES!- RIFTS:  This aspect of the game is designed for public questing.  This was seen in Warhammer: Online, but in RIFT it is more of a random event.  While questing on the world map rifts will randomly appear / open.  Mobs will spawn (invaders) and begin attacking your questing hubs!  To prevent invaders from spawning you need to close rifts which consists of stages requiring certain triggers (kill the boss or perhaps kill 10 *insert rift mob*)  RIFTing is addictive!  Very addictive.  Ontop of a \"world event\" random Invasions can be triggered which spawn tons of rifts on the map. Satisfy the requirements to seal the invasion and a world \"elite\" will spawn.  Based on how many stages you complete, types of invaders you kill etc you get \"currency\".  Using this world currency you can buy high quality gear, skills, items to enhance your stats etc.And well... that's about it.  There isn't much to bring to the MMO table anymore even with today's technology.  Is that a bad thing however? NO!  What RIFT does bring to the table are aspects of various MMOs that have been very successful, and polished exceptionally well.** DESIGN **SOUND EFFECTS: Top of the line I feel.  Weapons, spells, rifts, environment noises and mobs... it is all pretty high quality.  The music is very nice and sets the tone for battles.  Cut-scene dialogue is handled well.GRAPHICS: I have a 1GB 4850 video card so I stick to the Medium settings.  The game handles well (30-55FPS depending on  # of players on screen) and even with medium graphics the game looks very beautiful.  I've seen footage at 1080p from friends who have SLI rigs and the graphics are mind blowing!  The level of detail at higher settings is very nice and if you got a powerful PC this game will look amazing.** PROS / CONS **+ Public Groups: handled exceptionally well with just a simple click of the \"pub group\" button.  Makes Rifts/invasions easy to drop in and out+ Questing: Quests are well thought out with very little travel distance required.  The game will also give you quests to guide you to the next questing spot+ Class System: Very diverse with tons of combinations per master class (warrior, rogue, mage, cleric). Each master class has 8 Souls and each character can buy up to 3 additional \"role\" slots for additional custom builds+ UI: well thought out with the ability to customize it in the main option menu (similar to LoTRO and Guild Wars)- Besides the Rift/Invasion setup, we've seen all this before- Class System can sometimes create \"bad\" combinations that don't mesh well at all until higher levels (not a good combination for new toons)(Neutral) Server structure: PvP or PvE servers.  Nice to have an option!** OVERALL **Is RIFT worth my money or not?  In my opinion YES.  It is rare that an MMO comes along with this level of polish, and does so many things right.  For having just gotten started, RIFT is throwing some serious punches and easily could stand side by side with the juggernaut WoW.  While MMOs are often works in progress; in its current state RIFT gets 5 stars.  For someone new to MMOs this makes a great game to dedicate yourself to as hopefully many good years are to come.  For the \"experienced\" MMO player this game might make a nice change of pace from the other MMOs out there.  With its combination of WoW, Lord of the Rings Online, Warhammer: Online, and Guild Wars done so flawlessly how can you not go wrong!Kudos to Trion Worlds for proving in this day and age, you can launch an MMO in a state that is playable and enjoyable!**NOTE: I recommend getting the Collectors Edition for the bonus perks you get.  You can either shell out $60+ for a physical copy and get various extras like a USB stick, poster, etc; OR you can simply buy a regular edition and spend $10 digitally to upgrade your account.  Upgrading your account gives you a 60% speed mount; upgrades your starting bag(24 slots) and gives you a nifty summon pet.**NOTE: While the game is $14.99/mo  $12.99/mo(3mo plan)  $10.99/mo(6mo plan)  you can pay and activate an account via credit card or PayPal.  A credit card is not a requirement (however your paypal account must be linked to a form of direct billing)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2011"}

I'd rather have a remake of a superb, 13 year old game (like N64's \"Goldeneye\"), than a new and original but lousy one. This has been done a few times before with great results: PS1's \"Resident Evil\" was remade (from scratch) for the Gamecube in 2002, PS1's \"Metal Gear Solid\" was remade (from scratch) for the Gamecube in 2004 (under the name \"Twin Snakes\"), and PS1's \"Silent Hill\" was remade (from scratch) for the Wii in 2009 (under the name \"Shattered Memories\"). This remake of \"Goldeneye\" is just as good as those. However, this is more than just a remake of N64's \"Goldeneye\" from 1997. This is like \"Goldeneye\" + \"all the other cool stuff from the James Bond-franchise\" thrown together in the mix and shaken (not stirred). Classic guns (including the golden one) and characters from past Bond-movies are playable in the multiplayer mode. These characters include:-Jaws (That big scary 7'2'' tall guy with metal teeth played by Richard Kiel in \"The Spy Who Loved Me\" (1977) and \"Moonraker\" (1979))-Francisco Scaramanga (Played by Christopher Lee in The Man with the Golden Gun (1974))-Oddjob (The Hawaiian guy with the lethal hat played by Harold Sakata in Goldfinger (1964))-Ernst Stavro Blofeld (This is the Blofeld played by Charles Gray in Diamonds Are Forever (1971). Not the Blofeld played by Donald Pleasence or Telly Savalas)-Baron Samedi (That scary voodoo-guy with the peculiar laughter and face-paint played by Geoffrey Holder in Live and Let Die (1973))-Rosa Klebb (The dangerous little lady with the red hair and lethal shoe played by Lotte Lenya in From Russia with Love (1963))-Red Grant (That blond henchman played by Robert Shaw in From Russia with Love (1963))-Julius No (Played by Joseph Wiseman in Dr. No (1962))The multiplayer is split-screen just like old times (up to 4 players), but an 8-player online multiplayer is also available. The single player story mode pretty much follows the same story as N64's \"Goldeneye\" from 1997. The only big difference is that you will be seeing the face and hearing the voice of Daniel Craig, rather than that of Pierce Brosnan. Personally I would have preferred Brosnan. Also, the rest of the cast (except Judi Dench) has been replaced by new \"actors\". Trevelyan, Ourumov, Onatopp etc. have different faces and voices than you see in the movie. Also here I would have preferred the old cast: Famke Janssen, Sean Bean, Robbie Coltrane etc.. But this isn't enough to ruin the game. Like I insinuated earlier, this is a remake made completely from scratch. This is not the Nintendo 64-game just printed onto Wii-discs. So you will have the pleasure of seeing the best graphics around. You can play this game with almost every controller ever released by Nintendo since the release of Gamecube: The Wii Remote with Nunchuk, Wii Zapper, Classic Controller, Classic Controller Pro, and the Nintendo GameCube controller can all be used with this game. I'm a bit old fashioned, so I prefer using the Gamecube-controller. Some parts of the story in this game are actually closer to what happened in the movie than the N64-game ever was. Like in that park in St. Petersburg when the identity of Janus is revealed, this time you will actually be sitting in the helicopter when those two rockets are fired. And you'll have to find a way to escape, just like in the movie. Some changes are made regarding locations I might add. The things that in the movie happened in Monaco, are here happening in Dubai, and what usually happened on Cuba is now happening in Nigeria etc.. I think this game is perfect as it is. Would have been fun with even more than 8 classic characters in multiplayer though. I am missing the likes of Auric Goldfinger, and I wouldn't mind having seen some of the newer characters like Jinx from Die Another Day (2002) and Solange from Casino Royale (2006) if you know what I mean :-). This game also lacks some of the humour that made the original so great. The AK-47 is among the weaponry here (wouldn't be Goldeneye without one) along with MP5 and SPAS 12, but nearly all the weapons have fictional names. Another thing that would improve this game: The original N64-game hidden somewhere like an easter-egg (just like \"Maniac Mansion\" was hidden in \"Day of the Tentacle\", and the original \"Donkey Kong\" was hidden in \"Donkey Kong 64\"). For example, in a video game arcade cabinet standing somewhere in that nightclub in Barcelona. I would even say this is the game of this decade (the 00s) I have been looking forward to the most, and for good reason. Oh, and unless you have been living under a rock the last 13 years, you know this is a first-person-shooter.P.S. Is it just me or did they stop making games like \"Goldeneye\"(N64) and \"Ocarina of Time\"(N64)? Miss those times....","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2010"}

With the huge success of titles such as Medal of Honor, Wolfenstein and Battlefield 1942, one more game saw fit to see its way into the competition - Call of Duty!  If you'd like to know how Call of Duty plays, I have a quick question: Did you play Medal of Honor Allied Assault?  If so, the same team of developers worked on Call of Duty so you may notice a striking resemblance in gameplay.  Multiplayer is very similar with most servers dominated by single death objective matches so if you have a low attention span and don't like waiting for a game to end after your early death, I'd recommend a game like Wolfenstein instead where respawning is a normal routine in multiplayer.  As usual, in order to play on the best maps, you'll need a high speed connection such as DSL or cable.  If you're only purchasing Call of Duty for the singleplayer campaign, don't fret because the campaign is loads of fun and truly impressed me with some of the script sequences planned out for my virtual platoon buddies.  Unlike Medal of Honor, you arrive via parachute (instead of storming the beaches) and combat centers around your platoon most of the game so there's always plenty of lieutenants barking orders and fellow privates forgetting to duck. Unfortunately, while the singleplayer campaign is fun, it's pretty short.  It's not as long as other campaigns in games such as Medal of Honor and Half-Life.  If you can't play online, my advice would be to wait for the price to drop because the singleplayer campaign will be over before you know it leaving you with nothing else to do.  Overall, I enjoyed Call of Duty.  I'm a WWII buff and a fan of PC first-person shooters, so this game was right up my alley but it probably didn't entertain me as long as other shooters.  It has nothing to do with the game, it's a terrific product that I would recommend to any gamer, but because I played Medal of Honor and all its many expansions as well as other recent WWII shooters, Call of Duty really didn't bring anything new to the table.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2004"}
{"product_name":"B001C4DKG4","reviewerName":"phoongdan","summary":"The glitches are fixed now, but it still ain't that great...","reviewText":"Like many other reviewers have said, I too am a fan of SOCOM 3 and Combined Assault which they made for the PS2. I too would rather play the campaign mode in single player, with an occasional stroll onto online play. It is difficult to understand why Slant Six would take this successful franchise (and one of my personal favorites) and make it an online mode only. I think the obvious answer is that they knew they could cash in quick and make some huge profits. Some companies don't care about their reputation or where they will be 10 years from now. They get in, make a bundle of money, get out, and then resurface a few months later under a different company name.The graphics are not terrible but they aren't anything special either. Certainly not what you would expect for a PS3 game. In fact I think the graphics on Combined Assault were probably better. The online play is about what you would expect - sometimes fun if you get into a good game, but an equal number of times there's a bunch of dingleberrys on there ruining your gaming experience. However, I haven't had any connectivity issues or getting booted out of games like I've heard other people mention. And the game has been out for going on 2 years now, and there are still many, many people playing online.I like the interface of the game and I like how you can customize your two players. You get a \"commando\" and a \"mercenary.\" If they would have made the in-game graphics as good as the interface graphics, that would have been awesome! Also, where's the SOCOM music? The main theme song for both SOCOM 3 and Combined Assault were fantastic! Some of the best gaming theme songs out there. This game has none. Another disappointment. Though the music at the lobby screen is pretty cool, but no music during gameplay.I think your enjoyment of this game will hinge on how good you become at online play. I've been playing it for about a week+, and plan to keep on playing it for now, but there are a lot of skilled players online and it takes a lot of play hours I think to learn the maps, where the best sniping spots are, where is a good place to hide, etc. And there are always gonna be fools ruining the online gaming experience. One thing I dislike the most about the online play isn't that people like to act like fools on there, or talk curse too much, it's that if you aren't \"running & gunning\" people will sometimes try to vote you out of the game. There is no strategy involved; you can't hide or use stealth, which is what I normally like to do when I play in a campaign mode. The matches are usually over in a matter of a few minutes. And you can be voted out even if you aren't doing anything wrong. If you play in a game where there is a clan, they may decide to get together and just vote you out. Maybe because you are good at killing them, or they don't like your weapon of choice (I prefer the shotgun). This has happened to me twice in a week already! The online play doesn't really match my style of play, but if you are a \"run & gun\" type, you might enjoy it more. Let's hope, however, that SOCOM 4 which is due out in fall is a much better game with a well-developed campaign mode.Final Grade: C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B006JKAS16","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"I may need a thesaurus for this one...","reviewText":"I feel the need to preface this review by making two important points: 1) This review is for Jak 3 only (I didn't play the other two). 2) I didn't finish the game. This review is geared towards the people that are thinking about playing the Jak series for the first time. I chose to only play the third installment because I heard the first one was much too easy, and the second one was much too hard. Supposedly, Jak 3 was the perfect mixture of the two...Ever had to explain something, but you couldn't find the appropriate words? That's kinda where I'm at now. How many different words can I use to describe how bad that video-game experience was? Well, we're about to find out. Honestly, I don't really have the words to describe how God awful this game was. Saying it's an abysmal game isn't strong enough. Referring to it as an abomination of a video-game is an insult to other terrible games around the globe. Jak 3 is so bad that I actually considered faking my own death just so I wouldn't have to play it anymore. In fact, this game is so deplorable that I'm going to go out and buy another copy, return home, and throw them BOTH in the trash. At one point, things got so bad that I found myself at a crossroads. Either I turn off my PS3, and go to bed; or I take my controller, locate an empty space on my wall, then throw the controller at said empty space on the wall as hard as I possibly can and hope to God that the controller ricochets off the wall and knocks me unconscious. Now that we've determined it's an awful game, let's discuss why I thought it was so awful.I've been gaming for more than 20 years, and this is the first game where I died several times during the training session. Most action/adventure type games start you off with some type of tutorial, and it's usually harmless (well, not this time). It was in an arena type setting where I had to kill about 30 enemies, and I kept dying over and over. Thirteen hours of gameplay later, I wish I would have stopped there because that was a sign of things to come. Many reviewers have been criticized for complaining about the number of races in the game, and I hope to shed a little light on this. I only made it to the 56% completion mark, and I only experienced two races. However, there are a crap load of 'one man races'. By this, I mean you'll be racing against the clock, or being chased by missiles, or forced to drive through a freaking tube that's littered with potholes and other nonsense, or having to actually ride on top of a runaway missile and guide it to various checkpoints, or having to ride this impossible to navigate surf board from point A to point B. I'll stop now, I think you get the picture.Another area of concern for me was the combat. This is the first game I've ever played that didn't incorporate an aim button during gun-play. Everything was hip-fire, and that doesn't work when you have enemies coming at you from the ground AND the air. I think they tried to copy Ratchet & Clank in regards to some of the weapons, but they forgot to copy the aim button functionality...It's not uncommon for a game to have a couple of frustrating areas -- hey, it happens. When I got past the first frustrating area in Jak 3, I was relieved. I was thinking to myself, now that I got past that frustrating mission, I can move on to the next mission and have some fun! Nope. Just about every mission is frustrating, and they come back to back to back. While playing, I found myself hoping that the next mission would be a tad bit more forgiving than the previous one. That's no way to play a game and enjoy yourself. It's not that Jak 3 is hard, it's one of those games that pretty much guarantees you're going to die at least three times before completing a mission. In some cases, you have to start it over from scratch (actually, in most cases).I should have stopped playing this game days ago. But, I let my ego get in the way. I wanted to prove that I could finish a game that I hated to it's very core. When it's all said and done, it's not worth it. Jak 3 made me miserable and turned me into a person that was starting to hate video-games in general. Now, I don't want to be completely negative, so I did find ONE thing I liked about the game. Although his missions are annoying, I really enjoyed Daxter. In fact, Daxter deserves better than that game. I think he and Clank should trade places, Clank deserves to be in a horrible game. Ratchet & Dax, I like it!!! God of War II, you're up next!!! Thank Gaaaaaawd I'm done with this piece of shi... nevermind...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00007F8PB","reviewerName":"A. Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"A great hack-n-slash dungeon crawl for the Xbox","reviewText":"Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance has already been released for the PS2 months earlier, but this doesn't mean that the newly, ported version to the Xbox video game console should be ignored. Developer Snowblind Studios has seemlessly ported the PS2 version over to the Xbox and, using the Xbox's higher graphical processing power, made the game look even better. But graphics alone doesn't make a great a fun and great time for a gamer. This Xbox port also includes the great gameplay of the original PS2 version. The intuitive and easy-to-use control scheme remains intact.Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance still allows a player to choose between three different types of player characters. One can either choose to be a dwarf warrior, a human ranger, or an elfin sorceress. Each type of character has their own advantages and disadvantages and all three could be used to go through the game and finish it. Though I learned after doing so that the best class to pick would be the elfin sorceress. Her high level of magic spells available to her in addition to being able to have some success using a melee weapon makes her slightly better overall. And for the prurient minded gamers out there, the elfin sorceress could be seen in all her near-nakedness glory in the menu-system.The 3/4 top down viewpoint of the fight makes it easy for th eplayer not to be surprised by enemies and traps as he goes from one dungeon, cave system and, at time, overland area to the next. Similar to Blizzard's Diablo, BG:DA is pretty much the same game as that hack and slash, but using the 3rd edition rules of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons and its world of the Forgotten Realms. The city of Baldur's Gate and the surrounding region of the Sword Coast are done beautifully by the Snowblind developers. From the deep, underground mine tunnel complexes of the dwarves to the festering, swamp area of Chelimber.The enemies are designed well and pretty much follows the description of the creatures in the many Forgotten Realms game books and novels. Whether its Umber Hulks, beholders, giants, displacer beasts, etc...the developers did their job well in bringing these varied and dangerous creatures of Faerun to life in BG:DA. Even the many different races introduced and used in the game follows their description in the FR books and guides. The dwarves speak with a heavy Scottish brogue, while elves, both high and dark speak in a high and might English-manner. The voice-acting in this game is also top-notch and I would say some of the best video game VA ever. There's not a false note with any of the spoken dialogue and that just makes the game much more immersive.Overall, Interplay and Snowblind Studios' Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance is a great looking and very fun game to play. It's not as deep and rich as the straight-up rpg that the PC games int he series were well-known for. What Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance does bring is the themes and storytelling of the PC games but in a much more simple, hack and slash dungeon-crawl a la Diablo and Dungeon Siege. For those with an Xbox, but not a PS2 then I suggest they go out and get this game. They won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-21-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00007F8PB","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Campy Fun in a Starter RPG","reviewText":"Baldur's Gate is a hugely popular RPG series for the PC. With Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance, console gamers get a taste for what makes this game so much fun.First, remember that this is a console port of a very rich PC game. That means that instead of having lots of choices of male/female or human/elf/dwarf or fighter/thief/mage/cleric, you have three. You can be a male archer, a dwarf fighter, or a female sorceress.The graphics are really quite good. There are numerous pools of water for you to run around in, to watch the ripples and wakes shimmer and merge. The lighting is lovely, the detail in the buildings and towns and dungeons look great on even large TVs. The sound is good too, and sitting in your living room with friends while the stereo sound surrounds you is tons of fun.You can play single player or two-person cooperative, which makes couch-play even more fun. With a large bowl of popcorn and your favorite drinks, you can hack and slash your way through numerous hours or a weekend of play.Now, the down side. Again, console port. Really, you're playing Gauntlet. You run around hacking up barrels and crates in your friend's cellar. Is this exactly the nicest thing to do? You hack at rats and enemies, look for things in barrels. Yes, you get into lever-pulling and puzzles. But in the end the game is pretty linear and the monsters don't regenerate. So whatever level you're at when you get to a certain point, you can't build yourself up more strongly.This can get to be a real pain when you hit a strong boss. You can't go buy more gear, because there's no way to make more money. You can't get stronger or more skillful, because there's nobody else to kill \"behind you\" and you can't go \"ahead\" until you kill the boss. So you're doomed to keep trying to hack at him until you get past him ... somehow.Another big complaint I have is that the gamemakers seem obsessed with the female form. The guys in the game are all pudgy and uninteresting. But the girls! The first woman you meet, the bartender, has jiggly, wiggly breasts and she shakes them around non-stop during her long, long discussions with you. Everyone I showed the game to was mesmerized by them.And playing the female sorceress character, I found that no matter how hard I tried, I could NOT get her clothed well. Every outfit involved a cut-off top, skimpy leather boots and not much else. Ahem, she's going into a deep, dark dungeon to face dire enemies? And she's doing this in beach-wear??Still, the game was campy fun, and definitely draws you in. A fun weekend-play game for real RPGers, and an easy way for those new to the genre to learn what it's about and to get a taste for the fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2003"}

It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force.When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader&#x2019;s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival.

Mostly the cutscenes which are of brilliant quality. During a menu screen there is a close up of Nariko's face and she's just looking around and it's one of the best graphic representations of a face I've ever seen in a video game. You can see emotion and life in her expression. Speaking of Nariko she's incredibly beautiful and I never got tired of looking at her and her sexy outfit.The voice acting is excellent but a little over-the-top sometimes. I still think Uncharted: Drakes Fortune has the absolute best voice acting. Nariko is voiced by Anna Torv, and it's up there with the best female voice acting I've heard (by the way Anna Torv is very pretty in real life and she slightly resembles Nariko).Gameplay is great but gets repetitive, and the game is too linear. You can mash your way through the normal difficulty level if you want, but to get the most out of this game I learned the numerous combos and perfected the fighting technique, and that's what you have to do if you want to complete the game in Hell mode, which I did. I enjoyed the game a lot more the second time around during Hell Mode because it required good skills and it felt rewarding to pull off slick moves and combos. The control is precise  and the fighting system very fast-paced and entertaining. I really enjoyed the Sixaxis controls too, once you get the hang of it, it's great and adds nice variety to the gameplay. During some battle scenes there are hundreds of soldiers on screen at the same time and there's not a hint of slowdown.  It's amazing and it shows the talent of the game developers and the power of the PS3.So it does have some flaws: repetitive, linear, short, the bosses have some cheap moves, the characters are a little over-the-top... but overall I had a really good time with Heavenly Sword.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001TD6SN0","reviewerName":"Flea Returns: FF13","summary":"I give it a 3.5","reviewText":"I used to enjoy the old school fighting games like tekken 2 and mortal kombat 1-3. I'm also a huge...HUGE final fantasy fan. So this game really caught my attention. I didn't own a PSP yet so with the announcement of the Dissidia Bundle that came with a PSP 3000...I couldn't pass it up.First the bad:Story 1.5/5Man was I disappointed. There is very little story here and what story does exist is very...very shallow. Like I said, I'm a huge fan of almost all final fantasies and the reason for that is because they have amazing stories (well...except for 12...it was trash). When I first heard about this game, I tried to not expect a whole lot. But when gamespot and IGN gave it really good reviews, my expectations rose quite a bit. Well, as far as the story goes, I was let down. Now on the other hand, this game is a quasi-fighting game. There really isn't any fighting games that have that much of a story. So in that aspect, this game has much more story than...say..soul calibur 4 did. However, the story is still very very shallow.Now the not-so-bad not-so-good:Characters 2.5/5The characters were a wash. I thought they did a great job with the characters of FF 1-6. These characters haven't had a voice or a emotable personality before and this game did really well with them I think. I was a bit disappointed that they kind of made the warrior of light from FF 1 the leader because when you have BAMF's in your party like Cloud, Cecil, Terra, and Squall...it's kind of hard for me to believe they would listen to the WOL. I understand why they did it though so it's just a small complaint. Now the characters after FF VI, Cloud, Squall, and Tidus especially were poorly portrayed as far as I'm concerned. FF fans are much more familiar with these characters' personalities and they basically just summarized their personalities and emphasized their more obvious traits with very little else added. Cloud was just a depressed, non-confident guy that couldn't make up his mind...nothing special. Squall was just a jerk that didn't really have  a personality (yet in FFVIII he didn't really have a personality there either so maybe they did a good job on him) and Tidus' lines can be summed up as \"I hate my dad\" and \"Let's go have some fun.\" The enemies were a wash too. Garland, the Emporer, Golbez, and Jecht were done very very well. Their stories really captured my interest. However, characters like Cloud of Darkness, Sephiroth, Kuja, and Exdeath were done very poorly. They could have done a lot with these characters but failed.Now the good:Graphics/Sound 4/5These are some of the best graphics I've seen for the PSP. Granted, my PSP experience is rather limited but I haven't seen anything come close to this. My only real complaint about the graphics is that a lot of the cutscenes are..well..down right amusing. Why amusing? Because a lot of the time the character is speaking and his/her mouth isn't moving...or it is moving and nothing is coming out. So the english dubbing wasn't really done very well. The sound? Amazing. The remixes of the final fantasy songs are just amazing. I loved hearing new renditions of some of the great old songs.  The only thing that could have made it better was if they had made Chaos' music the \"Hell is Bad\" song off of the southpark movie sung by James Hetfield. Kidding. Voice acting? For the most part amazing. Some characters I thought could have been done a bit better (cloud, warrior of light) but for the most part, the voice acting was spot on.Gameplay 5/5Playing this game was really great. I played this game in order of the original 10 games which probably wasn't the best idea because the WOL from FF1 has one of the harder story lines. But this game has amazing replayability and the fighting is done really well. If I were to complain about something, I thought most of the summons were useless and the camera was really really bad at times. But these small flaws don't take much away from playing the game. There was a good mix of easy matches as well as dang near impossible matches.  The RPG elements were mixed in really well I thought. The gameplay of Dissidia really shines and can be very...very addictive.All in all this game is worth a purchase. Definitely worth a rental if you are unsure. Some of the die-hard FF fans may not like it because IMO it does a bad job portraying some of the more beloved characters in the FF universe. You also need to go into this game realizing it's a FIGHTER with some RPG elements thrown in...not the other way around.  If you go in knowing the story is going to be a story in a fighting game, not an RPG, you probably won't mind the story that much. (After all, it pretty much kills any tekken, soul calibur, street fighter story out there) As long as you play it for what it is, you won't be dissappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords. A few minutes with this game may turn any  zombie gamer into a next-generation gaming system fan.--Eric  Twelker","reviewerName":"R.

Read any other review and you can get it there.  My only negative with this game (aside from the catwoman DLC, but we knew what we were getting into) was that it starts out at full force.  Right away you are into it with a full belt of gadgets and I probably put three hours in before I even figured out how to switch between them.  There is no real tutorial here.But to address some of the criticisms.\"Glitches that lose saved games\"-Haven't experienced it yet\"The Catwoman DLC should be included\" - I totally agree that it should, but it's an incentive to buy new.\"The game is misogynistic\" - It sure is.  The B word is used quite often and you'll overhear lots of conversations about how hot one woman or another is and how the criminals would want to get with them (nothing graphic is said). Honestly I feel it adds to the grittiness of the game, being stuck in a place like that.  But if you're easily offended then......\"No Manual\" - It was kind of frustrating trying to figure everything out while getting my butt kicked.  But once you get it you're set.\"It's just button mashing\" - You can play that way if you want, for sure.  But if you want to earn more points to unlock more stuff then there is definitely a strategy you can follow.\"It's just like the old one\" - Only if you count the graphics, fighting style, some gadgets (come on, how can you NOT have the batarang?, some of the ways you get Riddler trophies and the fact that it's based on Batman.  Otherwise it's so different I wasn't even sure if I liked it or not because I missed the old style of game.  Now that I got used to it I can't put it down.\"It's a short game\" - Possibly, but I've put a good two days into this already and I'm only at about 13%.  BUT, that's because I'm enjoying the open world environment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2011"}

Avoid hot plates, electric shocks and inky turrets to create your own path to the impenetrable I.N.K.T. Fortress. Just remember that the struggle to reclaim Chroma City is to be fought on your terms. Remix the city in your own image using custom paints, patterns and soundtracks. Super-size your blob to attack larger and stronger enemies. Join the Color Revolutionaries to refine your skills while making a mess. The race to rescue Chroma City has just begun, and only de Blob can save the world from a black-and-white future.Gameplay: de Blob's Primary Goalde Blobis a 3D platformer where players use the Wii Remote/Nunchuck combo to maneuver their hero, de Blob. Equal parts amorphous blob of paint, struggling artist, revolutionary and juvenile delinquent, de Blob's goal is to replace the drab, lifeless gray coloring that the I.N.K.T. Corporation has imposed on Chroma City and its inhabitants, the Raydians, with a range of vibrant life-giving colors, all the while avoiding and battling the gray-clad forces of the Inkies.Players must acquire paint and hurl de Blob at the buildings, walls, statues, roads and skies above Chroma City. As de Blob bounces around, adding color wherever he lands, his supply of paint is depleted and he begins to dry out. As this happens players must collect more paint and rehydrate in pools and in front of hydrants scattered across the city. As the game starts access is limited to the colors red, blue and yellow, but these can be blended to create a number of other colors. Being able to create and apply these colors becomes important as Chroma City and its inhabitants come to life, and de Blob makes contact with a range of other characters known as the 'Color Revolutionaries' and receives an increasing amount of missions that charge him with splattering color all over town. Success at these mission gains the player point which drives the game forward, eventually leading to a direct assault on Comrade Black's I.N.K.T. fortress guarded by elite Inky soldiers and massive ink turrets.Key Game Features:de Blob- Flip, bounce and paint your way past the all-powerful I.N.K.T.

These multiplayer campaigns support up to four players, come with street and sewer maps and include four player split-screen functionality. Just a few of the multiplayer campaigns include:Paint Match- Paint as many buildings as possible and steal points from opponents by re-painting the buildings that they've already covered.Blob on the Run- A variation of 'Capture the Flag,' in this mode only one blob can paint and is pursued by opponents who attempt to slam him into submission and gain the ability to paint and accumulate points themselves.Blob Race- In this mode buildings can only be painted once and are indicated by in-game arrow. With time limited it's a race not only to paint the town but also to keep opponents from doing the same.","reviewerName":"Matthew Wiltshire","summary":"Very underrated Wii game","reviewText":"This is one of the Wii's most original games. Everything is fantastic even down to the menu interface. The game does have a story that has some great cutscenes and aren't overdone or stall gameplay. The music is one of the best of any videogame I've played. You can choose different music types and even then that certain music type will slightly change as your blob changes. The game has some great depth. Watching any video review won't even do it justice. It looks simple, but there's much more to it. The game isn't a straight up button smasher, but requires you to think a little as well. The graphics are only second to the beautiful Mario Galaxy and include a myriad of colors. It just looks fantastic when you're painting a city.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2010"}

Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"M.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start. Guess we'll all have to wait for Tekken 4 to find that out.--Jeff Gerstmann--Copyright &#169; 2000 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

Unfortunately, backgrounds and foregrounds don't blend nicely together, and because the PlayStation 2 hardware lacks anti-aliasing, you can notice pixelation within character models. The title of the best graphics in a fighting game still belongs to Soul Calibur. Even with features added, isn't this the same Tekken we've been playing all along? Tekken Tag retains the same features from the arcade version. Every character from Tekken 2 and 3 will be selectable here. Better single player modes could have been added, which would have boosted the replay value.The newest fighting technique in the Tekken series is the Tagging system. You'll be able to select two characters to go against another fighting pair. During battles, you may switch off between fighters at any time to beat your opponents. Unlike the Tag options in Dead or Alive 2 or Marvel vs. Capcom, Tekken's Tag option doesn't allow you to completely finish a battle. Once one of your team members die, the fight is over, which is degrading.Tekken Tag Tournament may certainly become a hit with its famous franchise, while at the same time showing off its new home with the Sony PlayStation 2. Unless you're a hard-core fan of the series, you'll find this as nothing more but Tekken 3 with a Tag feature. Once you get past the new look of the game, the fun begins to turn routine. Gamers who have never had experience with Tekken or fighting games should investigate the game, but others looking for something new would want to check out the other titles the PlayStation 2 has to offer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2000"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Evan M.","summary":"The Game That Spawned a Spectacular Franchise","reviewText":"We have all heard that &#34;Kingdom Hearts is just so beast!&#34; from all of our Playstation gaming friends, but this title really lives up to the hype.

{"product_name":"B000BXKA38","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"Can This Franchise Get Any Better?","reviewText":"Ever since the first \"Metal Gear Solid\" brought stealth-gaming, cinematic storytelling, and the franchise to a new level back in 1999, this series has gotten nothing but better.  This latest entry is an expanded version of \"Snake Eater\" (first released Nov. 2004).  To all new gamers, do not let this series' long-standing reputation intimidate you.  Believe me, this newest entry in the acclaimed series is one for everybody.  To anybody who plays video games, this is one to check out.For the newcomers, the \"Metal Gear\" games require the player to avoid enemy conflict and reach their objectives through stealth and covert tactics.  The previous games took place in more industrial settings like warehouses and weapons factories.  This time, lead protagonist Snake must survive the jungle using camoflouge and the utmost caution.  But to as much of a stealth game as this is, it also a fierce yet poetic one.  From a tense sniper battle in the jungle, to a gruesome and sadistic torture scene.  From a deadly escort mission with plenty of carnage, to a one-on-one confrontation amidst white-flowered fields.  It's also a pretty damn funny game sometimes.  The sexual tension in this game is both alluring and shamelessly exploitve...I'll leave it at that.  I must admit that I find the prologue chapter (which will take a new player about an hour to finish) to be kind of dull until its closing cutscene.  But be patient, and you will be rewarded.Playing through the other two \"Metal Gear Solid\" games makes the story clearer and more meaningful.  However, I say with confidence that because \"Metal Gear Solid 3\" features a more direct plot than the cryptic second title, newcomers should get into this one fairly easily.  Honestly, you need not to have played any \"Metal Gear\" game for this gripping story to make sense.  Will you get more out of it as an experienced player: Definitely!  Can you still appreciate this exciting, suspenseful, character-driven, and intelligent tale without the background: Definitely!For those who've already played through \"Snake Eater\" (the original PS2 version), there is more additional content that is well worth checking out.  The most popular addition is a new camera system that allows players to avoid the top-down perspective, and better see their surroundings as if it were a jungle version of \"Splinter Cell\".  Although this makes the game a lot easier to play, some of the presentation is lost.  Hideo Kojima created some of these levels with a cinematic flair, and you don't get as much suspense when you can see everything.  The good news, which somehow wasn't advertised very well, is that you can pick either camera view whenever you want.  You, the player, are in complete control of how you want to play this game at ALL times.Disc 2 features some excellent content.  A new Theater lets you watch some outlandish parodies of some of the \"Snake Eater\" cutscenes.  The CIA Director's revenge on Snake, Snake's HALO dive going terribly wrong, and my personal favorite---Raiden's desperate need for the spotlight and the resulting \"time paradoxes\" he causes.  These alternate reality scenes are hilarious!  The complete library of the original cutscense is available on the first Disc from the get-go.  There is some Online versus modes that deathmatch fans will love.  And for the true \"Metal Gear\" fanboy - the MSX versions of the first two \"Metal Gear\" games, which were terribly butchered on the NES (sorry, Nintendo).So, should those who own the original \"Snake Eater\" pick up the expanded version of \"Metal Gear Solid 3\"?  My answer is absolutely!  Trade in your old copy, and pick up this version immediately.  It's very fair-priced for 30 bucks or less, and the Extra content is excellent.  I love all of the \"Metal Gear Solid\" games, in all of their iterations.  What's special about this game is that for the third time running, Hideo Kojima's beloved \"Metal Gear Solid\" franchise surpasses all expectations that I have no doubt that \"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots\" on the PS3 is going to be amazing - such faith in a video game series is rare!FOR THE NEW PLAYERSOriginal versions\"Metal Gear Solid\" (PSone, 1999) and (PC, 2001)\"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\" (PS2, 2001)\"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater\" (PS2, 2004)New versions of the old titles\"Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes\" (Cube, 2004)\"Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance\" (PS2/X-Box/PC, 2002)\"Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence\" (PS2, 2006)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2006"}

Then it all feels different and one's first reaction is \"this is not as fun\". After playing this game for over a month, then going back to play MW2 online again, I definitely like the online game play of Black Ops better.The music and game play sounds are better to start with. You can hear more detail, not only do you hear the pin from a grenade being pulled, but which direction was just thrown from as well.The weapons are much more varied, but better at not having a select few be overpowered. The addition of weapons such as the under barrel flame thrower attachment and the crossbow make for a more random game play. Can't say I have ever played another online game where a guy can get shot with an explosive arrow, and while he runs for cover behind all his teammates, it goes off and he blows them all up.The removal of the nuclear strike is a welcomed change. The only person who enjoyed that was the person setting off the nuke. Everyone else who was in the middle of working on their kill streaks just gets their game ended. The ability to customize every detail, from face paint to gun camo it a fun addition, making each players guns their own.There have been some teething problems with the stability of the servers hosts since the games launch. From inability to keep connected through a whole game, to lobbies getting stuck and the rounds not launching at all. Thankfully though, with the most recent game update, almost all of these problems have been fixed and only now are there occasional game disconnects. Had their been a public BETA testing of the games servers, this probably would have been avoided. Hopefully this lesson has been learned by Treyarch, in case they ever do another Call of Duty game.Offline Play:The storyline is darker than that of Modern Warfare 2. While you play the same character throughout this game (unlike the changing of characters in MW2), the game definitely has a twist at the end. The game has significantly more swearing and acts of prisoner torture. The \"No Russian\" airport mission in MW2 has nothing on the torture scenes in this game. Basically, I'm saying this is not for the little kids.I personally like the offline storyline and game play of MW2 better. I found the missions in Black Ops to feel a little like going through the same mouse maze over and over, just with different scenery and more viciousness. It seemed in Black Ops, the goal was to be better at stabbing people in the head, instead of taking down an enemy with one shot at 500 yards. The game play in Black Ops felt more constricted and the graphics weren't quite as dynamic as MW2. Still, the game holds it's own and is worth plaything through.Conclusion:In a head to head comparison of Black Ops and Modern Warfare 2, Black Ops (with it's new stable server updates) wins for better online play, while MW2 has a more fun offline play.Tip:After you have played through the entire offline game, wait for the credits to end and you will get a new zombie game. You play as JFK trying to fight off the zombies from the White House.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2010"}

Even though I personally didn't like it, I am giving it 3 stars because it's not a bad game, just not my thing. I played demo's of this and just was unimpressed. A demo should hook a consumer to buy a game. But I'm still giving it 3 stars because there are OTHER people who will probably love this and it's not a bad game, just not that good. I love the horror genre but this was just not much fun for me.People have noted, \"You can not defend yourself\" so this game is different than any other game. Running away from everything is no fun. I don't want to play a character that's a wimp. Even if it was similar to the old Alone in the Dark where light can be used as a weapon and guns aren't really needed, would have made this more enjoyable. At least I'd have some protection.What you get from this game:Not the greatest graphics.Not the best physics or better yet, annoying controls. I was NOT impressed with the dragging of the mouse to move or open things. It was not \"cutting edge\".But..The Pro's:From what I saw and have read, it's not a bad storyline and creepiness/darkness abounds here but that doesn't justify a great game. It gets points but no 5 stars.Spending my time running from everything and sometimes nothing just didn't make for a great game for me. Some consumers may like this type of game, have a low end computer and be forced to buy games with lower specs and the price is low so they will buy it.You be the judge of how to spend your $$.

As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction.

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Just Trying to Help","summary":"A \"big enough\" upgrade from the old Wii","reviewText":"Great News.  Today (4/30/2013) Nintendo released an update that resolved a lot of the problems that the Wii U had.  My personal favorite is that you can now download and install games in the background and fully automatically.  Yes, it should have been like that since the beginning.  Three cheers! I've updated my review to reflect this new information.-----------------Original review (edited due to improvements by Nintendo):I remember that Nintendo came under a lot of criticism for not having an HD version of the Wii.  HD was around when the first Wii came out, and a lot of people were a bit skeptical that they stuck to the lower resolution.  As HD became common, Nintendo told fans that they had to do something \"more\" than just come out with an HD version of the Wii.Well, thats just what Nintendo did.  The Wii U is more than \"just Wii HD\".  But Nintendo hasn't changed the Wii experience very much.  You still use Wii remotes every time you play.  The Wii U is not \"completely different\" like the Wii was when it came out.  The Wii U is the Wii's younger, smarter brother.  And if you liked the Wii, you'll like the Wii U.The 3 main features of the Wii U are:1) Its HD, which brings it (finally) up to speed with the Xbox and Playstation ... and everything else out there.2) The Wii U has a single video controller.  The video controller opens up new game experiences.  Whoever is playing on the video controller sees something different than the other players.  For generations people have wanted multiplayer games that didn't use a \"split TV screen\", and the Wii U gives you that in one console.  This is a really big deal.  The video controller is also a touchscreen which you use to flick something at the screen, or move things on screen.  The new video controller allows for new control options ... just like the \"Wii balance board\" allowed Nintendo to sell yoga and ski games.3) Videos, videos, videos.  Netflix, youtube, TiVo, amazon instant video.  It will keep track of the TV shows you want to watch, and when they will be on.  You'll also be able to use the Wii U as a social outlet to chat about TV shows and movies.  Nintendo calls this Wii TVii, and it would be a revolution in TV watching... if only all the features were available now.  So you can use the Wii U as a control for all your Video experiences with your TV.  The video controller will act like \"PIP Picture in Picture in the palm of your hand\".  I use the Wii U with Amazon Video to watch movies for free, and the Wii remote lets me see information about the movie on IMDB WHILE the movie is playing.  For sports, you'll be able to watch instant replays on the small screen... while the rest of your buddies continue to watch the big game on the main screen.  So its going to be a remote controller on steroids.  To be honest, this is going to be a really big big deal but since not all the features roll until \"later\" I can't give the WIi U a star for it yet.  Maybe it will change your life, maybe not.  Time will tell.And that concludes the main appeal of the Wii U.  We finally get HD, the video controller adds a new dimension to the usual Wii gaming, and it also serves as a \"TV command center\".FAQ:::Some people have asked me about the Wii U, and the short answers are:1) No, you don't have to own a Wii to have a Wii U.2) You can only use ONE video controller with your Wii U.  All other players use the old Wii remote.3) 5 people can play at once, making it even more of a \"game party\" console than before.4) You can't play DVDs or Blu Ray discs.  Blue Ray is Sony Playstation territory, as you probably know.5) You can surf the internet on it (why would you want to?  I don't know)6) Should I get the deluxe?  Probably.  You get 32gb of memory, which will become more important the longer you have the console, and the more you do with it.  You get the Nintendo Land game.  You get the cradle for charging the video gamepad.  And until 2014 they will give you a store credit of 10% every time you make a purchase of digital content (games).  If you buy digital content regularly, you might \"earn back\" the extra $50 you pay for the deluxe Wii U.  (I tried this yesterday, read below for more info on the credit)NintendoLAND:Nintendo Land has a nice set of games that introduce you to life with the video controller:1) Some of the games are a lot of fun.  The most popular minigames in our house are the game where one player pretends to be a ghost and scares other players.  This is accomplished by having two screens, the ghost can see everyone, but nobody else knows where the ghost is.  This is always a howling good time at our house.  The Mario hide and seek works the same way and is also popular with us. (update: after a month of play, the Kids now play Zelda and Metroid the most)2) Some of the games would be worth about $1 in an \"app store\". (race game, balloon game, and yoshi game: I'm talking to you!)3) Some games have more than one control scheme.  The Pikmin game is enjoyed by my 4 year old because he can use a stylus to direct \"Captain Olimar\" instead of the joysticks/d-pads.  He just points at what he wants to do.  So for the first time even my youngest can join in on at least some of the action.4) Metroid and Zelda show off what the Wii U can do for multiplayer combat/FPS. In Metroid, the player with the video controller operates a \"helicopter\" while everyone else are \"ground troops\".  The two screens allow for different perspectives in battle.NintendoLand has satisfied my kids for a whole month, but its really starting to wear off now.  NintendoLand is particularly good if you have a lot of friends come over to your house.  But, its just a variety game and not very deep.  You'll probably want to buy another game shortly after buying the Wii U.  (PS I bought Trine2 from the Nintendo eShop for $20, but, I think it was worth about $10.)Other games: since I wrote my original review, I have bought a lot of other wii U games.  However, I'm generally disappointed in the use of the video controller.  In many games, the video controller either shows you a map of the area, or, shows a version of whats on the big TV screen.  Party games, like the Rabbids game and Nintendo Land, make the best use of the video controller.  Single player games tend to make the worst use of it.  I don't have all the games for the Wii U, but, thats been my general experience.The Wii U has a host of \"lesser\" features:1) A person can play the Wii U without having the TV on.  Expect a smack on your head if you want to play ZombiU while your wife watches a movie.2) Its backwards compatible with all older Wii games (but maybe not dance pads!), which is nice if you bought Zelda Skyward Sword this summer.3) Just as with the old Wii, you can download games from the Nintendo store.  If you buy online content for your iPhone, Xbox, or PS3, you know that this is a big deal.  I used to buy songs for guitar hero to add to the songs that came in the box.  If you buy this DELUXE version, you get a 10% credit back for all online purchases, see more about this credit in \"The Bad\" below.4) The Wii U video controller is like a universal remote.  You can turn on your TV and change the volume from the gamepad which is a convenience.5) Most of the old Wii hardware is compatible too, which is nice, EXCEPT that round \"gamecube style\" connector is not present on the Wii U.  Games that use a mat like \"outdoor challenge\" and \"Dance Dance Revolution\" become history in your house.6) There is a big, easy to find \"download again\" button for all digital content, so if your Wii U got fried by a power surge you wouldn't lose your purchases.  That's always nice.The bad:1) The menus aren't intuitive.  There are two menus... the Wii U menu and the Home menu.  The Home menu is found by pressing the Home button.  Note that now that downloads are automatic, the unintuitive menus aren't so bad.  But they still seem redundant.2) Transferring data from the Wii to the Wii U should be easier.  In particular I didn't like that when I imported my Miis, I had to do a separate step on the Wii U before I could actually use them in the games.  The day I got it the patch took way too long to download and install, and after I transferred my data from my Wii I felt like I had spent 2 hours on the whole thing.  But, since then, there has been no problem.3) Freezing.  I did have a problem with NintendoLand locking up, but, that went away after one day.  This will be something they fix and becomes a thing of the past.  I wouldn't sweat it.4) Long updates.  I feel that the time that it takes to download stuff and install it has improved over time.5) Installing downloaded content.  I wrote a long rant about how annoying this was, but as of the most recent update you can buy items in the store and they download and install automatically, as they should.6) Digital Content 10% back has a $50 minimum, and I feel that its high.  For every $50 in digital content you get a $5 credit.  If you spend $65 on digital content, then you still get $5, until you spend another $35 to get it to $100.  You go to a separate website using your computer, and log in, and then copy the code onto a piece of paper.  Then you go to your wii u and put in the code.  I've become accustomed to the process and I've decided its not very restrictive, but I still wish that credits just \"appeared\" in your account 24-48 hours later.  The codes are good until 2015.  The codes remain on that website even after you've used them, they don't disappear.  When you add the codes to the eShop there is no expiration date.Ok now that I'm done complaining...Your decision matrix:1) If you still like playing on your Wii, and you have the money to spend, buy a Wii U and sell your Wii.  You'll enjoy it.2) If you are considering between an Xbox+Kinect and a Wii U, I think its a tough call.  I really like the \"second screen\" gaming, it really opens up a lot of possibilities.  But most of the wii U stuff looks really juvenile.  The kid down the street told me he still wanted an Xbox because the Xbox has games for teenagers.  I said \"whatev.\"3) As a side note, every kid who has seen and played our Wii U in the last two weeks has put this as the top item on the Christmas list.  Its the \"next big thing\" for them and you can be sure that the little things that I complain about in this review won't matter to them.  Not at all.Games:  Nintendo now has decent amount of digital content to buy online.  I paid .35 for \"kirby's great adventure\" or something like that.  Its a grainy looking old game, but it was only thirty five cents.  Nintendo has started offering games at the $2, $5, and $8 price points as well.  I'm VERY pleased to see this, because I want to be able to log into the shop and grab a game for cheap when I want to.I rate this item 3 stars out of 5 because three stars means \"it's ok\".  Nintendo has made a lot of improvements in 6 months, and while they have fixed most of the problems with the system, I find myself reluctant to raise the review to 4 stars until some more exclusive games are released.  Pikmin 3 has been delayed until August, for example.1 month UPDATE:We've become \"heavy users\" of the Wii U.  My wife, who always preferred the Kinect, has started to warm up to the Wii U.  But I think its because my son is converting her, I sure couldn't.Big negative: CRADLE and battery have limitations: The battery on the video controller can't hold up to extended play.  I picked up one of these cables:Global Game Gear GGG0040 Deluxe Split Extension Cable for Wii U Video Controllerwhich resolved my problems.  Now its easier to keep the video controller charged.  I've removed my rant about the video controller battery not lasting.DOWNLOADS:  I removed my rant about problems with downloads because its been fixed.The Wii U is getting better.  I think it may turn into my favorite console of all time, if they can just get some good exclusive games out, and improve the use of the video controller in those games.

As a teenage girl named Heather, players must explore and unravel the mysterious connection between the god-forsaken town and her inner fears. The game features enhanced graphical detail, a more complex storyline, and even more grotesque monsters than the previous games.","reviewerName":"S. Fernandez \"lorenzferus\"","summary":"SILENT HILL 3","reviewText":"Although I thought Silent Hill 2 was the most disturbing and engrossing game of the next generation consoles, the game took a lot of criticism.  I've heard it all.  The game wasn't scary enough, it isn't intense enough, you never feel any real danger, the monsters are too slow and far away, the monsters never pose much of a threat, it doesn't have enough action or gameplay, it's too easy, it's not disturbing enough, it's not mean enough, it's not as demonic as the first one.  These are all valid complains, and I agree with almost all of them, I hope the developers of the game improve in those areas.  Silent Hill never gets boring to me, because every installment is different, the only thing that is really the same is that it's gonna try to be the darkest and most twisted tale it can.  The monsters are always simular in the way of looking like deformed images.From what I've seen in the screen shots, the game might be addressing some of these problems.  First off, the monsters seem to be bigger, and you use an automatic weapon, which probably means you will need it because monsters are harder, and play more of a role.  Some people think that more action in the gameplay takes away from the horror or disturbing nature.  I don't agree with that, because what usually makes a game scary is it's sound and presentation, not really the gameplay.  Just look at the Resident Evil games from the mid to late 90's, like Resident Evil 2 and 3 which had action but were very cutting edge and intense.  Those Resident Evil games really relied on sound to scare you; they went from one extreme to the other.  It was the loud crashing sound that came without warning that really scared you.  Realistically Resident Evil was only as scary as how high you had the volume on your TV.  That also means, that just because SH3 has more action than SH2, that doesn't mean it will be scarier, but in this case I don't think it will hurt it, if anything it might add some needed intensity to the series.  Another problem with Silent Hill 2, many people thought it could have been more disturbing and gory. I've already seen a few gorier pictures in SH3, I've seen a girl being killed by one of the monsters, I've seen a dog like creature eating what looks like flesh, I've seen a dead dog served on a plate.  The monsters themselves look a lot like the ones from Silent Hill 2 but in my opinion some of them do look a bit scarier.  I personally would prefer reddish skinless creatures over the brown rusty looking monsters they seem to be using here.  A lot of people also said that the monsters in SH2 were too slow, they came at you from too far away, they never really made you feel any danger, and they were too weak.  You felt sorry for the creatures more than scared, but that was more less the approach that SH2 took altogether.  This time some of the monsters in Silent Hill 3 are bigger, some are dog like creatures that can attack quicker, some of the creatures even seem to be able climb and can perhaps be a threat to attack at more sudden directions.Like I mentioned before, Silent Hill 2 took a certain approach, the game was all about loss and depression and the end result was a seriously disturbing and engrossing feeling.  Konami could easily turn the plot of Silent Hill 3, into a scary and demonic one, over the twisted and heartbreaking one used in Silent Hill 2.  We will have to wait until the game is released in August to be sure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2003"}

DS allows up to four players to compete via wireless connection.Unlockable stages where familiar items from the worlds of Mario and Sonic enhance the challenge of each unique event.","reviewerName":"Female Spy","summary":"The Inside Scoop of Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games (by Laura)","reviewText":"Introduction:If you read my other reviews, you'll know I'm actually a huge Sonic fan.  I'm also a little bit of a Mario fan (although the characters there seem significantly stranger).  So, being a fan of both, it makes sense to look forward to and get a hold of this game.  I got it for Christmas, and I have to say, I'm nowhere near disappointed!  You might want to know, however, that there is no option for left handed people; so it might be harder for those who are left handed.  I played this game hard over the holidays, and I've unlocked a lot of cool stuff; so, here's the inside scoop.Features:Basically, this game came out in celebration of the Beijing (hopefully, I spelled that right) Olympics.  It has at least most of the classic sports: track (many versions, including hurdles), swimming, table tennis, trampoline, high jump, long jump, triple jump, hammer throw, javelin, pole vault, single skulls (a rowing competition), springboard, fencing, skeet (a shooting competition.  Don't worry, nothing alive; just clay discs), Archery (again, just targets), and even a sky diving competition (I'm not sure if that one is traditional)!  You can play as sixteen characters (eight Sonic and eight Mario) classified into four groups as follows:Power type: Knuckles, Bowser, Vector, and Wario.All around type: Mario, Amy, Luigi, and Blaze.Speed type: Sonic, Daisy, Shadow, and Yoshi.Skill type: Peach, Tails, Waluigi, and Dr. Eggman.This selection is only the in game characters, as you can also select a Mii you've created.  A Mii's type isn't explained, but play as him/her a while to figure it out (I think mine is a speed type).The Menu:Single Match Mode:  Play with one to four players in one event at a time.  the specified fields are Athletics, Shooting, Gymnastics, Dream Events, Rowing, Aquatics, and Fencing.  A couple of events need teams of four; if you are playing alone, you can choose how many you can control, or be COMs (Computer controlled).  Please note that some events need to be unlocked; like the Dream Events.  You can unlock events by getting gold medals, the easiest way being to find sports you're good at and win with all of the characters (that's sixteen medals per sport).  The Dream Events are fun, and include: Dream Race, Dream Fencing, Dream Table Tennis, and Dream Platform (the skydiving one).  You'll want to unlock these events, as Dream versions of Fencing and Table Tennis, is a lot more fun than the original versions.Circuit Mode: Earn trophies by competing in three to six events in a row for overall first place.  You have to win gold medals in Single Match Mode to unlock the circuits.  I've only beaten the Beginner ciruits.Mission Mode: Play various missions as the characters.  These missions can be anything from placing in a certain place, beating a rival, or scoring a certain amount of points.  I'm almost certain you earn something if you complete all of one character's missions (completed missions are shown with yellow stars); but I haven't been able to do this yet.  Also, note that some missions require you to be in events you need to unlock in Single Match Mode.Gallery: A great place to take a break from the major olympic games.  Play the simple mini games: Voice Memory, Card games (like matching and memory), Whack a mole, Count Master, and Bound Ball.  If you accomplish getting a certain score in these games, you'll learn very interesting things about the Olympics like: how to participate, who Beijings mascots are and what they stand for, Olympic history, and more!  Did you know they didn't always give gold medals to the Olympic winners?  How about that one person won track bare footed?  Unlock all of the information in a section to get cool museum background music from the Sonic and Mario games.  This is easily the most educational place in the game.Collection Mode: View medals, trophies, emblems and world records.  Good if you don't quite remember what you already won.Options: Configure a couple of things.  I don't remember what 'cause I hardly ever go there.  For left handed people, I'm sorry to say you can't access a configuration for left handed control, even here.  I'm right handed, so this isn't a problem for me; but I understand how it can be a problem.Other interesting things: If you're a fan of Mario and/or Sonic, knowing these little details may make the game further appeal to you.  Even if you're new to both, these things may still interest you.1.  Heavy Sonic fans will know that Sonic can't swim.  So, in every event that deals with water (Swimming, Rowing, and even Dream Platform), he wears a life jacket.  This is kind of funny and cute.2.  Although the sixteen characters I mentioned are the only Sonic/Mario characters that are playable, others make appearances.  Espio, Charmy, Shy Guy, and Lakitu all take part in events like Javelin to calculate things like how far you threw.  They also follow you around in events like swimming (look at the background on the pool's side).  Cream the Rabbit also fires a starting gun in events like track.3.  The audience is interesting.  One time, I took a glance behind a character who had already performed, and I noticed the only people watching what I do are Toads and Chao.  For those not acquainted, Toads are characters from the Mario series; they're characterized by their mushroom-like hats and simple apparel.  Chao are from the Sonic series; theyre the cute blue bubbly things, with the small yellow balls floating over their heads.Conclusion: So there you have it; the inside scoop.  Some other comments before I close: If you want a good workout, then participate in a lot of aquatics; it's exhausting.  Don't play Voice Memory too much, unless you enjoy being annoyed.  You're not going to pick up on every event right away, so just keep practicing.  Always go for the gold!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2008"}

The developers have managed to combine an engaging story with strong RPG and FPS elements to produce a thoroughly absorbing and memorable experience. The storyline is unusually effective and all the more compelling due to the aspects of morality it addresses. The voice acting is terrific, especially the chuntering splicers that wander around Rapture -- their psychotic ramblings are utterly convincing. The game is also graphically impressive for a 2007 production -- Rapture is a beautiful, art deco wreck of a city.

Playing shooter like Black Ops II was a head-pounding experience! Not only the background explosions vibrate my head, but so does some gun shots. Machine gun does a pretty good job at knocking my head semi-automatically!The headset can be in various modes, from game to specifics like shooting and racing, to movie. The differences are subtle to me, especially my head is being a \"shock absorber\"...All these are in wireless bluetooth mode with PS3. Wired with audio cable is not bad. The option to use audio input on the USB stick is clever, but the sound is ordinary stereo...and disappointing since my head doesn't get the \"massaging\" action.I have the first generation PS3 bluetooth wireless headset as well. Besides the head vibration sensation, the other major sound difference is this one can do 7.1 effect on blu-ray and streaming movies as well if I recall. The previous one can only do stereo for non-games sound effects.I haven't ran out of battery on this one, with my longest session being 3 hours. Of course, I think that's all my head can handle before needing some quiet times!Headset is classy looking, with good blend of chrome/steel in frame. The leather-wrapped ear cushion is stiffer in this model, so the whole headset feels snugged and firmly \"gripping\" my head without feeling tight.  Firm \"gripping\" also helps in kicking my head around!Anyhow, enough of me describing my simulated migraines (without pain). It's worth the experience..unless you are headache prone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}

Here are some reasons why I believe this game is better than the others.#1-The Driving in this game is a LOT more realistic than the past GTA games.  I am not a big fan of unrealistic driving such as Need For Speed or Midnight Club and the past GTA's.  I am a big fan of games such as Grand Tourismo and Driver. I like the realistic driving.The story in it I thought was better than any of the other GTA's.  For one it was something a little different and I didn't find myself pushing the continue button every 15 seconds to skip the story like it past GTA's.As far as the action in game it is a little arcadish but better than past GTA's.  In the past GTA's I would get bored of the story very quickly and just kill people untill I got bored.This game in my opinion surpasses all previous GTA games and it has my vote.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Beautiul & historical, but a lot of trial and error","reviewText":"Admittedly, (as of this writing), I've only been playing the game a few days and have about 6 hours (passed game time, but in reality much longer) invested into thus far.  So how can I rate something with only 6 hours play?  Well, because I've played the rest of series before hand and believe I should know what to expect...with obvious improvements and new features.The good:- Game is stunningly beautiful.  With each new incarnation in the series, the graphics, effects, details, sounds, landscape always seem to improve and this is no exception.  It's a beautiful world.- Cities are HUGE.  One of the first cities, Boston, is gigantic with a lot to discover.  It feels like a real city with many more people, animals, and day-to-day life going about.- Educational: As you come across new NPC, landmarks, buildings, your \"online\" database, the Animus, does a nice job of teaching history, just not the intersting facts, but also the \"feel\" of teh culture at the time.  I've actually learned 'real stuff' here that you won't find in your generic U.S. History classes.- Cut scenes and cinematics are really well done and draw you in deeper and depper.- It's still fun as all heck to explore the cities looking for collectibles, treasures, and other goodies.The bad:- Some of the cutscenes and cinematics (at least early on) seem long and tedious at times.  Sure you can 'skip' them, but you also don't want to miss important plot points.  But sometimes conversation go on and on thus breaking up the gameplay experience.- Many times mission instructions text scrolls by way too fast to read.  I wish I could 'pause' at times just to read what I am expected to do before it disappears.- Enemy 'Red Coats' are numerous in cities, and it seems this time around, it's harder to avoid arousing suspicion or breaking line of sight. While I appreciate the step up in enemy A.I., the constant annoyance of Red Coats everywhere can be frustrating.- Very first tutorial is confusing for new players.  Even as someone whose played earlier incarnations, I found starting tutorial direction lacking at times.  I would like more 'practice' options in figuring out the controls, especially combat/fighting....My first few fights were more about button mashing then it was about strategy and countering.- Quirky writing: Some of the database entries try to be cute and funny with forced humor - Note developers: the jokes aren't funny and seem forced and hackneyed at best.  Don't do this in the future.- Too many people in cities can cause for some confusion at times when the action gets intense.  With so many people on the screen at once, you'll sometimes lose sight of your own character and who you are actually controlling....they all look alike after a while.The ugly:- No print manual.  I know everything is digital these days, but I like to be able to turn pages for quick reference or look up.  The 'ingame' manual can be difficult to navigate, or even find at times, and information contained within seems lacking of gameplay details.- Trial by fire instructions/objectives and their subsequent consequences.  Because the online manual is not fleshed out and early tutorials don't divulge everything or let you practice a lot, you sometimes are thrown into situations where you only figure out what you are supposed to do by failing a few times first.  Yeah, it's nice you can restart a mission at anytime, but vague (and I mean vague) instructions and/or mission parameters will leave the player frustrated by not understanding what Ubisoft intends for you to do at first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2013"}

They got some getting used to , but the story was decent and flowed pretty good. KZ 2 was ok, and 3 was better in my opinion. So I was hyped to get started with KZ 4. Well, so far all I can say is this game is boring. Granted I only played about 3 stages, but they throw in so many enemies at you, just for the sake of doing it, and it's just not fun.The game is good-looking, but we all know that doesn't qualify for a full priced game. If it at least had the same pace like the other games it would be good. The intro just ruined it with the dumb reason they are fighting to begin with. I just started playing my PS3 again, since there is so much I wanted to play there.I hope it gets better, but this game, and then broken Battlefield  4 made this day irritable. However, the ironic part is Reso Gun is the most time I spent with the PS4 and it's free for PSN subscribers. Contrast was also interesting and the second most played time with my new system and it was also free.I love the system, and if you love the series you will probably like this game. It's just one of those that I have to force myself to play instead of actually enjoying it. If you really didn't like the first 3, you won't like this one. There is just something about the Killzone series that is just mediocre for some reason to me. I haven't done online multiplayer yet, but I'm not a big Multiplayer guy either.

{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Red Baron \"Rdeschain\"","summary":"This is a great game, you should ignore the haters","reviewText":"This is an amazing sequel, I personally love the game and think it is a five star game, but I do not think it helps any one to write reviews based on my own feelings, instead I write reviews based on the actual quality of the game, something a lot of people on Amazon neglect to do. So first off I will start by saying that I think people who are used to playing sequels will enjoy the way in which this game handles the transfer of powers, most other sequels will figure out some way for you to lose everything you worked so hard to gain in the first game, I think God Of War is a good example of how other games do this. To a certain degree you are instead spending this game improving all of the fabulous powers and getting much much stronger. I think that most people will enjoy this feature as much as I did myself.Next the graphics are really amazing, I have seen some people trash them and maybe they have a lo def tv, but on my HD tv the graphics are much better then the first game. Some people may not have played infamous or they played it a long time ago, I played it right before I got this game, so I had the graphics from the first game fresh in my head, also they have additional movies and cut scenes in this game, if you are familiar with the first game they only used cartoon like cut scenes to continue story, in this game they have those as well as video cut scenes to advance the story which I think adds to the story telling mode, if you were frustrated by that in the first game, no video cut scenes you will like the change in this game.The game play is fun and engaging, even more so then the first game, the action sequences are extremely satisfying for myself, and the game has a heavy feel to it, it is not a pew pew shooter, you really feel like a super hero running around the city saving people and pulling off some awesome moves. If you enjoyed the game play in the first one you will most likely also enjoy the game play in the game, as the tweak and changes are not huge but still make you feel like you are playing a whole new game. Some of the crazy people on here and in the discussion said that this should have been DLC for the first game, I think that is crazy due to all the improved powers which you will have lots of fun figuring out how to get and use and so on. Certain elements were improved upon and changed such as the manner in which you gain new powers and power areas of the city, I would highly recommend playing the first game before playing this game, Due to the error and lack of Play Station Network they are giving away games on the play station network so you can download the first infamous for free, and if you have not played it, you will enjoy this game more having played the first game.Story, they story was a little weak in the first game, as with most super hero franchises they were establishing Cole and his powers with the first game and they are blowing it up and adding a lot more content in the second one. The first game had a lot of information so once again it will only help you enjoy this game more if you play the first one. In this game all you choices affect your character and so on which is a great feature in the same way Mass Effect and other games let you make good or bad choices that changes the story and what happens. I think that player will enjoy this story and the way in which it is presented, it adds to the first game and continues the story in a lot of interesting ways. It is not a cookie cutter story and does a good job with the super hero category.I have read a lot of complaints from others and wanted to address some of them so people are get fair warning, when you are hurt the screen changes color the same as some first person shooters, not as bad as say gears of war where a gear shows up in the center of the screen obscuring you vision but not as subtle as say blood splatters on the outside of the screen, I do not know why people are complaining games have been using this some what frustrating method for a while and the best way to fix this problem is to play well. It seems funny to me that people would complain and say a game is bad because they are bad players.The other people in the game are more interesting then the first, with out giving too much away you end up meeting other people who have powers and work with you, based on your choices you will end up choosing one of them to work with you and make the other one mad, they both give your choices and are at least consistent, if you follow one of them you go down the evil path if you choose the other one you go down the good path, these characters help reinforce the choices that you have to make and working with them in the missions is a fun and interesting way to do some of the missions. Some people did not like Zeke but I thought that he was a more real person in this game. Also some people complained about the voice acting, while I enjoyed the first game, the first game's voice acting reminded me of Christian Bale in the batman movies, his voice is a little to gravely for my tastes but others like it, this game the actors is a little bit more light hearted reminding me more the the spider man then batman, this is kinda a big change which others might have a strong view of, basically changing a character so drastically, he went from a very serious tense person to a more light hearted jovial joking person, maybe you can chock that up to not being locked down in a city, maybe it was because he was still adjusting to his powers, and in the first game he was still in recovery mode and balancing out, I am sure you can look at it in a number of ways, and some people might not like this one point, I think it would be sad to let that ruin the entire gaming experience I think it would be more enjoyable to just let it go and enjoy the game, it did not bother me but it might bother you which is too bad, I think it would be better to just enjoy it besides that fact.User Generated content has not been mentioned in the negative reviews I looked at which led me to assume that they never played the game or do not have internet. Some people said that the game was very fast to play, I think one person even said he did everything he wanted to in four days and then returned it. I do not understand why people are complaining this game has an infinite number or as many as people create of user generated content, you can create your own missions, some of the missions created by other users were lame and detracted from the story, one even made it so easy to level up that I had to reload an previous save because I did not want to cheat in this manner. So some of the UGC is lame but you get to rate other peoples content so eventually you will be able to tell if the content is good, ok or just blatantly terrible, like a mission that just goes on and on forever and you do not even take damage. But I had fun making a mission and the setup could easily keep people playing for days, with all of their super charged powers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2011"}

The graphics are good but the in-car could be improved on some of the cars. The outside detail is awesome with the reflections. The game is fun but it does have alot of the older Forza 2 tracks on it and makes you feel like it's Forza 2 with add-ons. The drag racing is a nice feature now but it does need some fine tuning as the menus are not that good in the multiplayer mode. It just throws you in any race without even asking what car class you want to run besides AWD or RWD. If you want to run against a stock muscle car class you can't. You end up running it against a Ferrari or something. This only applies to non-friends. You can create your own race and rules. But I do not regret buying it as it's definately a keeper.***TAKE NOTE***Please only install the first CD on your hard drive. DO NOT INSTALL the second CD until you have started the game and as it will ask you if you want to install it from IN GAME. On the forums there are tons of people who have had issues because of this including myself. I installed both CD's and then started the game. Well the game started then asked if I wanted to install the second CD anyway.. I told it yes.. then put the second CD in then right away it asked for the first CD againthen it said the first CD was the wrong CD and the Xbox locked up. It was confused due to the fact I had the 2nd CD installed already. So I deleted the 2nd CD off the drive and installed the 2nd CD IN GAME and it worked perfectly.

Final Fantasy VII changed that, along with how I looked at the genre, as I, like many others, became addicted to the game's emotional storyline and well-rounded characters.  Since then, we have seen a number of tie-ins, spin-offs, and even feature films based on the Final Fantasy VII universe, and now, Crisis Core has finally arrived.  Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII is a prequel to the game, where you play as Cloud's old friend and partner Zack, and uncover secrets and revelations that are full of surprises, and lead up to the events of Final Fantasy VII.  First off, the game is is simply gorgeous to look at.  Not just the cut-scenes, which themselves are beautiful and stunning, but even the in-game graphics look great, making this undoubtedly the best looking RPG to hit the PSP, and the game's voice acting is even better.  The game's combat system is also worth mentioning because it isn't quite turn based, and isn't quite real time.  Instead, it is a fast moving system that is quite fun in itself, even if it may come off as a bit too easy for some.  Leveling up and performing Limit Breaks is now determined by the slot machine-esque DMW system, which is a fun little twist as well.  There are familiar characters abound as well: Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, and of course, Sephiroth.  The game's story wonderfully weaves into FFVII mythology, and offers some new perspectives on Zack and Sephiroth, and those respects alone, Crisis Core is worth picking up.  All in all, Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII is a stunning achievement that is an absolute essential addition to your PSP library, and needless to say, if you love everything Final Fantasy VII and you own a PSP, you have to pick up Crisis Core.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2008"}

The emotions run extremely high with this game. And that in and of itself indicates how much people care about the characters and plots.I've been reviewing video games since the days of Adventure and Zork, and of course there have been many atrocious games along the way. People who play atrocious games tend to be fairly blase about it. \"Yes it sucks. Move on.\" However, with Mass Effect 3 it is an entirely different set of emotion. The emotions here are more along the lines of \"I adored my character. I invested hundreds of hours into carefully crafting his life, his moral choices, and the people he fell in love with. And then THIS!!!\"I think it's important to realize how powerful this situation is. Only a mere ten years ago people would argue that video games could not capture the emotion. They would argue that there was no way to connect with a video game. We have proven here, in 2012, that absolutely a video game can be FAR more immersive than a movie or a novel. With a video game you become invested in the story, you help craft the path, and you emotionally connect with the characters.Think of all the areas that Mass Effect 3 opened horizons. It offered heterosexual and homosexual relationships and most people didn't blink an eye. It offered a range of ethnicities and hardly a word was spoke about it. Moral choices were presented, and people made their decisions. People cared.So I think it absolutely should then be expected that these years of investment, these weeks of time and emotion and energy should have a pay-off at the end. Yes, gamers paid the $x amount for the game - but that is trivial compared with the investment of their time and energy. They expect, after all of that, that what they did mattered.And, in the end, it didn't.The summation of the game - as undoubtedly the vast majority of gamers know by now - is completely independent of what the gamer chose to do. Relationship choices didn't matter. Alliance choices didn't matter. Morals, good, or bad, or ugly, didn't matter. The game makers simply pulled with a razor and ended the story.There are some gamers who posit that this shouldn't matter. Oh well. It was a noble end. We should be satisfied.But again, this is not about a movie we watched for 90 minutes while munching popcorn. It was an investment. If you were in a five year relationship with a partner, where you lived with them, cared for them, and made a focused effort to make things work, would you be content with a five minute razor-blade slicing off of the relationship? How would that ever be considered adequate? And, once your partner had done that to you, would you say to yourself, \"Oh well, they were nice to me before\"?Absolutely I feel strongly that the way one closes a relationship is one of the most important, powerful things a person in a relationship can do. I feel BioWare failed in this act - and by doing so they tainted all that came before.Ask any woman or man who has been through a nasty divorce what they remember. Is it the few years of joy - or is it the way they were treated at the end.For those who didn't mind the ending at all, I'm not sure what to say. If someone was in a five year marriage and they don't really mind that their partner cheated on them nastily and laughed as they ran off with the money - what does that say about the person's emotional investment in that relationship?I purchased this game with my own funds for the purpose of doing this review.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Derek Ryder","summary":"never been done this good ever!!!!","reviewText":"this is a good solid game i love it but very hard in throught the game also no one i lnow no company i know has done a good old western game like this rockstar is truely the best company gaming ever in the world still will be with more games coming like manhunt 2, the warriors, bully, and the world famous gta (grand theft auto) seriesgraphics 9/10sound 8/10gameplay 7.5/10overall 8.3who ever does'nt have it get it is the best western game ever!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2005"}

The game is harsh but some of the Downloadable Content is OFF THE CHAIN AWESOME!  I love the dude in Oasis he wants desperately to be your friend and when I say desperately I mean DESPERATELY! This dude is SOOOOOOO NEEDY FOR FRIENDS it is absolutely hilarious.  I have never laughed so hard in any years.  I would have brought Borderlands on day one just to enjoy the DLC.  Humor in the DLC for Borderlands 2 is better than the original Borderlands. What made Borderlands the Game of the Year for me was it was fun to play, easy to play and the humor kept me laughing so much I stay home from work for a week to play the game.  Not to worry I had scads of Use or Lose Personal Leave Time.  The people who scripted the DLC are my humor heros they brought back the endless laughs that made original sick twisted humor and barely plausable hair brained schemes that made the original Borderlands great. The basic Borderlands game is 85 out of 100.  The Borderlands 2 DLC is 100 out of 100 I can't find fault at all, I had to stop playing to game till I finished laughing the people and things were so over the top funny.I just got to the part in Borderlands 2 \\ where you save the life of the Cute Little Red Skag Pup in a Lynchwood mission.  That was the most awesome little side mission I ever played.  I'd buy Borderlands 3 if the Borderland Game Developers let us meet up with the Adult Alpha Male skag this cute little guy will surely grow up to become. I'd love to be greeted by a big brutish playful Alpha skag who remembers me saving him as a pup.  Yeah, I liked the Skag Pup side mission so much I give Borderlands FIVE STARS!  Till now Borderlands was mean spirited but the pup skag story was so sweet and awesome it made the game work for me.  FIVE STAR RATING FROM ME IN FUN AND OVERALL FINAL!ORIGINAL: I still enjoyed the Original Borderlands much more than Borderlands 2. The Original Borderlands was funny without being overly vulgar or childish. The Original Borderlands was riddled with real humor not profanity that tries to be funny and misses the mark as is the case in Borderlands 2.  In my humble opinion Borderlands 2 is just far more mean spirited just listen to the endless snarky remarks made by the re-spawn stations after your game character has suffered death.  One already feels bad for having died last thing one needs is lots of needlessly insensitive commentary from the re-spawn mechanism.  My other peeve about Borderlands two is the distance between the autosave locations during missions is enormous so you can easily spend an hour getting through a mission only to die and have to start over from the beginning.  Finally Borderlands 2 is a much harder game than the original Borderlands which takes away from the fun on easy mode.All that said Borderlands 2 is a great game to play if you have golden keys to access the Treasure Chest Located in the Sanctuary Rapid Transit Station Hub.  It is annoying that the game gives out mostly cheap useless white and green level weapons and blue and purple weapons are very rare outside the aforementioned Sanctuary Golden Chest.  For me to play the game I must do too things.  I must use Golden Keys to access the lastest current level weapons and I must wait till the tasks are considered trivial before I can clear levels which tells you just how hard Borderlands 2 really is on so called easy mode.  So even with the best gear I can barely play Borderlands 2.  I brought Borderlands 2 and had Amazon.com ship it to me on release day.I will buy Borderlands 3 when it is released but I will wait till it gets much cheaper before buying.  Borderlands 2 is way too hard to play even on the easiest setting even when using the very best Purple level gear.  Borderlands 2 is a great game but I would not recommend it for causal gaming on easy mode because the easy mode is anything but easy.  The Original Borderlands was almost always fun and rarely if ever frustrating.  Borderlands 2 is always frustrating, vulgar, way too long between auto saves and rarely if ever pure fun.On a purely crazy note the one thing that made me laugh my head off in original Borderlands is strangely \\ sadly absent in Borderlands 2.  In the original Borderlands when I used a Electrical Element SHOCK weapon the enemies did the electrical energy shock dance which they still do abet toned down.  Unfortunately in Borderlands 2 the shocked enemies brain does not erupt from their skull as was the case often in Original Borderlands.  When an electrically shocked enemy died in Original Borderlands I used to die laughing when their brains popped out.  Watching electrically fried enemies brains pop out was one of the endearing charms of original Borderlands.  The enemies don't die in the wild inventive over the top ways as was the case with how enemies died in Original Borderlands.Don't get me wrong Borderlands 2 has many good improvements that make it uniquely funny.  The far better Artificial Intelligence of the enemies make them more challenging hence more realistic to kill. If you liked the comic book like art of Original Borderlands which I did, it is unchanged in Borderlands 2.  Borderlands 2 glitches a little on single player but is generally stable on my PS3. The most funny thing in Borderlands 2 is the BUZZARD Vertical Take Off & Landing \\ VTOL craft.  The pilots sing and say the craziest things as they try to kill you.  The guy who sings the 1812 Overture as he swoops in for the kill is priceless and never gets old for me.  the other pilot that screams Air Superiority is also a hoot.  So it would be wrong to say Borderlands 2 is without really nice clean comedic touches they are just way too few and far between.  Borderlands 2 is what it is mean spirited, vulgar, not too funny, childish and cold.  The Original Borderlands was clever, easy to play, fun and both the characters and the locales were interesting in ways that were positively addicting which is so TOTALLY not the case in Borderlands 2.  Borderlands 2 is a great video game too bad it is no longer great fun and easy to play.  For being a great video game I give Borderlands 2 a 4 star rating.  I take off one star because Borderlands 2 is a mean spirited needlessly difficult game.  Boderlands 2 forgot that some people play video games on easy mode to have a pleasant diversion from real life.  For those who want horrific challenge their are still much harder modes I never go near.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"B.

Yes, the graphics are drastically improved, the voice acting has been cleaned up and sounds MUCH better compared to the original PS1 and Sega Saturn versions, and the game did a fine job building atmosphere, which in turn gives off a LOT of spooky feelings for the player.But I don't know, I just feel the game could have been even better.  It's not really more FUN to play compared to Resident Evil 2 and 3, and I think that's my biggest problem- it's just not a very fun game to play compared to the other popular games in the series.  I was expecting the fun factor to increase more than it did.Plus, I KNOW it can be argued \"this is how it's supposed to be\" because this Remake is supposed to do everything the original did and improve upon it, but it's rather frustrating having enemies constantly attack you, even when you plan ahead and prepare for them.  It gives off the feeling you're never good enough no matter how many times you attempt the same areas trying not to take a hit- you will get hit either way.  Just a challenging game all around.Still, not a bad game by any means.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2009"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"THE AUTISTIC WEREWOLF \"Wolf\"","summary":"FEAR 2 - ORIGIN: EVERYTHING A GREAT VIDEO GAME SHOULD BE AND THEN SOME!","reviewText":"I can be a hard judge of Video Games and that is a fact!  But have no Fear, I found F.E.A.R. 2: Origin to be the most awesome video game, I have successfully completed.  I have cerebral palsy, among other disabilities so playing video games is difficult for me.  F.E.A.R. 2: Origin set on Easy Mode was still quite the hand full for me to play.  However F.E.A.R. 2: Origin had none of those extremely challenging hurdles or mini games tucked inside that made it impossible to finish.  Not to say F.E.A.R. 2: Origin was not challenging because; it was indeed the most challenging video game I have ever played.  F.E.A.R. 2: Origin was intelligently designed so it did more to challenge your senses.  F.E.A.R. 2: Origin never got old or boring either.  Using the Mech's to lay waste to the enemy was an awesome experience.  Mech's are very powerful robots driven by humans that can wage destruction on a massive scale.  Because the Mech's regenerated their abilities during times they were not fired on was an awesome touch that let me figure out unique awesome ways to win that were compatible with my brain and limited physical abilities.  The weapons in F.E.A.R. 2: Origin were a lot of fun to use.  The enemies died in so many unique ways with lots of blood spatter and gore thrown in.  F.E.A.R. 2: Origin was a real festival of blood and gore if you had the gore option engaged.  Of course if you want your enemy to die a less gore filled bloody death you have the option to turn Gore \\ Realism feature Off in the games control center.F.E.A.R. 2: Origin is not just another shoot em' up gore fest, F.E.A.R. 2: Origin was a LOT of fun but it was also different in so many interesting ways.  I wished Snake Fist hadn't gotten killed because; I liked him he was a true scruffy geek \\ nerd like me minus the disabilities of course.  The locales where the action takes place looked so real down to the signs in the buildings especially the school scenes.  That school cafeteria was so real I could almost smell the over salted fat rich unhealthy rubbery food they serve students.  I am trying hard to find one bad thing to say about F.E.A.R. 2: Origin and nothing huge comes to mind.  The graphics were awesome.  The sound was first rate not as good as the original Bioshock BUT still awesome.  The audio set a creepy or frantic mood well whenever needed.  The city scenes and subway interior scenes were equally well done.  The unusual thing about F.E.A.R. 2: Origin was the attention to detail and the overall quality and attention to detail that was invested in every interior shot.  F.E.A.R. 2: Origin had a fair share of destructible objects sprawled throughout the game.  Nothing destroys the mood set by a video game more than an object easily destroyed in the real world that is impossible to destroy in the game.F.E.A.R. 2: Origin also had some funny dialogue for the enemies as they got ready to kill you.  I laughed my head off when an enemy would say, I've got him just the instant before I blew his head off.  I loved it when  a frustrated enemy would say he is moving too fast, or I need back up here.  The timing of some of the enemies lines is pure comic genius.  You have to be deep into the game to really enjoy the enemies funny one liners and assorted quips,  I have heard some people say the character in F.E.A.R. 2: Origin has some pretty lame friends given that whenever the going gets rough they fade out.  However I enjoy being a LONE WOLF when hunting things on video games.  The most infuriating video games are those that pair you up with an inept but affable side kick you must continually get out of jams not of your own making.  I know F.E.A.R. 2: Origin was a good video game because even on Easy Mode I died a lot in some places and not at all in areas where I am stronger like sniping.  Despite lacklustre performance in other areas of video game play rare is the video game with good snipping guns that I do not get the expert trophy.  F.E.A.R. 2: Origin's sharp shooter trophy is called \"DEAD EYE\" and Yeah I won it.  Gun aiming in F.E.A.R. 2: Origin is so much better in F.E.A.R. 2: Origin compared to the truly stupid sideways reticle only gun aiming in the original F.E.A.R.  Button layout was much improved in F.E.A.R. 2: Origin although some minor additional fine tuning to make some things flow better is needed.The best thing about F.E.A.R. 2: Origin is the ability to slow down time as it was needed, worked everywhere and added so much to the funny situations it created during game play.  The only gripe I had about F.E.A.R. 2: Origin and it is a tiny almost non-existent gripe is about the targeting system.  In the heat of battle the target would be clearly in view and locked on, I'd fire my weapon hit the enemy and he would not die, spurt blood or in any way act as if he had been hit.  I loved how you had to use the time slo feature just right to catch enemies at critical times of exposure.  The best thing about F.E.A.R. 2: Origin was the AI control of the characters being the most realistic I have witnessed.  The Replica soldiers were worthy prey because you truly had to hunt them down and kill them like the hell spawned vermin they were.  Replica soldiers of all kinds never went quietly into that good night without my having to blow their brains all over the wall first.  I only wish I could give more than five stars for fun and overall to F.E.A.R. 2: Origin because they were earned.  It is a rare video game that I get this fervent about but F.E.A.R. 2: Origin is that rare fun that kept me engaged in the game like a true fiend like addict.  I consider F.E.A.R. 2: Origin one of the must haves of any video game collection.  I will be buying more copies of F.E.A.R. 2: Origin just because; I never want to be without the video games I enjoy so much they become addictive to me.  Oh I will be replaying F.E.A.R. 2: Origin again and again as it never gets old for me.  Treat yourself to F.E.A.R. 2: Origin by buying a copy.  I love F.E.A.R. 2: Origin more than double recess and playing in water!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2012"}

In most trilogies, the character story arc usually spans the entirety of the series, but in this case, point A and B comes in just 14 chapters. Seeing Max go from how I remembered him to the man he becomes was an experience I'm very happy to have played through.Minor annoyances hold this game back like those silly video effects, unskipable cutscenes, and repetitive gameplay.

The XBOX's much-touted GPU really shows its stuff off in Wreckless: The Yakuza Missions with real-time reflections, bump-mapping everywhere and intense city streets.  Never before have the streets of Hong Kong been modeled in such detail!  Much of what you see can be demolished, from the Dim Sum stands, to fences, to oncoming traffic!  Watching the people running for their lives in the streets is both fun and realistic!  You can't run them over though.Now that I've gotten the graphics out of the way, let me explain how the game plays.  Sadly, playability-wise, Wreckless really doesn't hold a candle to its beautful graphics.  Why you ask?  Because it's just a Super Runabout (Sega Dreamcast) clone with far better graphics and effects.  You're basically given a series of missions to complete (mostly ramming enemy vehicles until their energy bar runs out)with a variety of cars that seem to handle like they were constructed out of tin foil.  It's painfully easy to spin out or flip over, which is bad news since all the missions are timed.  Sometimes a legitimate hit on a Yakuza car will send you flipping around, bouncing off innocent cars in the traffic in a chain-reaction method, costing you both time and your sanity.  If you flip your car over, be prepared to lose several seconds while the game gives you a new car.  Also, the game clock keeps ticking while you're in an elevator or taking snapshots...these are basically cut scenes in which you have no control, yet you still lose time!  Bad game design!!  Sometimes the actual goal of the mission is rather vague and relies too much on trial and error...this is most evident in the stage where you have to take out 4 Dim Sum stands going only by 4 camera snapshots and a pretty useless hot/cold tracking meter.  Considering that the city you're driving in is pretty large, this is by no means an easy task.  It seems like you can play the same missions over again and wind up with different results...luck has a lot to do with your success in the game.  The AI is not very forgiving and the lucky aspect just reeks of poor game design.Having trouble with a particular mission?  Too bad.  You're going to have to play through it over and over until it's beaten!  There's no way to skip any of the tough missions.Wreckless has been highly praised by practically every game magazine I've read and I am wondering why this is.  The nice graphics?  The special effects?  There's definitely nothing new in this game and I find it to be a bit on the frustrating side.  Am I sorry for buying it?  Not at all...it's fun for a mindless gaming session, but will I be bothered to play through it over and over again to finally beat it?  Probably not.Note to developers...this is a prime example of &quot;pretty graphics and eye candy do not make a great game...gameplay is the all important aspect of any video game.&quot;","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2002"}

Using the car to jump from platform to platform is a great change of pace and keeps the game fresh.  This game is absolutely fantastic.  The problem for me was, after I finished, I wished there were more missions (which I would say is a good thing).  I was also dissappointed there was no multiplayer mode....anytype of multiplayer would have been good.

DOA3, Halo, and Wrecless are great examples of Xbox horsepower and they really blow other games and systems away.Wrecless, without any doubt, is the most technically advanced game out there. With all the best eye candy that can be achieved to date, tons objects on screen at the same time, and fluid framerates, it is the most amazing demonstration of the technical power that was not achieved by any other systems before (Gamecube, PS2, PC, and MAC). Even though the gameplay limits the overall fun, I might even say that the graphics make up for all of that.If Grand Theft Auto was originally for the Xbox, it would be a revolution in gaming. More traffic could be on the road, more variety in people, the graphics would look A LOT better (like those in Wreckless), and there won't be any glitches and framerate problems. Wreckless graphics combined with gameplay of GTA3 would definitely result a HUGE step forward in videogames.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2002"}

You help fellow earthlingswith missions, and they help your doctor buddy stay alive.  Frustratingly, you can't skip the cutscenes.I think the single largest gameplay key is the health system.  You have to search for vials to regenerate health.If you're used to regenerating health slowly, this game can be frustrating.  This game is very challenging.There's a good assortment of weapons, and you carry eight at a time.  The controls are fully customizable.Multiplayer has unique ablilities, such as creating a doppleganger, and hunter vision.  There are kill streaks, such ascloaking.  There are different grenades you can use.  The maps are allright.  It feels like any other MP, kill the enemyor die.  You can get into objective matches as well.  You have to play with PSN friends to play the game co-op.I downloaded the hoard mission, which is one map.  You start with a sledge hammer, and work your way up intothe weapon chain.  Honestly, it's kind of boring.  The boss fights in the campaign are kind of cool.The major deterrant for me was the health system, as I'm too used to regenerating health in safe zones.I've played Resist 1 and 2, so I wasn't suprised by health vials, but I still don't like being attached to themin order to stay alive.

If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"Video Game History \"Gamer 4 life\"","summary":"great!","reviewText":"fun to play in bursts.

I didn't want to fully endorse it only to find something that ruined the game for me.  Of course, nothing happened like that.I know you've heard this from a bunch of different \"fanboys\" a bunch of different times but this game is awesome!  I mean, this is a true RPG right here.  It's huge!  The world is massive and is just chuck full of things to explore.  Gone are the times in the bast games when you would wander for miles and not encounter much at all.  Now you are exploring caves, ruins, barracks, towns, cities almost constantly.  That doesn't mean that you won't be able to just explore and take in the scenery, however.  There are tons of places to climb up and see for miles and I would recommend it because this game is very good looking.  The world is one of the most finely crafted I have seen in a video game.There are many things you can do as well.  There is a pretty lengthy main quest that I found to be very good but I would constantly get sidetracked by my curiosity of my surroundings and people coming up to me to give me a side-quest.  There are a handful of guilds to join and play through as well that have had a lot of attention paid to them.  Add to this the ability to smith your own armor, create your own potions, etc. and you have a bunch to do in this game.There are also a ton of improvements to the combat from past games and conversing with the NPCs is much more fluid and interesting this time around.It's not perfect.  Im sure you've hear about quite a few bugs and glitches in the game.  Those are true.  The thing is,though, not all of them happen in every single copy of the game.  Very rarely are they game-breaking either.  They are usually just amusing little things like flying mammoths that float gently to the ground after a while and stuff like that.  Things I easily overlooked in that grand scope of the game.If you have decided not to play the game only because of something bad you've heard about it then you will be missing one of the best games to date.  If anything you should also read about why people like it and then play it while giving it a chance.  You'll probably find yourself wrapped up in it like I did.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2012"}

Lerch","summary":"Game of the Year? Quite possibly and for good reason","reviewText":"Red Dead Redemption is the spiritual successor toRed Dead Revolver. John Marston is NOT Red from Red Dead Redemption despite some striking similarities in looks.This game is what would best be described as a 3rd person (you see your character on screen) shooter (you get plenty of guns) with some RPG inspired elements. Think Gears of War, God of War and similar for the perspective. This is not a first person (all you see is the gun) shooter (think Halo, Resistance, Kill Zone, Call of Duty etc).You play the role of John Marston attempting to free his captured family (captured by US law men) by going after and killing or capturing the gang members whom he used to ride with. These are the same members that John chose not to pursue when they left him for dead before the game started.Red Dead Redemption (RDR abbreviated moving forward) is a phenomenal game. If you have a desire to play a game that attempts to recreate the Hollywood style Western, then you will get your wish with this one.Graphics:You will be met with some stunning desert back drops that really show off the graphical prowess of your system of choice. 360 supposedly has a leg up on resolution and extra details, whereas the PS3 gets a leg up on shadow detail. Whichever version you purchase for whatever your choice of system, you will be pleased with the astounding beauty the world contains. Desert areas are desolate but detailed; cacti, tumbleweed, dust clouds and so on are in abundance. The towns LOOK like real Western (Hollywood Western) style towns, complete with the mandatory bar/brothel.Over all the graphics are tremendous. This game will give your gaming system of choice a good run for its graphics money.Music:Rockstar called in Bill Elm and Woody Jackson fromThe Shadow of Your Smile [Vinyl] (Woody is no longer part of the group). What they've done is created 14+ hours of instrumental masterpieces that capture a mood better than any word ever could ever describe. When you hear the tracks you will instantly recall hours of Spaghetti Westerns and Clint Eastwood movies. They've successfully captured the Hollywood Western feel in the music and tell an amazing and emotional musical story.Dialog and Voice Acting:Rockstar seems to have spent time in actually developing voice work that matches the master piece. Even the banter of people on the street is well acted. Some will point out that some of the supposedly \"Mexican\" dialog contains people who will call it Mexico and not Meh-hico that many native Spanish Mexican speakers will refer to their country as. This is nit picking, but it does lightly detract from the dialog. The nice thing that Rockstar did was to actually have Mexicans speak Spanish. When two Mexicans are speaking to one another they speak Spanish, not English which is the opposite of what many American movies capture. Think of Schindler's List. Would a bunch of German soldiers speak English with German accents to one another when no English speakers are around? Adding this small detail adds to the depth of the game and the world you enter. John is a foreigner in this country and as such there are things that John, thus the player, will not understand in the dialog. For me this adds to the immersion; for others it adds to the annoyance. Figure out which you prefer and if you HAVE to know what everything that is spoken means, learn Spanish before playing or avoid the game.Story:Because of the broad world in which you play, the story can suffer from time to time. The game is mission driven and in order to advance any story you have to visit specified locations and speak with specified people to take on missions. For me this lightly breaks the immersion and suspension of disbelief. I'm not sure how else the game could be handled and still remain with the open world feeling, but it can be a little long in the tooth at time.The story can be gripping, funny or sometimes trite, but it does help to keep the player engaged by never really being what a person could label boring.Game play:As stated above, the game is mission based. At any given time you have up to 3 different locations you can visit to do a series of missions that get you closer to the close of the game. You can do the missions in any order you want. One problem I have is that here I have an open world to play in, yet the missions are quite linear. You have a clear goal and you definitely have a specific way in which Rockstar will allow you to complete it. This adds to the story but detracts from the openness of the world for me. I still enjoy the game immensely.One big complaint I have about the game is some of the ambient challenges. No, you don't NEED to do the challenges, but if you do there are some nice perks. My problem is with the \"run around aimlessly for hours\" picking flowers, shooting animals and so on. Do I REALLY need to pad my game playing time with 6 hours of running around New Austin, Mexico and Black Water collecting things? It makes this feel like say, the mind numbing platformers that saw the light of day on the Nintendo 64. Banjo Kazooie comes to mind for mind numbing and relentless collect-a-thons. They keep the hunting and the sharp shooter challenges mostly relevant but collecting flowers? Yeah, really seems like something a guy who is trying to save his family is going to waste his time doing.Also, some of the mini games are sort of period relevant or at least period relevant in Hollywood Westerns and work well. Blackjack, Five Finger Fillet and Poker are all present. And for those that don't know how to play Poker, like me, you can just fumble through the achievement and uniform unlocking pieces that require you to play Poker. You won't be playing Poker here to get a \"real\" Poker fix, that's for sure (I speak only from the tournaments I've seen pieces of).Over all:This is a great, great game. RPG-ish elements, open world, jaw dropping graphics, gripping music and a well told story(well, once you have the whole story it is well told; getting it in 10 minute bites during the missions it may make it feel disjointed).NOT FOR KIDS. There isn't any visits with women in the houses of ill-repute (John is a reformed man, faithful to his wife, thank you) but there is at least one scene in Mexico definitely not something you want your children to see, especially when they come to you asking questions about the birds and the bees. If you are a parent, do yourselves a favor and buy your child something else.Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2010"}

Well, believe 'em - it's all true!Prior to this game, I could never really say that I was that crazy about the Mario games. I played many of them, but outside of the original Super Mario Kart, and the new Mario Kart for the Wii, I really didn't have any favorite Mario games. I've owned this game for all of three days, and it's right up there for me with the Mario Kart games. In fact, I think I even like this game better.The graphics in this game are PHENOMENAL. Of all the games that I own or have played for the Wii, this one has, by far, the best graphics. I remember watching a friend play Super Smash Brothers before I bought my own Wii, and being transfixed by the graphics I saw in that game. The graphics in Super Mario Galaxy are right up there with the graphics in Super Smash Brothers, and I like this game all the better because it's not just a straight fighting game. This one is almost like Paper Mario on the virtual console (I don't own Super Paper Mario, and thus can't compare the two) in the unfixed way that you move around the screen (anywhere on the screen you want to go to and can get to), but this game takes it a few steps further, in that you move upside down when on the underside of a planet, and that, obviously, this one depicts everything with a 3D effect, as opposed to the 2D effect that Paper Mario uses.This game is SO much fun to play! Just like a traditional Mario game, but amped up to everything you might've ever hoped for in a Mario game for ANY console. If you're considering buying this one, trust me - it's worth every penny! The graphics alone will make you happy you decided to go for it, and the fun that you'll have playing it will keep you entertained for hours on end!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2009"}

I was very disappointed.  However, I remained Optimistic when hearing about Far Cry 3's development.  I purchased the game on Playstation Network as a download and hoped for the best.  I could not have hoped for a better game.SPOILERS FOLLOWYou play as Jason Brody, a California adventure dude who is not comfortable with violence and who is not a fighter.  In the first mission, Jason's brother, Grant, is killed during the escape attempt.  Of course Jason is traumatized but, over time - and with Dennis's help (a member of the Rakyat tribe), he is able to grow over time and evolve into a complete and ultimate warrior (no pun intended).  The gameplay is great, the customization of weapons is phenomenal, and the choices given to the player of how to kill enemies, conquer strongholds, and free the people, is truly adds immensely to the replay value.The story is great, with Vaas a tremendous villain, and is fast-paced, though there are non-intrusive side quests that only add to the underlying story.  The graphics are beautiful and the sounds, both music and ambient sounds, are crystal clear and add so much depth to the game itself.Lastly, the difficulty of the game is adjustable, so if enemies are too tough you can always set it at an easier setting.This first person shooter is a much-needed breath of fresh air in the gaming market that's stagnant with military shooters.  If you're a hardcore gamer, an occasional gamer, or somewhere in-between, this game is a must-own.  Rent if you want, but I would recommend to buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2013"}

Not even though I like the story and the style I will admitt i like the first better but this is still a good game. The biggest thing I did not like about this game is that every cavern or cave or beach looks exactly the same, yes not being able to equip new armor to your characters is stupid and needs to be changed but i thought they could of added more details to these quests and parts of the game to keep it new and so you don't feel like you been here before. You may start from the beginning of the cave or the back but its exactly the same cave or beach, I just found this to be lazyness.

{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"Poo Poo Pooey","summary":"awesome sequel to the world's creepiest game","reviewText":"When simply viewing the game, the visuals are superbly done. A distinct atmosphere is created, and the character definition is excellent. At times, such features as fog and lack of lighting can overcast the graphics, however, this is meant to add to the environment, and it does just that. The CGs are beautiful as they should be, and are one of the reasons the game can be as spine-chilling as it is. The detail that is shown in these scenes is sick, and that&#65533;s what is great about them. Silent Hill 2 is absolutely a gross depiction of your worst nightmares, and is just that much more fun to experience while you are awake. Be warned, though, SH2 may seep into your subconscious and be waiting for you when you close your eyes, that&#65533;s how detailed a few cut scenes can get at times. When speaking solely of gameplay graphics, SH2 does a terrific job. The game doesn&#65533;t quite compete with titles such as Devil May Cry, ICO, or Gran Turismo 3, but then again, those types of games aren&#65533;t trying to create the atmosphere SH2 is hoping for. When attempting to create a setting that is eerie and mysterious, brilliant graphics are not what is desired. Konami has achieved a very paranormal affect, and the overall feeling of the game benefits because of it.The story in Silent Hill 2, although taking place in the same town, is completely different then the first. If you recall, the original Silent Hill dealt with the character Harry, who was searching for his daughter, Cheryl, after a terrible car accident. SH2 tells the story of James, who has received a letter from his wife, Mary, saying she will be waiting for him in Silent Hill; the problem, however, is that Mary died three years ago of a severe illness. James knows his wife is dead, and although thinking the note may be a hoax, decides to journey on through the hellish conditions of Silent Hill. The gameplay is similar of the first, as it is your task to search the town encountering some of the most twisted and perverse images your mind can handle. Armed with only a wooden plank (stick) to begin with, you will soon be treated with a handgun to fight off creatures. I found, however, the 3-foot wooden stick to be very affective against the random creatures you encounter, especially since you need to save your handgun bullets for more ferocious enemies. Entangled in the game are clever puzzles for you to solve, which gives the gameplay an element of adventure that is nice to see. The difficulty of the puzzle is determined on the game setting you choose: Easy, Medium, or Hard, and the same is done with the Action level. What I like most about Silent Hill&#65533;s gameplay is the constant paranoia that you will feel. Given the constructed camera angles, at times things will literally jump out at you, immediately putting you on the offensive. The feeling of vulnerability and helplessness is played out perfectly, and truly gets your heart racing at points in the game. It is obvious that this aspect was looked into heavily by Konami, and in my eyes, they have succeeded.The sound in Silent Hill 2 works perfectly with the surroundings, and makes for an intense encounter every time you turn around. When moving from room to room the musical score changes to accommodate your progression, and hints at unique happenings as they occur. Nothing gets your blood pumping faster than the gradual rise of supernatural music, with the added elements of small details creaking in the background. Without SH2&#65533;s sound, the game would be in no way at the level it is. Every door opening, every corner turn is executed with great presence, and allows the gamer to get the full feel of what Silent Hill is about. The voice acting is one of the best qualities in the game, as it is pulled off nicely. Konami could have rushed past this element, but I am very happy with what they have done. The background music is a mix of eerie tunes and the in-game sound affects are just as well done; stellar sound all around, which adds beautifully to the disposition.Many people may still get frustrated with the control, and that&#65533;s understandable. However, with Konami&#65533;s added features, I find the control to be above average, with very little responsive problems.For all lasting appeal purposes, it all comes down to the preference of the player. Silent Hill 2 has multiple endings, and therefore if desired, can have a very good replay value. For those who enjoy playing the game through once and stopping, obviously the replay value isn&#65533;t significant. To put it simply, if you enjoy the journey of the Silent Hill, you may very well want to venture another go at things. With the game being about 10-15 hours long, players may find themselves wanting more, and maybe changing the levels from Easy to Hard. Konami has allowed fans of the game excellent replay value, and have added elements that make this option possible.In conclusion, to me, Silent Hill 2 did everything it set out to accomplish. People who are not fans of this genre may miss out, but in the overall picture of things Silent Hill 2 is a success in almost every category. Obviously, if you were as big a fan of the first game as I was, this purchase is a no-brainer. People who dislike survival horror games may find themselves not enjoying some truly wonderful gameplay features. However, in the end, Konami&#65533;s twisted look into the town of Silent Hill is quite well maneuvered, and possesses qualities that every fan of survival horror titles will appreciate.9.2 / 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2001"}

I liked so many aspects about this game but overall it just didnt resonate with me.  Here's why:I love the horror/survival horror/action genre, so I came into it with positive expectations.  This had Ridley Scott's \"Aliens\" movie written all over it.  I was psyched.Graphically, the game is pretty amazing, possibly one of the best looking games out there in the space-genre.

Its almost as scary when things ARENT jumping out at you as when they are, and Dead Space uses that Hollywood scare tactic a lot.  A whole lot.I like many aspects, zero-gravity, the work stations, even the weapons were ok, but why 3 stars for fun?  Because I played several sections into the game and realized not only how massive the amount of time it was going to take to solve it, but also how I was going to be repeating so many tasks so many times, and then backtracking through all the areas I previously passed through, like some kind of masochistic scavenger hunt.  I can take this for a while, but not for an entire game the size of Dead Space.  Even the cool new areas and details werent enough pay-off to make me want to spend the kind of hours I was going to need on this one.Its an interesting lesson for game developers:  beauty, atomosphere, storyline may not be enough to make a game \"5-Star\" fun if it requires a lot of repetitive work.  Many, looking at the ratings, feel differently, but I was surprised enough by this to want to write a \"second-opinion\" review for those who havent yet played it.  You may love it, buy the animated DVD and the comics and pledged your life to it, but you may not, so before you buy, you may want to try (rent).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"Jane","summary":"I'll blame it on EA","reviewText":"3.5 stars - but you'll play it and love it, just like me.  Incredibly fun, but incredibly disappointing as well.First.  No controller support.  Ughhhhh.  How annoying!  I thought the reason why we played PC games was because we wanted choices and options?  Whatever, so I downloaded xpadder and had to torture myself slowly mousing across the screen with my gamepad.  I only play keyboard and mouse while at a desk, don't hate!  I also got beat up by James Vega because it took me a while to account for the L/R interrupts switch.  Don't get beat up, kids.I also had to rename save files to get the game to cooperate with the import I spent about 20 minutes in a panic thinking I was going to lose all my great ME1&2 data. My face translated perfectly, so I'm sorry for those of you who look terrible.I love Mass Effect and play a few replays, as well as numerous saves to get all the good options.  I took off half of a star for the release date DLC, which was 10 dollars.  I purchased it, foolishly, for the extra conversations with my teammates.  I didn't feel chock full of great conversations like I did in Mass Effect 2.  I liked that the support roles played a bigger part... the reporter, the Kelly Replacement, the shuttle pilot.. but I was able to have very few conversations with my teammates, Liara seemed to have the most options for talk.  I imagine if I had one less conversation with every member because I didn't purchase the DLC I would have been pretty disappointed.So many early quests are \"Do something that helps the war effort and happens to bring you in contact with one of your old crewmates.\"  I took off a half star for this because it wasn't natural.  Everyplace I went, I met an old buddy.  It just didn't feel natural, and each time I was surprised like, \"OMG, I thought I'd never see you again\" but the reality was, I was pretty much in the phone book looking up old contacts.I took off a half star for the endings.  Literally, there are 3 endings, which apparently they call 16 endings even though they only have teensie weensie minor differences based on your \"War readiness\".  I took off half a star for the fact that I have to play Multiplayer to get my war readiness high enough to get the third ending.  I have a feeling this is an anti-piracy ploy, but for those of us who don't really care to play non first-person-shooter multiplayer, it kind of sucks.  Mass Effect doesn't have roots in online multiplayer, why should I have to do that?I added a star because of the cute conversations that happen when your team roams around the Normandy.  My favorite?  Catching two beloved friends having a day-before-we-die makeout session.  I also loved how they would be on the talking on the intercom with the others.  Cute.I liked the new and improved weapons loadout, which was simple but not as simple as ME2. The addition of weight and it's affect on your power-recharging speeds is pretty neat.  Gameplay and strategy feels great on hardcore, and I'm looking forward to some frustration if I do decide to play insanity.I liked the balance of powers.  I didn't much care for the fact that there wasn't a tech-combat character on the squad.  I kind of feel like I didn't have enough playable characters.  That said, I wish they had picked push over pull as far as biotic powers.I removed a half star because there were a few parts that didn't make sense with the plot.  They're not huge, but just kind of nonsensical.  No spoilers!  Not all are focused around the messy endings but a lot of them are.On one hand, I want to play to see if I had not saved some characters in ME2 how my experiences would have gone. On the other hand, I realize it just brings me to those three bland endings and I get kind of sad. I do want the character interaction, so perhaps I'll just replay the first few quests (the meet-former-squadmates on the war effort ones) and see what happens there.I'll tell you after romancing the Drell (Thane) in ME2, I can say I was pretty short on romance in my life and pretty high on tears.  Those scenes were great.  The growing desperation of other races and the scope of the game?  Fan-tastic. Bringing the universe together to fight on a single front?  Oh my!  I had feared that side quests would either be phased out or seem out of place, but they all seemed quite reasonable.  They're all \"Bring this to me if you see it during your search\".  What's really cool is that your shipmates come aboard the citadel, so you can speak to them elsewhere.  I thought this was a nice touch.  I was impressed with a lot of things, but I don't think it's the same caliber as the first two games.If I hadn't played Me1 and Me2, I would probably give this game a 4.5, but coming down from SO MUCH CONVERSATION and these great cinematic endings that just made you feel so goddamned good to these weak cinematic endings that pretend to give you options and choices.  I think it's a natural progression, though.. when handling something with such scope it's very hard to strike the balance that pleases.Also, it's not that the ending is bittersweet or unhappy that bothers me, it's just the way it's done.  It's almost worse than the Matrix.  I know the writers are great, so I'm going to have to ask for an ending re-do!OH.  And I read that Dietz book in the Mass Effect universe, so if you have, look forward to some nice bits from there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2012"}

You fight alongside your allies in 12 action packed missions with very similar objectives: (capture all outposts to hold the enemy at bay), You can take the place of 5 different posistions in the army (scout, assault, anti-tank, medic, and engineer) each has special techniques and unique weapons(utilize all 5 to maximize your gaming experience). A bonus feature in Battlefield is the ability to use any kind of artillery you find in the battlefield ranging from German Panzers, Sherman tanks, AA guns,airplanes,jeeps,halftraks, the all powerful Tiger Tank, and pilot battleships, carriers, and LCPs.So choose your side(axis or allies) and get ready for a side of WW2 you have never seen before.Bottom Line: Battlefield 1942 is fully loaded and ready to blow you away.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2003"}

SPP is not \"too girly\". It is not as if SMB was ever a \"manly man's game\" to begin with, so if the only reason you haven't tried this yet is because the lead character is female, you are officially ridiculous.That said, I'll get to the actual game. It's awesome, and NOT too easy. Sure, the first few stages are pretty simple, as you get used to the various mechanics. But as the game goes on, you get fewer hints, less obvious puzzles, and more unforgiving platform placements. Still, Nintendo's magic touch prevails; the puzzles are always fair and logical, and a combination of skill and ingenuity will always pull you through.It's not too short, either. There are eight, rather large stages, filled with plenty of challenges and collectables. There is also a big \"shop\" where you can buy tons of stuff, much of which is actually useful. And for the hardcore, the option is there to run through all the stages again after beating the final boss, for the purpose of getting absolutely everything.The trimmings are no slouch, either. The graphics are sharp, and many of the tunes are actually hum-able. The use of Peach's emotions to solve puzzles is really clever (getting mad to fuel a hot air balloon? Awesome), and Perry (the umbrella) is one of my favorite new video game characters. SPP is a rock-solid platformer not to be missed by Nintendo lovers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2006"}

(thankfully)it's a little tough to get going since you have no idea where anything is and also do not know the map,thus your first few adventures may be harder then you expectedespecally when the quest marker is not being very helpful (I followed my quest objective into a city and upon going in it pointed behind me)the pawns are a godsend though with better A.I. then I have seen inan RPG in a very very long time. they heal you, fight the monsters(a little zealously sometimes which leads to either death or another battle)the pawns not only support your actions but actually assist very welland their comments on the huge beasts weaknesses are most welcome! they also pick up items and give them to you. you also get a Main Pawn that will lvl up with you throughout the adventure and you may Hire using Rift Crystals up to Two Support Pawns that will Not gain levels with the party. they bring loot and info back to their masters. your pawn will be the same when \"rented out\" though while rented he will still be at your side so you're never without your main Pawn (unless he \"dies\")the loot is a bit more sparse then I was getting from the videos butit's not a big problem. the stores sell loads of items and Innssell Skill Upgrades where you expand upon your skill tree depending on your choicesthe strider class is your \"rogue\" class with loads of nifty abilities (like invisibility). the mage is a AoE + Healing support style character.you may also re-spec your points at almost any time (for a price)the environments may seem bland at first but they soon are filled with lifeand thgis life is intelligent too so beware of brigands that mightset a trap for you (like the rolling boulder shown in the vids)or a dragon might come crashing through the trees and this above allcreates Tension throughout the adventure, which leads to caution.caution is wise here as your pawns can \"die\" if one does it's sent back to the \"rift\" where they come from. your main pawn may be resummoned from the rift if he or she dies. support pawns cost Rift Crystals to aquire and the more crystalsyou have the better class of pawns you can hire.overall this game is a Must Buy for Hack & Slash fans and action RPG fans aliketheres loads of content and the map is Huge, be ready to cough up some rare lootto fast travel though (No one rides for free I guess lol)not only are the pawns quite smart, so are the baddies they will flank you, use long range to their advantage and annoy big monsters to lure then to you.(so evil of them...) renting pawns is done through a rift stone 9they're scattered everywhere it seems) and a quest awaits you around every corner.some of which take you underground into caves and labyrinths filled with the dead (some of which can posses party members lol) you must use a lantern in these dark places and you'll need to be sure to bring loads of Lantern Oil.enemy types are quite varied with quite a few that will be easily identified byRPG'rs and D&D; fans. the enemies range from standard fare goblins on up to Chimera,Harpies, Evil Eye (think Beholder) Hydra, Cyclops, Trolls, Ogres and moreall for you to climb on and give a beating (provided you have the stamina which is important in this game)Some NG+ infoyou get Portstones (which can be bought at the black cat in NG+) too which help a ton. (lets you set a spot to use ferrystones to Go to!)you get one of these at the top of blue moon tower.and at the end, the game IS NOT OVER! it's not only got NG+ (new game+)but it has endgame content only available After beating the game. so there's Tonsto do. also they keep adding new quests and other stuff via DLCthe game is a blast if you're hesitating about picking it up, don't.I haven't had this much fun with an RPG in years.I'd recommend being at least lvl 50 before going for the end.it's not due to the end boss rather, it will be eternal nightafter the \"final Battle\" and is extreamly difficult. so be ready andwell equipped.this game seems to be going back to\"the good ole days\" of RPG's. I was shocked to see almost no fast travel (and I love it) (well, there IS fast travel but you need Ferrystones that you find (rarely) and they're extreamly valuable. also for resurrection you need Wakestones that you find in shards and need Three to Resurrrect your character. while this may sound difficult, it's great to use in times of dire need.) but I find it refreshing since it really makes you explore the whole world and as such, makes the game last longer (and the sun setting much more scary lol) also from the good ole days is the Lantern! How surprised I was at actually having to use the lantern in the dark (most games I turn the gamma up and I'm fine, not here though) and of course the brutal difficulty. it really makes me feel like I am playing old days D&D.; I just love the game and it's exactly what I have been looking for on the ps3. I will sum it up in two words: Simply Stellar!Gameplay: 4 of 5 stars due to the lack of a lock on. climbing is fun though.Graphics: nicely polished and interesting locations 5 of 5 starsSound: an excellent score backs up the sound of combat 4 of 5Controls: fairly easy to learn, menus can be a pain to navigate 5 of 5 starsFun: the game is a blast whether you're climbing a hydra lopping off it's heads one by one or bashing the undead in dark caverns. the battle system really makes the game shine. 5 of 5 starsOverall: a must buy for RPG and Action RPG fans it will not fail to please.5 of 5 stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2012"}

The transition from Human to Undead was superb, especially. The expansion pack does far less to follow in the main game's heavy footsteps, but that depends somewhat on viewpoint and still does a fair job of a complex world with complex characters - even if some complexity of previous characters like Illidan are flatter.Story: 7.8/10The cutscenes are superb, but I thought that the interface felt more cluttered than helpful. The units seemed decent but there are no few sights of jagged polygons if you zoom in. Most strategy gamers likely won't notice, but the particle effects are often repeated unimaginatively. This game looks good, but could've done better - especially for the system requirements.Graphics: 7/10Effects seemed appropriate in general, but like the particle effects showed a lot of repetition when it seemed like some more variance was called for.Sound: 6.5/10Music was very good in general, excellent during the cutscenes. There were a few points in game play that I thought it edged into boring or inappropriate to the context, but few games manage a spot-on sound and at least it seemed good throughout.Music: 7.6/10This is one of the first strategy games to truly differentiate at least three different playable factions. Blizzard must have listened closely to their beta testers, because balancing seems generally good despite the significant difference in styles represented by Night Elves, Humans, Undead, and Orcs. There are a few flaws and points that could have been further expanded to exploit varying styles, but it all works fairly well and the editor gives a dizzying array of options. Like many strategy games, most units can't seem to strike outside one screen, but Total Annihilation was the only game I've seen to effectively use artillery.Gameplay: 6.8/10The story is linear, without even optional missions to subtly alter character or gameplay like Command & Conquer: Tiberian Sun. However, an extremely powerful built-in editor allows players to create maps, units, even abilities - on the scale of the developers! It's dizzying, though creating truly new units is a little difficult, but modifying to unheard of levels is rather easy and practically everything the developers used in the campaign is at your fingertips. Despite the linear story, this power leads me to rank Warcraft 3 even higher than Ratchet & Clank in terms of staying power. This is pushed even further in the expansion pack Frozen Throne.Replayability: 7.8/10Gameplay follows a well-developed genre, and while the system requirements and graphics are a little more strained than necessary I thought that everything was executed extremely well. It's also all in one volume and lacks intrusive DRM, unlike Starcraft 2.Overall: 7.1/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2011"}

Once you have enough blocks connected, they'll shoot back up into the sky to form planets on the upper screen.","reviewerName":"Suzanne Amara","summary":"TOTALLY addictive---incredibly fun!","reviewText":"This game is very hard to describe when trying to make it sound as good as it is.  Many people might say it's Tetris like, which it is to a SMALL extent, but it's far more.  The basics of the game is trying to line up 3 falling blocks of the same color---when you do, they fly up into the sky and blast enemies.  There is a little bit of a story line, but mainly, you are just trying to line up those blocks!  The fun comes in that there are many different playing field to do this with, and each is a little different---different gravity, different strategies that work best, different kinds of blocks.  And wildly different music---I am not someone that usually is that into music in video games, but this music is GREAT---it ranges from a country twang to a outer space sound to almost classical, and it really gets you into a groove.  The other cool thing is that any block you manage to shoot into space gets added to your store of blocks, which you use to unlock more planets, and to unlock special kinds of blocks that do things like clear the board.  You can play multi-player against the computer, but I so longed to try this in real multi-player mode I actually broke down and bought a second DS.  I think I'm going to buy a second copy of the game, too, so I can use all the multi-player options (with one copy, you can play a limited version two player)  This is the kind of game that makes you want to keep playing just a little more, to try to get a new planet, to try to make a new goal, just to see what the next area sounds and looks like...a TERRIFIC game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-02-2005"}
{"product_name":"B002EE5SAC","reviewerName":"Nightmare","summary":"Killer fighting game","reviewText":"If you like fast paced fighting games, you will love Tatsunoko Vs. Capcom: Ultimate All-Stars.  This is the definitive fighter for the Wii, and possibly for all three major systems.  The graphics are beautiful and stylish.  3-D character models and enviornments with cel-shaded style is perfect for this kind of game, the controls are flawless, and the character roster is impressive.  Few fighting games are this well-rounded with quality oozing out of every aspect of the game.There are a wide variety of different characters to choose from so things don't get old.  You make a team of 2 characters that you can switch between mid battle to form impressive combos, but there are two characters (PTX-40A and Golden Lightan) that are so big that they don't get a partner.  This was a nice addition since it mixes things up a bit (PTX-40A is my favorite character so far, although Ryu and Tekkaman are pretty darn awesome as well).  I actually like the fact that Tatsunoko characters are in the game since it brings in a completely new roster of characters not well known in America.The controls are variable to a wide degree.  You can play with simple controls (using just the Wii remote) for novice gamers, Nunchuk + Wii remote, and Classic Controller/Gamecube Controller for experts.  There are a wide variety of moves to pull off so technique and skill are very important to success.Japanese voice-overs remain which will please many fans.  I would have liked to hear English voice-acting, but there is something to appreciate about listening to your characters speaking Japanese.  I guess it makes it feel more authentic.There is the usual Arcade mode for blasting through each stage until you fight the final boss, and there are several difficulty levels to choose from (10 if I remember correctly).  Survival tests your ability to last as long as possible, Time Attack sends you through a set number of levels to see how fast you can achieve victory, and Wi-fi is available to play against opponents worldwide.  There are also plenty of unlockables including characters, color schemes, art work, and minigames (haven't unlocked any of these so I'm not sure how good they are).  The replay value is through the roof, and I really think this is the best fighting game I've ever played.Anybody considering buying this game needs to pick this up immediately.  Let Capcom know they did an excellent job with this game!Overall--9.5/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2010"}

AR Feature Is Fun.","reviewText":"I've been waiting to get my hands on this game since it was announced for the PS Vita and I'm glad to say, this game delivers. If you bought the console (PS3) version last year, then the Vita version will make youf feel at home; the main menu looks exactly as the bigger console counterpart,Scorpion punching the snot out of Sub-Zero. The Vita version offers an array of new modes. All classic costumes are included, some other costumes are unlocked by completing challenges. All 32 fighters are included in this version including DLCs from the console version such as Rain, Skarlet and Freddy Krueger. Of course, Kratos is there.At the main menu you will see:FightStory Mode : A retelling of the arcade classics from MK1 to MK3)Challenge Tower: Konquer Hundreds of Challenges from The Tower of The Elder Gods.Bonus Challenge Tower: Master an all new set of challenges. Touch, Slice and balance your way to the top)Training: a way to learn and master the moves.Versus: online and localExtras: Krypt, Nekropolis, Kredits.Options: Controls, GamePlay, Audio/Video (including contrast and brightness)Select \"Fight\",there you have:Ladder (just like the console cousin)Tag Ladder:Tag team tournament using 2 players. (tagging done with the R stick)Test Your Balance: where you use the Vitas motion to keep your balance or dieTest Your Slice: think of fruit ninja, but with body parts...bloody good time!Test Your Luck: Slot machine wheelsTest Your Might: fill up the meter and smash through difficult objectsTest Your Sight: Find the object under one of the heads or dieTest Your Strike: Just  like test your might, but precision is the name of the game.The game runs at a smooth 60 FPS without any hicups. I was able to perform special moves/combos/fatalities without much effort; and just like the original version, you can pause at any time to look at the list of commands. X-Ray moves are performed by pressing LB+RB at the same time, if you want to do an enhanced super move, simply press RB while performing the move, simple. Fatalities are easy to pull and we can now use the touch screen, which by the way, is freaking sweet. I'm sure many of you saw the trailers where players had to wipe blood off the screen; luckily, this is only done during challenges.Touch Fatalities: This is a new feature that makes the game that much more enjoyable for Vita owners. The way you do it is, simply look at the moves needed for the fatality, for example, foward, back, down, down (not an actual fatality), then simply swipe your finger in those directions and voila! The sweet, bloody mess is all yours to enjoy.The AR Feature: it is sweet! BUT, as of now, can only be used in practice mode. I hope in the future a patch is released to be able to use it during actual fights. This is how to do it: In \"Practice\" at the fighter selection screen, press the TRIANGLE key, this will take you to the arena selection, once you're there, scroll to the arena of  your choice (but do not press anything to chose it)then press LB+RB at the same time, you will hear a loud laughter, indicating AR has been unlocked; next chose your figthers, the game will load, the arena you wanted will now have AR backgrounds, enjoy the view!Some have complained about the game's graphics, and I have to admit, the characters look a bit out dated and blocky, but that was a sacrifice needed to have a fluid frame rate. Don't be fooled though, the game still looks good, considering the limitations. I know the Vita is supposed to be a powerful system, but you have to take into account the complexity of this game, if you owned the the PS3/360 versions, you know how detailed the game was; trying to cram all that info into a small flash based card is a challenge on its own. I have been playing the game for many hours now and I can tell you, THIS IS NOT A LAZY PORT. The game's controls and mechanics have been re-done from the ground up, to fit the PS Vita's needs and capabilities. The adition of touch/balance features is something every Vita owner will appreciate and will keep you playing for a long time.MP was also a breeze. I was able to connect without any issues and in no time I was getting my ass handed to me online.If you want to enhanced the experience, I suggest you get a PS Vita grip such as thisCTA Digital PS Vita Hand Grip. That grip makes it much easier to play, due to its ergonomic design, that makes you feel like your holding a PS3 controller.In conclusion, if you are a true fan of the series, this game won't disappoint you, so do NOT SKIP this one. It comes packed with tons of extra content and modes that take advantage of the Vita's features. It is worth every penny of the $40 hands down. Players new to the series will enjoy it and long-time fans will rejoice having bloody fatalities in the palm of their hands. Peace.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2012"}

Penniless and shipless, you venture around a space dock until you find a ship and a job. You'll encounter a heady mix of canned missions that follow one main quest, and a million opportunities to make money or aggravate the various factions that co-exist in the universe. Like an online role-playing game, or Bethesda'sMorrowind, you determine who your enemies are and who your friends are by your own actions, and, in another nod to role-playing, you can customize your ship with guns, rockets, and equipment just as you would customize a RPG character with swords, bows, and magic items. Best of all, you can play cooperatively with friends or fight it out with enemies online.The backstory posits a future where various countries, divided by both nationality and, seemingly, race, have boarded massive colony ships and ventured into a wormhole that appeared within reach of our crude space technology. They found themselves in a galaxy far, far away and they got stuck there when the wormhole collapsed. They quickly colonized new home worlds and named everything with familiar locales that make navigation a breeze. In the American sectors you'll feel at home entering the New York system and landing at a spaceport called Manhattan, for example. While contrived, this device is used beautifully and it's far better than having to memorize a bunch of sci-fi names and remembering where they are, perfect for a massive universe such as this one.ThoughFreelanceris set in space, it is technically not a space simulation. The game was designed to be accessible to casual gamers. For example,Freelancermakes you use the mouse for ship control. This is quite a shift for a game genre normally known to require joystick control. But even old-schoolWing CommanderorX-Wingfans may find that the sacrifice of verisimilitude is made up for with gains in agility. The mouse controls your guns, while you use the keyboard to maneuver around the rich universe that developer Digital Anvil has constructed. Much like a first-person shooter, you can dodge and weave while precisely blasting your enemies.Despite the game's age, its graphics are spectacular, as is the sound and voice acting, and in that way, fighting and trading with friends or alone,Freelancerproves worth the wait. Just keep in mind that it is explicitly not a hardcore space simulation, and you'll have to leave your joystick on the shelf.--Andrew S.

I really tried getting use to flying with the mouse but it gets silly, especially when I got into a dogfight with the lightweight enemy fighters in the game. If I could use a joystick they would not last 5 seconds, the enemy AI is that bad. It makes the whole issue of combat in the game seem like a side issue.Plus the game starts getting jittery in spots.

Take control of two  heroes, Jonathan Morris, a vampire killer and his close friend Charlotte Orlean, a girl with tremendous magical ability. Amidst the chaos of World War II,  two mysterious sisters emerge, and design a plan to resurrect Dracula. Join Jonathan and Charlotte as they attempt to thwart the terrible plan to resurrect  Dracula.Fight vicious bosses as you play the character of Jonathan and  Charlotte.Choose which character you want to control on the fly.Explore the depths of the castle.Seek out the evil  Brauner.Game StorylineInCastlevania: Portrait of Ruin, players take on the role of Jonathan Morris and  Charlotte Orlean. During World War II, many lost souls from the global conflict were left to wander the world in search of salvation. Desperate to escape  their terrible plight, they sought to resurrect Dracula's Castle from the rubble of society, assisted by two mysterious vampire sisters. Now Jonathan and  Charlotte must work together to confront the two vampire sisters, and ensure that this villainous catastrophe is not unleashed on the world.GameplayEvolving the action-adventure gameplay that has been the series' trademark for 20 years,Castlevania: Portrait of Ruinlets players switch  freely between Jonathan and Charlotte as they proceed on their heroic mission, each with their own strengths, abilities and style of play. Players can now  utilize powerful combination attacks in which both characters unleash the full extent of their combat abilities to decimate the game's more than 100  different enemies and bosses. In their quest to stop Dracula's resurrection, Jonathan and Charlotte can collect and use different weapons, equipment, and  items to increase their overall skill level and acquire new abilities.As mentioned before, players can switch freely between both characters, a  necessary option to win the game. For instance, you need to analyze certain situations and carefully choose to play either Jonathan or Charlotte in order to  successfully battle against the vampire army. The two characters can also combine their powers to pull-off powerful combo attacks. Their combined abilities  are needed in certain parts of the castle in order to progress through the game.The game has two different endings. Both endings involve the prevention  of Dracula's resurrection, however only one actually involves the defeat of Brauner. Different choices allow for a uniquely diverse gameplay experience.Castlevania: Portrait of Ruinsupports the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection with a limited cooperative play mode feature. There is an online shop mode used through  Wi-Fi as well. Players are able to put their items up for sale in a realistic marketplace. And perhaps best of all, when another player buys the item, the  selling player gains the money but doesn't lose the item.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Better than Dawn of Sorrow","reviewText":"Hot off the heels and success of Konami's Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow, they went back to the drawing board and developed a brand new game for the Nintendo DS. Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin was released in 2006 and made improvements in just about every area of the game. Overall, it's a better effort than Dawn of Sorrow and was made for the fans.If you've played Dawn of Sorrow, then you will immediately feel at home. Portrait of Ruin is very similar to the previous title in terms of gameplay, controls and acquiring weapons, accessories, relics and magic spells. This time around, you control two main characters. Each of them has their own strengths, weaknesses and preference of attack methods and accessories. Jonathan uses sub-weapons and get better if he uses them for long periods of time while Charlotte casts magic spells. You can switch between them at any time and they both share the same health and weapon energy bars. They also can be summoned at the same time to perform special attacks on enemies and bosses. There's a castle that needs to be explored again but now there are paintings scattered throughout with additional stages that your characters can jump into a la Mario in Super Mario 64. And just like in DoS, you can save your progress in any room marked in red on the map you see on the top screen of the DS. Beat the game and you unlock bonus content.The PROS: The game makes improvements in the graphics, music and sound effects so it looks better than Dawn of Sorrow. Using two characters at the same time brings more strategy to the table and it never feels like a chore switching between the two of them. They compliment each other and you'll need to switch between them to access certain areas. Using their simultaneous special attack feature helps deal with the tougher enemies and bosses further into the game. In addition to the main story, you have the option to complete side quests to earn money and extra items. On top of the \"same as before but nice anyway\" bonus content, there is some online connectivity now. You can open up a virtual shop and sell items you collected by connecting online with other players. Just like before when you and a friend can run through stages and see who finishes first, this time you can do the same thing online. The difficulty level here is more balanced out than it was in Dawn of Sorrow but will still give players a challenge regardless.The CONS: Setting up your own virtual shop to sell items is cool but it's only fun if there are people who connect online and from what I have seen, not many people connect online with this game. The same goes for the VS 2 player mode where you race another person through custom stages and see who can finish first. Both of these online features are nice but it would have been cool to play through the game with another person online or at least flesh out the custom stages. Other than the new story, characters, map and paintings, it's the same Castlevania experience you played before.Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin is really for the fans of the popular video game series. There is more variety now and the game is more catered to the DS as well. Those who don't like the direction the handheld Castlevania games has followed will not pay attention to this game. Everyone else should check it out and once again, it's a fun game that will keep you busy for awhile even if the experience is familiar.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"Third Person Shooting Perfected","reviewText":"I played and thoroughly enjoyed Max Payne 2. Remedy did a fantastic job, and I was disappointed that the fall of Max Payne went mostly unnoticed. Thankfully, Rockstar noticed, and if the second game was Max's fall, than the third starts with him at rock bottom. Max Payne 3 revels in its status as Noir, and that aspect defines every aspect of its presentation. Color shifts, dynamic camera work, voice overs, and bullet time are all dripping in hard boiled coating and it is wonderful. The atmosphere is constant and pervasive, doing as much story telling as the spot on voice acting. From the wealthy,decadent clubs and yachts to the filthy and hopeless streets, the level design never fails to impress. Thankfully, the gameplay is even better.What you point at, Max can shoot. You would be surprised how many games fumble on that basic concept, but Max Payne takes it a step further. Bullet time and shoot dodge combine to make a combat engine that, when done correctly, is not just fast,fun, and efficient; it can be downright beautiful. There is a fully functional cover system, that you will most definitely need, but this is not a cover based shooter. Kick down a door, run into a room, activate bullet time, and head shot the first three closets bad guys. When the other five men with guns react, shoot dodge behind the nearest cover, taking out another two as you go. Not letting grass grow under their feet, the enemy AI will be on you in an instance. As they leave cover to flank you, surprise them buy jumping onto the desk you're hiding behind, and shoot dodge forward, diving through the air taking one guy out. You look for the other guy, but he managed to get behind you. You practically pirouette while still in mid air, doing a full one eighty and pump him full of lead before hitting the ground and sliding across the floor, still on your back, guns raised and ready for the next wave of bad guys that come flooding through the door. Thankfully, you didn't waste precious time getting up. Still prone on your back, you unload on the door, taking several of them out, sending the rest into cover, giving you valuable time to do the same. The scenario I just described was not one of the games many fantastic scripted events; that is every encounter.There are many scripted events, none of which I will spoil, that give the game a summer blockbuster feel that never gets old. The characters you are close to, you will grow attached to. The enemies are ruthless and you will come to hate them. The story is strong but nothing revolutionary. There are golden gun parts to find, grinds ( or stunts) to perform, and every level is different. There are only a couple of problems.Firstly, Max Payne has never been an easy game, but Max Payne 3, at times, can be downright brutal. Granted, I did play on hard my first time through, but there are still two difficulty levels above that! Casual gamers, or those not great at shooters, be warned; this game is absolutely unforgiving. The second problem ties directly into the first. You will die in this game, many, many times. A part of dying is waiting for the considerable load times, and having to watch the many, wonderfully done cutscenes over, and over, and over again. There is an option to skip some of them, but by the time the game has loaded enough to do so, they will be practically over. Max Payne is not a short game, but the frequent deaths couple with the soul draining load times and cutscenes will make it feel much longer, and for many, will deter repeat playthroughs.I have not played the multiplayer myself, but have heard good things. if I ever have occasion to dip my toe in, I will update this review.Bottom line, Max Payne is the most polished, challenging, rewarding, third person shooter out today, and you owe it to yourself to experience it. A definite buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Big Daniel McFoot","summary":"mario party is back... more great multiplayer fun!","reviewText":"Generally speaking, a good party consists of loud music, obnoxious people you don't really know, copious amounts of cheap vodka, and a few loose women. While Nintendo's Mario Party 4 doesn't rely on any of the above, it does provide a digital alternative to raging hangovers and vague memories of the previous night's activities. Although it's the fourth title in the series, it's the first Mario Party game on the GameCube, and it packs a decent four-player punch.Mario Party 4 goes a little above and beyond its previous incarnations, and thanks to some skillful development from Hudson Soft, eight of your favorite Nintendo characters are ready to do battle through over 50 nutty mini-games in order to win a juicy prize. Lending itself to a very simple gameplay premise, Mario Party 4 is best enjoyed with four human players -- the idea is to be guy that collects the most hidden stars and gold coins at the end of a party. Each party is played over a selectable number of turns (from between ten and 50 -- ten turns takes around 30 minutes to play) on one of five themed game boards.Some familiar faces are on hand to meet and greet the party-players. Toad, Shy Guy, Koopa, Boo, and Goomba all offer a game board with themes such as the \"Seaside Soiree,\" the \"Haunted Bash,\" and the \"Jungle Jam.\" There are eight Nintendo-friendly guys and gals to choose from at the player select screen: Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Daisy, and Waluigi. There are essentially two main modes of play in Mario Party 4.Party mode is where the most fun occurs and involves between one to four human players getting jiggy on any of the game boards. Story mode is the single-player component of the game and pits you against three randomly selected CPU-controlled guys. If you win the game, you'll be awarded a prize, and depending on which character you were playing as, it'll be different each time (e.g. Playing as Waluigi, I won Waluigi's Shelf, which is one of many unique pieces of furniture that can be found for his mini-apartment -- viewable in the prize room).One new feature to the series is the mini-mega system -- which manifests itself in the form of two different mushroom-based items. These items can be taken before you roll the die at the beginning of turn. A mini-mushroom will shrink you down, allowing you to access other areas of the board, but it'll limit your maximum die roll to five instead of six. Being mini will allow you to tackle some special \"mini\" mini-games too.Going the other route and taking a mega-mushroom, will in contrast increase the size of your guy, and it'll give you a combined roll of two dice, increasing your ability to travel further around the board. You'll also squish any players that you travel past, causing them to hemorrhage value gold coins. Being large also means you'll be immune to any event spaces on the board. The mini-mega system is cool in theory, but in actuality, it doesn't really add that much to the gameplay.There are a ton of new items, events, traps, and bonuses that are scattered through the game -- such as the Genie Lamp which costs 30 coins to buy -- but it'll warp you straight to the current star on the board. All these factors throw more uncertainty into the mix, with the final game experience getting more and more random compared to the first three games in the series. Is this a bad thing? It depends on your point of view, but it can be pretty frustrating to be on top for most of the game and then have it all snatched away at the last minute. There are a few constants; these arrive at the very end of the game in the form of stars awarded to the player that collected the most coins, won the most mini-games, and triggered the most event features.There's no doubt that Mario Party 4 sports classic multiplayer fun and all of the mini-games are a blast in their own right, but there's one hugely annoying factor -- the CPU controlled characters. In the single-player mode, you'll be forced to watch the CPU guys take their individual turns.This happens at a mind-numbingly slow pace, and after a few games you'll be begging to have bamboo shoots inserted under your fingernails to alleviate the tedium. Essentially, the single-player game exists to let you win the prizes -- something that becomes very unimportant all too quickly.Huge Mario gets ready to squash the others. Putting those issues aside, Mario Party 4 as an actual party game, works really well. Teamwork, smack talk, and cajoling come heavily into play, and it's certainly the best in the series to date. The GameCube provides the graphical grunt to take Mario Party 4 to the next level and all of the characters, boards, and mini-games display slick animation, special effects, and a sweet bouncy-cartoony look and feel. Controls for the most part are extremely simplistic, but this really only adds to the pick-up-and-play nature of the game as a whole. There's a myriad of nice Nintendo-tastic tunes, voices, and sound effects, which wrap the game up into a well-presented, good-looking game.For those that enjoy Nintendo's rich characters and imagination, Mario Party 4 is a great game to have. With four-players in tow, it's a total blast, but for those that are looking for some solid, non-anger-inducing solo play, you'd do well to swerve away from this one for sure.The Lowdown: More of the same great Mario Party multiplayer action.Pros: It looks great; the mini-games are a hoot; really good fun with four players.Cons: More features aren't necessarily a good thing; there's little fun when flying solo.BIG DAN's OVERALL RATING - 7.5/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2002"}

It's better than its predecessor in  every way, and arguably the best 2-D fighting game to grace the Dreamcast.The amount of playable characters is enough to put any fighting fan's salivary  glands in overdrive. Beginning with favorites such as Spider Man, Wolverine,  Ryu, and Chun Li, players can eventually unlock 56 characters. We had our hands  full just mastering a few of these fighters, and getting familiar with all 56  would take months of intense practice. There are almost too many moves, all  depicted with superb animation and augmented by several tag-team combos. When  the match begins, you can pick three characters. Once things heat up, you can  call in your pals to unleash a massive move on your opponent. This adds  immensely to the game's depth, and button mashers will be in for a shock when  they find that their mistimed tag-team moves backfire.Visually, this game is intense. The large characters are slightly jagged around  the edges, but that's more than compensated for by the massive amount of  animation frames, colorful special effects, and stunning 3-D backgrounds that  are loaded with detail.Marvel vs. Capcom 2also delivers a sonic  performance that is nearly arcade-perfect. This is a must-buy for any fighting  fan, especially those who have a couple of buddies to bash. Just be prepared to  put in a lot of time in practice mode if you want to get good.--T.

Though previous FF titles offered battle systems, story elements, and world designs that were unique enough to sustain a loyal fandom, FFIV was the first home run.Though FFIV, originally released in the U.S. on the Super Nintendo as \"Final Fantasy 2\", lacks the complexity of proceeding titles such as FF6 and on, this game offers much to RPG fans. I'll add that if you've never played an RPG before, FF4 is a wonderful choice as an introduction balancing challenge and simplicity well.In this game you control Cecil and his band of warriors as they attempt to thwart a powerful dark wizard and a corrupt kingdom from unleashing ultimate destruction upon their world. Cecil is a conflicted character who must betray his own kingdom and his whole way of life to wield the power to fight evil. (I'm not giving much away here, you find this out in the first five minutes or so).When I say world I mean world. This game was one of the first to enable you to explore a mode 7 \"globe\" complete with continents, landforms, and towns. As you seek new powers to aid you in your quest, you will also make new friends, discover new weapons, more efficient forms of transport, and you will add and (gulp) lose beloved party members along the way. A new player could spend 40-60 hours playing this game before reaching the end of this tale.Ultimately, FF4 delivers well designed gameplay and an easy to use battle system, a compelling story, memorable characters (slashdot.com still uses Tellah and Edward as icons for their gaming articles), and beautiful music to keep you playing to the finish. Trust me, you'll like it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000Z9A95M","reviewerName":"J.M.","summary":"Just Buy It!","reviewText":"Okami is one of the most unique, interesting, exciting, cultural, and revolutionary games to hit the shelves.Graphics- Wow.  Japanese art really brings this game to life in 3D.  The colors are bright and vivid.  There are almost no glitches and the characters look great.  Throughout the whole game you will never forget that you are in Japan.Gameplay- Hmm... where to start.  It has the familiar and welcome formula as the Zelda games, but once again, the game turns it into something of it's own.  You are in a huge Japanese world called Nippon and must restore the areas that are cursed by evil ( a bit like the Twilight Zones in Zeldas, except you can't go in them).  This can be done by making Guardian Saplings bloom with your Celestial Brush.  The brush is a powerful tool that freezes the game so you can draw stuff that help you fight enemies or do whatever you have to do.  You have to play it to see what I'm talking about.  With the brush you can do things such as turn day into night or the other way around, draw a bomb, create a stream, or make a gust of wind.  The power of nature is in your hands!  The Celestial brush has 13 handy techniques.  They help you get through dungeons.  The dungeons are nice because they aren't too long, yet aren't too short.  In games like Zelda, the dungeons were way too long.Sound- Beautiful Japanese music plays in the background.  When you speak to other creatures, there voice sounds like Animal Crossing voices.Plot- The plot is my favorite out of any game I've ever played.  The story is based on a real Japanese legend, making it very interesting.  There are many cutscenes that make you excited to go to the next area/dungeon.  The plot can't be described in only a few sentences, so you can figure it out for your self.  There's a cool twist at the end!To sum it up, Okami is an outstanding game that anyone shoud at least rent.  it is very similar to Zelda, so if you love Zelda  you'll also fall in love with Okami.  It is a perfect blend of all elements that a game should have.  Parents, ignore the teen rating and just buy it for your kids.  It is very educational.  There is a lot of alcohol reference, but the sake they drink is just pretend.  Just Buy it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2008"}

I picked up a copy of Battlefield 3 from my local Blockbuster and was sorely disappointed.  The campaign, while beautiful (FrostBite 2 engine) is fairly easy.  I put the game down after playing approximately 30 minutes  having selected Normal difficulty.  It plays like a movie with destructible environments.  There is nothing more to this game other than what the FrostBite 2 engine creates and that is it's downfall.  Gameplay is extremely weak and I wouldn't recommend a purchase unless you are a die-hard multiplayer fanatic!  However, if the multiplayer portion of the game is anything like what was experiencec playing the Operation Metro beta, I would steer clear of it considering the frequency of glitches!  Being locked in prone mode frozen in the terrain is just inexcusable.  C'Mon Dice, create a quality product before you release a game.

Unlike other game environments that serve as nothing more than a visual backdrop, the devastating Helghan climate takes a notable toll. And, worst of all, the Helghans know exactly how to use the planet against you.The in-your-face perspective comes to life as you take aim with exotic new weapons and mainstays from the previous games, including the M82-G assault rifle.

And the audio experience is no less impressive. 7.1 surround sound capability lend a truly dynamic sound element to your experience, while audio occlusion with wave tracing means that you can hear the difference between indoor and outdoor firefights.Chaotic Multiplayer Drama OnlineWhile single-player mode lets you take on the unique challenges of 11 fully developed levels, online play lets you engage with up to 32 players at a time, bringing the gritty, realistic chaos of war to a whole new level.Other multi-player friendly enhancements in Killzone 2 include in-game clan management, a match wagering system, and the ability to integrate new information and track friends and enemies with the community at Killzone.com.","reviewerName":"Jose Marval","summary":"Great game with the best online shooter in this gneration","reviewText":"When I turned on my PS3 with my brand new 60$ copy of killzone 2, I was amazed. the graphics are awesome, the gameplay is great, the sound is fantastic. If I had to rate each part of this game I had to give it 5 stars in almos everything. Yet as a whole, Its an 9/10.First, The bad. the story of the game has its highs but is somewhat poor. Its like they thought of it in a short priod of time and had not the best intention to create a really captivating story. That makes the single player campaign far from great. Besides, it ends too fast. The campaign is too short for me.The best of the game is the online multiplayer. It doesnt require a fast internet connection, the range of weapons and classes is excellent, and the way each class complements and balances with the other is very good (except for one of the misile launchers whichs sometimes messes the game up). You could easily group with three players and share voice communication and positions, making it easy and fun playing with friends online.After all, they missed a really good chance in making an EPIC game with a better longer story, and perhaps a co-op campaing mode. They had all the ingredients there. But after all, Killzone 2 deserves at least 4 stars (I rate it 4.5), with outstanding graphics and mechanics, excellent sound, and the best online shooter this generation, for any console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Street Jay","summary":"Playstation Fan must own","reviewText":"I never owned the PSP, to me it just was to big (reminded me of Sega Gamegear). When the Sony PS Go came out all I saw was a huge waste of money, then the Vita came out and I was very interested but decided to wait. I bought a Wii U and realized there were no games out for that console so I sold it and with the funds bought myself this bundle.Right off the bat I loved this little guy, the touch pad was very easy for me to understand and get around the menu's are simple and very straight forward. I bought this bundle because it enables both 3G/Wi-Fi and the 8gb. By the way little disclaimer if you have PSP titles on your PSN account the 8GB gets used real quick, I am purchasing a 32gb memory card for this guy, which I recommend if you has PSP titles and PS Plus account. Its another $80-$100 but worth it.I am a Mac user I have an iPhone, iPad, Macbook pro, and iMac and I love how they are all integrated to be used together with the iCloud and my info is with me everywhere. Now Sony has taken that approach and I believe Microsoft is going the same way. I love that I can back up my info to the PS3, and that the PS Plus and PSN accounts are linked to both devices which makes it much easier for me.I bought the MGS HD Collection, Little Big Planet, Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom, and Playstation All-Stars Battle Royal, so far the games are extremely fun to play. I have played a few other vita titles as so far nothing besides the horrible Call of Duty game have disappointed.If your on the fence about this item, you shouldn't be especially with the PS4 around the corner and how Sony plans to implement this system with your PS4 just sounds amazing to me. If this bundle is to much then go with the Wi-Fi model, the 3G alone is not worth it. So stop thinking about purchasing and purchase it already.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"The Matrix Fan \"Video Gamer since 1979.\"","summary":"Faithful to Toy Story...hard for younger gamers. A review from my child and I!","reviewText":"+ PROS:+ Infinite lives+ Reduced difficulty after 7 deaths in a row+ Co-op play+ The voice acting and music are SUPERB+ Free roam Toy Box mode offers lots of fun and creativity+ Only the PS3 version offers the ability to play as Zurg+ Compatible with the Playstation Move- CONS:- Some platform jumps are very difficult for younger gamers- The game and the instruction manual do not explain the reduced difficulty option- No instructions on how to switch 1P and 2P camera angles- Zurg is NOT immediately available; he has to be unlocked.- There is only one shooting stage that works with the Playstation Move, NOT Story Mode or Toy Box Mode.I played this game with my child and we decided the only way to do a proper review was to offer both our viewpoints. So without any further ado, here's what we thought!CHAPTER ONE: Train RescueMy thoughts: Woody played the action hero to a T, as he raced off to save a train full of orphans from the evil Dr. Porkchop. It fit the overall mood of Toy Story and I was very impressed. The jumping puzzles weren't too difficult to figure out here.Quotes from my child:  \"When I first played Woody, I thought the game would be easy and hard too. I died a lot, but when I figured out how to jump and move around, I liked trying to help the orphans. Those orphans needed to be saved. I felt happy not leaving any of them behind and getting a trophy.\"CHAPTER TWO: Andy's HouseMy thoughts: Unlike the first level's imaginary setting, our characters are set up in \"Toy Reality\" - we have to move around the room/basement with the limitations that a toy would go through. This level is designed to get us used to each character's strengths and weaknesses like Jesse being able to land on small areas, Woody using his pull string as a lasso, and Buzz throwing each character across long distances.Quotes from my child: \"When I was trying to get the cell phone, I knew this would be hard. My dad helped me when I got frustrated. When we got to the basement, my dad had to explain how the paratroopers flew. It was tricky getting to the cordless phone, but we figured it out.\"CHAPTER THREE: Buzz VideogameMy thoughts: This level was a lot harder than the previous two levels. It involved platform jumping, but unlike games like Super Mario Bros., this added the dimension of depth. The jumping goes from being challenging to extremely frustrating, especially for younger gamers.Quotes from my child: \"There were 3 parts to this level. The first was the shooting part - the game told me how to shoot the boulders, but I had to dodge rocks while flying and that was hard. The next part was jumping around on moon rocks and I thought that was hard too. There were so many broken pieces and I fell a lot. I didn't understand the part with shooting the crystals at first. The 3rd part was Zurg's fortress, and when those big spikes came at me I knew I would die, I had to run towards \"me\" which was confusing.\"CHAPTER FOUR: Sunnyside Daycare.My thoughts: This level was fun, but it's another one based in \"Toy Reality\" - you have to do a lot of platform jumping to get to the lights, and if you have brought the wrong character, it wastes time. Getting the special cards is not easy because you have to complete carnival games, which are tough for an old gamer like me, and extremely frustrating for younger gamers.Quotes from my child: \"I needed my dad's help to play this level because there were hard games like hitting all the aliens without missing any. I got angry when I would miss a jump and fall off the lights. There were lots of jumps.\"CHAPTER FIVE: Bonnie's HouseMy Thoughts: This level introduced some hard elements - up until now, we had platform jumps that were difficult, but on this level, the jumps have time limits. Instead of playing the game at a relaxed pace, now we have to run and complete jumps before we drown in coffee or fall to our deaths. This stage includes rail sliding on the spaceship, which reminded me ofRatchet & Clank: Tools of Destruction. We also had to pick up batteries...one false move and we had to go back and get the battery again.Quotes from my child: \"I drowned. A LOT. This level wasn't easy, I couldn't figure out where to jump. The rail sliding on the spaceship was super fast and tricky. The part with the peppermints made me angry because I fell a lot. I told my dad I'd have to be at least 15 years old to get past this part. I wanted to take breaks from playing because it kept getting harder with every level.\"CHAPTER SIX: Prison BreakMy Thoughts: As if the game wasn't hard enough, now a stealth element is added. We return to Sunnyside Daycare at nighttime, and the main goal of this level is to rescue your trapped toy friends. Buzz is not selectable, and you have to avoid searchlights while you wander around. Michael Scofield would be proud that I got through this level without being spotted.Quotes from my child: \"I kept getting caught! This wasn't as hard as Bonnie's house but I still needed help. I got mad when the lights found me but at least I wasn't drowning in coffee!\"CHAPTER SEVEN: JunkyardMy Thoughts: The first part of this level is saving 3 aliens from a chop-o-matic trash machine. Two player assistance is recommended but not required. If you haven't gotten used to switching between characters yet, this next part forces it on you. We have to save our friends before they are melted, crushed, and sliced into fish bait. Each character has a specific task that must be completed for the other two characters to move forward.Quotes from my child: \"I kept getting sad on this level because I didn't want Slinky or Hamm or anyone else to get hurt and when we didn't know what to do quick enough, I knew they wouldn't make it. My dad had to play most of this level.\"CHAPTER EIGHT: Haunted BakeryMy Thoughts: After all the previous stages, this level was a well-deserved change of pace. The level consists of running around and shooting an army of muffins and evil witches (yes, you read that correctly). There's no platform jumping to worry about: just shoot, shoot, shoot, and shoot some more.Quotes from my child: \"Finally, an easy level! My dad kept getting the toy balls and I played as Buzz, shooting the witches with the cannon. We got all the cards and hidden things and I smiled a lot.\"TOYBOX MODE:My Thoughts: This is a free-roam level that has no time limits. Players can unlock new townspeople, go on quests, compete in races, take pictures, buy cars and houses and shops from the Toy Store, it's very fun. Some areas can't be unlocked without performing certain tasks, which is a little confusing for younger gamers.Quotes from my child: \"I like Toy Box. This is a fun part of the game. I can wander around, get lots of gold, buy things from the toy store, and I want to get the little tuba guy who goes under water, he looks cute. I like watching the guy on the construction site when buildings are building. If I get lost, I talk to Mission Pig. If I want a new mission, I talk to Mayor Pig. I don't have to worry about coffee here!\"CONCLUSION?The music, storyline, voiceovers and character models are extremely faithful to the Toy Story universe.While it is rated \"E\" for everyone, that doesn't mean that everyone will have an easy time playing it. For example, In two-player mode, player one is on the left and player 2 is on the right. If you want to switch those camera views, both players have to press the L1 button at the same time. This is not explained in the instruction book or anywhere in the game itself.If your child gets frustrated by platform games likeSuper Mario Bros., they'll need your help with Story mode, and that's where the 2-player option really shines. In Toy Box mode, younger gamers will enjoy roaming around and creating their own little town.Recommended, but not for children who have difficulty with platform games.P.S. I quit drinking coffee.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2010"}

With a reputation for superior marksmanship and phenomenal hand-to-hand combat abilities, he's on the ground and up against a new strain of evil.You'll call his shots from the same over-the-shoulder third person viewpoint that distinguishedResident Evil 4, except this time you'll also have the option of playing as his teammate, the fierce, local Alomar. Whoever you play as, updates to the earlier version's third-person control scheme offer more options and promise intuitive interactions.Learn to Work TogetherThe new cooperative game play element focuses on the realities of a dual-agent mission, highlighting the ways in which Redfield and Alomar must work together to survive the unexpected, while still allowing them to split up and work alone. To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Twins Daddy","summary":"Kill Majini, Go To Next Level...Kill Majini, Go To Next Level...Kill Maj...Well, You Get The Idea","reviewText":"Bummer! This is the THIRD game in a row that's let me down. Is it a coincidence they're all Japanese 3rd Person Shooters (MGS4, Lost Planet, RE5)...And 2 of them are from Capcom? You'd think by the time a game series gets to number \"5\", all the good stuff would be kept and the bad stuff would've been eliminated. Well, it didn't work this time with the Resident Evil franchise...First off, I've never used the term BORING in reviewing a PS3 shooter/action game (unless referring to cut scenes). The GAMEPLAY of RE5 is the part that's actually BORING! The root of the problem is the enemy because there's not much variety. They're \"Majini\"...They're ALL freakin' Majini. There's Majini in the town of Kijuju...Majini in the Train Station...In the Savanna, the Marshlands, the Oil Field, etc, etc. You see the SAME Zombied-out Freaks EVERYWHERE and they either charge you, shoot flames at you or try to chop your head off with a chainsaw. That's pretty much all there is to it! And after you've faced them for a few levels, it gets OLD & TIRED real quick! In fact, only after you reach Ch 5 (of 6 Chapters) do you start seeing Lickers and a couple of other enemy types. This is not at all what I expected when I saw that awesome RE5 TV commercial (which looked much more terrifying than the game itself). And you'll notice the description on Amazon starts off, \"Tackle a horror-filled mission as Chris Redfield...\" Well, I've taken on infant diaper-changing missions that were more filled with \"horror\" than this game! The first 3 chapters all take place outside on sun-drenched days and you ALWAYS KNOW when Majini are on the way because they either play a cut scene of them coming or start playing \"scary\" music or you hear them roaring like lions. In other words, there's very little suspense...I also don't see how ANYONE could possibly prefer the convoluted targeting and shooting mechanics of this game. It's one thing to deal with it because you have no choice...But who could PREFER this mess? You're above and to the right of Redfield's shoulder looking towards him...He's pointing the gun and laser sight to his right. Every time I try to just target and shoot a Majini, even if he's only 5 freakin' feet in front of Redfield, I feel like I'm trying to bank the 8-Ball off the left rail into the right corner pocket! Is that supposed to feel \"natural\"? I wanted to see just how practical this is in real life. So I took my Glock to the range the other day and stuck my arms as far as I could down and to the left of my body while keeping both hands firmly on the gun (so as not to lose a thumb when firing)...Then I \"aimed\" my laser sight to the right (as Redfield does) to put it on target. Now I don't recommend anyone do this, but if you do (and you don't kill anyone with your shot or get thrown off the range), you'll experience just how RIDICULOUS it truly is to try and AIM & SHOOT a gun like this, even in a video game. Of course, if you could take a FIRST PERSON view with a shotgun, any Majini within 10 ft is easily toast...But with RE5's funky aiming mechanics, it's actually possible to shoot that same shotgun and completely MISS that target 10 ft in front of Redfield! Like everybody else I had to deal with this targeting system, but I absolutely DESPISE it! This had to be designed by someone who has NEVER AIMED & FIRED A REAL GUN...Another thing that makes no sense whatsoever to me is why a game that so proudly shows its two primary characters sporting guns on the game cover would ever be STINGY with ammo? WTH?!? You have to do A LOT of shooting to survive in this game...And most of the time 3 of the 4 or so guns I'm packing are ALREADY EMPTY while Sheva keeps yelling, \"I need ammo!\". Well, of course you do. Perhaps if you didn't keep firing away like your daddy owns the ammo factory you wouldn't keep eating it up like Ms. Pac-Man. I don't even HAVE any ammo for you...So just take this Stun Rod and shut the hell up, OK?WHY OH WHY is lack of ammo even a problem in this game? I mean, you pay thousands & thousands of $$$ to upgrade weapons, then you have nothing to put in them?!? At first I thought it was just me...I had over 30,000 dollars (or currency equiv) and went into the BUY section (can't miss it since it pops up everytime you clear a level or get killed) looking for ammo. What? You CAN'T BUY AMMO in this game? WTH is with THAT? Then I found it WASN'T just me. I went to my Google toolbar and started typing \"can you buy ammo\" and the toolbar filled in the rest with THREE of the 5 suggestions being some variation of \"RE5 or Resident Evil 5\"...I kid you not. So it wasn't just me...It was nearly EVERYBODY that plays this game and the search engine knew what I was going to ask before I could even ask it! I started reading elaborate plans for \"farming\" ammo. At first I was intrigued...Then it occured to me, ***Just how ASININE is it for PLAYERS to have to resort to 'farming ammo' in a shooter game when the DEVELOPERS HAVE FAILED to put adequate supplies of ammo in the game in the first place?!?***It's a rhetorical question, but the answer is still obvious: It's an absolute CLUSTER SCREW-UP to have players farming ammo or walking around with empty weapons in a shooter-type game! To add insult to injury, the game even suggests via popup that you CONSERVE AMMO by taking on the Majini with hand-to-hand combat...Really, I'm NOT making this stuff up!! It's just UNFORGIVABLE for developers of a shooter game to INTENTIONALLY place inadequate amounts of ammo throughout the game, prevent you from buying any more and then TAUNT YOU to conserve what little ammo you have. It frankly DEFIES LOGIC!! I prefer to have ammo falling out of my pockets so I can concentrate on other things in the game besides a \"running out of ammo\" complex...And at a time when people are wearing surgical masks to avoid getting the Bird Flu & Swine Flu, does it really make a lot of sense to go rushing up into the faces of these virus-infected zombies for a little hand-to-hand? After all, THEY were exposed to the virus and they don't look so good...Then there are the stupid control issues. When Redfield targets a Majini his feet are nailed to the floor. Nothing quite like a little immobility when Majini are charging you! Also when targeting an enemy, it can take Redfield a good 5 sec to turn around and check his 6:00. And perhaps the most ridiculous of all, Redfield is shooting the approaching Majini and if his magazine runs out, he automatically goes through the re-load process...This means he can't run or melee or for goodness sake even DEFEND HIMSELF until the re-load is complete. Again, just WHO is developing these game controls?!? The targeting was developed by someone who's never shot a gun...And I'd like to see who would stand flat-footed in front of a Zombified chainsaw-wielding Freak and just casually re-load their weapon. These controls are just not practical and not what anyone would do in any of these situations. I don't like unrealistic video game controls and I also don't like having to fight the controller throughout the game!Of course RE5 is a Run&Gun; type game, contrary to what you may have heard...It's just a \"different\" kind of Run&Gun.; Instead of running FORWARD and shooting like you normally would, you'll find yourself turning around, running AWAY FROM Majini and bosses, stopping, turning back around and shooting. This tactic is frequently necessary to make up for the above control deficiences, the hit or miss aiming system and constantly needing to re-load or switch an empty for a loaded weapon. You'll also need to do this whenever you pull up your inventory, since the game doesn't pause. In trying to understand WHY these ammo & control issues weren't \"corrected\" before the game's release, I've read where they're BY DESIGN to create more \"tension\" for the player. While the goal is desirable, I found these things just created repeated FRUSTRATION during my play.The inventory system also stinks. For example, just how crazy is this: You have an empty grenade launcher. So you buy either exp or acid rounds for it (the only ammo you CAN buy in the game). The game automatically puts them in the L2 Inventory next to Treasures...But if you forget this, then you'll start the next level with a still empty grenade launcher even if you bought 4 boxes! So press \"O\" to exit \"BUY\" and select \"Organize\" and toggle down to the L2 Inventory slot to get them. Then it asks, \"Chris or Sheva\"? So you pick Chris and they go up into an empty slot. Then you have to toggle up and select them again and if you choose \"Equip\", he just walks around carrying a box of grenade launcher rounds. So you choose \"Combine\" then you have to toggle over and select the Grenade Launcher JUST TO GET THE FREAKIN' GRENADE LAUNCHER ROUNDS YOU JUST PURCHASED INTO THE EMPTY GRENADE LAUNCHER YOU'RE CARRYING!! Could it be more difficult? You'll also experience how quickly 9 + 9 inventory slots fill up when you're playing...And they mostly fill up with useless EMPTY weapons, not ammo.I see no reason to go much further. I'm obviously quite disappointed. However, I will mention something about the graphics. Everyone raves about the graphics of RE5, but there seems to be a strange \"metallic glow\" to everything, everywhere in this game combined with a nearly complete ABSENCE OF COLOR. Even skin tones are weird looking. I'm not saying the graphics are horrible because they aren't...But it's like someone said, \"Just make everything shiny looking and everybody will love it!\" So they got out their Shiny Pens and went to town with them...Maybe it's my imagination or my TV or even the graphics engine. Whatever it is, it distracted me to the point of people and environments looking hokey and not real, and it frequently reminded me that I was playing a video game. Just look outside your window and you'll see how the Real World has so much MORE COLOR than this game.Overall, I've concluded that Japanese-designed 3rd person shooters are simply NOT FOR ME! Give me a scope or iron sight, a FIRST person view and too much ammo to carry it all. When developers start using tricks and gimmicks to limit player involvement (like the ginormously long cut scenes and button prompts in the final 2 action scenes of MGS4 and the manic button-mashing prompts in the final boss battle of RE5) and designing intentionally clumsy controls (to artificially create \"tension\" that the game itself fails to produce) and coding in scarce ammo (that forces players to resort to time-consuming work-arounds like ammo farming), then it's pretty clear to me that there are still too many game developers in the marketplace. Sure, these 4th and 5th in a series games will sell millions of copies, with many going to loyal followers of each series...But I don't take too kindly to developers thinking they know what's best for me when I enter their gaming environment and FORCING their view of this on me with a bunch of hard code. This is such a 180 degree turn from the wide open sandbox environment of games like GTA4 where the developers basically say, \"Here are the keys...Take it for a spin and HAVE FUN!\" That kind of DEVELOPER ATTITUDE towards the GAMER simply makes for a SUPERIOR and MORE ENJOYABLE gaming experience...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"Sir Edmund Hillary \"Tenzing Norgay\"","summary":"Some Things are Great, But........","reviewText":"I have mixed feelings about this title. There are some elements that are designed well, while others fall flat. Since this game was developed from the original GTA designer, I expected a little more. \"Saint's Row\", while not as good as any GTA game, was still an impressive production, and is also a far more complete sandbox experience than \"Crackdown\". I still recommend playing the game, but make sure you either rent it or purchase it for a bargain price as others have recommended. For the potential buyer, listed below are the pros and cons:Graphics - Although some may be turned off from the cell-shaded graphics, they were designed well from an artistic standpoint. I felt I was engaged in a \"live comic book\" and from an atmospheric standpoint, I felt I was in a GTA game. It's truly the only reason why I still recommend playing the game. Another good thing was that there was never a load point past the initial load. The frame rate almost never dropped even with lots of non-player characters present and multiple explosions.  The explosions themselves were awesome and draw-in for distant objects was almost non-existent. With that said the vehicle models left little to be desired.Sound - Explosions, weapons, and overly dramatic narrator were cool. However, sound tracks are weak. I didn't recognize a single artist, and that would be ok if the music was actually good. Sound tracks is where GTA titles shine, even with their budget flicks, like \"Vice City Stories\" for PS2. Also, vehicle sounds were dismal.Game-play - This is a real mixed bag. The RPG-like ability enhancement function was comparable to \"GTA-San Andreas\", and that's a good thing. Weapon and melee control was also an improvement from GTA titles. The superhero abilities were great. However, I gave up on trying to drive anywhere in the \"game-scape\". The vehicles were designed horribly in every aforementioned category, and especially from a controls perspective. In any event, once your agility skills were ramped up, driving becomes moot because you can leap from building to building without the hindrance of sticking to the roads (like everyone's dream when stuck in traffic). Also, almost every mission has the same recipe: Find the boss's location, find a way to the get the top level where he/she is most likely hiding, while slaughtering legions of dumb NPCs along the way. Next, melee attack the boss and defeat them in under 15 seconds. Also, side missions are virtually non-existent, and what is  there is unimaginative. That stinks since there are less than 30 core missions.A special note: Game Save Functionality - I can't believe in the \"Next-Gen\" world with hard drives adequately saving endless save files, why most games don't have a \"save-at any-point/time\" functionality (the old XBOX had that for several games, BTW). While \"Crackdown\" improves game save functionality by saving every detail in real-time for ability progression, intra-mission saves were mysteriously left out. Therefore, you will be \"rinsing & repeating\" several iterative motions to get to the boss if you die along the way. I didn't mind that with a game like \"Ninja Gaiden Black\" because learning to perfect all the moves becomes instrumental during later game-play, and the controls were mega tight with no equal. However, for \"Crackdown\" which doesn't exactly have the state-of-the-art \"Ninja Gaiden-like\" game-play, the iterative motions are uninspiring  and take away from the overall experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2007"}

First of all there are actually less enemies to fight but it is still very challenging. I was actually able to beat this version unlike the last version in which the last chapter was just so overwhelmingly hard. In this version the last chapter is a lot easier. I felt like I finally was able to redeem myself from not being able to beat the original Ninja Gaiden 2. You have an auto aiming system with your projectile weapons so that makes this version easier as well. This could also be why there are not as many flying enemies in this version as well. Many of the enemies from the original were taken out but some new ones have been added. One noticeable one is the Statue of Liberty, who comes to life thanks to Alexie and is actually pretty tough to beat. The graphics have been improved from other Ninja Gaiden games. The variety of weapon choices is excellent. Playing with the female characters was interesting but R. Hayabusa is still the best. One other new feature that I enjoyed was Team Mission mode. You can pick a character and pick the character you want the computer to control and then pick a mission. There are several missions to choose from. Even the violence has been toned down for this game even though it is still very violent. Decapitations and dismemberment is still in the game but with less blood. You will actually see blue essence come from the enemies instead of blood when you cut their head off. Overall this Ninja Gaiden 2 is much better than the XBox 360 version.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"aka TRAP","summary":"The recent patch ruined it","reviewText":"DISCLAIMER:  I have not, and will not, complete the campaign.  Battlefield is known for the multiplayer, not the campaign.It's been around six months since I first picked up Battlefield 3, and over a year since my first dive into the series itself.  Bad Company 2 gave me an experience I will never forget.  It was the first time I ever played a game that demanded teamwork.  Killzone 2 kinda-sorta counts, but it was easy to play that game, do well by yourself, and somehow magically revive your team to victory.  But Rush in Bad Company 2 was my crack.Then comes the release of Battlefield 3.  I loved it as much as I loved Bad Company 2, but now it looked prettier and the weapons were updated.  Granted they all sounded the same to me, especially the pistols, but I still loved the game.  Rush, again, was my favorite gametype.But then came the patch around March(?) that was supposed to fix so many issues with the game, and add an option to rent servers and customize the game rules to your liking.This patch destroyed the game.  For one, they tried to fix the MAV issue by having them explode once they're used to kill someone.  However this is proved to be irrelevant due to the fact that the sniper can spawn another one as soon as the previous one is destroyed.  The Rent-A-Sever option lets you purchase the ability to host servers for others to join.  It sounds like a good idea at first, until you realized that the servers now feel like P2P servers instead of the official DICE and EA servers that have been replaced by Rent-A-Severs.  It wouldn't even be a bad thing if they kept their original servers in tact.  But instead, you're forced to join games where people play the same maps over and over and over and over and over AND OVER again.  There are 13 multiplayer maps in this game.  Why am I constantly seeing the same five names in the server browser?  Of the 13 maps, the most commonly selected ones are Operation Metro, Seine Crossing, Grand Bazaar, Operation Firestorm, and Caspian Border.  You can search for games that are running other maps, but the problem with that is there's a good chance they're playing the same map repeatedly.  There are dozens upon dozens of \"24/7 Metro\" or \"24/7 (insert admin's favorite map here)\".  There is nothing fun with spending an hour on the same maps repeatedly because they also decided to give both teams 1000+ tickets.The one thing that ruined this game for me is the hit detection.  I bought Battlefield 3 to get away from the problems of Modern Warfare 3, but now it's like they're following me no matter what game I try to play.  The hit detection IS HORRIBLE!  It is flat-out horrible.  Pre-patch, if I shot someone first, they died.  If someone shot me first, but I outgunned them, they died.  Post-patch, if I shot someone first, magically my last rounds decide \"Nah, you've done enough\", don't register, and they'll kill me.  To make it worse, it's possible to have 0% health AND STILL WALK AWAY FROM A GUN BATTLE.  0% apparently no longer has its original meaning, but this didn't happen pre-patch.  RPG's are worthless.  If it's not a direct hit, it won't kill.  Period.  DICE and EA forgot about a thing called splash damage where, even if the rocket lands six inches next to you, you should still die.  NOPE.  You'll be lucky if you take off half their health with a rocket, again, A ROCKET, that lands a few inches away from your target.  With Battlefield being a game that tries to be realistic (Suppression, bullet drop, etc), this is down right embarrassing and laughable.  Don't even get me started on point-blank shotgun rounds not killing my target, or the ridiculous range of them...STILL.Speaking of Suppression, it's flat-out ridiculous now.  Pre-patch, if you were suppressed, you could still aim at your attacker and shoot back, even though you were less accurate if you hip-fired (which made perfect sense).  Now post-patch, if you're suppressed, you're inaccurate no matter what.  I was being shot by a sniper being suppressed because he can't aim (which makes no sense), and not only did I line up a headshot, I took the shot and nothing happened....at all.  No hit-detection, no dead sniper, NOTHING.  So now if you're being suppressed, good luck hitting anything.  Even if you line up the shot, the rounds won't register.DICE and EA had an amazing game five months ago when Back to Karkand was first released.  It's such a shame that they ruined their own game with a horrible patch, and then profit from it thanks to the Rent-A-Servers.  This is a prime example as to why my love for gaming has turned into a strong dislike for the community.  Companies are starting to make elementary mistakes with their games and are profiting from it, ignoring the backlash from the community (and some of those that make negative comments still buy and use their products) as the company laughs all the way to the bank.  Then you have DICE and EA that took an amazing game and made it worse by releasing a patch that was supposed to fix all of the issues, but only made them worse.  \"We're going to make the Foregrip stats more realistic\".  Thanks, now an attachment that's supposed to reduce my horizontal sway now increases it.  What sense does that make?  I'm supposed to be more accurate with it, not without it.It's almost heart-breaking to give a game I loved three months ago such a low-rating.  But thanks to this god-awful patch, it deserves it.  Until they fix the new issues (which I doubt they will), I'll never touch another Battlefield game.  And to think I almost spent $2,000 on a gaming PC for this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2012"}

This will be short since so many others have reviewed it already. I would say more 3.5 but only can put 4 stars.Overall I enjoyed the game. I just felt the game seemed very unfinished in certain aspects during the course of gameplay.Here is what I liked about the game.1.Crafting system was easier. I am not big on crafting things in a games,mainly because I just don't enjoy it. Though this system was simple and fast.2.Liked the improved graphics, not the latest and greatest by far. But better than Origins.3.The overall story was well done, just it needed more depth.4.The companion banter and pop culture jokes were hilarious in the game.5.Pretty much all the choices I made in Origins carried over and I saw some results. I do like this feature in games.6.The companions were interesting and I enjoyed them.But there was also a dislike here.7.The voiced main character.What I didn't enjoy.1.Way too many recycled maps.2. Very much a lack of any kind of \"Getting to know\" your companions. Which again made it feel unfinished or rushed on this compared to other Bioware games.And not being able to talk to your companions anytime.3.Your only in Kirkwall and surrounding area pretty much, so more should have been done to change the city with your actions. All I saw was some small cosmetic changes here and there. They should have let you take over or destroy gangs,take over businesses,get involved with the nobels or try and help your fellow refugees more. Just anything to impact the whole city more and see some big changes come from those choices.4.Quite a few bugs. I don't really go searching for bugs, but these were very noticable.In retrospect I just feel the game should have had more development time. It just feels not done, or a lot of corners were cut to get the game out. One thing that I thought about was it seemed to be a base game. Like when Hollwood studios release a movie on DVD & Blu Ray with nothing but the movie, and 6 months later release it again with extras. I hope this wasn't a ploy to get the game out then finish it over the next year with extra pay DLC's. DLC and expansions packs should be there to keep the game fresh till a sequel comes out. Not to complete the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2011"}

And to be honest, I do have a hard time jusifying a purchase in 2012. But believe it or not there are a few things that give it an edge over the newer incarnations of the system.First and foremost, the most prominant feature that the DS lite offers over the DSi and 3DS is the GBA slot. I am a huge GBA fan, and there are tons of  GBA games, and they can be played on the original DS or DS lite. Consiering that the lite is without a doubt the better model between the two, if one were so inclied towards playing GBA games, this would without a doubt be the model of choice. One thing to bear in mind is that it only plays these games in sinle player mode only, meaning it lacks the port to connect to other GBA's and the GCN.There are some accessories that came out earlier in the DS's life that use the GBA slot. Accessories like the rumble pack and the Guitar hero cartridge will only work with the original two models. There are others, but none of them make or break the system in my humble opionion.The battery life on the DS lite is fantastic, it's actually the best battery life of any Nintendo handheld ever produced. According to wikipedia, the battery life is 5-8 hours on the brightest setting, and 15-19 on the lowest. Even on the lowest setting, the brightness is better than the original DS's. It really is nice to have a handheld that has such a long life and doesn't require charging very often.Aethetically, it's nice too. I love the glossy plastic top, and the color selection is great too, just about any major color is available. Some of the colors (white, pink, silver) are glossy and maintain their color even on the back, while others (blue, red) are only that color on top and are augmented with a flat black through the remainder of the unit. I reccomend the later more than the former, you still get the nice high end gloss without the whole thing being a finger print magnet. It's just a preferance, but that's my reccomendation. The fact is though, the DS lite it built like a tank. I've dropped it multiple times and it has never given me any performance issues. The screens are crisp and clean, the bottom screen can show marks from the stylus, but hold up fairly well consider the amount of abuse by my hand. I know that the lite's screens hold up better than the original model as well, I've seen some original models just brutalized by a stylus.My only real issue I have with it is the L + R buttons. Much like the SP, Micro, DSi, and the 3DS, the buttons just stop reliably registering after a while. It's frustrating, and a terrible design flaw that has been an issue for years, and while it does get better with the newer models, it's still an issue.Price-wise, I think Amazon is a little high. You can get these used for about $60 or less if you know where to look. I certainly wouldn't pay $100 to get this new when a DSi could be had for that new, or a used DSi XL. It's just doesn't offer that kind of performance to demand $100 in 2012.What I'm actually getting at is this makes a great system for kids. It's durability, battery life, selection of available (affordable) games, and it's price (depending on where you buy) make it perfect for the 10 and under crowd. Sure it's not getting much for new games, but for a child at that age, it's not really a concern. If you factor in the fact that it can play any game regarless of reigon across GBA and the DS library, it can play well over 1500 games.However, if you are just jumping in for yourself now, it's hard not to recommend spending a bit more to get a 3DS. The reason is, those systems offer much better functionality and don't cost that much, $169 for a 3DS or $199 for a 3DS XL, and used prices falling about $30 cheaper for either. If you've been paying attention to the market, you know that systems run in cycles, and it's important to know that the DS is at the very end of it's cycle, meaning very few (if any) games are going to be released on the system. With the 3DS you can play all of your DS games (that don't require a GBA slot) on the 3DS with tons more games coming out for next gen. Like I said, for a kid 10 or under, it's a much better fit given the possibility he/she could lose or neglect the system, but for the rest of us, it's time to move onto bigger and better things.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2012"}

{"product_name":"B004QEV0MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"A Bombastic, Ridiculous Thrill Ride","reviewText":"The Saint's Row series has always had a special place in my heart. So many hours of my childhood were wasted taking turns with my best friend acting a fool in the initial entry, and countless nights devoid of rest were spent pimping my character and buying up property in 2008's excellent sequel. Starting off as a Grand Theft Auto clone and soon forming it's own unique voice in the industry, Volition's franchise has morphed into a carnival of everything you've ever wanted to do in a game, but were too afraid to say aloud. With \"Saint's Row: The Third\", all of these things have crashed to form what may be the craziest game you'll play all year.Picking up a while after \"Saint's Row 2\", \"The Third\" finds the Third Street Saints transformed into a brand, one that is slapped on everything from bobbleheads to energy drinks. Every single one of their exploits is a media circus, and the first mission of the game takes place during a particularly crazy heist. This heist involved breaking into a bank, shooting up droves of SWAT members and gangbangers, getting a vault airlifted from the bank, and riding on said vault while shooting off assailants. This is only the first mission, mind you, and it's a great taste of what's to come later on in the game.Not to go into specifics, but one thing leads to another, and before you know it, your custom character is in a new city, forced to reboot the Saints from the ground up in a new locale. But as luck would have it, you've happened to royally irritate three very intimidating gangs, and all of them want you and the Saints gone. It's either you or them, and as the protagonist, it's fairly obvious how everything's going to go down.The game takes off to an exhilarating start, featuring some of the most insane missions you've ever experienced in a game, film, or anything else for that matter. One such mission has you skydiving from an airplane into a penthouse, shooting up waves of gang members, and hurling grenades to dislodge barracades, all while Kanye West's \"Power\" blasts in the background. It's a rip-roaring good time, and many of the early missions have the same thrilling tone to them.Which makes perhaps the game's only shortcoming more anger-inducing: the poor pacing of missions after the first act. Volition pulls a very cruel bait-and-switch on players, after packing every mission in the first parts of the game with over-the-top action. Once you've gotten into a groove, though, the game starts throwing on seemingly meaningless side activities on you at such a quick rate that it starts to feel like the formulaic sandbox game the first entry was. While none of these missions are particularly bad (Professor Genki's Super Ethical Reality Climax is a brutal reality show that is a blast to play through), many feel like they were best left being optional. I would even go so far as to say that some side-activities from the other entries should have been eliminated altogether, such as the intensely dull Snatch and Trafficking.Speaking of those last two activities, they are perhaps two of the most demonstrative of the game's rare but frustrating glitches. NPCs that you're supposed to be protecting will often do the most counter-intuitive of things, such as run straight into enemy fire when they're supposed to be escaping, or simply standing around like a statue while you're getting torn apart by enemy fire. These don't happen all the time, but after a while, it starts to become noticeable that allied NPC AI could have used some last-minute fine-tuning. Other notable (but incredibly rare) bugs include enemies that will occasionally disappear into a wall and getting trapped in ragdoll form underneath certain objects. The latter is remedied by an instant respawn, but one would figure that Volition could fix a glitch that has been in the game since it's inception instead of making a quick fix like that.Which isn't to say that the overall gameplay is bad at all. In fact, it's one of the more standout features this time around. Gunplay has finally been perfected, able to balance the freedom allowed in sandbox games and the precision shooting offered by third-person shooters. Being chased on foot through the streets by a car or helicopter is no problem, as the player seamlessly shifts between vaulting over obstacles while whipping around to pull off quick, precise headshots to their assailants. Other aspects, such as the driving and boating mechanics, work in a similar fashion to their predecessors in Saint's Row 2, with one exception: flying. Vastly improved from the last entry, flying around feels like a fully-fleshed idea instead of an exciting concept. Flight sim-esque controls allow more complex flying maneuvers to be pulled off with ease, which makes flying a more viable way to travel Steelport.And you'll be doing a lot of travelling, because \"The Third\" has the most robust and exciting city I've experienced in a game of this type. This is due in no small part to the outrageous amount of customization and overpowered weaponry. Ever wanted to be a skydiving mascot wielding a bat fashioned out of a dildo? How about a punk rocker with duel pistols that shoot infinite explosive ammo, or a streaker with a penchant for jumping into cars \"Dukes of Hazzard\"-style and propelling your crotch into people's faces while tackling them? In this game, all of these unique possibilities are a few of the hundreds of realities you can make happen. Volition deserves a round of applause for delivering such an insanely fun overworld to explore and/or ravage, with plenty of side-missions to complete and real estate to purchase.They also deserve praise for the sheer variety story missions pack in. Outside of the utterly disappointing manditory side-mission portions, players will experience virtually every trope from contemporary games in the  campaign. I won't be the guy who spoils things, but let's just say that zombies, luchadore gangsters, pimps with autotuned voiceboxes, and trips into a Tron-style motorcycle ride are among the highlights of the game. I cannot think of another game with such sheer variety in it's narrative, with the possible exception of 2008's bland but amusing \"Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard.\" This game will routinely have players in stitches with the zaniness of the situations and the wry humor characters shoot back and forth at each other like verbal gunfights.\"Saint's Row: The Third\" is the start of a new direction for Volition's fantastic franchise. While not perfect, it establishes it's identity and severs ties with it's GTA Clone past, which is a hard feat that other open-world crime games have stumbled at and failed to accomplish. Offensive, loud and outrageous, this game is one that will stick with you, for better or worse, and suck you into it's grasp without letting you go. While it certainly is not the best game I've played this year, it may very well be the most consistently entertaining.Plot: B+Gameplay:B+Graphics: B+Sound: B+Overall: B+ (9.0)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

Many of his fellow soldiers have not. Some deaths have been the result of chaotic battle. A few have been the result of circumstance and tragedy.  One such incident forced Baker to make a choice between telling the truth and watching a man be killed or saving him by keeping the man's confession to himself. He chose to save him.  This one choice led to over half of Bakers squad being killed when the man snapped from the guilt that he had been carrying around. Now Baker has a reputation as being cursed and the strange pistol (a gift from his father) he carries has gone from being a good luck charm to a bringer of death and misfortune.Now with his squad brought up to strength, Baker and his fellow soldiers are spear heading Operation Market Garden and the effort to clear Hell's Highway.  But the past won't leave Baker alone and some of the replacements are asking about the incident that led to half the squad getting killed. As the war marches on so does Baker's squad from the initial battle to clear the way for the Paratroopers to the final mission to push the Germans out of there Holland strong hold. During this time Baker will have to find a way to address the guilt in his heart or it very well may make him lose his mind.------------------------First off if the above summary is a little vague it's because I did not play the last game in the series and the \"previously on brothers in arms\" bit at the beginning of the game is more or less meant to jog memories not bring those who have no idea what happened previously up to speed.  I can say by the end it makes sense. The game's story over all reminded me of a book called RedLiners by David Drake. Most of these guys are definitely there.  Now onto the game. I really liked this one I guess because it focuses more on a story (like COD4) then here's the evil doers go blow em up like you square jawed, bullet proof heroes of WW2 shooters always do. The game also reminded me a bit of Rainbow Six Vegas as far as using other squad members for flanking and suppressing fire. You usually have up to three small squads you can move around. You really have to use these tactics or you do end up dying a lot. This can be annoying sometimes when you forget and move around without cover and all enemies seem to instantly know where you are, even though they may be facing away from you, and fill you full of holes. There are also a few tank maps where the player can blow stuff up good. If your trigger happy your probably not going to like this game, but if you like a mix of gears of war (cover based fighting), call of duty (story and pacing) and Rainbow Six Vegas (tactics) then give it a shot, its almost like playing a episode of Band of Brothers.--------Graphics: Great, environments are detailed, stuff blows up good, and most characters avoid the uncanny valley.Game Play: Generally Good.

One problem I had was how easily Sly dies because he really can't see far in front of him. This causes him to get taken out by dogs and arrows,etc as soon as he lands on a new platform. And when he gets hit, he's out. There's no life gauge or mascot hanging around. You have no access to firepower or any real protection. I once used an invincibility code and then the hang/swing button failed to function, so I couldn't advance. I need a game where you can relax and wander, not be on constant guard for enemies attacking you before you can even step back or defend yourself.

{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"L. Sun \"Sun_Jot\"","summary":"Game is not hard . The truth is (kind of). from die hard DS fan","reviewText":"Edit: I decide to change the the rating from 4 stars to 5 after 30 more hours diggin into the world. I realize that there are plenty more things to do and tons of secrets. The latter half of the game is definitely on or above the level of Dark Souls I. The idea of burning bonfire ascetics is also appreciated. New game + mode is obviously better experience than dark souls I (in the previous game you can roam with ease in new game plus). Everything starts at Drangleic Castle being magnificent again with memorable scenes/monsters and bosses. The dragon Aerie is stunning place to visit.The online pvp is better than Dark souls I. There are more modes to invade (making covenants more meaningful) and there is no more connection hoarse thanks to physical servers. All in all, I am still addicted to Dark Souls game and I already start looking forward to Dark Souls III on new gen!!I am keeping what I wrote early on as below. They still stand true but they are more to each person's flavor now. I still can't stand the 2D grass in forest of giants.---------This game feels short and at some places cheap. Compared to DS1, the new game has worse graphics. I can give you many reasons why Dark Souls 1 is the best RPG and one of the best games ever. But I find it hard to say the same about DS2. Mind you that I also love Demon souls and had high hopes when DS1 came out. Now I have the same high hopes and it turned to be disappointment. Let me briefly list a few.1. The graphics. My biggest complaint. It's downgraded from the demo released earlier last year. Comparing the PS3 version (at same scene) with the demo, I find it hard to believe they are the same game. Now I did pop in Dark souls I and was hoping it was only because I got used to new gen of PS4 graphics. But .. sadly, the details/lighting/shadow from DS1 are so much better.2. Bosses. Dark souls had the best boss fights. The second game is a bit underwhelming in this category. Most of the bosses show in a arena kind of setting which feels too much like any 'game' while the first Dark souls had impressive bosses with varieties background stories and surrounding arena. Remember the snow girl in the picture?3. Length. The map and design are okay I guess. The game length is relatively much shorter. I also find the enemies are not that impressive like the first game4. Bonfire.5. Fighting, backstabbing6. Character...Sorry I don't plan to list them all. You may say I had too much of Dark Souls I and I am too hard to please. Well I was like this crazy hyped up about dark souls when it came out (I was demon souls die hard fan at that time). And dark souls even surprised me with new changes.Dark Souls 2 feels rushed in production. I am not sure if this is blame on Namco. Dark Souls 1 was made before Namco took over the studio (Namco did produce it in the later stage but the game was already made). I had my doubt on game quality when I heard the director is changed and the production time is shortened. Now the doubt just became reality.However this is still a good game even with the PS2 level graphics. Especially if they plan to bring up what they showed in the demo to New gen PS4 or (maybe PC?) I will purchase it again. For now, I still enjoy souls world, I will keep buying souls game and I am willing to spend my soul on more dark souls.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Worlds of Fun","reviewText":"If you've played a variety of FPS games, there are times when it seems the Master Chief has weights on his feet compared to the speed of, say, Gordon Freeman or Soap MacTavish.  That said, of the first three entries in the Halo series, Halo 3 really feels like the first time we get to fully stretch our wings.  The first game introduced us to a two-weapon mechanic that really requires you to think strategically.  The second expanded on that with dual-wield and a little bit of physics effects in-game.  But Halo 3 really brings all those things together in a way that shines.In Halo 3, you play \"The Master Chief\", a cyborg soldier who is the last of his kind, and an inspiration to all of humanity.  Having done great deeds in the first two installations, The Master Chief is now the single greatest soldier in an interstellar war of epic proportions.  Your health is measured by a shield that protects you from damage:  if you take too many hits in a row, you need to get to cover and let your shield recharge.  As you play through levels, you often balance keeping an eye on your ammo with watching how much your shield has been hit.  The added dimension is tactics:  which enemies are in the area should greatly affect which weapons you choose to pick up...and how to deploy them.  For example, if you dual-wield two weapons, sometimes you want two of the exact same weapons so that you can dump huge amounts of rounds into a strong foe.  Other times you want to have two different kinds:  an energy weapon to sap the enemy's shields and a projectile weapon to do serious amounts of damage once he is vulnerable.  One other nice addition is the ability to pick up particular items that assist you, from a shield bubble that protects you to a bright flare that blinds your enemies, and more.  What makes it a challenge is that they can use the same things you do!While previous Halo games added a variety of enemies, you really start to see their capabilities take off in Halo 3.  A brute can charge at you, or can simply knock heavy objects around, causing complete chaos.  There are times when the battlefield gets so dramatically changed by what's going on that you really need to keep your head about you to avoid getting pinned down, or stumbling over an obstacle that wasn't there before.  Enemies are also much better at getting to cover, timing their shots, and being willing to climb on top of or over obstacles to get at you.  The AI has a \"fight-or-flight\" mentality to them, but there are times when they can goad each other out of fleeing and into turning around and coming back at you.  Probably the most fun I had was realizing my enemies could now flank me, and wouldn't hesitate to do so without yelling out exactly what they were going to do.  While you do get aided by your fellow marines (and an unlikely alien ally), it's clear that the bad guys are all focusing on taking you out.  They know exactly who you are, and each of them sees you as the greatest threat to their war.If you're new to the Halo series, this is a good starting point.  While it can be a bit more complicated than the first two entries, the easy difficulty is well balanced for you.  Experienced players will enjoy Heroic difficulty, and Legendary is definitely for the practiced of hand.  Multiplayer gets an added dimension in that many of the single-player maps are designed for a multiplayer experience as well:  so familiar territory for those who begin with the single-player campaign.  The fact that multiplayer means everyone else can make the same weapon choices you do means that there is a lot more variety and creativity (and thus a lot more difficulty) facing human foes.  This is one of my favorite games for the XBox 360, and my only lament is that it was never made for the PC.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B006IOAHPK","description":"","reviewerName":"Jessie Scott","summary":"If you don't play this game, you're gonna have a bad time.","reviewText":"The quality of South Park games has been incredibly sub par since the first one released in 1998 for the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation.  Creator's Matt Stone and Trey Parker teamed up with developer Obsidian to create a game that would not only be great to play, but would be true to the show.  Did they succeed?Without a doubt, this is a South Park fan's dream come true.  It's as if you're taking part in a long, interactive episode.  Although short (clocking in around 15-20 hours), I can say that I had a blast and was laughing from the beginning to the end.  Instead of filling the game with unnecessary fluff like a lot of RPGs, the game stays tight and focused which lends itself to a shorter completion time.  Rather than dragging on, it feels like it ends right where it's supposed to.Review at glance:Graphics:  5/5This is how a South Park game should look.  Stick of Truth, from start to end, looks like a South Park episode.  The characters, the moves, the backgrounds, the weapons - everything looks as it was transferred right from the show.  This doesn't pretend to have graphics that rival Crysis and it doesn't need to.  This game looks exactly how it should.  There are tons of weapons, armors, tattoos, hair styles, and other miscellaneous items that fit perfectly.Audio: 5/5Matt, Trey and the other voice over veterans lend their voices to the game and it sounds authentic.  The lines are hilarious and well delivered.  Going into different stores or location provides with some interesting songs that people will recognize from the show.  Battle music was generic, but workable.Story: 5/5This is an episode of South Park.  No, I don't mean it's just an episode they made into a game, this game is a new episode that's interactive.  The story is hilarious and exactly what we'd expect to see Kyle, Stan, Cartman and Kenny participating in.  The boys are playing Humans vs Elves with Cartman as the Grand Wizard.  They are guarding the Stick of Truth, which whoever possesses said stick controls the universe.  When the Elves steal the stick, it's up to the new kid to get it back.  I don't want to spoil anything, but you will see zombies, hippies, the military, Canadians, and of course aliens.Gameplay: 4/5The game play is very solid, very akin to the Mario RPG games where the player does bonus damage for pressing a button at the right time.  Pressing it at the correct time will inflict bonus damage (and not make you look like a wussy weakling when hitting).  Magic, aka farting, is also present in the game and play a big role.  From using this \"magic\" in combat to helping to open new paths, you'll use your cantrips of flatulence to assist in your adventure quite often.  Players have a choice of four classes, that determine starting equipment and skills, but otherwise all equipment is fair game.  Be warned: there are some \"controversial\" portions of the game that were removed for other countries.  Yes, they are extremely offensive but at the same time hilarious.  There is one particular scene on the space ship that had me in tears - of laughter.  It was not the scene itself, but the presentation of it - it was executed masterfully.Overall:  Depends.Fan of South Park, Fan of RPGs: 5/5Fan of South Park: 4/5Fan of RPG: 3/5You hate everything: You already know you'll hate this, just like everything else.Those who don't enjoy South Park, especially the humor, will probably not enjoy this game.  As an RPG it's a little flat.  But the elements of the RPG coupled together with the spot on South Park style make this THE South Park game fans have been waiting for.  There are tons of nods and secrets to discover that will leave players say, \"Ah!  I remember that.\"I'll attempt to write a more in depth review later.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2014"}

Especially useful if you don't have an amp.The lessons are pretty good and cover a lot. I learned that I was actually holding both my guitar and pick wrong. They also slow down if you're not doing too well, and gradually speed up when you get the chords right.Lessons can usually tell you what you're doing wrong and offer suggestions.Simple interface so you're not struggling to balance a guitar and a controller.Fairly good selection of songs to play, and more to buy over xbox live marketplace.In game guitar tuner, because I have no clue how to tune a guitar.Cons:Lags with an hdmi cord. There's a set of analog cables that comes with this edition, but since I didn't have a stereo system to plug them into, I was out of luck. There's a slip of paper in the box that gives you set up recommendations, but 2 of them require a sound system, and the other requires headphones. In short, if you can, don't use an hdmi cord.Tuning the guitar is initially very time consuming, and once in a while the game will not recognize a string, and automatically start the guitar tuner.Some lessons fail to explain what you're doing wrong correctly, or say you're doing something wrong that's being done right. Sometimes this is due to the way the cords are plugged in.Later lessons are more difficult and require a large amount of patienceNotes occasionally don't register with the game. Volume or setup issue.There is a huge gap in the amount of skill required to complete some lessons. At one point it went from simple riffs in one lesson  to switching frets very quickly in the next lesson, and my hands were not ready for that pace . Again, a lot of patience and practice is required.Kinect doesn't work as well as  a controller because the guitar interferes with the sensor.Final opinion on this game:(5 stars) Truly unique game that, with patience, will make you a great guitar player.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying.

I enjoyed the fact this game did not hold anything back and you will have to use tactics and a lot of practice to pass certain areas. This game was a lot of fun, even with the lack of a story, and I was wanted more when the game ended (and thanks to increased difficulty after you beat the game, I got that).The idea of the story is that the area of Boletaria is being overrun by demons because the king wanted immense power and brought the Old One back. While all these other heroes have come and failed, you decided to come to Boletaria to kill demons and collect demons souls and maybe just save the land. I know this sounds like the typical loner coming along and saving the world, the way the environment is presented and the darkness of it makes it stand out among others.With the choice of starting a new game, a very detailed option to create your character is presented to you, which you can create a crazy looking person, or just an average human is available to you. From there a choice of classes is available, and each starts out with different equipment and different level/stats at the beginning of the game. What I do like is the fact that to level up you choose a single stat, with all the stats available to you from the get go. Even if you choose the typical \"mage\" class you can create a high level warrior if you choose those stats.Eventually get to the Nexus and this is your main city where you can visit shop, by spells, and choose five other areas to go through these stone waypoints. While I don't like the fact you can sell any of your items, I over looked it since this game brought so much more depth than that, and maybe it's just the way the universe is presented. Each area has three sub sectors that you have to beat a boss to continue on, but once you beat that boss you can start from the beginning and go to the end of the area (I.E. staring out at 1-1 and leaving the area at 1-4).Gameplay is where this game shines, wither it be finding a way to take down this enemy, to finding hidden items scattered across the world. One of the things you will get used to fast is learning how to roll and to avoid enemy's attacks. Even the beginning monsters can hurt you pretty bad so your brought right into it. If (and most likely when) you die you start out at the very beginning of the stage and you lose all your souls. On top of that all of the enemies respawn and in order to get your souls back you have to go to the area you died and pick them up.One of the things you have to get used to is dying all the time. Roll the wrong way, forget to attack or just plain bad luck will get you killed, and these are just some minor things. Also on top of that if your connected to the internet, anyone can invade your game and kill you and take your souls (or you can kill them), and while I played this game offline, if I did play it online this would get annoying fast.If you can handle being killed all the time, risk of being ganked, or don't need a story to push you along, this is a great and fun game to play.Length: Depending on your play style you can average about 20-40 hours on one play through. If you choose to level up, you can take a long time leveling on 4-4 and this could add some time to your game.Trophies: Getting platinum in this game will be a difficult one. You have to beat the game at least 3 times, and collect some bosses demon souls in a fourth play through to unlock all the magic/faith/weapon upgrade stuff. The ones for killing the bosses are pretty easy, since again you will obviously get these while working on these others.~ Written: August, 2010Positives:* Great setting* Adds to the atmosphere with low key or no music* First time since Dead Space to have fun when you die* A lot of variety along with being able to create any character you want* Inside artwork in the case (Something extremely rear these days)Negatives:* No way to sell things* Uninvited PVP* Losing your souls if you don't collect them and die again","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2012"}

It's that simple!I'm very happy I finally got my copy last Friday. Games such as God of War, Uncharted, inFamous, and many others are the reason I love Sony's console. When I knew Naughty Dog was developing a new IP for current gen I thought that I'd seen everything on the PlayStation 3 already. Happily, I was very wrong.Playing The Last of Us is a delight. This game does not look like a current gen-game. If you saw E3 event last week and compare Xbox One games to The Last of Us, I'd say Naughty Dog's new baby looks and plays much better.If you don't own a PS3 yet and buy one console today just for The Last of Us and Beyond: Two Souls (which is coming out shortly), you won't be wrong: it's that good! The Last of Us worth it!TLoU is very re-playable too with its NewGame+ which allows you to play a New Game and keep everything you took on your first playthough. 4 difficulty level (Easy, Normal, Hard, Survival) for both NewGame and NewGame+. Action, survival horror, weapon crafting, a fantastic story, terrific voice acting, 10/10 graphics, perfect controls, and a robust multiplayer experience. Multiplayer should have more variety of play styles though, but it's very good and you play it with not complains.Immersion is awesome too, because health doesn't regenerates automatically. You have to patch yourself, but the game doesn't pause while you're doing that. It does't pause when you're crafting or upgrading a weapon either.TLoU is not an open world game, but its big enough to explore and get collectibles (for trophy hunters).Like I said before, it's very simple: you can't go wrong with this game. You should experience this game now, because you will be surprised of what PS3 is still capable of. I know PS4 is near us, but you'd regret not playing this game on the ps3 today.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2013"}

If this game had been released much earlier (or even on the PS2) say, 2007 or so, some of the flaws MIGHT have been forgiven...or maybe not.This game is from the same company that helped develop KOTOR II, Neverwinter Nights II and is working on the new Fallout: Las Vegas expansion.Where to begin?Graphics:  This game is flat out ugly in some retrospects. Most of the framerate drops would be excusable if this was on a PS2 but 5 years in on the PS3 and to get framerate drops and hiccups during cutscences of this magnitude is uncalled for. It's hard to believe that this game was delayed time and again for this to be the final result. Most of the levels look very drab and mono-color, like someone just took one can of paint and gave you only 3 shades of it and that's it.The facial models are even worse and again, for this to be a current gen game it looks last gen.Controls:  In most levels, this game handles so poorly. This kind of game would seem ripe with opportunity to do all kinds of things that Splinter Cell, Gears of War and Metal Gear would dream of but the opportunity is squandered here. Most of the environment where it would seem great to interact with does not happen, you can't shoot out any lights or blow up barrels, climb over everything; the cover system is broken (what's the sense in getting under cover behind a concrete barricade to still get shot up is beyond me) because some places that would make good cover is NOT cover at all, and stealth? Forget about it. Many times you may try to sneak through a level and somehow still set off an alarm and you just can't figure out how. And this is often.  And what makes this worse?  The 3rd person almost literally draped over the shoulder view. The camera angle is too close to your character to allow you to be effective in some spots when you need to find out who is shooting you and by then sometimes it's too late.The mini-games are a poor man's version of Mass Effect II's mini-games and if you hated those, you will despise these even more. These are an out right headache and lock-picking a combination safe?  REALLY??  no.And the AI?  Makes me wish for the Splinter Cell AI. Once guards start shooting you, they all draw a bead on your position and while you are trying to dial up the correct gadget to use, you are already dead. Worse yet, sneaking up on them takes not finesse, but patience. And in most cases not even that. In some instances, I have had some run right by me, in the light and in the open. Only after I had shot them did they respond. Worse yet for this to be an \"RPG\" one of the elements very rarely occurs in this game and that is loot drops. For every 10 guards you kill, 1 may drop something. So take it for what it's worth. And that is the other thing. Shoot as many times as you want to get a head shot or some that should disable an enemy and be prepared for the enemy to stand up and shoot right back like they didn't just get shot in the face.  Why? Because dice rolls are used. Some may argue for this system but in a game like this, the realism gets taken away with this feature.So far I fought two bosses in this game and the fact that I beat one with a regular machine gun was just so utterly ridiculous that it's what really made me rethink having this game in my collection.This game is really that bad and what's stopping me from giving it just one star?  The dialogue. This game is the only game I have played outside of Mass Effect where your responses are heard as well as the NPC dialogue and it's ok for a B movie. The actor doing Michael Thornton's voice is very bland at times and you can barely hear the change when you pick certain responses, but it's there. The supporting characters, however are better at holding up the story (as cliched as it is) than the main character and that's not by much.This game could have stood more development time and it shows. This is the 2nd purchase this year I have regretted and this was for a game that had so much promise a year ago.  If you really want to get your spy RPG on, then rent it...and I really wouldn't recommend that but some are curious, otherwise, avoid this title.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2010"}

If you are already good at fps games on consoles, this product will not help.If you have issues with trailing your cross-hairs on an enemy at close range, aiming at a target long range, or feel like you waist too many bullets just to kill one target, this product is for you.What this product does is give you more leeway to direct your cross-hairs onto your desired target.  The higher angle this product gives on an analogue controller stick allows the user more finesse to adjust their aim point.  This isn't hacking or some type of cheat, just a tool used to establish geometrical leverage.As a personal testimony, I knew the reason why I had issues with fps shooters on the xbox 360 was due to the low analogue stick height.  I constantly overcompensated on shooting targets, leaving me frustrated and quitting games early when I shouldn't have.  I do very well on the PS3 shooter games; and this is due to their higher analogue stick differential.  After installing these on my 360 controller, I increased my k/d ratio by .3 in less than 3 hours of playtime.The fpsfeeks stick adapter should be the staple of any hesitant fps fan out there.  After installing this product on my 360 controller, I thoroughly enjoy multiplayer shooters. I feel like I'm on an even playing field with others, rather than keeping up with the rest of the pack.

This game is similar to Indiana Jones mixed with a Tomb Raider type of gameplay and it's non-stop adventure the whole way.

I'm really singing this game's praises here, but there isn't anything that I did not like about this game, which is rare for me.What I thought was a great touch was they decided to add a very solid multiplayer to this game. So, once you beat the game a few times, you can go online and have your deathmatches, capture the flag, and so on. You can also go online and play special cooperative levels specially designed for multiplayer. No, you cannot go through the whole single-player game with a buddy, but you can play in many maps with a couple different co-op game modes. It adds a ton to this game and I would easily have purchased the coop modes separately if they offered them. By this game and get the first one. You wont be disappointed.

But although the game contain several well-deserved nods to previous games in the series in the form of iconic characters like Mario, Luigi and two Toads, as well as familiar enemies, sound effects and levels, it is not simply another trip downMario Bros.memory lane.

Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.' Those days are no more. InNew Super Mario Bros.

Wiiis held sideways, allowing for easy, classic inputs using the D-pad to direct playable characters, the 1 button to jump and 2 button to spit out projectiles like snowballs and fireballs.

The announcement of a new, 2D side-scrolling Mario game on the Wii console, however, was a shocker. The original \"New Super Mario Bros\" on the DS was a great game and I would have expected any follow-up to appear on the handheld console. What we get here is a fun, challenging, and wonderfully nostalgic Mario game that will no doubt appear to most fans of the series.The story is standard Mario fare; Princess Peach has been kidnapped by the evil Bowser, and Mario must travel through eight vast worlds in order to save her. The layout of the land is familiar to any Mario fan, with several stages across varied terrain, including desert, ice, and cloud worlds. The gameplay objective is to get to the end of each stage and earn points for thumping enemies, collecting coins, and finding secret areas. The large coins first introduced in the DS version are also included here and they do provide some replay value, since collecting a certain number of them is a must for latter parts of the game. The control is simply the Wii remote turned sideways, with the D-pad controlling direction and the 1 and 2 buttons being used for jumping and firing. The motion control comes into play when using the new (and very useful) helicopter helmet and for moving platforms to reach areas in the game. Shaking and tilting the remote to progress is a novel idea, but this game would have also benefited from supporting the classic controller. While the original DS game was fairly easy, this new incarnation on the Wii eases you in gently and then spikes the difficulty after the first few worlds. Even if you're a diehard Mario veteran, this game will prove to be punishing and frustrating at times. Fortunately, the game does throw you a bone or two if you die a lot, so the frustration is short lived.The biggest selling point is the option to play through the game with up to four players, however online play is not supported and all players must be in the same room with four Wii remotes. As impractical as it may seem, it is actually a lot of fun when the four players are playing competitively. I enjoyed jumping on others and stealing their coins, so competitive gameplay is where this game shines. Playing cooperatively to progress through the levels is great as long as everyone knows how to play, otherwise the less experienced players will trip you up and ultimately seem like dead weight.  This game would be better suited to online play and we can hope that Nintendo allows for this sometime in the future.Graphically, the game looks great with the fluid character animation and colorful worlds. The music and sound effects will be familiar to any Mario fan old or now, as music from all of the previous games make appearances. Fans of the newer 3D Mario games might feel like they are taking a step backwards with this new game, however for anyone looking old-school fun with a good challenge thrown in, this is a must have. Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2009"}

But it's worth it. Now if you don't like driving or let alone difficult games then don't even bother reading on.Like the previous Driver games, there is storymode where you drive from one location to another. The missions are quite difficult which takes alot of practice. Some you might be repeating more than a couple of times (especially towards the end of the game). There is also a new feature that they added. Unlike the previous games, you can use weapons. This makes the game more realistic other than driving the whole time.The graphics are just beautiful. It seems like you're really there and the explosions of the cars are just fun to watch. Another good thing is the music. And not just the game music, I mean your own music. The only problem is everytime you repeat a mission the music plays from the beginning again and again. It can get annoying.Overall, this game is worth it, but it's definitely a challenge and takes alot of practice. But if you can handle that, then I suggest you buy this game immediatly.

You will not be able to enjoy them because the game play of this title is completely busted. I don't understand the high praise at all and wonder if I accidentally got the wrong game included inside my case.You are tasked with killing people, but you first have to search them out through the city. Easy right? Wrong. The cities are MASSIVE and you have to do various menial tasks in order to find clues that will lead you to the person. Ok, that acceptable too and had it stopped there, this might have been a different review.But no, you are not allowed to step foot into the city because everyone knows who you are (I've heard of this thing called a disguise... but not Alistar or whatever your name is. Its set so far back in time maybe disguises werent invented yet). So to blend in with the crowd you will have to play frogger and walk around endless swarms of people who just walk the streets all day and night. Collide with a single one and they will start shouting at you and the guards will run over and kill you. (Remember- if you bump into someone on a crowded subway you sure as hell better prepare to fight for your life against the police, you rapist.) Anyway, the only way to avoid people is to constantly walk around holding \"A\" which makes you put your head down (in shame as the developers of this \"game\" should) and walk at a snail's pace.However you will still have to content with constant beggers who will walk in front of you (nobody else!) and harass the hell out of you and make you walk even SLOWER. But you can't even give them money to get them off your back! You just have to contend with them! Also for unknown reason there are also people balancing jars on their heads and trying to walk the crowded streets. If you touch them (and they seem to follow you to!) they will drop their jars and the guards will rush over and attack you.That seems to be the conclusion for everything in this game, walk to fast - a guard will kill you, bump into someone - the guard will kill you, stable your horse outside the town but have the crappy AI make the horse STILL follow you and have it trample someones store while you are IN THE CITY - a guard will come and kill you. Climb up a wall- a guard will see you (or even be waiting on the roof!) and kill you. Stay out of the mob fest that is the town and just ride your horse through the plains trying to find anything good about this god forsaken game) - and a guard will be randomly posted in the middle of nowhere and kill you.Overall, if it isn't obvious I HIGHLY recommend that you STAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME. It is HORRIBLE and I have no idea how it is a Player Choice game. It is innovative yes, and the story seems to be really good (though I only was able to experience 2 chapters or so before rage quitting) but the gameplay is mediocre. Absolutely mediocre and frustrating to the point of screaming at the game.Perhaps the newer versions are better (AC II or Brotherhood) but I will never know because I refuse to buy another title from this series. The real assassination happened to my wallet when I shelled out $20 bucks for this. Someone KILL ME!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2011"}

All this on top of the severe early release bugs.Aside from the need for loading Origin first, the game doesn't even launch then, but instead opens up options in a browser window.  It's extremely frustrating and difficult to find many basic options.  As well, searching for any kind of game will randomly choose a server, even if it's using an expansion pack you don't have.  You can't join it, it just brings a popup telling you to buy the expansion pack, and can happen many times in a row when searching for servers.Once you actually pick a server, there's a severely long wait time to load up.  People say there's very little wait time if you have a solid state hard drive, but this extremely long wait time is inexcusable.  My computer settings are such that I can run everything on high settings as perfectly as a console.Adding on to that, unlockables are extremely difficult to get---I've put in at least 2-3 hours of average gameplay in and not unlocked a single thing yet.  By that point in Battlefield 3, I'd at least unlocked the next level weapons in Assault and Engineer kit.  It's a seemingly callous ploy to get you to pay more money to get all the unlockables instantly.As for the maps; except for Siege of Shanghai, they're unimpressive and overall dull.  The environment destruction is essentially unchanged from Battlefield 3, with greater level destruction either inconsistent or only working when you use tank shells, as rocket launchers and grenades are useless for bringing down pieces of structures.The temptation to just uninstall this and go back to Battlefield 3 is all the more tempting given that the game looks exactly the same.  Even Call of Duty games change up the user interface/HUD and the font between each game---this one doesn't even do that.  If not familiar with the different maps and weapons, you'd never be able to tell the difference between BF3 and BF4.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2014"}

Back in the day, you would compete to see who had the highest score on Donkey Kong or Pac Man.  This game combines the high-scoring-competitiveness of those games with the high quality graphics of todays' next-gen First person shooters.  And that brings us to: Bulletstorm.-Personally, I'm tired of First Person Shooters.  And to me, this is nothing but a glorified Quake.  I was hoping it would be a different refreshing take on the genre, but it wasn't.  Yes, it's brilliantly colorful and fast-paced and has different weapons and cool different ways of killing an enemy, but I found it boring.  Slaughtering your way through a level in this game does not feel rewarding in the least, and I could care less about my point total, or comparing it online with some kid in Japan who will always hold the highest score for that level anyhow.  People don't care about their score anymore.  So by including something we USED to care about in a game that's meant for kids of TODAY, you get this mixed bag that doesn't work.  The graphics are great, and there's a lot going on - but there's almost TOO MUCH going on: Yes I can kill a guy a few different ways but there's SO MUCH action going on or other guys attacking you that it's not like you can spend time appreciating the devestation you create.

{"product_name":"PlayStation 3 40GB System","summary":"I've had all three consoles (Wii, PS3, and XBOX 360)","reviewText":"In fact, we just sold the Wii because we were bored with it.  Because the Wii was from Santa I promised I'd replace it with a PS3--we already had two XBOX 360s in the house.So I'm not going to include the Wii in this comparison, because, IMO, this generation is a two horse race.  The Wii is all hype and feel good for people who don't normally play video games.So I'll compare the two point by point.1) Hardware:  The 360s problems are legendary.  I have two, and they haven't broken, but I treat them with kid gloves, and know many people who have had problems with their hardware.  My new Halo 3 edition had a couple of issues right out of the box that I just work around (an iffy power button and conroller indicator).The PS3, on the other hand, turns it up a notch.  It's nice to look at, nice to touch (the power/eject buttons are very cool), and it is very, very quiet.  Quieter than the Wii, even.Winner:  PS32) Controller:  the thumbsticks as I recall were added later on the PS1 controller, almost as an afterthought in response to Nintendo's thumbstick.  It was broken then, and it is still broken.  Sony should have modernized the controller to be more ergonomically friendly.  The triggers aren't as progressive as the XBOX's, and the distance from your fingers (on the triggers) to the thumbs is awkward, particularly for my young one with small hands.There are people who are \"used\"  to it but I think that's just because they adapted over time.  The XBOX controller evolved--why couldn't this one?Winner:  XBOX 3603) System Software:  You can really tell that one company is a consumer electronics maker, where the other company is more of a software/client/server company.  The PS3 system software is positively primitive in terms of its aesthetics, ease of use, and ability.  The Playstation Store is hideous.  What's best for the PSP isn't necessarily best for the XBOX.  Everything, from friends lists, to shopping, to just generally managing everything is easier with the XBOX.Winner:  XBOX4) Online Play - XBOX has XBOX Live, which, while not free, is worth it.  I haven't played online yet with the PS3, but they tell me you can't message friends/chat/get invites while in the game, and that the XBOX experience is just more integrated, unified, and polished.Winner:  XBOX (you might do your own research here since I haven't played online yet)5) Games - I only got two games initially:  Formula 1 and Ratchet and Clank.  Formula 1 is very unimpressive, and was the sole reason I considered buying the PS3 back during its launch.  I know it's a launch title, but so was Project Gotham 3 on the XBOX, and it was much more impressive.Ratchet and Clank, though, shows off more of the PS3's potential.  I believe the PS3, with the right programmers, could be every bit as capable as the 360, and probably more capable, we just haven't seen it yet.Right now, the XBOX has the best exclusives--I've played and enjoyed Mass Effect, Bioshock, Halo 3, Gears, etc, and so far the cross platform games have tended to work better on the 360, but that is changing for the better for the PS3 as time goes by.Winner:  XBOX (so far)6) Value:  outside of the games library, on paper the PS3 40GB is a better value.  When you compare it, considering the blu ray player and built in wireless, and it's comparatively a steal compared to the XBOX Pro.  Still, it's a lot to play for a system that doesn't yet have a lot of great games.Winner:  PS3The PS3 has a lot of upside--the question is, will Sony exploit it?  So far the winner is the XBOX, but I'd like to see both of them have great games, particularly given my new investment.UPDATE 10/10/2012====================Since I wrote this review, BOTH of my xboxes died.  Both had RROD.  The replacements/refurbs that were sent both failed probably less than a year later--in both cases, it was the DVD drive.  I bought two more.  Those were the later models of the prior design--not a problem since.  Those are probably 3 years old now (not the new design).  I think they finally got their act together, but the quality control over the first few years was abysmal.  Outrageous failure rate for consumer electronicsOh, and the Blu-Ray drive on my first PS3 failed.  I replaced it with the PS3 slim.  120gig model I believe it is.I bumped my rating up to 4 stars, but stand by my overall assessment.  I have both, but if pressed to choose, I'd pick the 360.  I like the environment, I like XBL, and I like the controllers.  The games are a wash--aside from the DVD capacity annoyance, which I got around by installing all my games--both to quiet the machine, and to save the DVD drives.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2008"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Enjoyable installment with the best track list yet","reviewText":"Guitar Hero III doesn't do much different than the last installment did, but what it does offer is by far the best track list to be seen in a Guitar Hero game yet.  Featuring spectacular songs like the Rolling Stones' \"Paint It Black\" and Metallica's \"One\"; Guitar Hero III also features selections from Santana, ZZ Top, Pearl Jam, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Smashing Pumpkins, Dead Kennedys, The Killers, Social Distortion, Iron Maiden, Slayer, Dragon Force, and the Sex Pistols among others; helping make this installment of the game be all the more memorable.  What hurts Guitar Hero III though is that the third time around, the game doesn't feel fresh anymore, and Activision and Harmonix haven't really done enough to make it all that different from Guitar Hero II.  There's higher difficulty this time around for experienced players, but getting there is a different story that casual gamers won't come close to getting towards.  Not to mention that the battle modes and boss battles aren't all that interesting or fun either.  There is more great XBox Live support though, but it should also be noted that there is a heavy amount of in-game advertising as well, which as you all know by now, is more annoying than anything else.  Negatives aside, Guitar Hero III is still a very fun installment of the popular rhythm series, and this installment has the best track list yet.  Let's just hope that next time around Harmonix and Activision do enough to spice up the formula.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2008"}

Denick","summary":"The King of The Iron Fist Tournament is back... and better than ever!","reviewText":"When I picked up the PS2 console on launch day way back in 2000, Tekken Tag Tournament was one of the two games I took home (SSX was the other). Throughout that console's lifespan, TTT would be revisited and played more than any other game in my collection. It was smooth, easy for friends to pick up, and just plain fun. Many an hour in college was spent playing that game with friends, where we would make combos like \"Team Zoo\" (Roger and Kuma) and \"Geezer Patrol\" (Wang and Dr. Bosconovitch). Never did I imagine that it would take TWELVE years for a proper sequel to arrive. Hard to believe... but it was worth the wait. If you're a longtime fan of the series, and were disappointed by T4, T6, and SF X Tekken... this is the game you've been waiting for.For longtime fans, this is the definitive Tekken experience. The graphics are bright, sharp, and colorful, displaying the wacky world of the Iron Fist Tournament in all its glorious weirdness. The roster of characters is staggering, and contains all favorites... it's hard to believe that every one of these characters has its own CGI ending (albeit a short one)!Most importantly, gameplay is TIGHT. The Tekken fighting formula has always been the best of all fighting series, in my opinion, with is relatively simple layout of left punch, right punch, left kick, and right kick. With those simple commands, there are hundreds of moves, combos, throws, reversals, and linkers for each character... I'm constantly surprised by seeing new moves that I didn't realize characters could do. The formula has been refined and tweaked to what I would call \"Tekken perfection\"... response time between button inputs and the character's response time is so fast, it's essentially telepathic. There is nothing sluggish or frustrating about trying to pull off moves, and even new players can pick up the smooth grace of fighters like Eddie and Lei in little time. And the commitment that Namco has displayed in showing such depth for so many different fighting styles is incredible- very few characters have a style that is similar to another. Some new elements have been added to the tag formula, encouraging more strategy, which will give this game even longer legs than its predecessor- which is a good thing, if it takes another 12 years for TTT3!Perhaps most impressive is the \"weight\" that this game has. When you land a punch, it feels like just that: you're landing a punch. Likewise, when you take a body shot from a heavy hitter like Bryan Fury, you almost want to involuntarily flinch (especially if you have the volume turned up). Add to this the hilarity of occasionally taking on the role of a kangaroo, bear, or dinosaur, and you have classic Tekken goodness!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2012"}

It took all characters from all 4 MK's (Mortal Kombat, MK II, Mortal Kombat 3 and Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3) and also made some of the bosses playable characters like Goro and Kintaro.  More or less, all of the characters that have been in the game this whole time (ex Liu Kang, Shang Tsung, Scorpion and Sub Zero) were the Ultimate Mortal Kombat versions.It's pretty good.  The graphics are good, the game play is smooth and you get to use pretty much every character that has been in the series up to UMK 3.  The UMK 3 Combo system is used in this so if you're not up to speed on the UMK 3 combos, you might want to brush up a little first.Like I said, seeing as how fighting games were very few on the 64, I'd check out this one because it was a good one.

{"product_name":"B0010EI6T2","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Split screen rarity","reviewText":"Let's start with the good...The split screen is why you should purchase this game. We all know games that let 2 people play on the same TV are becoming a thing of the past on PS consoles. And this one gets it right. There are 4 players on your team. The 1st player will direct their other teammates (much like old Socom games). This lets you control your challenge level. If you prefer to take a room out without any help from the computer players, then just have them hang back. If a particular part is proving too much for you to handle, send those bad boys in ahead of you. It also gives you tactical advantages, as there are usually multiple ways to progress through each area, and therefore you can send the team one way while you go the other. This game certainly feels less linear than everything else I've played lately. Sometimes enemies will drop down on top of you or come at you from multiple angles; including areas you've already played through. This makes for a much more satisfying experience than alot of other shooters deliver. The gameplay also feels fair. Not only do the weapons work the way you want them to, but the enemies can kill you just as easily as you can kill them. That being said, your health will still automatically regenerate over time. It's a nice balance that keeps the game from being easy, while also saving you the hassle of having to replay a stage 100 times just because you're too near death to make it through the end. Another cool thing about the game is the ability to breach rooms on ropes. It takes some skill at times to manage it without dying, but it's still loads of fun and I'm glad the option appears so often in the game. Your character's guns and armor are also fully customizable, and the more you play the more options you will have and the better your characters will become. The cover system is another thing that makes this game wonderful. It can be as problematic as any other cover system out there, but you don't pop to cover by pushing a button and then pop out of cover by pushing it again. Instead, you simply hold the button to pop to cover and let it go to leave cover. Simple, but amazingly refreshing.Now for the not so good...Where this game falls flattest is in the graphics department. When you're actually playing through a stage, everything looks decent. In fact, I've no issue with the in-game graphics (bland though some areas may be). But the cutscenes look sub par, to put it mildly. Having the computer players follow you can hinder your ability to move, as they'll huddle near you and not move aside until you command them to. I avoided this mostly by ordering them to the far side of a room or simply leaving them behind for awhile. Another annoyance is the timed maps and screen pop ups. When you pull up the map, you have to wait 5 seconds or so for it to go away. It would have been nice to have the option of immediately taking it offscreen whenever you like, as it takes up close to half of the 1st player's screen. Sometimes the game pulls up briefing maps to explain the mission in front of you as well. These come up on the 2nd player's screen and are just as large and annoying as the regular map; only these don't go away until the game is done explaining what lies ahead of you. Also, the audio can sometimes leave alot to be desired. The commentary of other characters fades entirely too fast into inaudible nonsense when you aren't right next to a character that is talking. I probably wouldn't have noticed it too much if it hadn't happened often (even during the last few minutes of the campaign). Lastly, the controls can be dizzying at times. Once you play for awhile, it isn't so bad. And it's not the 'run and gun' controls that are the problem. It's remembering all of the smaller nuances, such as how to turn on night-vision, which become a hassle. One analog stick is clicked to zoom and the other is clicked to crouch. It's easy to confuse them and that will lead to deaths that wouldn't happen if the control scheme were stronger. But these are very minor complaints.So in short, unless you're a stickler for amazing graphics, this game is a must own for shooter fans. The experience is unique, fun, expansive, and I highly recommend playing the campaign with someone you love. Teamwork pays bigtime in this game. And I actually can't wait to play through it on a higher difficulty.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

When I saw it I knew that it would be good, but I didn't think it would quite as good as it turned out to be! The interaction, the societal setups that aren't exclusively \"good guy\" oriented, plus a drove of other features make this a great game.Here's a few examples of why I liked it:(1) Storyline. Yes, it actually has a storyline. Mario, for all his said worth, has always been bound in a minimalist storyline that one could easily predict. This isn't to say that Super Mario games aren't fun, but the depth, well, it is less that complete. In this game, however, you find yourself trying to recover seven stars that have been kidnapped by your old buddy, Bowser, so you can defeat his newest form of invulnerability and (of course) save the princess. You reach your goal through fragmented means, running all over the make and conversing, obtaining, playing side games, and so on. To me, following the story and ascertaining why I was beating people down was fun.(2) Combat Features. The combat is actually powered in a somewhat odd way for Mario. With your \"jump\" and \"hammer\" features, you use your attacks on a metered system, inflicting damage to people's \"heart ponts\" while doing so. You are also rewarded with a \"perfect hit\" on your meter (easy mastered after a little practice) by double damage and so on.(2) Abilities. Your abilities are determined by a number of things like items, but your basic setup is determined by three statistics. Your health, of course, is his \"heart power,\" his ability to use specialized moves comes from his \"flower points,\" and his ability to obtain specialized moves/defenses comes from his ability to collect numerically coded badges ruled by badge points. You can further your offensive/defensive capabilities by collecting \"star points,\" something that all enemies give and tougher enemies give in droves, allowing you to modify your health, your \"flower points,\" and your \"badge points.\" Gain one hundred of these puppies and you level up.(3) Allies. In this game, you get to carry around a drove of allies. They all have specialized moves that they can use for free (some on a metered attack scale, too), plus others that feed on your \"flower points.\" As the game progresses, you have a chance to pick up more and more of these useful little guys, not to mention level them up. They are, in a word, lifesaving.(4) Help. Some people get lost in \"adventure\" games and need a helping hand. Well, Paper Mario provides a character for exactly that purpose. Pay the man 5gp, a minuscule sum, and he'll \"read your future\" and tell you where to go. A spoiler, to be sure, but a useful one at that.Anyhow, this is just a brief overview of the great features contained therein and leaves out all sorts of useful quips that you should try out for yourself. If you like Mario you'll love this, and if you don't you'll still love it. I highly recommend it to anyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2002"}

It has the combat training, which is a nice addition, but they took away the co-op campaign that we were treated too with World at War. Thanks for screwing us like that guys. I can not believe that they would offer it in a past game and take it away. Doesn't every developer know that you can NEVER take away features once they are added. I guess the good developers know that, but these guys don't. They wonder why games like Halo, Gears and Rainbow Six are so successful, its because they give you a lot of options to play. These guys make me sick with their lack of regard for their customers.The other thing is that they continue to ruin zombie mode. What made the original zombie map in World at War so much fun was that you could put your back to a wall and just fight. With every subsequent map after that, they forced you to run around to different rooms to find the boxes. Then they added the very irritating feature of having the boxes dissappear at random and appear somewhere else. They force you to playt he game the way they want you too, instead of giving the user any level of control over some of the options. So with this iteratoin its the same thing, a huge level that you are forced to run all over to find the box, only to die by the time you do because you don't have any money or a good defensible location. I haven't unlocked the other two levels for zombie mode yet, but my hopes are incredibly low at this point.If they would have given us the co-op campaign that they promised, and not continued to downgrade and ruin zombie mode, I'd have scored this much higher. But I'm so irritated that they would take away the campaign's co-op feature. I love multiplayer just like a lot of other people, but NOT at the expense of a co-op campaign. I'm sorry I purchased this game now, and I hope I can save a few of you from doing the same. I'm done with this series.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}

Plant \"CP\"","summary":"CALL OF DUTY BLACK OPS IS NEAR PERFECT! Please Read!","reviewText":"I had been looking forward to this game for about 2 months which is when i started watching videos of it on youtube and everything.  This game was by far my most anticipated game ever.  I had very high expectations for this game.  I will tell you that Treyarch met every single one of them and surpassed them all. First off i was insane about this game coming out and when i got it i went even more insane.  I told myself that i was going to beat the story mode before i played multiplayer.  I started playing the story mode the day i got it and ended up beating it the same day.  The story took me roughly 5 to 5 and 1/2 hrs to finish.  I never thought that the story mode would keep me so interested and enthralled.  This is by far the best story mode in any call of duty game.  The graphics are great, gameplay is smooth, achievements are fun, the voice acting is phenominal, Sam worthington did a great job.  I have no complaints about the story mode.  Now, .... to the best part, the multiplayer.  ABSOLUTELY THE BEST MULTIPLAYER EVER!  First off let me say that this game has a completely different feel then MW2.  It is also 10 times better then MW2.  They fixed all the stuff that made MW2 suck.  On top of that they added massive customization, and many ways to look at your stats and info.  I could write a book on Black Ops!  If you were the type of player to camp in a house and use one man army perk and keep shooting noob tubes at everyone, you are going to have a tough time playing black ops.  I'll give you some reasons why you will have a tough time: 1) killstreak kills dont count towards your next killstreak, 2) no one man army perk, 3)scavenger perk doesn't refill noob tubes or claymores, 4)noob tubes are not as strong, 5) no danger close perk, 6) IF YOU CAMP I WILL FIND YOU ;).  I used to doubt treyarch, but Treyarch is great!  They are alot better than infinity ward, because i truly believe that they care about what type of game they're making and don't just care about the money.  GREAT JOB TREYARCH!Favorites:1) Primary gun: Commando2) Secondary gun: Makarov3) Map: Cracked4) Perk: Sleight of Hand5) Game Mode: TDM","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2010"}
