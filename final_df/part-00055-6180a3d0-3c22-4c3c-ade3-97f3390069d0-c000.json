There isn't anything that new when gameplay is concern, but it does give you a little more open world capabilities. The story is pretty interesting, but isn't the best AC game out there.  It's hard to top AC2, though. The gameplay is not easy, and can get frustrating fast, so I guess there is a little bit of a learning curve.  Once you get use to the gameplay it gets a little less frustrating.  Overall AC4 is worth playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2013"}

It is one of those games that show off exactly how much fun the unique little system can be. Using the classic Mario Kart franchise, the game utilizes everything from the dual screens to the microphone to the multi-player and online support available with the DS. Far from simply a demonstration of the impressive hand-held system, though, it is also a terrific game in its own right.The game follows the formula made popular by the long-running Mario Kart series. It uses characters from the Super Mario Brothers franchise and puts them through a series of go-cart races with tracks that resemble levels of the various Mario games. The tracks themselves are a lot of fun, but more fun is the ability to sabotage your opponent using tricks and traps like banana peels that make them skid out or koopa shells that you can use to knock the opponent in front of you out of the lead. In addition, the game has several alternate modes, including challenge levels and a balloon battle where your goal is to knock all the balloons off of an opponent's cart. The race, balloon battle, and shine runner modes can all be played by up to eight people with or without extra copies of the game. Additionally, the wi-fi capabilities of the DS allow you to play online with people anywhere in the world, although this mode lacks a high degree of communication, making the online opponents feel very much like smarter versions of the computer AI.In addition to sixteen new tracks, there are several tracks brought in from other Mario Kart games, making this version of Mario Kart a complete package that brings in both the past and present. Overall, this is an excellent game for both veterans and novices of the franchise. It's worth hours of fun on its own, and also does an excellent job of showing off how awesome the Nintendo DS can really be.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00000I1BJ","description":"Raccoon City has been overrun by the living dead, and you are one of only a dwindling handful of survivors. You must escape the doomed city or become part of a ghastly new food chain: one with you at the bottom.You play as either Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop who's having areallybad first day on the job, or Claire Redfield, sister of one of the stars of the originalResident Evil. Leon and Claire's meeting is depicted in a visually stunning, B-movie cutscene. They're quickly separated, but occasionally meet up throughout the game.Right after the gruesome intro, you're dumped into the thick of things and have to dash through the devastated city streets, fleeing from one horde of zombies after another. As you make your way to a supposed refuge--the city police station--you find evidence that the citizenry fought bravely against the undead menace--and lost. Smashed barricades, abandoned police cars, boarded-up stores, dismembered bodies, and hundreds of expended bullet shell casings are all-too-common sights. Once you reach the station, you discover the remains of a siege. The defenders' desperate final hours are recorded in a fragmented journal. Its pages detail a possible escape route through an underground passage. Did the cops make it out? The alarming number of zombies wearing tattered police uniforms may be a clue.Resident Evil 2keeps the terrific puzzles and action of the original while vastly improving cinematic qualities such as dialogue, camera angles, cutscenes, atmosphere, and location design. An instant survival horror classic,Resident Evil 2has it all.--John CockingPros:ZombiesCheesy horror movie actionReal sense of dread--actually makes you jump with fright2 characters, 2 different angles on the storyCons:Clumsy save-game interfaceBacktracking for puzzles","reviewerName":"JackLiberty \"Steven Smith Jr.\"","summary":"YOU HAVE RE-ENTERED THE WORLD OF SURVIVAL HORROR","reviewText":"The series of Resident Evil continues with its sequel Resident Evil 2 on PlayStation released in 1998 and developed by Capcom once again. It takes place in Raccoon City which is the closest residence of the mansion from the first game. This time, the entire city has been transformed into zombies from the outbreak of the T-virus created by Umbrella. You get to play as two characters: Leon S. Kennedy (disc one) who is a Raccoon City Police Officer on his first day of the job and Claire Redfield (disc two) who came into town to search for her missing brother Chris Redfield who was one of the main characters in the first Resident Evil game. Both characters get their own set of weapons and storylines, but it doesn&#8217;t matter what order you play them in.The gameplay features the same basic principles as the first game. You have to solve puzzles, use a limited supply of ammunition, herbs to heal wounds, carry only eight items, and use typewriters to save. It&#8217;s nice they stuck with the original format of the first game and I wish every Resident Evil game in the series was like this.You get some new weapons such as a bowgun, sub machine gun, spark gun and upgrades to Leon&#8217;s handgun, shotgun and magnum. The aiming feels more comfortable and you always seem to be in control of where you shoot. One downside is that auto aim isn&#8217;t set by default. When you start the game, you have to press &#8216;Select&#8217; to get to the options, select the controller settings and set the mode to &#8216;Type C&#8217; to turn the auto aim feature on. A nice new addition is that the character&#8217;s current health can be determined by their posture and movement speed. This makes it easier to tell what condition your player is in and you don&#8217;t have to go to the inventory screen to find out how much health you have like with the first game. The Item Boxes are back where you can store items you don&#8217;t need and pick up later, but a new item you can retrieve is the &#8216;Side Pack&#8217; which will allow you to carry two more items increasing your total to ten. Both Leon and Claire are joined by a support partner throughout the story. Leon is aided by a woman named Ada Wong who is searching for her boyfriend. Claire is aided by a 12 year old girl named Sherry who was told to go to the police station because of the dangers in Raccoon City. But even the police station is infested with zombies and bio weapons. The enemies in this game are really memorable; there are the lickers who are just terrifying and powerful, especially later in the game. Then there&#8217;s Mr. X who is like the Terminator, he always comes back to hunt you down.The most innovative feature in this game is that there are different scenarios in this game. Say you play as Leon and complete the game as him; well you can then play as Claire in that same scenario to find out the true ending. And you can&#8217;t play Claire&#8217;s second scenario by popping in the second disc for the first time to play as her, you have to unlock it first. So in total, there are four possible scenarios in this game.Another innovative feature is that you get a ranking based on the total amount of time it took to complete a scenario, the number of saves and healing items you use. If you do well, you can unlock some goodies such as infinite ammo for a sub machine gun, gatling gun, rocket launcher, unlock special outfits and three new mini games. The first mini game, you play as Hunk, whose mission is to escape the Raccoon City Police Department with the latest G-Virus created by Umbrella. The second mode is known as &#8220;Extreme Battle&#8221; in which you play through the entire map of the game and you have to locate four special bombs to destroy the T-Virus in Umbrella&#8217;s Lab before it can cause a lot of damage. You get to play as four characters: Leon, Claire, Ada and Claire&#8217;s brother Chris. Each has their own set of weapons and you can adjust a difficulty setting to fight stronger monsters including bosses from the regular game. The third and final game mode is called &#8220;Tofu&#8221; and it is the strangest mini game I have ever seen. You play as this giant block of Tofu (Yes, I am dead serious, a giant piece of Tofu) and in terms of the objective it&#8217;s the same as Hunk&#8217;s mission except you play as Tofu, who is only equipped with a combat knife, so it makes this mini game very difficult to complete. I&#8217;ve completed the mode as Hunk, but never as Tofu. The good news however is that Tofu takes a lot of hits to kill so basically the only way to complete this game is to run. Don&#8217;t even bother fighting the enemies, the knife in Resident Evil 2 is just extremely weak and isn&#8217;t worth the time. Still this mode is worth playing just for the amusement factor because Tofu says some funny Japanese phrases whenever he gets hurt. It&#8217;s funny, even though I can&#8217;t understand it. It is also pretty difficult to unlock, you have to get an A ranking at least six times to play this mini game. For the Extreme Battle and Hunk, you only need two A rankings.One thing I didn&#8217;t mention yet is that the music is really awesome. It has orchestral themes and even opera themes and it fits the game very well. There were many different versions of this game. There was an updated version on PlayStation called Resident Evil 2: Dual Shock Edition which is the same as the regular game except it supports the PlayStation&#8217;s DualShock controller&#8217;s analog stick and vibration function. The Extreme Battle Mode I mentioned is exclusive only to the Dual Shock Edition. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;Rookie&#8221; mode which gives the player a Machine Gun with infinite ammo at the start of the game, but you can&#8217;t unlock the other mini games playing this difficulty even if you get an A ranking, you have to play Normal mode to unlock them. Another cool thing about the Dual Shock Version is you can use a cheat code to give yourself unlimited ammo. You just go to the control settings, hold R1 and press square repeatedly until the icon turns red. This version was later released on the PlayStation Store as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation 3.There were also ports on the PC and Dreamcast with slightly better graphics, higher frame rate and an art gallery. There was even a port on the Game com. It was a s***ty 2D black and white handheld console by Tiger. That port is just pathetic; I&#8217;m not even going to discuss it. The best port however is the Nintendo 64 version. The sound on the Nintendo 64 version is better than the PlayStation&#8217;s version, it has updated graphics, new costumes, a setting to adjust the violence and blood color, a more responsive aiming control scheme, new files, cheat codes to give you infinite health and ammo and the most interesting feature of all is a randomizer to place items differently during each playthrough so it definitely has more variety. The only thing it&#8217;s missing is the Extreme Battle mini game. But this port is equally as good as the PlayStation&#8217;s version.Any criticisms I have with this game? Well it&#8217;s hard for me to think of things I don&#8217;t like about this game, I guess a minor criticism is that you can&#8217;t skip the in game cut scenes, you couldn&#8217;t do that in the first game and it&#8217;s a minor annoyance when you already played the game a million times like I did and just want to get through the game. The problem most people have with this game is the beginning. You start the game surrounded by about ten zombies with a slow handgun. The first time playing, you only have a few seconds to figure out the controls until the zombie&#8217;s corner and kill you. It definitely sounds like a terrible idea to start next to the zombies. My strategy is to just run away. Hold square, press up on the d-pad to run and use up-left and up-right to get around the enemies. Once you figure that out, it isn&#8217;t too hard to get past the zombies and give yourself some breathing room. It did take me a while to figure out the controls but I&#8217;ve mastered it and you can too. The voice acting in this game is much better than the first Resident Evil, but still nothing too special. That&#8217;s about all the criticisms I can think of.When I was a kid, I used to play the s*** out of this game and in my opinion; this is undeniably not only the best Resident Evil game, but the best survival horror game and one of the best PlayStation games I have ever played. This game still manages to be very scary, if you&#8217;re playing this for the first time, you are guaranteed to be so scared; your heart will burst out your chest. Trust me; I had my jumps even to this day. It&#8217;s more fun playing this game alone in your room in the dark, with the volume turned up. This makes for a terrifying and memorable experience. I absolutely love this game, it&#8217;s just a masterpiece. I&#8217;d recommend getting the version from the PlayStation Store to play on the PS3 for only $6, or the regular PlayStation version or the Nintendo 64 version. Those are the best options. The replay value is very high for me and I could play this game at any time. You will admire this game and it&#8217;s by far the best in the entire series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}

I got this game for christmas and I am not dissapointed. However, EA games is really falling apart. I honestly don't know how hard it is to make a game not bad.The game is a hack and slash. Hit a constantly and your pretty much good. The levels are extremely well done but just man after man after man. The graphics are really good though. Lots of action.There are quite a few problems though. One, your allies do nothing. The path of the king levels are you with legolas and gimli. They do nothing and it is all you. Another huge problem is some levels are stupid. The path of the king levels are boring. It isn't fun hacking the dead over and over because it feels meaningless. Then it comes to the worst level of the game, the dead king. You beat him(a hard battle) then you run to the exit. I fight and get outnumbered 50 to one but I still beat the undead somehow. Still, if you've played it numerous times then you will know what I am talking about. Sometimes random rocks fall and kill you. There is NOTHING you can do. I have played the level a billion times because I just die to some random rock falling or because I go a little backwards.The game does have its good points. Good characters, some extras, and awesome environments(with the exclusion of the first few aragorn levels). The bad points though greatly overshadow the good. Once you beat the dead king level though, you probably won't play it again. Besides, the game is kinda short so 50 dollars is still a little high. Once it goes down to like 30, then buy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-25-2003"}

Well, yeah, that's what you get here, but luckily, World at War isn't just a newer version of an old game with a semi-fresh coat of paint.  Thankfully, World at War plays very much like Modern Warfare, from the grim and gritty tone to the excellent multiplayer modes.  Alternating between the American and Russian POV's, World at War offers a compelling story and plenty of exciting (and violent) moments to be had.  The game looks gorgeous with some brilliant audio quality as well, and the four-player co-op campaign mode is a nice addition as well.  Other multiplayer modes are carried over from Modern Warfare, and are still a blast to play.  Not to mention that including new weapons like the flamethrower and bayonet, and the unlockable Nazi Zombies co-op mode is worth the price of admission alone, and is insanely fun to play.  All in all, even though Activision has taken the Call of Duty franchise back to World War II, don't let that put you off to Call of Duty: World at War.  It's the best WWII-based FPS to see the light of day in a while, and is definitely worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000G6SPHI","description":"Sony God of War 2 PS2 God of War 2 PS2","reviewerName":"ICUH8N","summary":"A great game, just falls short of the original","reviewText":"A pretty good game that fans of the original will like. In my opinion, it is just fun and has some memorable moments, but is not earthshattering like God of War 1 was. Since GoW 1 pressed the limits of the PS2, this game is more of a continuation of the storyline (think GoW 1.5). I think we'd all have it that way, though, as opposed to the team messing with perfection.Really the only reasons I gave four stars is that the story is not as good or cohesive as the first. Instead of having motivation built through story line, level design and character development, everything (for the first 1/2 or 2/3 of the game or so) seems very contrived. You'll be going somewhere and get sidetracked by a very artificial plot device way too often. You feel like they ran out of ideas and wanted to lengthen the game. Second, it is very unclear what you are supposed to do sometimes. I felt the puzzles in the first game let you see where you needed to go, you just had to figure out how to do it. In GoW 2 you find things instances where you have to break this pillar to create a bridge, but how do you know you can do that when all the other pillars are indestructable? Then you get an item you didn't know you needed to advance. While many people will notice that most enemies are the same, the team took the liberty of making many more boss fights (one thing lacking in the original) and most of them are pretty amazing. A good game, just not legendary like the first installment.If you liked God of War, go buy this game. If you're a parent and wanting to know if this game is approriate for your child? It absolutely is not.Also, I think the game really picks up towards the end with some great boss battles and visuals. Sadly, though, GoW2 pulls a Halo 2 on us and the  game ends before you are treated to a final chapter. Kind of sad that after $50 and around 10 hours nothing is resolved. At least this game was a great sequel and didn't suffer from the Devil May Cry 2 disease.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2007"}

Backdrops are big and nicely detailed (the NYC and Astral Plane levels are particularly cool) and presentation is excellent (loading screens are beautiful to look at, menus are nice and responsive) but one can't help feeling that the PS 2 is capable of far more.SOUND: 4Excellent voice acting adds to a wonderful atmosphere that is hampered only by repetitive in-game battle music. Excellent sound effects and the option to skip over the longer monologues is a nice touch.PLAYABILITY: 4The controls are very responsive and, though detailed enough as to be complex, are by no means hard to learn. The learning curve is steep, but the intro levels with Wolverine, Cyclops and Magma are more than enough to familiarise yourself with tactics and motion. The Danger Room scenarios, accessible at any time, are great, too - becuase health items are very scarce in the earlier levels. The lack of interaction or a true RPG element is also somewhat annoying - how much cooler would a Final Fantasy-style X-Game with realtime combat have been??ATMOSPHERE: 3Although this is an X-Men adventure in the true mold, there are one or two things that detract from the atmosphere. Loading Screens, though pretty to look at, and very varied, cannot mask the fact that Loading Times in-game are insufferably long, and changing teams mid-mission becomes a huge chore. Similarly grating is the difficulty level of some of the later missions, and the price of resurrecting fallen teammates is disproportionately large, meaning you may find yourself going up against the final bosses with a handful of the more useless characters - Rogue, Gambit, Beast, Jubilee, etc.However, for every bad point here there's two good ones to take its place, and I defy all but the most finnicky of X-Purists to find something that actually ruins their enjoyment of the game.LASTING FACTOR: 4Levelling your individual teammates up as you see fit is a nice touch; powers become unlocked as you want them. Secret items and costumes are a great touch, and become available after you finish the game, which is nice and long. But two plays through this excellent adventure will leave you having seen everything - there's only a finite number of things to do and see.OVERALL:A truly great adventure game that loses its fifth star becuase of a few annoying gameplay quirks (loading times, a general feeling of 'on-rails', unfairly expensive items), 'X-Men Legends' is still a thoroughly recommended way to spend forty bucks.Roll on 'X-Men Legends 2'!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2005"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GEXM","description":"","reviewerName":"Enjolras","summary":"Beautiful graphics, lackluster gaming","reviewText":"Like a lot of gamers, I was very impressed by the early footage from Epic Mickey and Warren Specter's enthusiasm for the project. However, upon playing it, I'm decidedly mixed.THE GOODThe game is visually beautiful, really pushing the Wii's graphical capabilities above and beyond. The cutscenes look incredible, like a real cartoon. The levels are absolutely brimming with visual treats - no boring fields of grass or carbon copies of the same building repeated over and over. Look closely and you'll spot some cool Mickey paraphernalia in some levels.Using old cartoon strips as settings for the 2-D levels is ingenious. It's too bad they don't go on longer and only serve as transitional levels.There is some replay value. There are a lot of pins, which might interest players who like collecting Disney pins in real life. More interesting are the unlockable cartoon reels and concept art.THE BADThe gameplay. It just isn't that exciting. It seems the game was torn between appealing to kids and holding the interests of adult gamers. Epic Mickey was billed as a platformer, but the never reaches anything as exciting as the Mario games. There's some jumping, there are some decent moments, but it's mostly just fetch quests where you have to find an item for somebody. However, the fetch quests often seem forced as they come at random times from people who aren't well developed characters (there are exceptions - I liked Horace the Detective).Other reviewers have criticized the camera system and I do agree. It's not a deal breaker, but there are times when it refuses to give you a clear view of what you need to see.THE UGLYThe game is too hard for kids, too easy for adults. I think this game would have benefitted greatly from allowing the user to adjust the difficult setting.THE FINAL WORDAt the end of the day, there's a lot of potential in Epic Mickey, but I can't really say it's a great game. It's probably one of the better third-party games for the Wii, but that's not saying a whole lot. I will probably try Epic Mickey 2 because Warren Specter seems aware of Epic Mickey's flaws, but I won't be rushing to get it on Day One.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2012"}

Wind","summary":"Not really a Nintendo fan... But I really like this console.","reviewText":"Okay, first a little background, and then I'll get to the review:  I'm not a Nintendo fan. Yes, I'm in my 40s, and I owned a Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Nintendo Entertainment System in the 80s and 90s. I enjoyed both quite a lot, but then, didn't everybody? Nintendo really had it going back then.When they introduced the N64, however, I was nonplussed. Mostly, I was ticked that they stuck with cartridges in an era when CDs were king. This choice limited what they could do with the N64, and I still cringe when I think about how much more awesome games like Mario 64, Conker's Bad Fur Day, and WWF No Mercy would have been if they had a little more room for data on a CD. Still, I did enjoy those few games, and a couple others got my attention. Ultimately, though, the N64 was a flop for me. I was unimpressed with the game lineup.When Nintendo threw the GameCube at the public, I held off. It seemed like it was \"too little, too late\" and for the most part, I was right. The games didn't impress me all that much. The forced jump to 3D for Metroid didn't make me happy. The lack of third party titles was glaring. The choice to use proprietary discs made me wonder what could have been if they'd used DVDs instead, like the PS2 and Dreamcast. Eventually I picked one up, used, and played with it for a while, but ultimately sold it because there were no games I wanted to play.And then, finally, the Wii arrived and I totally skipped it. I wasn't into the gimmick, and I was really not interested in another standard definition console after shelling out the big bucks for an HDTV when they were first out, and still quite expensive. As the years went by, a few games piqued my curiosity, but I still never jumped at the Wii.In-between all this, I enjoyed the original Game Boy, the Gameboy Advance, and even the Virtual Boy. I messed around with the DS, but didn't keep it, and didn't transition to the DSi or 3DS.So basically, I bailed on Nintendo in the late 90s because I felt that they were losing touch with what I wanted as a gamer. They always seemed late to the party with new technology, or if they were first with something, it was kind of gimmicky and I just didn't see the appeal. When they announced the Wii U, I said pretty much the same thing: \"A gimmick controller, and they're release all the same games again. I really don't want to play another Mario, Zelda, or Metroid title.\"Boy, was I wrong!I got a Wii U because I happened to be in the right place at the right time, and figured that if I could decide later whether to keep it, or sell it. Eventually, being the gadget freak I am, I had to hook it up and give it a try, and I was pleasantly surprised.THE SETUPThe first pleasant surprise was that the box contained some nice things. This was just the Basic Set-- The white one-- And it was still packed with an HDMI cord, a nice, low-profile Wii sensor bar, and of course the GamePad and console along with all the necessary cords. It's packaged smartly, with everything neatly wrapped and in its place. It reminded me a bit of a 1990s Apple product in this regard-- Simple, elegant packaging with everything you'll need to get started. The HDMI cable was almost like a little apology from Nintendo for making us wait for an HD console.There are two AC adapters with the Wii U. One is for the console, and the other is for charging the GamePad. The Deluxe Set comes with a charging cradle, too, but in the Basic Set the charging cable is plenty to keep you gaming, and if you want the cradle I'm sure there will be tons of them on the market soon (aside from the first-party version that's already out there, I mean.)Once everything was connected, I powered on and was taken through a very simple start-up procedure which included a system update after establishing an Internet connection. On the screen (despite what some \"journalists\" might have told you) is a message telling you not to remove the power supply while the system updates. Even if you do, though, the system is dummy-proof. You'll get a black screen while it finishes the update (in a \"recovery\" mode) and then it will apply the update and come back to the Wii U menu. If you see the black screen (if you're stupid enough to unplug the device while it's doing a system update, that is) then don't panic. Your console is not \"bricked\"-- It's just fixing your mistake.For most of us, this will not be a big problem.After the update (1GB, not 5GB as some people are reporting) the system is ready to go. You're encouraged to make a Mii, which is pretty easy and done on the GamePad, and then you're let free in the Wii U menu to start playing. You'll be greeted by a screen full of Mii characters, all popping up little messages and drawings. Oh, yes... you can send drawings done on the GamePad's touch screen as messages in the Miiverse. Kinda nifty.THE ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCEAs I have the Basic Set, I do not have NintendoLand. It sounds cool, but I'll wait for that one. Instead, being a big fan of zombies, I picked up ZombiU. I also picked up Super Mario Bros U because I was told it's fantastic. Without getting into game reviews here, I'll just say that I'm very pleased with both games-- Especially with the integration of the GamePad's touch screen into regular gameplay. It's very cool. Nintendo has lots of practice doing this sort of thing, too, with the Nintendo DS systems.Rather than talking about individual games here, I'll talk about the other things that impressed me about the Wii U. Namely, the Web Browser, Netflix, and TV Remote functions.WEB BROWSERThe Wii U has one of the best TV Web browsing interfaces ever. Via the GamePad, you can surf the web seamlessly. You have a keyboard on the touchscreen for when you need it. You have the ability to smoothly zoom web pages in and out and pan them left and right via the analog sticks, as well as handling basic up/down scrolling the same way. You can save bookmarks, open multiple tabs, and do anything on the Web that doesn't require Flash. Apple fans will feel at home, and really, anybody still reliant on Flash these days (as opposed to HTML 5) is just dragging their heels.The Web Browser interface of the Wii U simply shines. I've used Web TV, MSN TV, PS3, Dreamcast, and a variety of other methods to access the Web on my television (including an HTPC with a standard web browser), and by far the Wii U outstrips them all in ease of use. Some have a bonus mark due to Flash compatibility, but the Wii U's GamePad interface makes up for that omission in a big way. I didn't expect to use the Wii U as a web browsing device, but now I could see skipping the HTPC or PS3, and going straight to the Wii U if I need to get online on the TV.And here's the kicker: You can also access the Web on the GamePad screen itself. You don't need to rely on the TV at all. If you want to walk away (to within about 25 feet of the console, anyway), the GamePad will act like a tablet and let you get online via the wireless connection with the console. Very cool.NETFLIXAgain, the Wii U beats the pants off other devices. I have a PS3, HTPC, Sony Set-top \"Smart TV\" box, and have used several other Netflix devices (Roku, WDTV, Xbox 360, etc.) and I'm here to tell you that the Wii U's Netflix integration is beautifully done. You can scroll through titles on the GamePad, control movie functions on the GamePad, and even have the video transferred to display on the GamePad so you can watch as if it's a tablet. When watching a movie on the TV screen, the GamePad provides information about the film you're watching (cover art, title, length, summary, scrubber/time bar, controls, etc.) -- It's the best way to watch Netflix, hands down. The only negative-- one I hope will be fixed in a future update-- is that the GamePad screen does not shut off after a while, so you're burning a couple hours of battery if you watch a movie with it unplugged, even if it's displaying the movie on the TV. I suspect this was an oversight, and that future versions will offer a \"turn off GamePad screen\" option due to popular demand. Right now you can turn off the GamePad screen, but when you tap a button to bring back your movie, the GamePad screen wakes up.Still, this is the best Netflix device out there. I stand by that. I'm not the only one saying it, either. Go ahead and look it up. I'll wait. . .See? Pretty cool, huh?TV REMOTE FUNCTIONSRight now, this is very basic, but it's just so easy to use! You pick your TV's manufacturer from a list, and test the settings until it works. For my Zenith TV, it worked on the second try. Once you do this, hitting the \"TV\" button on the GamePad turns it into a TV remote. You can change channels, adjust volume, and change inputs (to switch between Wii U and TV shows, I'd suppose!) all from the GamePad screen. No more juggling two remotes to jump between console and TV!Here's a tip: The \"A\" button on the GamePad works as the \"Enter\" button for the TV Remote functions.In the future this mode will be made even more useful with Nintendo's TVii service. We won't know what's up with that until December, but Nintendo seems pretty stoked about it.OTHER THINGS[*] The Stylus: It's cool that they have a nice little stylus built into the GamePad, much like on the DS.[*] Rearranged Buttons: It takes some getting used to, but the four buttons on the right side don't respond in American style, with the bottom button as \"Yes/Enter\" and the right button as \"No/Back\". Instead, they're Japanese/European style, with the right button (A) being \"Yes/Enter\" and the bottom button being \"No/Back\". At first this seems an odd choice for a market that Nintendo themselves spoiled with the rearranged American-style buttons, but it becomes obvious that they made the choice because they put their right analog stick ABOVE the buttons, instead of below or to the side of them. This means that when you reach down from the analog stick, it's easier to hit the right button than it is to hit the bottom button. Just bear in mind that you may need to get used to a change if you come from any other American console.[*] Wii Remote: The system does not come with a Wii Remote. You need to pick one up separately. Until you have one, you can't enter the Wii Menu or play multiplayer (local) games on Wii U. Luckily, the Wii Remote is ubiquitous these days, and you can find them dirt cheap if you shop around. Once I acquired mine, I was pleased to see how easily it synced and then worked to control the Wii U's cursor in Wii U and Wii modes. I was also very pleased with the way it worked for Super Mario Bros U as an old-school NES-style controller.[*] Nintendo's Store: The online store is frankly a little sparse right now. There's no Wii U Virtual Console at the moment, though if you go into the Wii Menu and enter the Wii shop, you'll find the Wii Virtual Console games are still available and seem to be perfectly capable of functioning on the Wii U, in Wii mode. This leads me to address the way they handle backwards compatibility... This is not like the PS3 or Xbox 360. When you inserted a legacy title into those consoles, they'd just start the game in an emulation mode. With the Wii U, you have to actually enter the Wii Menu to find the Wii games. In effect, you're switching the Wii U to Wii mode and then loading games from that mode. When in this mode, it's just a Wii, without Wii U functions. I found this to be a strange choice, and no doubt it will curtail the use of the GamePad's advanced functions for any Virtual Console titles bought from the Wii mode. Sadly, when in Wii mode, the Wii U will not do anything fancy with the GamePad. That is saved only for Wii U games and software.[*] Storage Questions: A lot of you are saying \"Why did you get the white console? The black one has more storage capacity!\" and my answer is pretty simple: Because Nintendo intends for us to use external storage with the Wii U. Hooking up an external 500GB hard drive was no problem for me, and now it sits quietly in my entertainment center with the Wii U as its eternal partner, doing its thing. Why bother spending extra and getting the fingerprint-prone black version when I could have a nifty white Wii U and end up with approximately the same amount of storage space? The 32GB will be burned through quickly enough, and I suspect Deluxe Set owners will be connecting hard drives to their Wii U shortly after they buy the console. If you're worried about storage, you're fretting over nothing. Unlike Microsoft, Nintendo was kind to console owners and let us use our own hard drive to upgrade without needing a special caddy or partition. Just connect the drive, and let the Wii U format it. Voila, you're done.[*] Disc Playback: This is my biggest gripe. Nintendo decided, once again, to use proprietary discs. What this means is that the Wii U can't play DVDs or Blu-ray Discs. While this doesn't affect me personally (I have a PS3, after all), I suspect there will be people out there who only justify having one gaming console, and it would be really nice to integrate disc playback so that the number of HDMI ports taken by hardware isn't continually expanding. I don't dock Nintendo any stars for this decision, but I do think it was a cheap choice.[*] GamePad Concerns: The GamePad is a great controller. It's not as heavy as you'd think, and it's not what I'd consider bulky, though it is big and unusual. As a controller, I like it. However, as a tablet it suffers. The GamePad is limited by range and line-of-sight with the Wii U console. If you put a wall between the GamePad and the Wii U, the signal is in danger of dropping past about ten feet. That's unfortunate, because being able to wander all around the house with the GamePad to play SMBU or watch Netflix would be very handy. As it stands, unless you have your Wii U in a wall-less zone, your mileage (or footage, rather) may vary. The other concern is battery power. The GamePad lasts about four hours, give or take, depending on what power-saving settings you choose. Remember to dock/plug in the GamePad whenever you're done using it! Hopefully, better batteries come along in later years.[*] Fun Factor: When it comes down to it, Nintendo knows how to make a console fun. Little touches like Miiverse really add to the experience. The fact that the console comes with a camera, motion detector, touch screen, and discrete wireless speakers is a testament to Nintendo's understanding of small things adding up. Some tiny omissions, such as the lack of a TOSlink/optical audio port (meaning you MUST be able to pass-through surround from your TV or have a surround receiver that handles HDMI if you want surround sound), are a detriment to this fun factor, but ultimately Nintendo hits most of the right highs and avoids the lows that drag a console down.FINAL VERDICTI am a former Nintendo owner who never quite became a \"fan\", per se, of the Nintendo brand. You could even say that I was disgruntled by the time the N64 launched. The Wii U turned that around. I may not be a \"fan\" yet, but I do like the hardware and the software that goes with it. So far. If third party developers continue to show up, and if Nintendo continues to do cool stuff with the GamePad and services like TVii, Amazon Video on Demand, and Hulu Plus, then the Wii U will be a must-have console for a family of gamers. Not just for the kids. Not just for grandma and grandpa. Not just for mom and dad. Not just for hardcore gamers. It will be the console for everybody in the family, no matter how seriously or flippantly they take video gaming. Even when viewed as just a Web browsing console with Smart TV functions, the Wii U is a winner.So as it stands at the moment, Nintendo managed to turn this nay-sayer into a yeah-sayer. We'll see if they can maintain this level of happiness with future updates, software releases, and other goodies. For now, the Wii U remains in my entertainment center, and I'm certain it will get much use.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0001KUE7S","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. If your PC has the juice to set this game loose and you have a thirst for first-person shooter action, you're in for a treat. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have.Hell on MarsYour character is a low-ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the Mars Research Facility of the United Aerospace Corporation (UAC). That's pretty much all the backstory you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the storyline department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of the Doom franchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?), it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well-crafted sound effects succeeded at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth... ethereal Revenants fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy... a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll often find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might easily be solved by duct-taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.Looking GoodDoom 3looks incredible. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. The eye candy does come at a price, though, and we were forced to play at fairly low resolution even on a Pentium IV 2.8 GHz and an ATI Radeon 9500. Even so, gameplay was smooth as silk. For higher resolutions (1024 x 768 and above) the latest generation of ATI or Nvidia cards is suggested.--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessRich variety of enemiesPlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineStiff system requirementsNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multiplayer options","reviewerName":"azn4life173","summary":"Great game!","reviewText":"Been a fan of horror survival games for a long time and wanted to play some of the original games, so i ended up buying this one and its definitely a classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-28-2013"}

Always willing to take a risk on a non-violent game. Of course, this does follow the same mold of previous popular non-violent games such as Harvest Moon and The Sims. But Nintendo doesn't delve into the sexual (however mild) relationships of those two games. It's not about wooing and winning your love, hopping in bed for a little Woo-hoo!, and creating a life for your character. This game's about fishing, catching bugs, collecting furniture, doing jobs for the neighbors, and paying off the mortgage on your house. The most violent thing in it is whacking your neighbors over the head with the bug net, and the only sexuality involves the questionable shape of the gyroid machines.The Good:+ Addictive+ A colorful cast of characters+ Tons to collect and customizeThe Bad:-- The lack of goals may turn some gamers away-- The charm wears off eventuallyThe Ugly::( Just what is your character supposed to be?Gameplay--8/10The purpose of this game is to just live in the game's town and interact with everyone and everything. Paying off your house's mortgage to shopkeeper Tom Nook is the only real goal, but you can work it at your own pace. It's a little ironic that to get the money to pay off the mortgage, you have to sell stuff to Tom Nook. He's basically paying it off for you, with only miniscule effort on your part. Of course, paying it off has its rewards: a larger house. The first time you pay off the mortgage, your house size increases twofold, but then you have a new payment to make. Make that, and you get a basement, and so on.There are plenty of things to do, so many that it's difficult to mention them all without just listing them. I'll mention a few, since part of the fun is figuring out everything for yourself, anyway. The three obvious things are those connected with the museum, where you can donate fossils, bugs, and fish. Fossil finding is nothing more than luck. You find a patch of grass marked with an \"X,\" dig it up, and send your findings in the mail for it to be identified. Catching insects and fish is much more fun and rewarding. They appear in different types of weather and different seasons of the year. Thus, insects are scarce in the winter time. And different fish appear in the sea water than in the fresh water. There's a much greater variety of fresh water fish, though the sea has the largest and rarest of the fishes. Catching the coelacanth is great. Catching it again is even better. The first time it can go to the museum, and the second it can go in your basement. Of everything you can do in the game, I spent the most fishing.Unfortunately, it gets a little boring in this blissful, peaceful town. There's not much to do other than what I've listed. You can kick a ball around, build a snowman, or accessorize your wardrobe, but when things get boring, there's nothing to get you past that point of boredom. Other games might grow boring until you get past a certain point, but Animal Crossing doesn't have that luxury. Once it's boring, that's it. And if you neglect your town long enough, it will become overrun by weeds because, apparently, you're the only citizen who cares enough to keep it cleaned up. If you ever have an urge to come back to it after giving it a break, the weeds ruin your welcome back. As the rest of the neighbors live in their blissful ignorance, you'll be left to pull out weeds one by one. Pretty soon you'll just give up.Longevity--10/10Despite the above-mentioned boredom, the game will suck up lots of your time before you set it aside for good. That you can share your town with other players is a plus, and it makes letter writing much more fun. Since it is a game you can't complete, it technically has an infinite life span. Some people will quit after a couple of hours, most will quit after fifty, and many will continue to wipe the dust off their Gamecube, plug this game in, and play for many, many more hours.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2013"}

After giving us The Twin Snakes, a re-imagination of the first MGS game for Nintendo's GameCube, Konami is back to deliver the authentic follow-up, Snake Eater. After the controversial outcome that resulted from Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear fans won't have to worry about the absence of Snake or another convoluted storyline here. Snake Eater truly defines what tactical espionage action is all about, and being one of the best games available for the PS2.As a prequel to the series, Snake Eater starts off rather sluggish, but later picks up the pace, drawing in gamers to 1960s USSR and taking on a similar presentation to James Bond films. Unlike Sons of Liberty, the plotlines of Snake Eater are much easier to follow while the characters remain memorable without too much backstory to slow the game down. The gameplay is by far the most sophisticated in any Metal Gear game yet, requiring the player to correctly utilize camouflage combinations, curing and healing specific parts of the body, and using the much talked-about close quarters hand-to-hand combat.Graphics-wise, Snake Eater pushes the PS2's visual capabilities to the limits. Moving blades of grass and foliage, signs of life in the environment, and amazing water and fire effects grace this great-looking title. Wonderfully directed cinemas tell the story flawlessly and even feature interactive cutscenes. Although the game does suffer from bouts of slowdown and hitches in framerate, it's still the most detailed Metal Gear game to date. The voice acting and soundtrack are both top notch, while the traditional sound effects from past MGS games can still be heard.The awkward pacing of the game may turn off some players, however. And while this is a true \"sequel\" in a sense to the series, others may find it difficult to understand why the setting of the game was chosen. Snake Eater is a fantastic game on its own, but those following the MGS story may feel strange as to why they're even playing it during this timeframe in the first place. These issues aside, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater still makes up for what MGS2 lacked. Even though the game can be beaten within a short period of time, the experience it gives to the player is really unlike any other, which is reason enough for anybody to give this one a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2004"}

I loved it!  I saw it a total of 4 times in theaters.  So when I saw the game, I HAD to pick it up.  And pick it up I did, and played through the entire thing several times.  But something was missing.  Here's what I thought of Spider-man: The Movie!1) Gameplay: Its a very fun game, and this is it's strongest point.  You can, in 4 words, \"Do Anything Spider-man Can!\"  You can swing around the HUGE cities, beat up thugs with over 40 different moves (you unlock new ones buy getting Golden Spiders), crawl on any wall, etc...  You can shoot web, do web domes (protect you from enemy gunshots, etc...)  You can also crawl anywhere you can get your fingers on, hang down from a sort of web rope and spy on unsuspecting enemies.  The whole thing is really quite fun, and while I've owned this game for 4 months, I still pop it in and swing around Spidey style every once and awhile.  Thats how good the gameplay is.The problem here?  There are only about 12 levels, most fairly easy.  And while going back and playing them on the harder setting is fun, its not half as fun the second time around.As for playing it on the harder settings (there are 4: Easy, Normal, Hero, Super Hero), its almost IMPOSSIBLE on just Normal.  Easy you can beat in 2 days, but the rest...  The enemies strenth twice as strong, the enemies atacks are twice as strong, your web supply goes down by almost half.  It's just WAY too hard.  It gets to a point where your almost scared to go down and fight a thug because you'll lose so much of your health.  Hard-core gamers will find the first 3 settings difficult (while casual get stuck on just normal), while even Hard-core, awsome, never die gamers will get stuck on Super Hero.  It's added depth, but its also really annoying.  I'd give gameplay 4 stars*2) Graphics: Fairly good.  You can see the web perfectly, Spider-man looks awsome.  The worlds are beautifly annimated, and each are fairly large.  The problem?  The faces look terrible, and there aren't enough character designs (too many of the same people)!  When you tie up enemies, the webbing jut looks like...there.  It doesn't rap around, it just looks really bad...  When your fighting thugs, or people, or whatever, you'll find yourself fighting dozens of people.  Yet there are only 2 common types of thugs, two types of business men, two types of guards, you get the point.  If your sitting there, fighting off 12 people, you'll notice that 6 look EXACTLY the same, and the other 6 look EXACTLY the same.  Its like your fighting an army of clones.  Very dissappointing, otherwise the graphics are very good.  But counting that last comment, I have to give it 3 stars*3) Options: Probably the game's weakest point.  NO multiplayer or 2-player cooperation (would have been really cool!).  No real bonuses or un-lockables.  There are some mini-gamers, like Pin-head bowling, or \"The Big Brawl\", but NOTHING that will keep you playing the mini-game for more than a few minutes.  And the freedom that this game could have built upon...just isn't there.  Being able to look for crimes and stop them, seeing HUGE cities from Spider-man's point of view, and getting to explore a full New York City.  That would have been cool!But they didn't, they just went by the story.  And while the story in this game (to go with the movie) is great, I think it would have been cooler if u could have had some freedom in between missions.  The way it is, you are confined mostly to the insiden of buildings, having to go a SPECIFIC way, with no freedom.  It's still a fun game, but didn't take advance of what (in my mind) could have made a GREAT game.  2 Stars*4) Sound: The game's strongest point.  Voice acting by the actors from the movie, it really adds to the experience.  As for the characters not in the movie, EXTREMELY well done.  Even the casual \"Look mommy, there's Spider-man\" from a little girl's perspective is done to perfection, as you often feel like you are living in Spider-man's world.  The villains sound evil and menacing, the thugs sound...like thugs...  And everyone really clicks to a sort of New York feeling, which adds to the game.The web makes sounds: swish, swash.  Really cool!  The gunshots sound real and scary, the fighting scenes sound...convinving.  Other than that, this game's SOUND was awesome!  4.5 stars*Overall, I really liked this game.  Its fun to go back and play, and there's enough positives to compete with the negatives.  I'd definantly recommend this game if u can find it for a good price.As long as your not looking for perfection, you WON'T be disappointed.  A pretty good game compared to past Spider-man games!Thx!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2003"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR12","description":"","reviewerName":"genocidal_maniac","summary":"SP Campaign is like a millennial Justin Bieber COD","reviewText":"I play COD for the single-player campaigns. The MP just isn't my thing. I can name a number of shooters which have IMO better multiplayer than COD. They include: Warhammer Space Marine, Transformers War for Cybertron, Ravaged, Red Orchestra 2, and Firefall.But the SP in COD is really special. The characters are personable, the realism is immersive, the interactive events are spectacular. On reflection, what makes COD campaigns special is that you never feel alone during them. You always have an AI teammate talking you through it. It's like in each campaign you meet a new friend: The Russian Victor Reznov, The Brit Captain Price, The American Bownman, The Scot Soap MacTavish.I'm not enjoying the SP in Black Ops 2.To start off, it doesn't have the same personality as previous games. It takes itself too seriously. There's a new \"best buddy\" here. Unlike previous \"best buddies,\" this guy kinda sucks. He's another macho dude, well, they're all macho dudes, but somehow this guy just sucks. He has a gravelly voice and is completely generic. He has the charisma of Steven Segall. The campaign feels like a dumb Stephen Segall film, actually, where previous games felt like over-the-top Michael Bay movies (and yes, Michael Bay movies do have an intelligence to them compared to many action directors. That of course is for another argument).Secondly, we see a resurrection. Now, it has been argued that it was the Death and resurrection of Superman that ruined comic books. Here, it is the resurrection of Sgt Woods that ruins it. COD I would say had literary significance because you often saw named characters from previous games in the series that you actually controlled, you saw them die in later games. That was cool. It's a reminder that in war, heroes die. The first Black Ops portrayed the death of a major character from a previous game quite poignantly.Thirdly, a lot of the humor is gone. The first Black Ops started off in a Cuban Bar. You saw a woman dancing in a summer dress. It was kind of silly and awesome. You saw Mason being subject to a comically over-the-top Cold War interrogation. You were treated to a Yossarian-esque inking out of classified documents. Here...in between missions you get treated to some sci-fi sight of this futuristic jet.And okay, now to the main problem with the game: the sci-fi turn. I hate the sci-fi turn. It completely destroys the character of the series. COD is supposed to be about realism on a visual level. The weapon handling is completely unrealistic of course, with minimal recoil and quickened reload and setup times, but the actual weapons modeled are real guns. The vehicular sequences are unrealistic as well, but they are based on vehicles that I'd expect to see in real life, and there's some clever scripting of those sequences in previous COD games. Here, you're treated to drone armies. now, for sci-fi it's not completely out of the realm of the possible. The drones that you see a lot of are based on prototypes that I've seen in the pages of Popular Science. So it's not like the 2-legged mecha of Japanese anime which is utterly unrealistic, but it is based on quadrocopter drones that the US mil actually uses, as well as 4-legged walkers that I have seen video prototypes of, and small little treaded robots that are based off of bomb-disposal robots. But it's annoying. It takes the emotion out of many of the battles because you're not against humans, but against robots.The weapons suffer in the sci-fi turn. Basically, they're higher capacity versions of existing weapons. One gun reloads in the same time as an M16 and carries over 100 rounds per mag. It takes some of the strategy out of it and makes the guns into, well, video-gamey guns, like something out of Contra or battletoads.The sci-fi turn results in you going into sci-fi environments. This is one of the worst of all. You get to see...a mall. You also see a night club. I hate seeing clubs in games. I can go in real life to these places, and have a better time in real life. It is harder for me, and therefore a better game, when they depict events that are not common, like for instance rappelling down huge cliffs in the first Black Ops. Anyways, in the Night Club, nothing really clever is done with the sequence. Previous games wore their influences on the sleeve. MOW2 for instance aped the Rock quite well, and then imitated James Bond films. The Night Club would have been a great opportunity for a Collateral-esque scene. Instead...you're treated to the image of a guy shooting a club-goer and a generic sequence.The writer for the campaign is actually the same guy who cowrote the Batman films: David Goyer. So you're also treated to parts that feel ripped out of the Batman films, and many of the weapons and gadgets do feel vaguely Batman-esque. That might explain a lot, but it just doesn't fit the series.There are some good moments. The developers did seem to work hard at innovating in gameplay and it shows. They modeled roughly the handling of a horse in a mission and that is commendable. They tried to implement some side-missions that were like Natural Selection in that you have an RTS-esque tactical control. There's a light branching structure in the story and so you have a bit more choice in this game than previous COD games. Those innovations are nice and all, but COD isn't about experimentation. COD is about awesome execution. And so these experimental structures just end up annoying me.In that view, the best innovation is allowing you to choose your weapon loadout prior to the mission. That allows me to select the Colt M1911 pistol as my primary weapon in every single mission and that is awesome. I would recommend that you try to play all COD campaigns with only a pistol. You have to aim your shots more carefully, and actually hitting a target far away is an accomplishment. You have to run in closer to get kills, which is more thrilling than just hiding back and shooting a rifle (or worse, a sniper rifle) from far away.Sadly, the sci-fi turn makes for a very generic COD SP campaign. I really hope they don't continue in this theme in the future. All in all, following the superbly entertaining Black Ops 1 campaign, I like to pretend that this one just never happened.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Good follow-up","reviewText":"I am an old veteran of the AOE series, having played both previous titles extensively in single and multiplayer. The thing that distinguishes this series from other RTS franchises (say, C&C; and Warcraft) are more or less as follows: Many more factions to pick from, more resource types & micromanagement, and the fact that AOE actually tries to be somewhat historically accurate.First off, I must admit that I'm a big fan of the fast-paced action type of RTS, a la Red Alert. This is probably one of the reasons I enjoyed AOE 3. I really don't like micromanagement (Terran was my least favorite race in Starcraft) and in previous installments of AOE I often employed trade in the market very heavily, because I just couldn't be bothered to find another dumb stone (or whatever) deposit. AOE 3 goes a long way to reducing the typical micromanagement of the series. For one, there's fewer resources, and you don't have to build gathering structures. Just get some citizens, right click on the stone (or whatever) and they get to it. They also removed the need to carefully place things like farms, since resources don't need manual delivery.The 'historical' single play campaigns in the previous games were, in my opinion, the biggest draw of the last two titles. Frankly, they were so boring it was a chore to play through them. The objectives were usually something on the order of 'capture 4 relics and move them from point A to point B,' or, when they weren't feeling particularly imaginative, 'kill everything.' AOE 3 pretty much flushes that down the toilet, and the campaign in this game is more or less a fantasy story. But the thing is, it's actually fun, and who plays computer games to learn about history anyway?A few new features include the ability to build a deck of cards, which allow you to send goods, units, and upgrades from your home city. This is tied into an experience point system. You get experience for practically everything, including just being a warm body, and these allow you to spend the cards in your deck. You can also train up to five infantry or cavalry units of the same type at once, producing them as a squad. Adding more units to a squad in training takes no extra time, so this can in fact save your hide. Additionally, some warships can train infantry and cavalry while near a shore, thus acting as a mobile base. AOE 3 also borrows a Warcraft 3 concept, in that maps are scattered with treasure protected by guardians. Kill the guardians and you can collect the loot. There is also greatly reduced emphasis on defensive structures. Forts are high level cards, so you won't be able to farm stone like mad and have one up 10 minutes into the game. Most defenses and structures are weak, and go down quickly to concentrated attacks- especially by artillery. Thus you are compelled to build a balanced standing army, which I would say is an improvement.The sounds and graphics are, as one would expect, top-notch. If you have a good machine, the detail gets truly fantastic, especially when artillery and naval units come into play. Unit balance is well done, though admittedly this might be due to the fact that many units are the same for all nations. As with most other RTS games, there is a pronounced paper-rock-scissors setup, although vast numbers of anything will generally get the job done.What's there to not like about AOE 3? Well, the main problem is the number of races. Especially if you don't count the Native American sub-factions, there are way fewer than in either of the previous games. The factions in this game aren't really more or less distinctive than those in the previous ones, so this isn't a good thing. This is going to be addressed shortly in the upcoming expansion, however, so it's not a permanent problem.The second issue is the graphics performance. AOE 3 seems to be heavily optimized for nvidia, and heavily un-optimized for ATI graphics cards. I have an ATI setup that runs The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion at 25+ FPS anywhere with max detail, but it sometimes drops into the single-digits in AOE 3 at the same resolution. Granted, this doesn't happen very often (usually in areas with tons of units and many doodads) but it really shouldn't happen at all.Lastly, if you actually like the micromanagement and quasi-historical campaign of the previous games, AOE 3 will likely turn you off. The battles are more arcade style than what you would see in, say, Rome: Total War- emphasis on impressive visual effects rather than realism.In my opinion, these changes were generally for the better, and though it does make AOE 3 a bit more 'mainstream' than its predecessors, the game is also a good deal more fun than they were. For one, those that couldn't stand the resource model and villager babysitting of the previous games in the series may want to give this one a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001E8VB3C","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Dark Knight Finally Gets a Game That Does Him Justice","reviewText":"Video games haven't been too kind to Batman.  Often times when we think of a Batman game, the first thing that comes to mind is that the game just isn't going to be all that spectacular.  What is it about the Batman that hasn't always worked in the past?  It's hard to point out.  What we can point out, however, is that Batman Arkham Asylum doesn't fall into that category.  In fact, it is easily one of the best Batman games to be released.  From its humble beginnings, the game is fine tuned video game that does most of what it does incredibly well.Let's begin with the production values.  This is by far one of Arkham Asylum's strong points.  The game begins with the Joker being caught and taken to Arkham Asylum, but he seems to be pretty non-chalant about it, and Batman doesn't like that one bit.  And it turns out he was right to be suspicious.  The Joker springs a trap and Batman is caught in the middle.  Now he's trapped inside the Asylum with the Joker controlling things, as well as several other adversaries.One of the nice things about Arkham Asylum is that it presents its story very well.  The art style feels comic book like, but it doesn't skimp on the overall visual presentation either.  There's a lot of artistic flair and technical goodness to behold with the graphics.  Most of the environments look fascinating and will really draw you into the game.  The tone is perfect.  The other good aspect is the voice acting.  If you remember that Batman: The Animated Television series you'll be surprised to see its the same voices.  Kevin Conroy is Batman and Mark Hamill is the Joker.  And the voices are done very well.  The production values of the game are absolutely stellar.Of course, a game just isn't much if it only goes off of visual flair alone.  In the past gameplay seems to be one of the areas in which Batman games often stumble.  In the past the games have had a hard time crafting together good gameplay elements or sometimes being unreasonably clunky.  This is mostly Batman's past.  The games sometimes felt rushed.  This isn't the case with Arkham.  In fact, the game mostly keeps things pretty simple.  The combat is really easy to pick up on, having you string together simple combos.  But the game hardly devolves into button mashing.  This is because your enemies will take advantage of the situation, and the game makes sure you can't rush head on into things.  First and foremost, most of your foes are willing to take advantage of their surroundings.  Second, you can't go head to head with several enemies all toting guns at once.  This is definitely not a beat 'em up kind of game.  In fact, in some areas, caution and stealth are required.There has rarely been a Batman game where you actually feel like Batman.  In some places you'll be able to swoop down and leave your enemies hanging from gargoyles... or perform a glide kick or use some of Batman's gadgets to get the job done.  For such simple gameplay concepts, there are actually quite a few ways to implement them into the game.  The game also lets you upgrade and improve on your techniques as you progress.  So there actually happens to be quite a bit of variety.At the same time, though, the game is accessible to just about everyone.  You can also enter what's called \"Detective Mode\" if you so choose.  Within this mode, Batman can see certain things he otherwise couldn't.  You can tell where your enemies are easier and find some hidden goodies.  You'll no doubt be playing a large portion of the game in this mode, but it's very worth it to do so.  Choosing not to means missing out on some of Arkham Asylum's secrets, and there are a lot of secrets.  The most prominent of which is that you can find riddles scattered all over that will unlock lots of different things for you to do.  You'll also be able to unlock small character bios and audio samples about certain characters.  These are other things that really make the game come alive in its own way.  And in the midst of all this, the game doesn't appear too challenging or intimidating.That's not to say you won't be challenged.  You will.  Particularly when you reach something new.  It's nice to know, however, that the game isn't overly difficult.  It's just to say that when trumping through it at least doesn't feel easy.  When helping you get acquainted to things, Arkham Asylum is pretty easy going.  But once the game takes away the training wheels you may find yourself hitting a few snags every now and then.The visual look of the game isn't all that adds to the game's atmosphere.  So does the music and so do some of the animations when you're fighting.  Sometimes it's fun to battle just to look at some of the animations as they take place.  Other times exploring can be absorbing because the music really knows how to set the tone.  Arkham Asylum has a lot of strength, but the game seems well aware of just what those strengths are.There's really not much that keeps Arkham Asylum down.  In many ways it's exciting to play a Batman game that's good.  After getting several Batman games that felt like a throwaway of the license, Batman Arkham Asylum feels like a breath of fresh air.  Most of its gameplay conventions have been done before, but it's mostly how the game mixes them together that works well, and the absorbing atmosphere it emits in the process.  Batman fans might find themselves pleased by this one.  It's a simple game to play, but there is definitely a lot in it that could keep you busy for some time, and a lot to explore.  It's great to see a Batman game come to fruition, and to do it so smoothly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}

They enjoyed a good portion of the songs which are included, although they had never heard a few of them before.Overall, the game provides a good break with some silly fun and great exercise for the whole family. I don't think it's quite as involving as the regular Just Dance titles without the \"Kids\" label, but that's what makes it easier and perhaps funner for the younger ones to play.

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

Having played \"Jak & Daxter\" end to end and made my way mostly through \"Jak II\" (which disappoints), I'm glad to say that \"Daxter\" seems to have taken the best elements of Jak II and put them in a smaller title that's more fun to play.\"Daxter\" is set in a time gap that takes place at the beginning of Jak II:  Jak has been captured, and Daxter has to make his way around the city that they're both trapped in.  As the name implies, you play the furry \"Ossel\" sidekick Daxter throughout the game, and you're all on your own.  In order to make his way around the city, Daxter gets a job with an exterminator.  From there it starts to resemble Jak II:  it's the city, but there are more unpassable barriers and no bystanders or crowds.  Gone is the car-stealing, gone are the paranoid guards that swarm over you in Jak II, and in their place are some fun (and funny) encounters.  Adding to the experience are colorful environments with very few boundaries and a professionally done game score that occasionally ventures into charming Danny Elfman territory.What makes the gameplay enjoyable and clever are the different environments you have to explore.  Each has the same goal of \"get through to the other side\", but along the way you'll find different puzzles to solve.  At one point you're sneaking through a series of tunnels, at another you're moving through a massive fish \"factory\", melting ice blocks in clever ways to unlock goodies.And speaking of goodies...as you discover Precursor Orbs, you unlock a hilarious series of movie-themed minigames.  Spoofs of The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings, Indiana Jones and more involve pushing buttons in sequence and rhythm.  The minigames in turn unlock more goodies in the main game:  Daxter might learn a special move, or improve his speed or health.  I also found the ability to sync with a PS2 or PS3 running \"Jak X: Combat Racing\" and unlock hidden characters.The main game contains various hidden secrets, too:  for example, I crawled behind a crate and found an item which unlocked the ability for Daxter to wear a ridiculous Sly Cooper mask.  And in case that's not enough to break the monotony, various side stories have you running races, chasing giant bugs (and lobbing little bombs at them), or crop-dusting massive flowers on a rocket-scooter.If you like platformers, you can't go wrong with Daxter on the PSP.  If you're a fan of the series, don't be disappointed that it's been trimmed a little for the small screen:  just take it as a fun aside that you can take with you on the go.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2009"}

Rhodes","summary":"As If the Original Devil May Cry 3 Wasn't Good Enough!","reviewText":"Devil May Cry 3 was one of the best games of 2005.  The only thing that kept some people away was the extreme difficulty of the game.  Still, if you didn't wimp out, the game was fantastic.  Now there's a special edition out, and it's one of the greatest gifts CAPCOM has ever given the Devil May Cry fans.Since this review assumes you're all familiar with the universe of Devil May Cry 3, I suppose the only thing I really want to do here is tell you about what's new.  Why should you buy this versin of Devil May Cry 3 over the original?First things first, this game is easier than the original Devil May Cry 3.  This is obvious by the new continue system that's been introduced.  Before you had to get yellow orbs that were particularly expensive, and so they came on a limited basis.  And then you'd run out of yellow orbs and have to play through a brutal level all over again.  The new continue system pretty much ignores the yellow orbs and lets you continue from check points regardless of how many yellow orbs you have.  If you have a gold orb, though, you can start right from where you died.  If you did like the original yellow orb system you can still do that, but the average gamer will find the unlimited continues welcome.The difficulty of the game, as noted above, is easier.  If you didn't know, the original Devil May Cry 3 given to American gamers was much harder on the \"normal\" difficulty setting than in Japan.  This is because \"Normal\" mode for America was actually the japanese \"Hard\" mode.  It's fixed here, and it's fairly noticeable.  There's also an easy mode to unlock (if you die a few times) and a \"Very Hard\" mode.  Don't be fooled by \"Very Hard\" mode, though.  It's virtually playing the original Devil May Cry 3.  With those unlimited continues, however, I'm sure you'll note the game is still easier on these harder difficulty levels.The best new feature is the ability to play as Vergil, Dante's evil brother.  In the original Devil May Cry 3 you'll note he was lightning fast, and had a few devastating attacks.  They're now all at your disposal!You have to unlock Vergil, however.  Either by completing the game as Dante once, or having a save file from the original Devil May Cry 3 on your memory card.Playing through the story as Vergil is fun, but not nearly as exciting as Dante's.  For one, all the cutscenes aren't included.  Vergil gets his own introduction which makes you think he'll actually have a story.  He doesn't.  He just plays through Dante's levels (which was to be expected) but with no real purpose for doing it.  At times it feels like it was a thrown in extra (a throwback to the unlockable character Sparda in the first Devil May Cry). So there's no continuity to his story.  And it's really strange to be fighting Vergil while playing as Vergil.  Why not fight Dante?  It's fun to play as Vergil, but it would've been really cool if they'd given him his own story.  We know CAPCOM can give each character their own scenarios (seen in Mega Man X4 and done especially well in Resident Evil 2).There's a hidden boss... a jester, who is, compared to the other bosses, way too easy.  Dante or Vergil can fight him, but you'll scratch your head wondering where the difficulty went against this thing.The combat system of Devil May Cry 3 was gold.  The fans knew it, and obviously CAPCOM knows it too, because there's a \"Bloody Palace\" unlockable which is just a fancy way of saying \"Survival Mode.\"  It's you pitted up against various foes.  There are 9999 levels in this place, and you can choose to advance by either ten floors or one-hundred floors.  It's time consuming and fun, although only hardcore fans will make it through the whole thing.  You might run into one of the challenging bosses as well.  As with Vergil Mode, you have to either complete the game first, or have save data from the original version.There are some more extras.  A turbo mode which allows you to speed up the gameplay (imagine juggling now?), a theater mode which allows you to view all the cutscenes in the game, there's an art gallery and there are costumes you can unlock for both characters.Really, this is worth while.  Some extras feel a little tacked on at times, but for the most part this isn't like getting some crappy \"director's cut\".  It's like getting your favorite movie in a special edition DVD.  It's packed full of extras!The Good+The graphics are still good+The music is also still good+The difficulty level has been fixed+You can play as Vergil+Survival Mode for those who love the combat system+The combat system is just fantastic+Art galleries, theater modes and other extras+Turbo Mode is just fun to watch!+New BossThe Bad-New Boss isn't all that exciting-For hardcore Devil May Cry 3 gamers, the difficulty may feel like it's reduced too much-It would've been really cool if Vergil had his own scenario","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2006"}

Alan Wake has been simmering on the back burner for awhile and I tried to avoid any coverage so as not to lessen the power of the story which for once I was hoping would surpass and stretch the medium of VG.  Remedy has done just that releasing what is my favorite system exclusive for the 360.  Everything that makes me keep firing up the console is here, a story that dares you to not follow it through to its wonderfully mysterious non conclusion, mostly addictive controls and gameplay that makes the whole 3rd person flashlight thing work for once.  Moving Alan is not a chore but it can feel that way when you get a CHEAP kill from behind, and hey where are the custom soundtracks listed on the back?  I would love to add some music to AW and was excited for this non-feature for once.  However, the wind blows through the trees more hauntingly than I would have thought possible and the game oozes atmosphere and manages some humor amongst all of its dark pop-culture/literary points of reference.  The soundtrack and audio f/x are top tier and the magic happens when you crank the sound in a dark room.  The graphics could be better as this game starts to look prettier as it nears it conclusion and in its stellar first DLC episode The Signal.  Fans of gaming and dark noir fiction are doing themselves a disservice if they fail to take a run, as these woods are lovely, dark, and DEEP.  Exactly the kind of title I want to support with my gaming $.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2010"}

ALL OF THE DLC IS ON THE DISC AND AWAKENINGS TOO!this is perfect! Unlike Borderlands, no Voucher Code here!you actually get it all on one disc. so if you haven't bought thisgame yet then this is the time!Like I said, you get all the DLC on this disc that means you getThe Stone Prisoner, Warden's Keep, Return to Ostagar, Feast day Gifts, The Darkspawn Chronicles, Feast day Pranks, Leliana's Song, The Golems of Amgarrak, and Witch Hunt Plus Awakenings all on One Disc!!! a Steal!quite simply put, one of the best RPG's ever you simply Must Ownthis if you have not already bought the collectors editionor the standard. for one it's nice NOT having to change discs during gameplay. and it's really nice to actually Own my DLC now.for further information I provided my review below.My Original Review of DA:O:I cannot praise this game enough! it will be one of those I play again and again!the size and scope of the game is incredible. when I started off I'd wager I spent two hours learning about my character's background.you pick one of many origins (i.e. elf, dwarf, human, etc)(I chose Elf Mage)and then begin with your origin story (which is like watching a full length movie and so well written the time just flys by)and then you're tasked with your first quest and the game begins.this game has more freedom of choice then most, such as make a deal with a demon, or kill it to save a child. (it offers you Powers Not to kill it)some of the quests have moral choices that will really pull on your emotions about people and things like power over friendship and the feel you have an impact upon the surrounding world.everything you choose to do has a \"ripple effect\" so your action will be known throughout the world. the characters control via one of two ways,one is using the hack & slash method though this is harder then hitting pause so you can set all your mages attacks etc.there's a lot of micromanagement in this but for loot mongers and rpg lovers this will be one of the years ultimate treats I assure you. there seems to be loot everywhere for those that search every area rather thourough. I also must say the amount of DLC available at this time for the collectors edition is amazing. (non collector edition owners will pay 6.99 and 14.99 for both dlc packs)the graphics are excellent (though not mind blowing)particle effects are wickedly done and the quests are crafted well enough to let you know you have many approaches to each \"situation\"and will pull at your emotions. if you weren't lucky enough to get this collectors edition no worries I know the goodies will be released as DLC to everyone eventually since they listed prices (wardens keep 6.99 and the stone prisoner 14.99)you have many abilities such as settinhg traps, stealing, dual wielding and so much more. while the game may be a bit \"baldurs gat-ish) it's the BEST RPG on ps3 without a doubt.the skill trees are similar to those you've seen in baldurs gate, diablo II and others. another thing is they must have over 200+ voice actors since I have not heard ANY voices repeat.excellent actors such as Tim Curry, Kate Mulgrew, Claudia Black and more!an excellent creature variety, large skill trees,great loot and D&D; style gameplay make this titleone of my all time fav's.Graphics: Excellent and crispy. not mind blowing but perfect for me 4 1/2 stars great spell effects! excellent creature models and good variety of them.Sound: the voice work is Top Notch and hundreds of actorseven the crickets put on a great perfomance! 5 stars!the sound is a star here, the voice talent is top notch.Gameplay: the micromanagement might put a few off but most will never let go of the controller since they got the controls so spot on for the ps3 on this title. it's amazing! 5 stars.the controls are well mapped to the ps3 controller.Fun: Yes Yes Yes! betray a friend or help him in a \"forbidden\" quest, help a grey warden or not?, kill a demon or trust the mouse? so many choices it's unreal! want to slay a dragon? you can!want to go into dungeons and hack away, you can!it's a Mature game so some of the things you can do are a tad graphic and as someone reminded me you end every battle absolutely painted in blood.the game is brilliant what more can I say? 5 Stars!!Overall: the package wraps up nicely into a 5 star Must Have!the Gods at Bioware have greated the best \"baldurs gate\" style game yet! it's brilliant! you have to buy it asap if you don't you're missing THE BEST RPG experience of the year and possibly in my lifetime.

Imagine that you had control of an entire movie studio, competing with others to create a string of box office smashes. Imagine being able to use your judgement alone, deciding whether success lies with epic action pictures or lots of low budget, hammy 'B' movies.Will the stars you've so lovingly groomed develop monstrous egos - refusing to accept that they are now too old to play the romantic leads that made them famous? You can help, but there are only so many times you can send them to fat farms and plastic surgeons.Will you watch your movies being shot or do you want to direct the action yourself? Will you decide to innovate and introduce the talkies, color or digital sound before any of your rivals? Or will you let the other studios make the investments, leaving you to jump on the bandwagon if the new technology becomes popular?Many of the things you've ever read or heard about Hollywood are right here inThe Movies- from stars having affairs and hitting the bottle to teams of genius filmmakers creating the box office hit of the year. Movie mogul, talent spotter or film director. You can be one or you can be all three. That's the magic ofThe Movies.","reviewerName":"Matthieu P. Raillard","summary":"An A+ idea with a B+ delivery...","reviewText":"The movies is one of those games, much like \"Fable\" and \"Black and White\", that garnered so much attention before their release that the hype easily outdwarfed the result.  The premise to The Movies is terrific fun, and on many fronts, the game delivers.  The downside is that it's not as innovative as promised, is full of glitches and suffers from a poor interface.The GOOD: Great sim-type game, crossed with a \"tycoon\"-type game.  The game really hooks you in, at least for a while, with its premise: to make movies, and ultimately, a lot of money.  Some people will dig the movie-maker utility, I personally prefered the sim aspect of the game.  Bottom line, this game, in spite of its flaws (below) is fun.  There is plenty of humor, a good soundtrack, and the sets/studio are well-rendered.The BAD: This game quickly devolves into an orgy of micro-management.  Instead of making you focus on the task of making movies, you end up wasting 90% of your time keeping your stars happy.  These people stress out over anything, get drunk any chance they get, and are generally very unhappy, requiring you to constantly tend to their whims.  Also, the addition of toilets, food stands, etc add nothing to the game, and add a layer of tedium instead.  The various buildings you can unlock and build are cool at first, but it becomes tedious after a while to \"unlock\" a PR office when it should really have been there since the start.  Also, movies take WAYYYY too long to film: later films can take years and years to film, even when everything goes well.  Do you want to hire a new actor?  Tough, because you have to wait until the game throws an aspiring actor your way to be able to add someone new.  It's ludicrous that a wealthy studio-head can't hire actors/janitors/directors etc whenever they want if they have the cash.  Finally, this game suffers from horrible, terrible, borderline infuriating lag as the studio grows in size.  I have a top-tier machine and it stutters more than any other game I've played (even F.E.A.R!).The UGLY: The character models / graphics.  The actors and actresses, even those you can draw yourself, are just plain ugly and freaky-looking.  The Sims 2 had much better character models, so why not The Movies?Bottom Line: Fun game, but I hope they make a sequel which addresses this version's shortcomings.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2006"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

It's definitely worth the small cost. I like that Infamous open world so you have a bit of freedom as to what quests you want to finish first, skills you want to level up, and choices over your actions...good or evil. It's not difficult at all once you get the hang of the controls. It can be a challenge to stay good since killing civilians accidentally in a mob of enemies makes you closer to bad. The game also suggested to me early on a \"humane\" way of killing enemies...bio-leech...so I kept doing that until suddenly I went down from Champion to Guardian status. Oops. My only annoyance is that Cole jumps so short compared to the game I played last...Assassin's Creed II. Ezio flies from building to building with ease while Cole plummets straight to the ground, yet he's supposed to be some electrified superhuman...what?

Goes to show you... people are a buncha philistines.When I fired this game up, I didn't know what to expect. I was hoping for something a little less linear than the disappointing BioShock, and something a little more immersive than the 'sport'-like Halo series of shooters.What I ended up discovering was that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is one of the most innovative and immersive games I've played in the last decade. The other reviews on here do a great job of describing the game, so I'll keep my review short and sweet:S.T.A.L.K.E.R. satisfied the desire for fast-paced FPS action, nail-biting survival game tension, and a richly detailed world and varied options for playstyle in RPGs. Graphics are great, even for 2010, and unlike some modern games it will run well on most modern computers (I'm running a core 2 quad 2.66GHz, 8GB RAM, and a GeForce 9800GT and can't complain about the load times or smooth frame rate).My only wish is that the combat in this game would be a little more graphic... I dunno why, it'd just be a little cooler if there was more blood and gore. Just my silly preference as a gamer. Everything else is spot-on... music is sparse but tasteful and ATMOSPHERIC as h*ll, gameplay is fluid and satisfying, environments are vivid, well conceived and well executed, and the storyling is top-notch.Not for kids, not for people looking for a 'Hollywood' style game (cookie cutter, Michael Bay-style)... surviving the twisted Alienation Zone of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s alternate reality Chernobyl takes thought, finesse, and attention. You're never completely safe -- always dealing with wounds, hunger, radiation, hazardous 'anomalies', marauding bandits, hostile military, bloodthirsty mutants, even deteriorating armor and weapons. This is a game to keep you on the edge of your seat long into the night, knowing you should've gone to bed hours earlier but unable to do so out of eagerness to see what's next.I really enjoyed this game and can't praise it enough. Hats off to THQ for supporting a truly innovative and immersive game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. In my opinion... it's a must-buy for anyone interested in a good non-linear FPS or survival oriented RPG.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2010"}

This isn't the best PS3 game out (that goes to Uncharted in my book) but this is my number 2 PS3 game.There are five games included in this package, and each one is mind blowingly good.  Portal is the most unique game experience I've had in a long time, and Portal alone is something every gamer should experience.Then there's the Half-Life 2 series, which includes three variations of that game basically, and countless hours of content.  The atmosphere and story is excellent, and again unique.  The nice thing about these games is that the story is all told by the things other people say to you, and the things that happen in the environment.  This is true of Portal as well.  The fact that your character doesn't talk makes it feel more like it's you in the game, and it allows you to have your own thoughts/reactions to what's being said and done, without anyone telling you what your character feels.  It's wonderful.There are some frame drops and the occasional hitching, but this honestly didn't bother me very much at all.  It happens rarely, and honestly games in previous generations suffered much worse and didn't stop anyone from buying them, and nor should it stop anyone here.  For the most part the game is smooth, with gorgeous graphics, anti aliasing.  Most home computers would probably run this game at less detail offered here, and STILL have far worse technical problems.  I had my second best gaming experience of the year with this game (Uncharted being number 1) so clearly I think it's a superb addition to any PS3 library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2007"}

I heard some guy even say that the game was so intense and scary that there was a feeling of depression afterwards.  Another guy said that even as he wrote his review he was looking over his shoulder.  I don't know what game those guys played or what their on, but be assured that's taking it a bit too far.This game like most other Survival horror's outside of Resident Evil and Silent Hill attempt to make a formula that would combine the best of both of those great franchises.  This game doesn't quite have as many jump scares as Resident Evil, instead it also has some kind of meter that brightens up in orange to warn you that there is a ghost nearby and the closer the ghost gets the brighter the orange light.  No surprise this is almost a direct [copy] of Silent Hill.Overall, the game isn't quite as scary as most Resident Evil's as few of the jump scares come as sudden and as sharp as they do in Resident Evil.  The game also falls short in my opinion of being as disturbing as Silent Hill, the characters are surprisingly cartoonish looking for a survival horror.  The game has no blood and sometimes when your fighting ghosts the background music will break into funky Japanese pop or something.  Ghosts will also say cheesy lines like, \"My eyes, my eyes, there's no one here\".  To some all that might actually be pretty disturbing, who knows.Overall this is still a refreshing and scary game and it's probably my favorite survival horror only behind Silent Hill.  Resident Evil is great, the formula still creates your basic scare but the plotline and characters need a reality check.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2003"}

Most of the time it is, in the shape of enemies who have little knowledge of tactics but do have the numerical advantage.Graphics are all right - a study in black, white and grey sometimes, but a touch more realism might have been nice to draw you more into the story. The rag doll physics are a bit creepy, as bodies fall in extremely unnatural positions and then tumble around inappropriately.There are fighting sections, stealth sections, puzzle sections, a collection of enemy types, new weapons to find, new upgrades for your spinny death-blade.Really, though, the main issue here is that the game begins to feel tedious after a while. The enemies are just a little too much of the same mindset so once you figure them out, you have figured them all out. The bosses are like puzzles, but poorly designed puzzles that give you little feedback.There are ten chapters which is relatively short for a game - and with their save system it seems that you always have to start a load game from the beginning of a chapter. That can get to be a royal pain if you are almost done with a level and need to turn off the system for some reason.How about the storyline? You begin as a reluctant soldier, almost trying to retreat from the assigned mission - but it's too late to go back. As you're in doing your deed, you get infected with a disease. This leads to your connection with the spinning blade of multiple powers.In general, while we've had this game for several months now, we rarely put it in. There are always other games we'd rather play. I would definitely suggest you rent this first, play it for a weekend, see how it appeals to you. Who knows, you might finish the game over the weekend and be all set.

{"product_name":"B006WQR3OM","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"A solid update of a classic game and a great title in its own right.","reviewText":"XCOM: Enemy Unkown is a remake and update of the classic 1994 strategy game, UFO: Enemy Unknown, which in turn was heavily inspired by the 1970 Gerry Anderson TV series UFO. It's a turn-based strategy game in which you command the defence of Earth against an encroaching alien menace. The original game is still held as one of the best strategy games of all time and remaking it is a brave move, but one that Firaxis seem to have pulled off well.As with the original, the game is divided into two modes. Between missions you hang out at your base, which is initially small but can be expanded to incorporate new facilities. At your base you can research new technologies, recruit soldiers and build equipment for them. You can also upgrade your interceptor aircraft and build and launch new satellites to increase your chances of intercepting the UFOs. Increasing your satellite coverage is also important to mollify your financial backers: if a country suffers too much damage in an alien attack or does not feel that XCOM is protecting it, it will withdraw from the XCOM project, delivering a serious blow to your finances. Once you don't have anything more to do, you can hit a button to speed up time, with the game pausing again to let you know about important news (such as research being completed or the completion of a facility's construction) or with news of a fresh alien incursion. Sometimes you have to scramble interceptors to shoot down a UFO, but at other times UFOs will land of their own accord. In either case, once an alien hotspot has been detected, you can send a Skyranger dropship packed with troopers to investigate.At this point the game moves onto a 3D map depicting the area of operations (sometimes a town packed with civilians, or an empty stretch of countryside, or an alien base).You move your troops around this area in turns. On each turn you can move your troopers, have them fire at any aliens in range or switch to an 'overwatch' mode, which basically stores up their move until the aliens' turn, when they can automatically fire on any aliens who venture into their line of sight. You have to be careful as the aliens often do the same thing, and moving might trigger an alien attack of opportunity on their turn. Combat is undertaken by your troops aiming at the enemy with a percentage chance being shown of how likely the attack will be. Cover is vitally important, with both full and half-cover available to protect combatants, so flanking is critically important, as is the use of heavy weapons that can destroy cover. As the game proceeds your squad size increases and you gain access to devastating new weapons, including plasma weapons, as well as psi-powers and robotic drones.The game itself is straightforward, but what prevents the gameplay (research and build stuff, shoot down UFO, fight on 3D map, rinse and repeat) getting repetitive is the importance placed on your decisions. Do you expand satellite coverage early on, but then lack the funds needed to research new weapons? Can you risk neglecting your interceptors' weapons in favour of upgrading your troopers' rifles? This also extends to your individual (and highly customisable) soldiers, who gain experience and new abilities between missions. Gaining new abilities (such as the ability to use three medikits per mission instead of one) comes at the cost of sacrificing others, and careful decisions have to be made. You can be ruthless, upgrading your troopers' weapons whilst ignoring their defences, since recruiting fresh troops to replace the slaughtered is inexpensive. But veterans have powerful abilities, so you may want to pump resources into armour instead. There are numerous approaches you can take to the game, which immensely rewards replayability.Presentation-wise, the game is slick but not lightweight. The UI is straightforward and instinctively easy to understand, whilst the 3D graphics are more functional than impressive, but with an attractive art style and some cool explosions. Sound effects are good, the alien designs (many of them directly upgraded from the 1994 originals) memorable and interesting, and there's even some pretty good characterisation of your various advisors. One mild misstep is a lack of personality and character amongst your soldiers (since you have full control of their development), which makes some events in the endgame not resonate as strongly as they should.The game is tough, even on the easier difficulty levels, and does not tolerate too many mistakes. Many players, particularly those unfamiliar with the original, may find themselves having to play through several dummy runs to get acquainted with the concepts and controls before launching a proper campaign (this is not helped by a story-driven tutorial mode which doesn't actually do a good job of giving you the tech you need urgently in the early game period). Still, it's a refreshing change to find a game these days which will punish you but not overwhelm you with frustration to the point where you stop playing. On the contrary, XCOM is compulsive stuff, with the \"Just one more turn,\" mentality resulting in you staying up until ridiculous hours trying to acquire that plasma rifle or bring down that alien base.On the negative side, the game does lack some of the freedom of the original, such as the ability to exchange equipment in the field and bring a lot more troops to the battlefield, whilst the inability to destroy cover deliberately with normal weapons seems a bit limiting. But these are fairly minor complaints. More serious is a series of crashes I experienced shortly after installation, but these stopped after an hour or so and never reoccurred.XCOM: Enemy Unknown (****) is a smart, intelligent and engrossing game, with compelling gameplay and some fiendish opponents. It's a superb update of a classic game but also a great title in its own right, and a clear front-runner for game of the year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00020BV1A","reviewerName":"M. Scott","summary":"Surprisingly Great","reviewText":"When this game first came out, I did not have an xbox so It passed me by. I did however always thought it looked awesome and wanted to try it out. Boy did I miss out.With the exception of Halo, Republic Commando is the most modern feeling FPS of the last generation. Its hard to describe but many older FPS games have a strange grid based aiming system. It made it difficult to be precise, and felt really cheap. Especially after playing modern FPS games which almost always have good controls. Almost. Republic commando avoids this flaw by using a smart aiming system that locks onto enemies while you attack them. Instead of a punch or rifle smack attack, your melee attack is a metal cutter that pops out of your wrist.Aside from its fluid controls, its graphics are pretty good too, once again considering the time period it came out during as it doesn't hold a candle to modern game. The effects are cool, but to be honest the locals are kind of bland. most of the character models are very cool though. They're aren't pretty by today's standards but they are unique and detailed all the same. This is especially present on the battle droids, who begin to fall apart after they take enough damage. Chipping off the face of a super battle droid with your metal cutter is very satisfying, and looks really cool. In my humble opinion its the best looking character damage system in any game.The story while there, is nothing to write home about. Its pretty lame actually, and the dialogue for the Commandos is far more interesting then the actual mission they're on. There are however a few interesting things that happen towards the end.Also, as a side note, this game came out before episode III, and they pronounce \"Kashyyyk\" with a short I. Just some trivia.There are only 3 levels in the game, although these levels are broken up into stages with specific objectives. Also, there are only a few kinds of enemies. Geonosisians, Battle Droids, Super Battle Droids, Trandoshans, and sometimes vehicles. Ocasionally you'll fight Destroyer Droids or IG-100s.Yes, its a good game. Yes, if you like star dance contests and FPS games you should by it.

It has it's positives, as well as it's obvious negatives, but overall it's a damn fun game I can't put down.  And I will be doing a 2nd playthough.Graphics - 3.5/5 Nothing special here, just your average looking game.  The environments look bland, the character models are actually pretty damn good looking up close.  But the voices don't always match up with what they are saying.Sound - 5/5 The voice acting is top notch, one of the key features that helps make a great story better in any game.  The background music isn't too spectacular, but it does the job. The sounds of guns, as well as some of the other sound effects are pretty generic, but don't distract from the game.Gameplay - 2/5  This is where most people have a problem with this game.  The AI is terrible, with enemies getting stuck on corners, and all the things that would normally make this a bad game.  The shooting is flawed until you level up, which in theory sounds good, but is poorly excecuted..  There is a bright light at the end of this tunnel however, when you beat the game on recruit you unlock veteran, which grants you a lot more skills right off the bat, thus making the game more enjoyable to a HUGE degree.Story - 5/5  This is where the game shines.  Every choice you make results in a differnt game.  I don't want to spoil anything, but sometimes when you make friends with the right people, they will assist you during a mission.  (resulting in friendly AI, which is also quite stupid, but nice as a distraction).  The story and in-game cutscenes along with the top notch voice acting make it feel very much like an interactive movie at points.Overall - 4/5  I would say if you are an action RPG fan, or a fan of the spy/espionage genre (Tom Clancy novel type stories) I would say this is a must play.  Just be patient, because if you can look past the obvious flaws, this is a really enjoyable game.*Achievement/Trophy note:  How can you not love a game that gives you an achievement/trophy for scoring with all the ladies in one playthrough?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2010"}

I've played quite a few MMO's, and they don't break any new ground here.  They try to make up for it with some pretty high-res background art, but the characters themselves are poorly animated.In terms of gameplay, it's the all-too-familiar system that Lord of the Rings Online, World of Warcraft, Star Trek Online etc., use (for better or worse).  I just don't understand why a company would create such a derivative game and expect people to dump the game they have been playing to play it.I've certainly played worse (Star Trek Online, and Conan are two that come to mind), but I'll be letting my 3-month subscription lapse when it is up.

It was fun looking around and problem solving together. The battles (although sometimes repetitive) were fun and adding new skills and partners was great.The graphics are great and storyline fun. The variety of puzzles is fun and seeing Mario putter around with his little clouds of dust behind him is comforting. There are things to do to increase the play time, solving problems in the trouble center, mini games, cooking and the dreaded Pit of 100 Trials.A solid game that easily stands the test of time even after being out for 8 years.

{"product_name":"Logitech Wireless Gaming Headset G930 with 7.1 Surround Sound","description":"","reviewerName":"Z Io","summary":"The hardware is fine, the software just won't support the product","reviewText":"So, I bought these on a whim, I was looking for a good wireless headset, emphasis on wireless. Bought these as I have plenty of other logitech products that I absolutely love. This headset did not meet the standards that their other devices put forth. I have owned plenty of logitech products, and currently own a C310, G110 and G500.Aside from 7.1 surround in headphones being a complete placebo, this also makes certain VOIP programs have an immense and distracting reverb effect, with and without the surround switch turned on on the headset. It is less noticeable when surround is on, but everyone still sounds like they are talking into a steel plate (look up plate reverb). Disabling all the speakers except for the main left and right speaker eliminates this issue, but causes another issue.Certain games will only play out of the right ear, if the game does not have a 7.1 output, OR because when not set to 7.1, the audio drivers, a la logitech gaming software, do not properly process the sound into 2 channel stereo.To put it plainly, a fix for one thing breaks something else. You can, more or less, only get one thing working well at a time. For gamers, we generally have a headset to use a VOIP program along side a game, and quite possibly along side either music or a movie as well. When I fixed on thing, it caused issues with something else. VLC was only coming out of one ear cup at one point, having set it to stereo mode or surround mode, caused it to either work with issues in my VOIP, or my VOIP was fine but VLC would not output correctly. This was attempted between computer restarts and program restarts, so the driver was not being toggled and bugged. I also had the same issues with guild wars 2, final fantasy 14, star trek online, and a couple other single player games. Guild wars 2 had a weird bug, as the music and combat SFX (weapon hits, shouts and pain hits) would be in stereo, but some voices, menu sfx (button push sounds) and all dialouge for cutscenes was coming out of the right ear only, when the fix for the overly reverberant VOIP was implimented.I want to point out, without this VOIP fix, the VOIP was practically useless as there would just be an ocean of broadband echo whenever someone would talk.I would GLADLY buy these again if logitech fixed the driver and gaming software issue, but as it stands, these are unuseable for gaming.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2014"}

Each game added more ridiculous gameplay and a completely humorous story. Despite that, Saints Row does a very good job at entertaining us with interesting ideas. Saints Row IV is the zaniest of them all with super powers, alien invasions, and computer simulations. The Saints are now in control of the United States thanks to the main hero being the President. Various Saints characters fill other roles like Kinsie being Press Secretary and Keith David being Vice President. An alien ruler named Zenyak bursts in and starts destroying the White House and the planet. You get captured and are thrown into a computer simulation of Steelport and need to escape. You start by rescuing your friends and devising a plan to stop Zenyak.The main story brings you through some interesting gameplay choices like previous games. A tron like level, a 2D brawler, mounted gun and RPG on-rails missions, and various others. It's a lot of fun but really short. The game is full of too much filler which is repetitive side quests after you rescue each homie. Instead of going around and doing the side missions on your own they are dealt out in quests so you actually end up doing them all. Each character needs you to do three sets of these monotonous side quests, after about the 15th time I couldn't take it anymore. Thankfully the unique Loyalty quests are interesting. At least you get cool unlocks for doing these like suits, weapons, powers, and vehicles. Besides main and side quests there's nothing else to do besides multiplayer.The entire game is completely changed thanks to these super powers. To make it believable you are in a computer simulation, and the times when you are out, you don't have them. You can run at lightning fast speeds, jump 30 stories, use telekinesis, earthquake stomp, freeze blast, and various other super powers. They are awesome and surprisingly work well in the game. You feel so powerful and the need for driving around in cars becomes pointless because you can run 10x faster than driving. To unlock more powers you need to collect special power-ups which are scattered everywhere, but the same upgrades via money are the same. Honestly, not much has changed from The Third besides the powers and the story. The guns are nearly the same except the alien weapons are exact copies of regular weapons -- the only difference is that they overheat. There are a few interesting weapons like the Dubstep gun which shoots deadly Wub Wubs at enemies. The Alien RPG is awesome and there's a tentacle bat. Not much else in the weapons department though. There's a few new alien vehicles, but nothing so new and amazing that you will forget the similarities from the last game.The lack of changes even goes into customization and the graphics. The game uses the exact same engine of The Third and there are hardly any new clothes or items to customize your characters with. This really feels like Saints Row 3.5 rather than 4. The game looks fairly dated with some ugly textures and jerky animations seen in previous games. At least there are all new mini games which kind of helps a bit. There are various mini games ranging from on foot races, giant tower climbing stretches, various other races, and a few games that revolve around your powers. After a few tries at each you will be pretty bored with them like previous games. The fact that all the side quests push you through these makes it a bore fest after so long.There's just an overall lack of uniquity and originality in Saints Row IV. It tries to use the same tricks as the past three games and you soon realize they don't work anymore. The dialog isn't as catchy or funny, the missions (even the main ones) can get really repetitive in between the occasional unique and exciting mission. There are many bugs and glitches in the game as well as severe difficulty spikes which can be very frustrating. There's a lack of enemy variety and the whole game at the end just feels very repetitive and redundant. Honestly, Saints Row needs another reboot or the series may fall by the wayside.That's not to say the game isn't worth playing. After some side quests you will blow through the main missions and probably be done with the game. This one is more of a rental than a purchase. New comers may find a bit more replay value, but Saints veterans will put 20-30 hours in the game and call it quits. I love the super powers and the whole alien invasion thing, but the lack of originality and new ideas kind of makes the series take a couple of steps back. Even the lack of new content hurts it more, this really just feels like a giant expansion of The Third rather than a true sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"pennywyze","summary":"Way better than Arkham Asylum!","reviewText":"When I first played Arkham Asylum and beat the game whilst collecting all the Riddler trophies and thoroughly enjoying the story mode and challenges, I felt like I actually wanted more Batman than what was offered. In any case, Arkham Asylum was an excellent game which should be owned by any Batman fan. (Alongside Batman Begins for the PS2/Xbox) But what's even better is Batman Arkham City. Here's my review.Graphics-The graphics look a little better than Arkham Asylum; but not by much. If anything, AC looks darker and grittier than AA and also, the color seems to have much richer detail; especially if you're using an HDMI cable. But perhaps the biggest difference between Arkham City and Arkham Asylum would be the fact that Arkham City is an open world game in which you get to openly explore Arkham and it's a pretty big city.The game is not just limited to Arkham however, for example, you'll get a chance to go to Ras a Ghul's demon realm which is a big wasteland full of sand and rocky cliffs with erupting lava and it looks fantastic. It easily looks better than the Scarecrow's nightmare realm in the last game. The game's menu interface looks really cool as well and you can tell the production value was high on this game. To make things even better is the frame rate is silky smooth with no graphical hiccups that I can speak of that are game breaking.With that said, the one complaint I have about this game would be the fact that most of the bad guys are simply clones and not varied enough. Fortunately, this is only applied to the minor bad guys while the main bad guys like Clayface, Joker, Ras a Ghul or Riddler are nice to look at. A minor gripe of mine would be just how dark this game is. I mean, it's really dark and if you lighten it too much that brightness will oversaturate the graphics with too much brightness. This causes most of the game to be done in detective mode instead of enjoying the actual scenery. Other than that, it looks fantastic.Sound-The voice acting in this game is really good, especially when you encounter the Joker or Harley. I found Bane to be the only villain that wasn't particularly voiced well. I really loved the soundtrack to this game. There are certain battles that feature the main theme and it feels extremely badass. I only wish some of the sound effects weren't limited to thuds and muffled smacks. But even the sound effects were really good.Gameplay-Here's the meat of the game. The gameplay in Arkham City is good. Not just good; but excellent. First off, the fighting system is nearly the same as AA only the system's been polished quite a bit. You get more moves, more gadgets and new ways of taking out enemies and most importantly, there are a ton of bad guys. In Arkham Asylum, one of my biggest complaints was the fact that there wasn't enough enemies or bosses. Now in Arkham City, that complaint is a thing of the past. Not only are there more enemies, but the enemies are harder, smarter and take a lot more damage. Taking down a group of bad guys is not easy and if you intend on button mashing, then prepare to lose a lot. Even on normal this game will be quite challenging.The hardest battles are when you find yourself surrounded by thugs and a few thugs have guns or perhaps there's an area full of Snipers.The one thing Arkham City does manage to do well is challenge you to use wit and devise a plan in battle.The story mode is much better. It includes lots of side missions that feel natural and somewhat of an extension to the story mode. For example, no matter what you do in AC, the writing and execution of the side missions are still relative to the main story which really adds a ton of replay value to this game unlike Arkham Asylum which featured only the Riddler trophies and minor side quests.In addition to playing as Batman you can also play as Catwoman. Speaking of Catwoman, there are a lot of Cameo appearances that turn into actual encounters  by villains like Bane, Two Face, Riddler, The Identity Theft, Croc and others.This game takes a long time to complete and there are plenty of cool unlockables.Overall, Arkham City took everything &#34;bad&#34; (if you can call it that) about AA and polished it whilst giving you an entire new experience. You can literally traverse the entire city of Arkham and take on any mission at any time while enjoying the game for what it is- An instant classic.The only bummer about this game would be that the ending was somewhat of a cliffhanger, but there's supposed to be a third Batman game that will make news this year or perhaps next year. (I think it will be 2013 though)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2013"}

Don't misunderstand, there is tons of FPS action, but the quests are often long, sometimes complex, and the compass system doesn't seem to work as well as the original Fallout, which would be okay if the people you talk to would remind you of where you're going, AND if the things they told you were in your notes, but often they aren't.For example, I still have not completed the sex-bot quest or the the King-gang's quest because I don't know where the Freeside Train station is, nor do know where to find a sex-bot.There are some really interesting parts, such as diving and I really like how you get to bring mutants along with you, though I would have liked it better if she had her own supply of Stealth-boys and used them when I went into sneak mode.  What's the point of having a half-crazed ninja-mutant, if she doesn't use her mutant-ninja skills?  Oh and one thing that is super annoying is how disobedient your companions are.  You tell them to sneak, they attack, you tell them to wait, they attack, you give them a weapon to use, they 'prefer' to use a different one.  It's cool that they don't die in this one though.  I HATED constantly having to reload because my companions are too stupid to stay alive.  In Fallout 3 I once just killed all my companions and finished the game without them because they would run into a wall while a super mutant bashed their head in.  Too stupid to live I guess.The sheer number of mini-quests are more like running errands than they are actual quests.  For example, if I want access to the Brotherhood of Steel shop I have to find a missing Laser Pistol that someone apparently checked out and didn't bring back???  REALLY???  HERE, here's a BRAND NEW LASER PISTOL!!!  Nope, you have to find the missing one; AND in order to complete a Brotherhood quest, I have to run around their dark maze-like fortress and talk to different members of the group trying to convince them that their current leader is either bad or good, depending.My BIGGEST complaint, is that I cannot do what I want.  There are Casinos and Gangs everywhere and my character is strong enough to kill everyone in New Vegas including Mr House, but can I take-over a gang or two?  Nope.  Why not???  From the very beginning I thought when I killed \"Benny\" I would assume control of his gang.  That makes sense, why bother with him at all, except that he almost MAKES you kill him. It is hinted that you can join the NCR, maybe become a Ranger, join the Legion, or even the Khans, but I have found no way of actually doing this.  In Fallout 1-3, you were an exile, but you felt like you BELONGED to Megaton, in New Vegas, you're just an employee of Mr. House and everyone else who assigns you a seemingly random \"quests\" (errands).Oh a new comer!  Here's your chore list:1. Stop by dino-hut for rocket fuel2. Pickup conductors from (that one place, you remember, with all the robots)3. Bugs in Basement (Make sure to turn on the lights)4.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents.

Sme\"","summary":"One of the best games of 2010","reviewText":"Mass Effect 2 is a role playing game (RPG) which puts the player into a complex and multi-faceted universe that could easily (and probably will at some point) make a good movie or two.As with all RPG's you choose which missions to take; some advance the story while others fill in side missions and quests.  You also choose your character's appearance, gender, and the persona in how you play the game.  Rather than a true good/bad choice you instead have the Yin/Yang of Paragon or Renegade.  Much more than the first game the shortcomings and advantages of both come through.  While being a Paragon will get people to like and respect you, there's times the brittle morality gets in the way of doing things.  Conversely the Renegade cuts through slack and red tape but often makes choices that are regrettable later.The graphics quality is superb and the different planets and places you go to all have a unique feel to them.  Action has been improved mainly by simplifying it.  Your characters heal and rebuild shields faster than the first game and have the capability right away rather than developing it.  Weapons are \"reloaded\" by changing out the heat dissipators, and rather than forever deciding whether to use this type of rifle or another type because one has a 5 point advantage in this but a 10 point deficit in something else, you instead decide by what class of weapon to use, and there are many.If the first game was \"Star Wars,\" with a heroic plot and storyline, then this is the \"Empire Strikes Back.\"  It's pared down, much darker and more cynical.  Your team is over twice as big as before and the first part of the story is mostly finding and building them.  I liked this better than the first game as you know what you're supposed to be doing rather than trying to figure out if this mission or that is something you want to do.I also found it more interesting in that your mission is funded by a mysterious organization with questionable motives as instead of being the hero trying to change the mind of a misguided Council.  The vehicle missions are missing from this game, I didn't care as they were tedious and all looked alike; same landscape, different color.  Scanning planets for resources can be tedious, but adds in more of a challenge as the harder you try the more you can get for upgrades, which is better than just clicking a \"survey\" button.Supposedly you can import your game saves from the first game and see how the decisions and choices you made affected the Mass Effect universe, I haven't tried that yet but probably will when it gets time to do a replay.Overall my only real criticism is the final Boss monster is one of the silliest looking things I've ever seen, which was the same problem with the first Mass Effect.  Ignore that minor fault and this is an excellent game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2010"}

True Crime doesn't break any new barriers with its gameplay, but it does offer some unique options.  The best part of the game, in my opinion, are the optional street crimes that can be solved while rebel cop Nick Kang is cruising around the streets of LA.  These crimes offer the most options involved in the game's often muddled and routine missions.  Nick Kang himself doesn't offer the true badass image the game wants him to have, which hurts this type of game.  The story itself is the weakest part of the game.  It's so confusing that by the fourth mission, I really had no idea what was going on, nor did I care.  The ability to skip certain missions and have it affect the ending of the game is a great concept, but it's unfortunate it's wasted in this mess.

Each animal has a unique mode of operating, which means that the two interconnected narratives behind this game each offer their own distinctive challenges to conquer.As the armored, action-oriented scorpion, you'll string together stinging blows into deadly combo moves that culminate in cinematic finishes and decimate your opponents. Playing as the sneaky tarantula requires a little more finesse--you'll find yourself leaping from above onto your nemesis, throw out neatly aimed shots of webbing to paralyze your prey, and finishing creatures off with your devastating fangs.Wild Enemies and a Sinister Back StoryIt takes skill and composure to master the moves the scorpion and tarantula have at their disposal. And, even after you think you've got every move down, you'll find you need to learn methods, since these life-and-death struggles take place between you and a huge array of vicious, hazardous creatures, including wolf spiders, rattlesnakes, Gila Monsters, Tarantula Wasps, black widows, mantises, enemies of your own species, rats, and even humans.Beyond the immediacy of fighting for survival, this game features a story of greed and betrayal in the human world. Slowly unveiled from the disparate perspectives of the two headline creatures, this evolving storyline helps keep even advanced players engaged and guessing at the implications of their own actions.Explore Brutal, Unforgiving EnvironmentsWhichever creature you're playing as, you'll have 360-degree access to a wide range of 3D environments based in the harsh Sonoran Desert. You'll explore a gloomy maze of thorny brambles, forgotten underground tunnels filled with rusting pipes, an above ground wasteland packed with people's garbage, and even a desolate gas station. Each arena promises to challenge your skills as a hunter and a survivor in its own way, while unique angles and a sense of scale that turns small, familiar objects into major obstacles help make these environs especially prickly.","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"Good game, but not without its flaws","reviewText":"Deadly Creatures is an odd beast. The concept itself should turn a lot of people off, but underneath its not-so-cute exterior is a game with potential that doesn't play on that potential.The level design is, for the most part, really interesting. It gives you the same sense of scale as does Super Mario Galaxy, only it's limited and not as grand as you would have guessed. The locations are really interesting and unique, and do great jobs of playing the game through an insects (or arachnids, for perfectionist) point of view. The environments are nice, but the texture looks a bit odd. It gives me the feeling that an alternate engine was used to produce the textures as the one used to produce everything else.Graphics are good for a Wii game, no where near the level of Super Mario Galaxy or Metroid Prime 3 , nor does it deliver the tech achievements of something like CoDWaW, but it is good. The character models are pretty good, they look real and (when in motion) creepy. All of the legs move in unisons as you would expect a real insect to move. Using the analog stick to slowly crawl up to an enemy, while watching the hairy legs of the tarantula smoothly move, is truly a sight. Unfortunately the frame-rate takes a serious dip on seemingly random occasions. A new enemie appears, the frame-rate drops, swip the camera to a wider area, the frame-rate drops, or even use the dash ability, and the frame-rate drops.Controls are only decent, motion kills in the scorpion levels are a bit off, so your stab/swing/etc. will be performed on screen a sec or 2 later. It doesn't ruin the game, but it deos detract from the immersion factor. Standard attacks are a combination of button presses (for weak) and motion (for strong), and generally it works well. You'll occasionally have to repeat a motion several times, but thankfully it's not too common.The most impressive part of the game however is the atmosphere; it almost achieves a Metroid-like level of creepiness and loneliness. Any Metroid player can tell you that's a great thing. The sound is great also, bringing absolutely terrific voice acting and a great soundtrack together. The soundtrack consists of ambiance and subtle tunes, and when combined with the sometimes disgusting SFX, it really brings you into the game.Deadly Creatures isn't perfect though. While you've probably heard this before, the game does have some bugs, or technical issues. Enemies may sometime get stick in areas, or appear underground (unintentionally of course), or your motions may not be registered, and while id wish that these were rare occurrence, it happens enough to be a bother.Worst of all though, is that the game simply isn't that fun. The combat is repetitive; locals are interesting at first, but quickly loose their flair as you're forced to backtrack through the same areas within different levels. The story, while shallow and bare, is easily the most interesting part of the game.I would recommend this to anyone with some spare cash (or parents cash, seeing as the game is rated-T), because your probably never going to play anything like it.  The game is short, maybe 7-9 depending on skill and ambition. After that there's nothing, and I mean nothing to do. While its hard to recommend Deadly Creatures at full price, i would definitely suggest you go out and pick it up eventually. Chances are you've never played anything like it, and if the game doesn't sell well, you may never play anything like it again. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it's definitely a memorable and unique experience.(\"fun\" is supposed to be at 2 stars **)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00004SPW9","reviewerName":"flaviolius","summary":"A Masterpiece in every sense of the word","reviewText":"When I first heard that Vagrant Story was reputed to be &quot;Medieval Gear Solid&quot;, I wasn't impressed, as I didn't care for Metal Gear Solid.  However, after hearing some more about Vagrant's storyline, and its similarities to Parasite Eve (my favorite PS game ever), I tried it out.  Result?  I have a New Favorite PS Game.  Gameplay-wise, Vagrant Story is a mixed bag:  it's too action-oriented for RPG purists, and too RPG-ish for action purists.  To me, it combines the best features of RPGs and action-adventure games, resulting in one of the most innovative, challenging, and gripping games I've ever been lucky enough to experience.  Using manga/comic-style voice bubbles was a stroke of genius -- too often voice translation RUINS games.  It's hard to believe the fading PS can produce such incredible graphics.  When the Wyvern came crashing through the ceiling at the game's beginning, my heart lept.  The &quot;hero&quot;, Ashley Riot, is one of the most intriguing characters ever.  I was unsure until deep into the convoluted, immersive plot if Ashley's intent were for good or ill.  The story is fantastic, the characters memorable, the soundtrack and sound effects atmospheric perfection, and even the dialogue is amazing.  And the battle system....ah, the battle system.  It's a masterful blend of strategy and reflex.  First you must choose the correct weapon with the correct affinity -- doing this is half the challenge.  For example, you'd want to use a weapon with fire-based affinity against, say, a water elemental, AND you'd want to make sure your weapon has a high Phantom class ranking (an elemental is considered a Phantom class creature), in order to have a maximum chance of inflicting a maximum amount of damage.  Then, timing becomes precise as you could allegedly Chain attacks together until the end of time, although a Risk factor (which simulates tiredness during battle) makes this highly unlikely.  Ashley also has defense abilities that could, in theory, render him impervious...with the right decisions and perfect timing (and Risk allowing).  How's that for a twist?  Add to that various spells, both offensive and defensive, and Ashley is a force to be reckoned with.  Add to THAT his determined nature and hazy memory, and you have an unprecedentedly heroic character.  As you wander the dungeons beneath the city of Lea Monde in pursuit of the mysterious Sydney Losstarot, Ashley will encounter dozens of creatures:  bats to dragons, zombies to minotaurs, ogres to elementals, and enemy human soldiers, many of which are Ashley's match, physically and/or magically.  A battle I fought against a particular dragon lasted almost thirty minutes!  But Vagrant Story has more to it than a shining battle system.  The story is told through seamless cutscenes that are a Square trademark, bearing you along with revelation upon revelation.  And if that's not enough, after playing through the game, you gain access to new areas, foes, and weapons -- talk about replayability!  Vagrant Story is one of those games that demands a lot of time to experience fully, and rewards without question.  It has as much depth as any game I've ever played, both in terms of gameplay and story (plus I love the fact you can name your various weapons -- watch out for the Brain Flayer!).  Any gamer who is looking for a fresh challenge coupled with a riveting, twist-packed plot and fabulous characters should look no further than the genre-bending Vagrant Story -- a definite highlight in the outstanding PS library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2001"}

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive.

I figured it'd be just like another one of those games like Dancing with the Stars and High School Musical where you see characters on screen dancing, but all you're doing is waving your remote to match the visual cues on the screen. Ho Hum.The first thing that struck me when I popped the game into the Wii was that these were fun songs from every era. They're all family-friendly, and there's something in the track list for everyone, from baby boomers to Gen X'ers to Gen Y'ers. Here's the entire track list. Most of the songs are not covers, but original tracks from the original singers.Girl Just Want to Have Fun - Cyndi LauperRing My Bell - Anita WardA Little Less Conversation (JXL Radio Edit Remix) - Elvis vs. JXLCotton Eye Joe - RednexSurfin' Bird - The TrashmenHeart of Glass - BlondieWomanizer - The Gym All-StarsGroove Is in the Heart - Deee-LiteJerk It Out - CaesarsI Live to Move It (Radio Mix) - Reel 2 Real feat.

In other words, not only are you playing the game, you're learning actual dance steps. You'll learn the \"Mashed Potato\" that was all the rage in the 1960's to Dee Dee Sharp's \"Mashed Potato Time\". You'll learn the best disco moves of the 70's with songs like \"That's the Way I Like It\". And my personal dream come true--you can dance like MC Hammer with \"U Can't Touch This\".For the controller, they went for a decidedly simpler approach, and they hit a home run. For using one Wii remote, the controls are remarkably accurate as far as detecting whether you're dancing correctly or not. For each move, you'll be given a grade of \"Great\", \"Okay\" and \"X\". Now, I won't lie and say the controls are the most precise in the world. There'll be plenty of times you'll be doing the moves precisely, but the Wii will tell you you're not. But where this game triumphs is that even though the controls may be off, the game is so fun that you really don't care.And you also find that the more you practice the moves and \"feel the music\", the better your scores become. If you've gotten to the point where you've memorized the dance and are just doing the moves to the music, your score will be great.The game is simple. You choose a song, and then after a countdown from 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, you'll see a silhouetted character on your screen doing the dance moves. The character is generally dressed appropriately for the song: a disco dude will lead you through \"That's the Way I Like It\", a cowgirl will do a two-step to \"Cotton Eye Joe\", and a dog (yes, a dog) will dance to \"Who Let the Dogs Out\". You basically just have to do the mirror image of the character's moves.They also have multiplayer games. In the first game (Challenge), you can basically have a dance-off between you and up to three other friends to see who'll get the high score. Again, you don't mind in this case if the controls are not completely precise because you're all on the same playing field. In the second game (Strike a Pose), it's like a game of Red Light / Green Light where you have to freeze in your tracks when the music stops. The third game (Last one standing) is an elimination game where the person who makes the least mistakes wins the game.As fpr the exercise value, with virtually every song, I ended it panting because I was out of breath, and even though I was out of breath I wanted to try it again and again until I got it right. To me, that's the sign of a great exercise game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00004U5VF","description":"The Tekken series has always stood as a set of console games that went above and beyond their arcade counterparts.  From additional characters to completely new modes, the series has always tried to add something that the arcade games lacked.  Tekken Tag Tournament, at first glance, is the most dramatic upgrade over an arcade Tekken game to date. The graphics have been given a huge boost, similar to the upgrade that Namco's weapon-based fighter, Soul Calibur, received when it hit the Dreamcast last year. Plus, new modes have been added. But does the series capture the same magical feeling that made the previous Tekken games such smash hits? Most definitely.Tekken Tag Tournament serves as an upgrade to Tekken 3, adding a few new moves along the way. Fighters that had appeared in Tekken 2 but were missing from Tekken 3 have been brought back as well, and most of them have lots of new moves to help balance them with the more powerful Tekken 3 fighters. Finally, the game is now fought in the same tag-team style as Capcom's versus series of fighters, so you can switch between two different characters at any time. Much like Street Fighter EX3 and Dead or Alive 2, you can have up to four players, with each player controlling a different fighter in the tag battle. However, unlike most other tag-battle fighters, Tekken Tag rounds end after only one of the two fighters have been defeated, rather than letting the battle continue as a one-on-two affair. An option that let you configure this would have been nice. Aside from the standard tag-battle arcade mode, there is also a one-on-one game that makes Tekken Tag Tournament more like the previous Tekken games, as well as the standard team battle (though it is now a tag-team battle), time attack, and survival modes. Unlockable modes include a theater mode, where you can watch all of the game's endings; a gallery mode, which lets you pause the game at any time and snap a screenshot of the action that is saved to your memory card for later viewing; and Tekken bowl mode, a bowling minigame that lets you hit the lanes and toss glimmer globes at Heihachi-headed bowling pins. Each character has a different bowling style that affects speed and control. The character endings, with the exception of the game's final boss, are rendered using the game engine. This presumably saved time during the game's development. As a result, they're short, mostly meaningless, and decidedly less than impressive.  By comparison, the prerendered intro and the final boss' prerendered ending are simply incredible pieces of footage. In Japan, the TV commercial for the game is simply an abridged version of the game's new intro movie. Very striking stuff.Graphically, the game has taken a very large leap, and the arcade version of the game looks downright ugly by comparison.  The characters are very, very smooth, and the backgrounds are amazing and filled with lots of movement, from helicopters to crowds of spectators. Some stages are well lit, showing off some really excellent lens-flare techniques. There are also some nice little touches, such as grass being crushed down by falling fighters then slowly springing up afterward. However, the game suffers from one particular problem that has in fact been seen throughout the series, but with the power of the PlayStation2 behind it, you'd expect it to be a thing of the past. The problem is the same one that showed up in Street Fighter EX3. While the backdrops of the fights and the ground on which you fight look great separately, they don't mesh very well. The result is two different types of scrolling, making it look as if the battle is occurring on a small, circular spinning platform surrounded by a nearly stationary background. It's easy to miss while you're actually playing, but it sticks out like a sore thumb on watching the game closely. Also, the game uses much of the same animation and motion-capture data from Tekken 3. Sure, the characters look pretty incredible, but with the identical animation quality, even as good as that animation was, the game looks and feels a little on the stale side. The soundtrack is full of techno and vocoder robot voices that will either endear you to the soundtrack or drive you up the wall.How much you enjoy the game will directly relate to one factor: If you played so much Tekken 2 and 3 that you couldn't possibly play another match, Tekken Tag doesn't offer enough new features to draw you back in. But if you've stayed away from the Tekken series for a long time, Tekken Tag is a very warm homecoming, delivering the same solid gameplay that Tekken fans crave in large doses. Still, you won't be able to stop yourself from wondering what Namco could have done with the game if it had been designed on the PS2 (or comparable arcade hardware) from the start.

I'd say it did a fairly good job of doing that.  And here's why...Pros:-The Visuals and environments were fantastic, especially in HD.-The controls were simple and effective.-Character development was spot on.-The quests were fairly self explanatory and there was no shortage of them.-Weapons and armor were well done and the choices and combinations of each were fairly abundant.-The choice based system was great but left a little to be desired (which is why this same statement will be a con as well).-Damage taken throughout the game shows on your characters body.-Character aging...and certain things age you faster, like heavy magic use.  But certain things can make you younger.Cons:-The choice based system was great but left a little to be desired.  For instance, when you are trying to be good, killing attacking people like bandits counts as an evil deed.  I guess the game expects you to run from all fights.-The game sort of feels incomplete, even the Lost Chapters version.  The original felt much more incomplete though...mainly because it was.-The targeting system was pretty poorly done.  During magic use especially, you would often target friendlies and cause very bad things to happen.All in all the game was a lot of fun and well worth the time and money put in to it.  I'm very excited for Fable 2 to be released.  I think it will be the first game I'll ever pay full price for it right when it comes out.  That's how much fun I thought this game was.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2007"}

It's not worth $49.99 (not too many games to me are, with the exception of a few). I purchased it for $29.99, it was worth that. The things I liked most about the game was that you could kill whoever (I never tried Maze; until I had to towards the end of the game, or the Guild Master), get married (you could have multiple wives or husbands), optional quest, change of appearance and all the gestures. The part of being either good or evil is getting kind of redundant in games these days but it still makes the game more interesting, definately not a bad flaw and it gives the game replay value. The only things I didn't like about the game was the Guild master saying \"There's an important quest card at the guild for you\" over and over and fishing (which was ok when you first started but it got pretty difficult later on). None of these were that bad, just got kind of annoying at times. This game is definately worth buying if you like these type of games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2005"}

However, it was delayed a year later until now.  The graphics are superior and quite realistic.  I like how this game is not just another first person shooter, but Microsoft Studios made it a third person shooter which is awesome.  The story line is quite interesting and the amount and creative enemies are massive.  Most of the game play is within a torn down city in which you play your mission along with cinematics to help the story line along.  This is a great game, the only thing I find a nuisance is the leaning up against the wall or something.  It takes a while to get use to and sometimes you roll to another wall when really you just want to get away from the wall and shoot some monsters.  Another thing I didn't quite like was the running.  It seems like you don't have much control of the direction of where you run, except if you are only going straight...it's hard to turn when you run and the running scene may make you dizzy.Other than that, the game is a great game to play with your friends at home or online...you'll enjoy it if you like shooters!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2006"}

Sturgeon","summary":"Soul Calibur IV","reviewText":"I've played the first and second Soul Caliburs plus the horrid Legends for Wii. I missed out on the original Soul Edge and Soul Calibur III. So those are my qualifications for reviewing a Soul Calibur game. I may not know everything about the SC series, but neither am I a complete newbie.BUTTON MASHING VS. FINESSE: With Soul Calibur II, I never felt any incentive to get better and learn more than my button mashing roots. While I'm sure fighting purists would think finesse fighting is its own reward, there's little reason to bother when button mashing with Link got me past every character on every game mode of SCII. It's a rare balance to find a game where button mashing can work long enough to get you into the game, but then just by virtue of having played, you start to get some finesse and find out just how deep the control system really is. This is what SC IV does. It still rewards button mashing to a degree. I was able to get through the Arcade and Story modes before learning much about the character I was controlling. But I did have a hard time of it. You'll find that things get significantly easier for you if you learn just a little bit of finesse.CHARACTER CREATION: You can altar any existing character to a degree. Mostly you can just upgrade their weapon, change out a single stat-altering quality and change some of their abilities. So no gold-plated Vader.Having only used the Mortal Kombat Armageddon Kreate a Fighter tool before, I can only compare to that. It is nice to have fifty slots worth of character creation (including the altered main characters you've made) compared to MK's two slots (one if you have the Wii). Original character creations aren't quite as all encompassing as the MK fighter creation, however. Every one you make must be a human. No tails, horns, wings or faun legs. You also can't do anyone who's really fat or really skinny. Even the faces are chosen from several presets. You can't thin out a nose here, widen the spacing between the eyes there. You have the presets and that's it. Same goes for fighting styles. Where in MK you could have Scorpions spear mixed with Subzero's freeze, Raydan's teleport, Sony'a weapon, any mix of combo's, here you have the style of one fighter and one fighter only. No mix and matching. So basically, you're just making male/female clones of already existing characters. Most annoying of all is that your stats (attack, defense, guard) are dependant on what clothes and weapons you give your character. Thus you often have to choose between a great looking weak character or an odd looking uber character.GAME MODES: Story Mode is great but short. This is how you would unlock character endings and some things to use in character creation. Tower of Lost Souls is the bulk of where you unlock content. But it's also an exhausting gauntlet that can be frustrating endurance trial that feels like trying to open a big steel door by banging your head into it. This is definitely where that finesse that I was talking about comes in handy. Arcade Mode is just like you'd think. Square off against opponents until you get to the end. But there's no ending as a reward. That comes from story mode. Also all the stats you worked so hard to boost in character creation don't mean anything in Arcade mode, only Story and Tower modes. So you're left to wonder why you would bother. Honestly, I'd stick with story mode.ONLINE: Stay away from it at all costs. If you do a quick join, you'll more than likely find that all sessions are full. You can create your own, but in the off chance that you do find someone, the combination of your lag time and they're button-mashing spamming of moves can and will often end in your defeat before you can even make a move.FINAL WORDS: This is a great game. While it may seem like I'm being highly critical of this game I wouldn't be credible if I didn't list a games short comings as well as it's high points. It has its faults. But at the end of the day, the graphics are great. The control is some of the best, most highly responsive controls you could ask for. Button mashing versus finesse is balanced better than most fighting games I could name. If you want a high quality, fun fighting game, this is one of the better ones.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2008"}

Ever wanted to join the Army or the Marines, but couldn't because you were flat-footed? Well, you can rejoice now, because Half-Life will solve both those problems with one blow. You start off as an intelligent scientist named Gordon Freeman. You work at a place called Black Mesa, which is like Area 51. After an informative train-ride, you get off, have some chit-chat with the guards and get your suit. I was very impressed with how professional the level looked. Security guards, retina scanners, the works. This ain't your local bank. After getting your suit, you go to a room where an experiment is about to take place. You're a crucial part of it. But wait, the scientists are sounding as if something might go wrong. And then you push the specimen into the beam and . . . and shortly after that you'll be experiencing one of the finest moments in video game history. Remember that nice-looking level I was telling you about? Now visualize it with HEAVY damage, dead or dying scientists and guards and aliens popping out of thin air. AND YOU HAVE NO WEAPON! This is no Quake cake-walk with John Wayne heroics. You'll be CRAWLING in FEAR for most of the game.  I think one of the main things that made this game popular was this: It touched on the common fear of going into the unknown and feeling ill-prepared for what lies ahead. Sure, you might have 200 rounds on the MP5, a rocket launcher, and whatever else, but believe me, it won't last long (especially on hard mode).  Another thing that this game touched on was this: The fear of small spidery-creatures and large, ugly, T-Rex things that can run faster than you. Believe me when I say you'll jump when you stick your head in a tunnel and a snark or headcrab jumps out at you. After a while you manage to arm yourself and try and make it to the surface . . . only to find that Marines are attacking Black Mesa in an effort to cover up the severe accident! So now we have this ugly Bermuda Triangle of Marines, Aliens, and You. The Aliens are just plain bad.  You're just trying to get your innocent rear-end out of there. And the Marines are just following orders. Makes for one whopper of a story and a game.  But not all is run-and-gun. MANY times you'll be jumping like Mario, making well-timed decisions, and solving puzzles. But besides all that, there are three other things about this game that I like: 1)A flashlight. It's ABOUT TIME someone did something to light those dark levels. 2)Humor. Guards goof around with experimental technology--with disastrous results. 3)Well-lighted levels overall. The only FPS I've seen with more light is Serious Sam. Very rarely will you be squinting your eyes in this game.  To wrap things up, my favorite levels are the beginning one and the one entitled Surface Tension. Despite some wonderful level design in this game, I really hated the alien levels. Sure, they LOOKED nice, but when you start playing them it's a different story. Also, the two endings are too short and unsatisfactory. But overall this is a GREAT game, worth getting even now (especially if you haven't played it before), despite the fact that Return to Castle Wolfenstein (and other FPS's) are around the corner.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2001"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J6DC","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Fun to play eye-candy with minor drawbacks","reviewText":"The game itself is gorgeous, and some of the fighting controls are clearly God Of War inspired. Otherwise, however, I don't really see that the God Of War comparisons are all that fair. The styles and mythologies of the games are completely different outside of stunning artwork and mirrored basic battle mechanics. I've found this game to be heavier on the flashy side of things, and much less concerned with the puzzling you'll find in most God Of War games. In that respect, the game almost reminds me more of Heavenly Sword than anything else.One thing worth mentioning though is that both God Of War and Heavenly Sword do a slightly better job with effective controlling. This could easily be due to a camera which isn't always friendly; as you don't control it much at all and enemies are often charging towards you without you even being aware of it until it's too late, because of a camera that is forward-facing in spite of allowing enemies to come at you from all angles. This really is a minor complaint. I've experienced camera work that is much, much sloppier. But it still takes away from the epic experience this game would otherwise be.Kojima has certainly gone to great lengths to expand on the mythology of Castlevania and present it in extreme depth. I expected nothing less when I knew he was involved, but the look and legend of this game really do shine. You'll remember the experience clearly, and the characters will stick out in your mind as well. Much of this game brought Zelda to mind. That, in and of itself, should let you know that the focus here is not so extremely violent and based around shock value that it forgets how to be touching in the story it's meant to tell.While the game does very little outside of its story line to set itself apart from other games it resembles; the experience is still one to be had. If you enjoy this sort of action packed, button-prompting endeavor, then Lords Of Shadow is certainly one to add to your collection. It follows a proven control structure in order to tell a pretty unique story, and ends up getting most things right. I finished it and was not disappointed. In fact, I immediately went back in to replay certain chapters.To conclude: Yes, you've seen this kind of gameplay before. But that shouldn't keep you from enjoying this game. It's not perfect. But it satisfies, to be sure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2012"}

Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"High Calibre, But Nothing New","reviewText":"When I finished playing Silent Hill 2, I was disappointed that it hadn't made any great developments over the original game, and was hoping for new things with part 3, but I'm sorry to say that the same applies with this new instalment.Silent Hill 3 is a great looking game. It outclasses so many other current PS2 titles on the merits of it's graphics alone, that its hard to be critical of it, but I am! I can't understand why, yet again, the producers haven't managed to come up with any standout new locations. The shopping mall, office block and subway station are new, but all three are ugly and drab looking (and not in a scary way!). Plus we have repeats of the sewers and amusement park (SH1) and the north section of the town including the club and the whole of the hospital from SH2. Getting Heather to explore the very same locations as James did in the previous game seemed pointless and boring to me.Plus, the other characters in the story make practically no impact on the gameplay at all, they just seem to crop up for a spot of conversation. And there seem to be far fewer ending options than previously seen, so there is not a lot of replay value here.OK, thats all pretty harsh, so lets get to the positives. The monsters are, once again, pretty repulsive, and can be quite challenging to fight. And although its not really new, the amusement park is a great section of the game (check out the Haunted Mansion!) and it ends with a very challenging boss fight-full marks for that. Heather is a good character, and well voice-acted. Her reactions to the unfolding plot around her make up some of the games strongest aspects. Interestingly, the plot is actually written as the \"real\" sequel to the first game, which gives some continuity, but even though the events of the second are completely ignored, the locations are lifted directly from it-Huh?But really, the first game did it all so much better, I lost count of the times I jumped or felt the chills run down my spine while playing it, something that seldom happens here.If you fancy a polished and bloody horror game to while away a few hours, you will certainly get it here, but its only a retread of the original. For real scares, I would go for \"Fatal Frame\".","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2003"}

The art directors did a great job keeping the feel of the show, and the video inbetweens (cinematics) are really good. In fact, getting to see the next one is incentive to keep playing. And while the in-game graphics obviously aren't as polished as the pre-rendered parts, they're still pretty good, staying true to the cartoon. The opening mix of gameplay and cinematics is very dramatic.The controls could be better. Particularly when you're flying the batplane or driving the batmobile. In fact, the batplane section, so far, has been the weakest part of the game for me, with the batmobile/car chase a close second. Plus, running around QUAKE-style, shooting bat-a-rangs is a little boring.Some of the in-game directions could use work, too. Some objectives aren't particularly clear at first...they should have tested the gameplay on people who didn't work on it.My hope is that response will be strong enough for a streamlined sequel, with better overall controls, deeper fighting combinations, and the ability to bat-grapple wherever you'd like. The game isn't particularly hard, and it felt kinda lame beating up Mr. Freeze's thungs, who are all young women! (...who manage to be tougher than Joker's big thugs).Essentially, this game isn't nearly as puzzle oriented as TOMB RAIDER, but it makes up for it somewhat in overall style.

Players can even customize their own hero or villain and upgrade them with an in-depth skill tree system that will increase their special abilities.","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"Not What Is Expected","reviewText":"I was a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece LORD OF THE RINGS years before the movies were even announced and over a decade before the series was considered cool and in vogue.  I really enjoyed the movies and the video games based upon the film series have been very enjoyable to play.  When I heard about THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE THIRD AGE, I thought this would be the ultimate LORD OF THE RINGS video game.  I had thought that the game was going to allow players to play their own character from the Middle Earth universe that had adventures spanning the time frame of the trilogy.  I also thought that the characters would have different adventures than the characters from the movies, but would occasionally meet some of them.The general plot follows Berethor, former Captain of the Citadel Guard of Gondor.  Berethor was a close friend of Boromir.  Apparently sometime after Boromir left for Rivendell and didn't return, Berethor was ordered to seek him out.  As the game progresses, gamers soon learn that this isn't the case.  Along Berethor's journey he is joined by several other adventures:  a female elf named Idrial, a Dunedain and friend of Aragorn, the dwarf Hadhod whose ancestors ruled Moria, a village-woman of the Plains of Rohan named Morwen, and Eaoden of the Riddermark.  Berethor and his companions seem to only be a few steps behind the Fellowship of the Ring.  The journey through Moria to the plains of Rohan to Edoras. From there it's off the Helm's Deep, next to Osgiliath, then to Midas Tirith and the Pelennor Fields, and ultimately a final confrontation in Mordor.The game follows a traditional turned-based role-playing format of rounds where each character attacks.  The visuals are very nice and the overall movement of the screen characters is easy to manipulate with very few quirks.  The mini-movies that are unlocked as you progress the game that are narrated by Gandalf also do a good job of connecting the adventures of LORD OF THE RINGS: THE THIRD AGE to the film series.  Also, it's kind of fun getting to play main characters from the series in certain places, such as Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Eowen, and Faramir.  After beating each level you can reload the game in Evil Mode and play evil characters from the game including giant cave trolls, the Balrog, Grima Wormtongue, the Nazgul, the Witch King, and even Sauron.There are some minor problems with the game.  For instance, even though all characters get experience, characters who are actually engaged in combat receive about twice as much experience as those who aren't.  This can be kind of annoying because a character like Morwen, who fights with a couple of axes and doesn't have much fighting stamina, really aren't very fun to fight with.Minor annoyances aside, the biggest issue I had with the game was the plot.  Except that there are no hobbits, the characters that you play have a strong resemblance to the main characters from the books and movies.  Not only that, but Berethor's party seems to be following in the footsteps of the Fellowship as the traverse Middle Earth.  There's also the issue that the general plot of the game doesn't make much sense with the story from the films.  This isn't such an issue earlier in the game, but it becomes more and more blatant as you progress.  For instance it isn't a stretch that Berethor's party might have come to Moria and had to finish the business of killing off the Watcher of the Deep.  However, they would not have been with Gandalf fighting against the Balrog, nor would they have fought Grima Wormtongue, the Witch King, or Sauron.  You don't even have to be a purist to be somewhat upset by that--after all since this is an \"Official Lord of the Rings Movie Trilogy\" product you would think it would fit with the rest of the canon.  However, even worse is how the actual plot of the game unfolds.  It starts off interesting enough and even though it turns into a three-way love story, it's enough to keep one interested.  That is until the last two levels of the game. The game quickly skips the plot of the story and at the end offers no resolution whatsoever.  It feels like the gamemakers rushed to finish the product to get it on the market.  I'm not sure why as THE THIRD AGE didn't appear until a year after RETURN OF THE KING was in movie theatres.  Therefore, once a player finishes the game there really is no replay value except trying to complete the game in co-op mode.Overall, LORD OF THE RINGS: THE THIRD AGE has an interesting premise, but doesn't really live up.  It's an okay game to play once, but offers nothing new to the canon and has no replay value.  Die hard fans will be disappointed, but younger fans of the movies might enjoy playing the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2008"}

I look fondly back on the days of some really wonderful 2D platformers that were made in the late 1980s and early 1990s.  Sonic was a developed as a deliberate attempt by SEGA to challenge NINTENDO's undisputed dominance of the platformer market with its \"Mario Bros.\" series of games.  While Mario has to this day, yet to be de-throned as king of 2D, and now 3D platform games, SEGA's Sonic the Hedgehog was the best and most fully realized challenge.  The original \"Sonic the Hedgehog\" (StH is included in this compilation) was a truely innovative game.  It combined some of the best elements of previous platformers like Mario and Megaman, and added something unique... SPEEEEEED.  Sonic was fast. For its time, the Genesis could push pixels at a rate no Nitendo player had ever seen before.

As the PS3 launch title which actually had some buzz around it, it has fallen on Resistance to prop up the PS3's launch lineup when other launch titles garnered reviews ranging from decently entertaining  (Ridge Racer 7) to horrific (Mobile Suit Gundam).  It's also hard not to note the difficulty of living up to a certain other first person shooter which happened to be a launch title: Halo.  In many ways, Resistance borrows from that title, and several others, most notably Call of Duty 2 and Half-Life 2.  In a nutshell, Resistance: Fall of Man is an FPS which takes place in an alternate version of the 1950s, where World War 2 never happened.  Instead, the world is under siege by the Chimera, a monstrous collective of creatures which may be either mutants or aliens.  As an American soldier brought overseas, your mission is to help the British fight off the Chimera.  Things take an unforseen turn, however, and relatively early on, you obtain the ability to regenerate health to a small degree.Less unexpected is Insomniac's love of off-the-wall weaponry, and you'll find that here, although in smaller and tamer doses than their hallmark Ratchet & Clank series.  While you'll get your stock machine gun/grenade launcher combo from the start, there'll be a number of other weapons you'll pick up, including the Chimeran standard issue Bullseye, which allows you to \"tag\" an enemy and have the bullets home in on the tag, the sniper rifle, which has a time \"slow down\" function, an organic mine-layer which spews explosive sacs, a rocket launcher with homing capability, and the auger, which fires energy bolts that can burrow through walls, and can also generate energy shields.  There are also several types of grenades, including the always fun and fiery air-fuel grenade.  If you finish the game, more weapons and a new difficulty level are unlocked for a subsequent playthrough.  The weapons are what really set this game apart.  The tactics they inspire will make for some heated battles.  The controls are decent and better than Sony's last generation as far as FPS responsiveness, although I still prefer Microsoft's control sticks for this kind of game.  Enemy AI, while sometimes buggy or simple, is fairly adequate enough of the time.  The game can also be played in co-op mode, which is certainly better than a kick in the teeth.The good news is that, provided you don't play the game on easy, Resistance is a long enough game to keep you occupied for a bit.  The bad news, however, is that the game can get oddly repetitive, thanks in part to the environments.  You get a basic handful of motifs: war-torn urban battlefields, British military installations, underground tunnels, and alien-looking Chimeran strongholds.  To be sure, there are a few areas that buck the trend, such as the relatively open spaces of Cheddar Gorge, or the frozen surface of the Thames River,  but a pattern does start to set in.  To break things up, Insomniac threw in a few vehicular sequences (where you drive a tank, jeep, or Chimeran walker), but they don't pop up very often.  The basic gun-play is still very solid, though, and use of the motion-sensing SixAxis controller to shake off enemies who grab you is a nice touch.  For multiplayer fans, there are a fair number of game types, and a high potential player count.  Sadly, as is the case with too many games nowadays, there are no bots available for practice.Graphically speaking, the game is pretty nice, if somewhat underwhelming.  The framerate is rock solid, especially considering the amount of activity going on, and despite what a few Sony-haters may claim, this game is more than just \"slightly better looking\" than a PS2 game.  Textures are decent, there are the requisite shiny surfaces, and the draw distance is pretty damn good.  Compared to Gears of War, however, it comes off as a bit blocky and plain in design and detail.  Inspiration is clearly drawn from Call of Duty 2's urban areas, Half-Life 2's City 17 and the associated Combine metallic block installations, and Prey's sleek alien technology.  The lighting doesn't stand out, but is used effectively enough in conjuction with a muted color palette and the usual atmospheric touches (different times of day in different areas, or the use of snowy weather later in the game).  The Chimera are nicely (if gruesomely) rendered, and there are a few of them that are almost alarming in appearance.  The sound effects and voice chatter are pretty good, but the music (which helped make Halo as unique as it was) is somewhat underwhelming.To put it simply, Resistance: Fall of Man is what one would expect from a launch game which was rushed, but created by a dedicated and very capable developer that refused to put out a sub-par product: somewhat unoriginal, yet consistently entertaining.  There is clearly room for franchise growth, and Insomniac has already announced that a sequel will be forthcoming.  While not a stranger to FPS games, Insomniac hasn't visited the genre in years, which makes the results all the more impressive (considering how archaic the game could have played).  If you have a PS3, you really should have this game in your collection, as the higher difficulty levels provide a challenge for hardcore gamers that approaches Halo's \"Legendary\" difficulty mode.  While not as inspired as the titles which it borrows from, or Insomniac's first three Ratchet & Clank games, Resistance still excels as a member of the higher echelon of console FPS games, even if it can't carve out a niche among the very best of the best.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2007"}

Is this how it's going to be...\" but to my releaf and surprise this game actually is even more fun than Fable 2 which far and away outshadows the first Fable.  How did they do this?  For starts a very rich story, a great choice in voice acting, including some repeat performances and some now ones, and gameplay that took you from Fable 2 and (just like the first time) pushed the world to a new age where the choices made by your character decide the fate of the world.  A great and terrible villian or the most honest of heroes, the choice is right there, but (much as my review of Fable 2) the game is rated M and should be for only mature audiances.  The great part about the Collector's edition is not only the little easter eggs from the old world and original game play but unique DLC that is only found through the Collector's Edition, including a new area and house a new outfit and 2 new types of dog, my personal favorate being the Boxer.  The case is build like a hollow book with the compartment for the game itself and a \"secret\" compartment where a fresh stack of cards and a solid (well build and somewhat heavy) coin with a Good side and an Evil side wait.  Oveall, I as a collector wanted the game, the DLC was something I wasn't sure I'd like, want, or even be interested in but I have to say I am now very happy with my purchase.

My excitement for the game was insane, and the end result was nothing short of hilarious. I spent over 100 hours and over $300 on this franchise, and I am very angry. This game is a let down from start to finish. The game does not have enough dialogue options, you don't get to explore big interesting area you are either in a battle or on the Citadel. Side quests are AWFUL and I mean god damn AWFUL you acquire side quests by wandering like an idiot on the Citadel and \"eavesdropping\" on people...seriously?! what's wrong with plain old talk to the NPC way? and worse side quests are not kept in a nice organized way in your journal..and you don't get to \"mark\" a side quest as active either..and you don't get info on where to go or what to do..you have to recall what the conservation was when you automatically acquired it..and a lot of side quests EXPIRE if you don't do them quickly..ugh.And don't get me started on the ending..its beyond bad. I am open minded when it comes to ending, I can take tragic, happy or anywhere in between. But this game..its just terrible..it does NOT make ANY sense..its totally against what the series has been about...and you have almost NO control over what occurs..isn't Mass Effect series about choices and consequences?!

{"product_name":"B000066RKC","description":"Based on the same elements that made the movie so enjoyable--fear, suspense, and the possibility that your teammate might be infected--The Thinglets players slowly creep into the action with the help of several nonplayer characters (NPCs), whom you control and use to protect and aid you and your group. Using a core team of engineers, medics, and soldiers, players must manage and control their level of trust in, and fear of, you. They react to your actions, and might betray you if they think you might be the Thing. Conversely, you must constantly monitor which one of them might be infected and dispose of that person. Other characters must trust you, but if they fear you, actions as drastic as coercion might be necessary. For example, if a soldier doesn't have confidence in you, you may have to put your gun to his head to convince him you're not the Thing.

The game designers could have taken a great leap forward in terms of gameplay and character interaction, but instead they chose a slight hop in favor of more action-oriented gaming. It's a shame, because the best thing about \"The Thing\" is recruiting allies, all the while keeping an eye on them lest they be Things themselves, even as they're keeping their eyes on you to ensure their own personal safety. These guys get scared, get sick when they stumble into a chamber splashed with gore, and sometimes demand that you prove your loyalty to them at gunpoint. But most of the time you'll just be running around shooting creepy crawlies that are fairly identical to one another, and just aren't very scary. That's not to say, though, that the game is completely devoid of scares - every now and then you can expect to be startled by some unexpected event. It's just that from a game based on \"The Thing\" property, you expect a little more than you get. Add some bland, if sometimes atmospheric, levels into the mix (they all look pretty similar to one another), and you've got a game that disappoints as much as it excites. I only hope another game (or a sequel) builds upon this unique gameplay concept and therefore makes the ultimate survival horror experience. In the meantime, this should tide you over, if you don't expect too much from it.Final Score: C","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2003"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"sft","summary":"Battle of the Boing","reviewText":"Visually F.E.A.R 2 is impressive. It features some terrific maps (although it's still a bit too much of a corridor shooter), cut-scenes, and in-game animations, the character modelling is good and it has a host of nice atmospheric touches. It also introduces some imaginative new enemies not seen in the original, including the reanimators, who bring dead grunts back to life as flailing, gun-toting zombies, and pesky, shrivelled guys in shorts, who scurry about like Gollum on speed. F.E.A.R 2 is also pretty creepy at times -- it actually made me jump once or twice. It's a shame, however, that these jolts are isolated to brief sections of the game with long gaps between. The story's okay though unremarkable. The combat ranges from quite easy to pretty tough (on the normal setting). The tasks are typical: finding keycards and whatnot -- nothing particularly inspiring. So far so whatever -- it's a good game but not a great one. On to my main criticisms. The PC controls are a bit twitchy, but more of a problem is the way your character moves. The amount of head-bob is insane. I mean truly bonkers. Beckett bounces along as though on a pogo stick. It irritated the hell out of me and significantly reduced my enjoyment of the game. Then there's the lack of humour. Aside from a few quips within the intel reports there is none.

This game felt a lot like the first Halo in that I felt like I was the chief and saw/felt what he did. Also the weapons in this game felt like they provided a lot of punch and that I could rely on almost any of them to get through any enemy force. Other improvements were Human vehicles felt more useful again, transitions between vehicles and on foot were better and the storyline was a lot more interesting, and for the first time I felt sorry for characters.One surprising fact was that, while weapons felt like they had improved, enemy resistence appeared to have improved also. Meaning, enemies were felt smarter whilst attacking me but not in the challenging way Halo 3 was, here it was fun to go against them. Another surprise was all the variations of combat we experienced on feet or in the air (this game had great airel combat situations).Now no game is perfect as their are a couple things I didn't like. Melee still didn't feel useful, as weapons appeared to take a long time to butt and then go back to shooting.

If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"demonsRendangered","summary":"For the Dreamcast!!","reviewText":"Crazy Taxi is something I would've recommended being ported to a portable.

It represents the time when console games were become identical if not superior to the arcade versions.In the game you pick a taxi driver and zoom from one spot to the next picking up customers and taking them to a location within a time limit. It's definitely arcade quality as you'll probably only be spending a few minutes before time is up. This is also accompanied by a few select tracks from the Offspring band, something that was more recognizable back then and probably won't shine as much now. It gets old listening to the same songs so I would recommend to anyone looking to spend a lot of time with this game to pick up the Xbox Live or PSN versions as they probably have options to customize the soundtrack. This version however would be great for someone to play in short bursts which is why it would make a great portable. All in all, it makes a great addition to the Dreamcast library.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

Again, God of War stomps on DMC3 in this area.Gameplay -This is where the game is the most dissappointing. Although God of War was easy, there were reasons for that - one of which were controls that were tight. Let's not even bring Ninja Gaiden Black into the equation. NGB was super hard as well, but the controls were extremely tight. I recently played NGB again to make sure I was comparing fairly to DMC3 and I validated the fact that DMC3 is stupid-hard because the controls are not tight enough. NGB steps on DMC3 in this area.  Simple examples of where DMC3 falls short is not being able to roll out of the way-forward or back, but only side to side. This has a huge negative impact later in the game when you are trying to get of the way of cheap bosses. Instead of rolling out of the way you jump up right in the way of one of their huge cheap life-stealing strikes. Another dissapointing issue is there is no blocking functionality, again just plain cheap. Ironically, the non-boss characters are over-the-top easy in DMC3. There is no real balance to the game.Overall: I recommed renting the game, it is at least worth that, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it unless you had a lot of time on you hand to get over the steep learning curve to beat bosses later in the game and also the patience to deal with the lack of control that has a negative impact later in the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2006"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must have.Metal Gear Solidis one of the all-time greats.

Blazkowicz, is back inReturn to Castle Wolfenstein. Set  during World War II,Return to Castle Wolfensteinfinds the Nazis  dabbling in the black arts in an effort to create an army of supersoldiers.  Naturally, Blazkowicz is the only thing standing in the Nazis' way, so he's set  behind enemy lines in an effort to end the madness.On the surface, the single-player game seems like pure gold--after all, everyone  loves killing Nazis. But the story jumps all over the place, the enemy AI is  less than impressive, and most gamers will be able to finish the game in a mere  10 to 15 hours. The single-player game falls short of the standards set by  titles such asHalf-LifeandNo One Lives Forever.In fact, the best thing aboutReturn to Castle Wolfensteinis its  team-based multiplayer mode. Each multiplayer adventure features Axis vs. Allies, and  both sides offer four character classes: engineer (removes obstacles), medic  (heals and revives teammates), lieutenant (calls in air strikes and replenishes  ammo), and soldier (only class able to use sniper rifles, flamethrowers, and  other unusual weapons). The game includes only eight multiplayer maps, but they  are all perfectly designed, and in order to be successful teams have to work  together. The result is a great gaming experience that fans ofCounter-Strikeor the Day of Defeat mode forHalf-Lifewill really  appreciate.Graphically,Return to Castle Wolfensteinlooks amazing. It uses the  powerfulQuake IIIengine to great effect, and the character models,  explosions, and lighting effects are all perfectly done.

JAGELLA","summary":"Another Milestone in Gaming?","reviewText":"As most of you are aware, the video and PC gaming industry loves to hype games.  In the last six years or so the games that got a LOT of attention prior to release include Unreal, Unreal Tournament 2003, Unreal 2, Black and White, and of course, Doom 3.  As you can see from this list, not all of these games lived up to expectations.  Considering the tremendous amount of hype that heralded the return of Wolfenstein, does Return to Castle Wolfenstein live up to expectations?Mostly yes.  The graphics in this game are definitely good, and they seem to approach photo-realism in some ways.  It helps to run this game with a good video card, and I can tell you that although Return to Castle Wolfenstein was released in 2001, my Radeon 9800 graphics card still strains a bit if I turn all the settings up.  The sound, level design, weapons, and enemy AI all are very good too.Nevertheless, most gamers would agree that this shooter was not the milestone it was expected to be.  Some complained that the single-player adventure is mediocre, but I thought it was quite good.  I guess there's only so much you can do with a first-person action game, and if the previews in the PC gaming press get too exciting, one should expect a let down.So should you buy Return to Castle Wolfenstein?  If you like playing action games on your PC, then by all means get a copy.  At the price, you'll get a really good value because this game is as good or better than many of the newer, more expensive shooters.  Moreover, playing Return to Castle Wolfenstein can lend you an idea of how games evolve and how gamers react to them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-19-2004"}

The parts are scattered across  a forested area crowded with giant (when compared to our hero's size) animals  and other hazards. Our hero stumbles across a race of part-animal, part-plant,  all-bizarre creatures he names Pikmin. Olimar has to learn how to lead the  Pikmin around the forest as he uses the abilities of the different-colored  Pikmin to overcome the many obstacles in his path.Learning when and how to make the best use of your Pikmins' skills and traits is  the essence of the game. You can control up to 100 Pikmin at a time while  figuring out which Pikmin are best suited for a particular task. Some are better  fighters, while others can survive in water or handle explosive bomb rocks.  However, even the best Pikmin herder will have to sacrifice a few of the  plant-headed beasts for the greater good. It's the making of new strategies to  minimize losses that makesPikminchallenging and fun.For a first-generation GameCube title, the graphics, sound, and music are  fantastic and show an awesome amount of detail. Though it's noPok&eacute;mon, this game should appeal to wide-eyed younger gamers as  well as seasoned vets. The controls are intuitive and feel perfect for the  standard GameCube controller. However, learning to position the camera can be a  tad frustrating during some of the more tense moments, as it has only a few  magnification levels and needs constant adjustment.The biggest obstacle Olimar faces is time. He has only 30 days (each day is  about 15 minutes in real time) in which to find the necessary parts. While this  keeps the pace of the game up, some may find such limits somewhat frustrating,  as it means there will be a lot of repetition and rethinking of strategy.

Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"H.

In my eyes, this game looks even better than the last one. The first 20 or 30 minutes of this game are worth the price of admission alone (especially considering that the game is only $20 now!). I don't feel that describing the very beginning of the game is a SPOILER, but if you do, please do not read any further.The opening segment, where you control Lightning and Odin, battling Bahamut, is simply awesome. It's some of the most fun I've had this console generation (even though it's easy- it is the very beginning of the game, after all). As much as FF13 was a step forward for JRPG combat, this one battle between summoned monsters was light years beyond. I was a bit disappointed that there weren't more sequences like that throughout the game, which is the only criticism that I have in that regard (but they set the bar awfully high). Battle remains fast paced, fun, and reward-driven throughout the campaign, following the blueprint established in FF13, but nothing quite lives up to that initial throwdown with your king-sized beasties, as they blast through the breathtaking setting of Valhalla.I realize that I'm (mostly) only covering one aspect of this game, but oh, what an aspect it is, and if you want reviews that detail the rest of it, there are 100+ others for you to peruse. Yes, the story is as whacky as ever, and the characters need attitude adjustments, but I've played most of the FFs, so I'm sort of used to it by now. You just need to embrace the whackiness, if you ask me. I mean, we all revere FF7, but do you actually remember how goofy Cloud was, what with that absurd haircut and sword, as he sprinted about the world map with a red lion-thing named Red XIII? I mean, that was pretty crazy, and so was that black-hatted midget mage and monkey-tailed thief in FF9.I also want to briefly comment on the music in this game: I thought it was awesome, other than a horrific heavy metal tune that occasionally pops up during boss battles (why, Square, WHY?). As for the leveling process in this game, it's \"okay\"... I preferred the system in FF13, but it's still way better than most JRPGS.Having played this game, and watching the tech demo \"Agni's Philosophy\", I can't wait to see what ol' Squenix whips together for PS4. This was a difficult console generation for Japanese developers, and a period of adaptation, but the leaders like Capcom, Square, and Konami have survived and are moving on, stronger for their trials.

It's side-scrolling, each world has its own theme (snow, etc.), levels are divided into several sections, and it has the feel one expects from a \"Super Mario\" game. What's unique is Princess Peach herself. As far as I know this is her first solo adventure away from bros. Mario and Luigi (requiring her rescue for a change). Peach has a number of interesting abilities at her disposal. She can access four different \"emotions\" at any time: joy, gloom, rage and calm. Using Joy allows her to turn into a cyclone or fly, while gloom makes her cry uncontrollably, creating interesting puzzles around the use of water. Using an emotion drains the \"mood bar\" that can later be refilled. Peach also has a trusty side-kick in the form of Perry, a talking yellow umbrella that she uses as a weapon, and who suffers from some decidedly strange dreams after each boss encounter. Who's this mysterious figure occupying his dreams? Why does an umbrella dream at all? Who knows. Perry also gives Peach the ability to glide after jumps, reminding me a bit of \"Yoshi's Island.\" Peach's use of emotions might have seemed odd in any other game, but here they add a kind of charm that fits well with everything else.

Set in an alternate present of 2010, players take on the role of a US Air Force pilot who while investigating an extreme radiation signature, stumbles upon a top secret Cold War era Soviet program, run amok which not only causes monstrous mutations, but also threatens to alter nature of time itself..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Speed up time to reduce enemies to dust.View larger.Or gain from turning back the clock.View larger.Classic FPS gameplay.View larger.A revisionist Cold War storyline.View larger.StoryIn the dark, Cold War winter of 1949-50 Stalin, the brutal leader of the Soviet Union, had two super weapons: long range missiles and the atomic bomb. But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.PlayStation Network support including PlayStation Trophies.","reviewerName":"Some Guy","summary":"Awesome FPS with great story","reviewText":"I haven't reviewed a game in a while, but Singularity really made me feel like I had to.  Especially considering there are only two other reviews here as I write.First, the most important thing.  Singularity gets the basics absolutely right.  Character movement is fluid, the controls are easy to learn, and there are no lurching mini-loads.The environments and graphics are top-notch.  From the moment you \"arrive\" on the island, you know it's going to look good, and it does throughout.Gameplay is also great fun.  I've heard a lot of comparisons to Bioshock, which I didn't play but watched my roommate play.  I suppose there are similarities, but Singularity offers it's own take on survivor horror FPS.The storyline is excellent.  Playing with time often causes a muddled story, but here we have a great altered past/present that must be fixed, and the history of the island's downfall is well detailed in notes and recordings you find.  Get all of them.  Also, the climax is a big moment for your character.Your time-altering abilities are great fun to use.  Power them up as soon as you can, especially the one that creates a sphere of frozen time.  This is extremely useful in taking out multiple enemies.  It's fun to age a soldier to dust, turn \"tics\" against each other, and age/renew countless items.  See a crushed, rusted crate?  Renew it and inside could be E-99 (your upgrade juice), med packs and ammo.  Sometimes this is imperative to continue, sometimes you just find more juice under a big branch you just \"de-aged.\"Happily, Singularity lacks any glaring flaws.  If you find something you don't like, it's often down to personal preference.  Health, for example, is (yes!) a good old-fashioned bar.  You have to use health packs to regenerate.  The encroaching red haze, once a good thing but abused to the point of annoying overkill in some games (the latest COD) stays away until you're nearly dead.It's not quite as OMG-THIS-IS-AWESOME as the first time through Dead Space, an astoundingly good game, but has it's share of pleasant surprises.  For example, I shot a soldier in the leg with my shotgun, which blew it off below the knee.  He hopped a few times, clutching his thigh and yelling, then fell and squirmed in agony until I finished him off.  That's a nice touch in enemy construction.I apologize if this sounds too positive.  There's always a risk of coming off as fake or easily impressed.  But sitting here I can't really think of anything they did \"wrong.\"  It's a fully developed, greatly conceived and polished horror FPS.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000R0URCE","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"The Force...unleashed!","reviewText":"Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is the newest LucasArts game based in the Star Wars universe, taking place between Episode III and Episode IV of the epic Star Wars saga. It fleshes out just exactly what Darth Vadar, the Imperial Army, the Emperor were up to leading up to Star Wars: A New Hope (Ep. IV). You will also get to learn how the Rebel alliance came to be.And just like its title, the game lets you unleashed the force, in ways never seen in a video game before. Your character, Starkiller is the secret apprentice to Darth Vadar and you are tasked with finding the rest of the Jedi in the galaxy and elimiating them. To truly 'get' the storyline of this game you will have to know the Star Wars story, which you can learn from the films.  Since you are the apprentice to one of the most powerful Sith in the galaxy, your powers are pretty epic. What is really cool about this game is that you really only use the most basic of force powers, but they've been so jacked up and juiced that they are 100 times more powerful than you have ever seen them. Force push literally blows over your enemies, force lightening has the ability to shock the life out of three or more enemies, and it creates a huge wave of electricity. You can use force grip to grab enemies and fling them around like toys...its amazing, and heavily addicting. In addition to your powers you have the standard issue Lighsaber. The Lightsaber combat is pretty basic but there are combos to learn, and you can even customize your lightsaber. There are also force combos which use both your lightsaber and your force powers for devestating combos.Another great feature about The Force Unleashed is the powerful physics engine and rendering engine used in the game. LucasArts basically used this game as a tech demo to test out their new tools, and it is...most impressive. The Euphoria physics engine gives weight and real time physics to every object in the game. Toss a stormtroopers body and watch his arms and legs flail about, and watch as his body bounces against objects. Same goes for inanimate objects. You can force grab a barrel and toss that sucker at enemies and watch them either jump out of the way or get bowled over; its great. Everything acts with realistic weight and physics, making for a truly unique and awesome gaming experience. Trees bend and break in a realistic fashion, wooden bridges bend like their real world counterparts as well. The best thing about the physics engine is the improvisations. You want access to that hidden area? Well go ahead and stack up a bunch of barrels so you can reach it. Its things like this that make The Force Unleashed a great game.The rendering engine, DMM makes things act and break like their real world counterpart. Which means, wood splinters and breaks like wood, glass splinters and shatters like glass, etc. This makes for an even more believeable game world. And the best part is that you can actually put it to use in-game. In one level you are on a starship and you can break out the windows and watch as enemies and objects alike are sucked into the void of space. In another level you can destroy various wooden objects and buildings and watch in amazement as they splinter and crack like real wood.The level design is pretty cool, despite what a lot of reviwers and critics are saying. There are many objects on each level that you can break off of walls or pick up and use as weapons. Tossing exploding barrels or pipes and wires at enemies is a fun aspect that I will never get tired of. Basically you fight your way through a level in linear fashion until you reach a boss. The bosses are always a Jedi, and the difficulty can range from extremely easy to extremely annoyingly hard; depending on who you are fighting. The Force Unleashed also uses QTE (Quick Time Events) during boss battles. Basically a mini game will appear on-screen and you will have to push the corresponding button. These happen at the end of boss fights, Rancor and AT-AT fights. While they are really cool it would have been fun to actually be able to take part in them rathern than just pushing a button and watching.As far as enemies go, there are storm troopers, imperial guards, uggernaughts, Rancors, AT-AT's, AT-ST's, Wookies, Rebel forces, imperial troops, Shadow Troops, Purge Troops etc. Various enemies to battle, bend, flip, throw, shock and maim as you make your way to the final confrontation. Interestingly enough, even though you are an all powerful Sith you will still get your butt kicked, and there are enemies that will be able to resist some of your force powers. Also, the attack timing for some enemies is set just right, so that if you get knocked down they will only fire at you as you are getting up thus knocking you down again and again and again. Can be very frustrating.The graphics are highly polished, and you can tell that LucasArts put a lot of work into them. The Star Wars locations look so good and so much like their cinematic counterparts. Character models are done really well also. Each planet you visit is wonderfully rendered and extremely detailed. I honestly think The Force Unleashed has some of the best looking environments I've ever seen on the Xbox 360. The audio is exceptional. Using classic Star Wars effects and the classic Star Wars soundtrack.Controls are good and bad. While combat and the force powers react with no problem, the targeting system is very horrible and broken. When you are faced with multiple enemies in an area with lots of objects sometimes your targeting system will get confused and you may end up picking up a barrel when you really wanted to pick up an enemy, and vice versa. This gets especially annoying near the end of the game in a very memorable scene that, in my opinion is amazing but utterly ruined due to the poor execution of the targeting system, among other things. Also, the camera can get a bit iffy, sometimes cutting you out of the screen and leaving you prey to off screen enemies. But overall this is not too much of an annoyance. Blocking can be an issue, sometimes it just doesn't work. And supposedly you can counter attacks if you time the block button just right, but it rarely works.The story line is very engaging and really awesome. Since it is official canon in the Star Wars Universe, the minds behind Star Wars put a lot of effort and time into it, and it pays off. Characters are fleshed out and actually interesting, to the point where you really do care about what happens to them. In your journey to eradicate all the remaining Jedi you will cross the galaxy, hopping from one planet to the next. And along the way you will encounter some truly epic plot twists and boss battles. While not as varied as, say Star Wars Knights of The Old Republic, the variety of levels surely suffices for a linear action game. There is one level in particular that is so epic and so awesome that it will surely be remembered as one of the best levels in any Star Wars game.As far as reply value goes, there really isn't any aside from getting all the achievements, plowing through the training missions and beating the hard modes. No multiplayer and no real reason to keep playing again, unless you enjoy flinging stormtroopers to their doom like I do:)Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a very addictive game that offers a great storyline, next generation graphics, classic Star Wars sounds and score, some impressive tech, and the ability to control the force like never before. Limited replay value, some minor camera and controls issues hold this title back from being truly stellar, but I would highly recommend this game.Yet another game that got lambasted and panned by critics and gamers alike (along with Too Human, another great game). Star Wars The Force Unleashed had its own brand of hype machine, the game and the physics engine being hyped for years. And when the game finally hits, many are left with disappointment at the linear structure of the levels and the fact that this game is not the game to end all games. I simply do not get some people, as this game is a great game. It may be lacking in replay value, but it certainly makes up for it with an awesome story, great visuals and fun combat.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}

I'm a huge fan of the Uncharted series and I was expecting Golden Abyss to have the same kind of gameplay as the PS3 titles. While the core of the game remains the same, they added a whole new system of treasure finding and story telling. Instead of picking up random treasures everywhere like in the PS3 versions, Golden Abyss has you collecting story related items that will help unfold the mysteries surrounding the game. In addition to that, Drake has to piece together maps, pictures, flyers, and charcoal rubbings of relics to add to his journal of clues. Drake also uses a camera to take photos of key points in the game, those photos, added to the relics and miscellaneous items will help you fill up the journal and complete trophies. If you really want to get the most of the game you will need to become a real treasure hunter and the people who actually complain about the game being short are simply running past most of it, probably because they're expecting it to be like the PS3 games. For me the addition of actual treasure hunting and collection of information really enhanced the series and I hope that Naughty Dog will keep this format when they're making the next Uncharted title.The only negative comment I have for this game is that compared to the other release titles I bought I was actually not very impressed with the low resolution graphics and the awkward sound effects. Perhaps its because development for the game started pretty early on when the Vita was still being introduced to developers, but I feel like this game isn't pushing the Vita's capacity at all. Still I'm not really bothered enough by it to keep me from loving the hell out of it, which comes to show that graphics are generally just icing on the cake for good games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2012"}

Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"4.5 stars - Definitely the first game of its kind","reviewText":"Metroid(1986). The first Metroid game and only one to appear on the NES.Imagine that it is the year 1986. Nintendo had finally managed to break through the market with Super Mario Brothers the previous year, and it looked to be an uphill climb in greatness for the system. The NES was becoming a household name, and Nintendo was sure to release many more classics which would define the system. Metroid was one of these.Of all the spectacular 2D platform adventure games to be released throughout the last 20 years or so, such as the masterpieces Super Metroid, Castlevania Symphony Of The Night, Rygar, the GBA Castlevanias, Clash At Demonhead, and others, all of them owe their design to the popular original Metroid. While Super Mario Brothers technically invented the 2D action platform genre, and Zelda was a milestone for adventure gaming, up until Metroid there were no games that merged the two genres together. To put it simply, Metroid showed us a large sidescrolling environment with no \"levels\" so to speak, and combined it with items to collect and upgrade your character. For its day this was unheard of.Now I will go through the Positives, the Negatives, and the other Negatives that I consider to be overblown about Metroid...THE POSITIVES:-WELL DESIGNED GAME LAYOUT. Each area that you traverse is filled with lots of pathways, secrets, enemies, and powerups for you to collect. One thing I'm very impressed with for the game back in its day is that it's designed to prevent you from accessing certain areas without the aid of another ability/weapon. It also leaves you to think of ways to bypass some of these obstacles before you have these abilities. Very clever, Nintendo.-VERY DIVERSE ARRAY OF WEAPONS AND ABILITIES. For weapons, you've got the long beam, ice beam, and wave beam, which isn't a whole lot compared to other games, but enough to suit you for this adventure. Your abilities range from a hi jump, to a morph ball, to a protection suit, and to a damaging screw jump attack. Good enough for exploring the inner sanctums of Planet Zebes.-GOOD RANGE OF ENEMIES. While they tend to repeat themselves in different areas of the game, they do come in a variety of types. Most of them are very challenging, some are enough to make you pull your hair out, and others can be avoided altogether.-GREAT DIFFICULTY. This game is not an easy one, and its steep uphill learning curve will be loved and hated by many.THE NEGATIVES-THE ICEBEAM ACQUIRING LATER ON BECOMES FLAWED. What I mean is that every weapon you acquire replaces the one before it, and because of that, once you have your most powerful weapon, the wave beam, you'll be in trouble when you reach the final lair. You need the icebeam again when approaching the end of the game. Some may get frustrated with this aspect.-YOU CAN'T DUCK AND SHOOT! It becomes really annoying early in the game when you don't have the bomb yet and you need to shoot those spikey creatures on the ground and you can't.-THE BOSSES ARE TOO EASY. Well, Mother Brain is a bit tough because of all the stuff shooting at you, but Kraid and Ridley are both a bit disappointing because all you have to do is come close to both of them and just let loose with the missles.Now I'll address the Negatives that people have about the game that I think are just hot air:-THE GRAPHICS ARE OLD. People often say this about the game, but honestly, can you expect anything more from a game that came out in 1986? It works for the time. Though some of the environments can get a little bland in places, it's not that bad.-NO SAVE GAME FEATURE. Again, keep in mind that the year is 1986, and the only game that would've already had this feature is Zelda, which may or may not have come out before this game. The passwords can be tedious, but they save everything.-VERY LITTLE STORY. Once again, 1986. See a common theme here? If you think about it, the original Zelda really didn't have any bigger of a story to it either but nobody complained there. Same thing with Super Metroid. Plus, let's not forget how adding an in-depth story into the gameplay killed the freedom and pacing of Metroid Fusion.-NO MAP FEATURE. While having a map would help, the game isn't really all that intricate compared to Super Metroid, so by not having the map, the challenge factor bumps up and makes the game FEEL larger.Overall, Metroid is a flawed masterpiece, but a masterpiece nonetheless. If you feel like divulging in a historical yet essential classic of the NES, then Metroid should fill the gap nicely. This game already comes as a bonus to both Metroid Prime and Zero Mission, so you might as well save money and play those. While Zero Mission may be a better rendition of the original game, no one can deny the classic sensibilities of this NES shooter. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.Other recommendations:-Any other sidescrolling Metroid title (Fusion, Super Metroid, Zero Mission, Metroid 2)-Any NES Mega Man game-Castlevania Symphony of the Night (PS1) and any of its GBA contemporaries (Circle, Harmony, Aria)-Rygar (NES)-Clash At Demonhead (NES)NOTE: For those who don't know, enter the password:JUSTIN BAILEY------ ------","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"K. Stewart \"Halfnote\"","summary":"Chiller of a Game!!","reviewText":"Wow! Where to start! This game is absolutely one of the best FPS single player adventures of all time.  The graphics are stunningly beautiful all through the game. If this is the Unreal engine as some have said, all I can say is that Unreal never looked near as good as Undying does. The soundtrack of the game will give you chills the way it compliments the game. The load times aren't nearly as bad as some previous reviews make it seem.  Clive Barker has written an amazing storyline for this game and it was extremely well developed.  One of the things that always hurts FPS games is when the storylines are not developed enough. This game is so scary at times, I had chills up and down my spine while I explored the monestary and believe it or not I was scared to go into the dark areas of the monestary. I have never felt like that in any game I have played. I think the Monestary Past level is probably the best rendered level I have ever seen in any game, it was absolutely breathtaking and incredible to explore too. This game is awesome all the way around.  If you haven't played it, don't wait another second. If I had known how good this game was when it first game out, I would have gladly paid full price for it. It's that good!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2002"}

With the PS3 Sony have utilised the motion sensitive gaming whilst keeping the conventionally easy PS3 controller. The SIXAXIS controls of the PS3 pad allow game producers to implement certain motion sensitive aspects to their games, without it becoming too much for those less active gamers.The Dualshock controllers have been a part of the Playstation generation since the beginning and now they have the Dualshock 3. A controller that reacts with vibrations at certain instances within the game. Say if you're using the SIXAXIS while playing a driving game, you're steering the car with the motion sensing turned on, and you collide with a wall. The pad would vibrate with the same level of ferocity of how you hit the wall, in a sense giving you that additional level of realism.The battery life and size are also something I want to touch upon with the wireless PS3 pads. A full charge can literally give you more than 12 hours of solid gaming, and when compared to the wireless XBOX360 pads, the PS3 version is minute. It's light and just generally easy to hold when compared to the bulky and annoying XBOX360 pad.If you have a PS3, you should definitely own a wireless pad.

SWEEEET!!!","reviewText":"Even though I just recently beat the FF Chronicles version (also known as the PSone version) of this classic, I still think this port about as good as that version. While backgrounds are changed and some of the other graphics are replaced with newer ones, this game remains the same otherwise. This port and the PSone port are both great but the great thing is that they both have non-existent load times with battles and character menus (unlike FFV and VI for the PSone because that took about 1-2 seconds) The only problem with this game (in general) is that it's a little tougher than the other 2 SNES games because of the fact that you can get stuck very easily (like if you don't know where you are suppose to go next or if you haven't played it for a long time), Unless you have beaten this game several times, a guide is very recommended. This is one of my favorite FF games of all time (FF 6 is my favorite one in the series and FF8 is my favorite of the PSone era games), The SNES and PSone FF games are (I think) the best ones in the series because of gameplay and story are more of the key of greatness instead of graphics (games are not always good when the graphics are gorgous, I am talking about you, The Bouncer!). If you don't have this classic, I seriously recommend both versions (PSone and GBA) because one has a few advantages than the other (like FF Chronicles has Chrono Trigger and the graphics are different than the GBA version) and the GBA version you can take with you anywhere.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2007"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"JWink","summary":"So far I like it","reviewText":"I received this as a gift and was eager to play it, since I am familiar with BioShock 2... which I thought was decent to play and had some unique twists to gameplay that I hadn't seen before at the time.  I missed the original Bioshock which I heard was better and I was happy to find out that this game comes with the original that I can play and see what I was missing the first time around.What I do like is that the scenery and graphics are very well done and very expansive, different than what I remember from Bioshock 2.  The storyline is intriguing but somewhat confusing at least for me in the initial parts of the game.  And at least in the beginning there is not a lot things going on other than you wandering around and figuring out where you need to go.  Maybe that was intended but a little warm up type tutorial would have been nice especially for those that aren't as familiar with these types of games.  A lack of a map is a negative for me though as I like to explore but I also like to have the ability to figure out where I am going and where I have been, especially since I am not one to play a game day after day until it is complete.  The shooting aspect of the game is a bit of a letdown as I think it is an area where the gameplay could be improved a bit as compared to other shooters of the genre but it does provide some customization that helps that aspect a bit.  I personally hate the long distance aspect of getting shot at without being able to see or figure out where the buttons are flying from.  With that being said, the bad guys seem to be a bit smarter than some of the same genre which is a plus.  A bit more variation in baddies would have helped too.  The ambience/soundtrack does put you into the time frame that it is intended but some of the music gets a bit annoying at times, especially when it is repeating over and over.  Your companion does provide an additional aspect of the game, something the previous BioShocks have done before.  At least for me the second Bioshock had a more eery feel to it that this particular version, not necessarily a bad thing but did add to the atmosphere of BS 2.  I also wish there was a bit more interaction with characters that aren't main players or necessary for continuing the storyline.  Although the individuals walking the streets are having conversations, you for the most part cant interact with a lot of them, unlike those in the Fallout series.  Even if it is a nonsensical conversation that doesn't add to the story, it would have been nice to be able to get some type of reaction when you click to talk to them.Overall, I like the game so far and I am enjoying playing it, even if there are some aspects that I am not crazy about. but this does add to the Bioshock series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","summary":"There's only so much \"nostalgia\" can do","reviewText":"As a stand-alone game, &#34;Ni no Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch&#34; (NnK) is really not bad. As a symbol of a trend in gaming, it's an atrocity.Lots of gamers nowadays are asking for a return of &#34;the good old days&#34; of role playing games. In other words, they want to regress all the advancement the current generation has made and play 100+ remakes of Final Fantasy 6/7. They want to take away the trend of moving towards more action-oriented or tactical games by returning to the real-time, menu-based paradigm of ages past. Even RPGs which have stuck to that route (e.g., FF13) have been criticized as ruining their battle systems by making changes which are, in my opinion, highly innovative. NnK was touted as the &#34;solution&#34; to the problem of innovation. It provided a poorly scaled world map. There were oodles of relatively unrewarding side quests and minigames. The battle system waited a few seconds while animation restrictions of unknowable length played out before performing the action you selected. How wonderful!In the end, though, the game wasn't so bad. The story, art, characters, voiceover, and Pokemon-like monster raising systems were all fairly enjoyable. I still hold issue with the return of the world map and delay-ridden, real-time battle system... these are tedious aspects which don't provide a whole lot to the game. Nevertheless, as much as I hate what the game represents, I can't give it fewer than three stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","summary":"Awesome game 3 1/2 stars","reviewText":"This is my opinion of the game, if you don't like... I don't care.I didn't expect this game to be fun since from the trailer it does look like it's only for kids. When I notice the same art work was done by the awesomeStudio Ghibli (who made my favorite childhood movies like Spirited Away and My Neighbor Totoro)You play as Oliver, a little boy who loses his mother after she rescues him from drowning in a river. After one day of grieving a doll his mother gave him comes to life, the doll name is Mr. Dibby and he tells Oliver he's the King of Fairies (or something like that) whose from Ni no Kuni (Second Country). Dibby needs Oliver's help to get back home but Oliver refuses. Mr. Dibby makes a deal with him, if Oliver helps him get back home then he can help Oliver find his mother. (Ni no Kuni has a spiritual connection to the real world. So basically in Ni no Kuni you have a doppelg&auml;nger) Oliver agrees and both go on adventure to find Oliver's mother but also defeat an evil wizard called Shadar whose causing trouble in Ni no KuniThe reason why I gave this game three and a half is; 1) I decided to listen to the Japanese dub with the English subtitles and I notice (from a few years of watching japanese dub) some of the English words didn't actually match with the Japanese. Then I figured out that the subtitles are only following the English dub script. I don't like that, it kind of pet peeve because The English subtitles should be the right translation to the dub. so I changed it and listen to the English dub. So if you are one of those people who can't stand English dub then suck it up and adjust to reading the semi-wrong English subtitles with the Japanese dub.2) Monsters, I can't stand them. Unless you're levels ahead of them they'll leave you alone but if you're not then they'll chase you and 99% of the time you can't out run them. Don't get me started on dungeons, you literally have to fight every monsters you see. And let's say you ran into a dead end, guess what? Turn back around and you have to fight those same monsters you defeated all over again because they respawn so damn quickly. I wish the dungeon had more puzzles than the monsters. They're EVERYWHERE.  It's alright to battle them when you're moving from town to town but it gets tedious and annoying after awhile. I can't even walk five steps without a monster seeing me and starts attacking. The same thing always happens; I keep battling over, over, and over again (before I even reach to a boss) I'll run out of health items, my useless partner (with the blonde hair) and my useless familiars won't be any help, I'll die then I'll have to start all over again.3) This game doesn't give me that feeling, \"I want to keep playing to see what happens next!\" like everyone else. When I got it, I played it for a couple of days and I took a break. I haven't played it in weeks.4) SO MUCH TALKING. You don't know how many times I skipped conversations in this game because I feel it's meaningless dialogue.OVERALL: This game is okay, I love the music, the story, the characters, and when you play it actually feels like you're on an adventure. I like how the battles are real time instead of turn based (which drives me crazy). It keeps you on your toes, you don't know when your enemy is going to do a powerful attack so you have to ready to switch over to defend quickly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2013"}

You and two friends visit hteir teacher in the hospital, and, just as you all arrive, the world (or at least Tokyo) comes to an end.  In a peculiar version of the rapture, everyone dies and finds themselves in limbo.  Now the various forces at play, demon, ex-human, angel, etc,, start a struggle for the power to create a new world.  And right in the middle of all this is you, converted to a semi-demon, and a pawn in what could very easily be the last conflict.You wander about a post-apocalyptic Tokyo making pacts with demons, enticing those you meet to help you, and tracking down your friends.  Needless to say you do a huge amount of fighting as well.  The battle system is complex because as the game progresses you gain the power to create demons of your own out of those you meet and miscellaneous accessories you can buy.  Then you can develop those you like with their own special talents and spells.  And you, you lucky person, get to add skills and powers by eating magatama, which bear an uncomfortable resemblance to bugs.  Since the demons you meet also have a range of powers, fighting never quite becomes routine.This is a very large game with a long story line.  As you play, you will find that your friends are marching to their own drummers, and that they to are trying to win the power to create a new world.  You can make major decisions about how you want to ally yourself that will effect the entore progress of the game.  The bosses you fight are an imaginative selection of gods and legendary figures, many Japanese, but many others are from quite close to home.  This game has a whole cosmology behind its story line.Despite being no more violent than most RPGs and considerably less sex oriented than many, Nocturne is a very dark story.  It's whether the good guys win or not, but that there really aren't any good guys.  And you start out on the wrong side of the divine ledger, and pretty much stay there.  The real question is how much you want to be in command of your own fate, and this is the first game I know of that addresses that as a story consideration.Another good feature of the game is the large number of puzzles and mazes that make dungeon progress much less boring than a pure hack and slash approach.  Most of the design inventiveness and eye candy awards goes into the huge number of monsters and bosses.  Scenery is adequate, but not breathtaking.  Animation is smooth and player control is quite natural.  And just when you think you've seen everything up comes Dante from Devil May Cry.  Wheee!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2005"}

Take the role of a master of martial arts and recruit followers to your cause in an interactive, living world.Innovative fighting system. Master fighting styles and mystical powers. Jade Empire provides a gameplay experience with the tempo and fury normally found in Hong Kong cinema favorites such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the Bruce Lee classics. As you journey through Jade Empire, you can upgrade your starting combat style or learn entirely new styles to tailor a character for your specific gameplay preferences. Select from dozens of fighting styles, including (for example) martial-arts styles (Legendary Strike, Leaping Tiger), magic styles (Tempest, Dire Flame), transformation styles, and weapon styles (Twin Axes, Staff, and improvised weapons like chairs). Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"Serene Night","summary":"Wonderful!","reviewText":"I'm a female gamer and really enjoyed Jade Empire. The graphics were beautiful the plot compelling and the character models amazing. You play as an orphan raised in the school of your Mentor Master Li. You have everything,(except perhaps romance at least for now ;-0 ), but your life takes a downward turn when one of the students is kidnapped and your master asks you to rescue her.At first I found the gameplay too hard. I'm not a big fan of fighting games preferring games similar to KOTOR. But eventually I got the hang of how to work the keypad.  (I DO however wish there was a general attack button and I was not compelled to hit the \"A\" key constantly to force my character to swing her sword). I also enjoyed some of the NPCS. Dawnstar. Henpecked Hu.

WAY too exorcist for me). =- )Lack of ability to equip multiple henchmen.GHOSTS.

Banjo-Kazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever, The story is really good. A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all. Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her. While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers, Red feathers and Eggs. However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered. While the game does have it's flaws its still really fun to play. The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game, Banjo Tooie. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true. Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have 6 things of air and have to get extra air, from a fish blowing bubbles. The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood. Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me. However the most challenging and difficult part of this game, is beating Grunty herself. That is the most challenging part of this game. because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game. Overall despite it's many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing, and the gameplay is awesome. Buy it you won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2013"}

The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah.

Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is the &#x201C;ultimate&#x201D; Ninja Gaiden, featuring characters from the previous installments that have defined the franchise. It radiates a striking visual appeal in high resolution display, featuring character and environmental graphics whose quality exceeds the original Ninja Gaiden Sigma.&#xA0; Combining both melee and long-range battles against enemies, the game requires skillful and strategic playing to successfully journey through the missions","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Just as difficult yet as fun as ever","reviewText":"As far as action games go, I consider Ninja Gaiden games to be definately the best as far as not only have the controls responsive but delivering an actually fun combat system that, to coin a really old cliche, is easy to learn but hard to master. Well, I wouldn't say easy to learn because one thing people fully well know about Ninja Gaiden is that these games are tough, maddeningly and frustratingly tough at times and more than once you will yell and you will want to throw your controller. Ninja Gaiden Sigma was basically a more HD version of the original and Black from the original Xbox and Sigma 2 is the same thing only it deals with Ninja Gaiden 2 for the Xbox 360. The game hasn't gotten a huge overhaul so much as the occasional re-tooling as far as difficulty, enemy encounters and even certain mechanics but like Ninja Gaiden 2, Team Ninja has a habit of sneaking in things that sour the experience. Not enough to fully ruin the game of course but it does make it a release that's still not as fully perfect as it should despite the second try with Sigma 2.Story: Ninja Gaiden games aren't that well known for their stories and we have a tale concerning the Archfield, a really powerful demon from way back when, Ryu and the Dragon Lineage's ties to it, the Black Spider Clan and the 4 Greater Fiends as well as Sonia, a CIA agent Ryu works with. Unlike the original, Sigma 2 allows 3 new characters to play as in addition to new missions for them: Momiji from Ninja Gaiden: Dragon Sword for the Nintendo DS, Ayane from the Dead or Alive series and Rachel from Ninja Gaiden Sigma.Graphics: The original wasn't really a graphically stunning game but there were certain sections that did stand out but the main draw is the character animation for all the characters from their move lists, special abilities and the Ultimate Techniques where they completely go off on an enemy or 2 (or 3). They're smooth and fluid and just look cool. As for the backgrounds, they're just okay. They're really barren and it's only in certain stages does it really get shown off. As far as slowdown was concerned or framerate dips, I barely saw any though the \"now loading\" screen did pop up quite a bit. One last thing: the gore is still present but it's not as obvious. Meaning when you decapitate an enemy, you will cut off their head but it's not going to be as obvious as it was on the Xbox 360, instead the blood is replaced by purple mist.Sound/Music: Not exactly the most stellar soundtrack but it does its job well though I doubt anyone would wanna buy the OST for it. The voice acting is workable but in games like this or Valkyria Chronicles which add the option to use either English dub or Japanese with subtitles well, I always picked the subs. The sound effects are also quite visceral and the sound the Tonfas make when smacking against the enemies is just awesome but thanks to the changed gore, slices and dices don't have the satisfying kick when you know your moves are really doing damage on people but oh well.Gameplay: Gameplay remains largely unchanged: you get weak and strong attacks with various combos to use (I highly recommend learning the Izuna Drop for each weapon, it'll come in handy a lot), Obliteration techniques where you permanently kill a de-limbed enemy and Ultimate Techniques where you charge up and you can unleash a really powerful attack on an enemy or a group. The on-landings are back (thank god) but the bow UT's are not (boo). One thing that has been changed though is enemy encounters so for example in one level instead of fighting those weird steel fish things they'll be...nothing but then what should've been a simple fight against normal werewolves will have a different fight altogether against something new so it keeps you on your toes since you can't go \"okay this is where those guys show up and....wait, where'd they go?\" and when you least expect, boom, enemies.Certain other things have been altered as well: essence, which is basically your money, is strictly for items like potions, magic-refilling mushrooms and revival scrolls. Your weapon upgrades instead of being tied into essence is free, the change being you can only upgrade one at a time. So no longer can you upgrade 2 handy weapons, you have to choose: upgrade this guy...or that guy? Arrows are now infinite and some boss fights have been altered a bit and there's even some new ones. It was strange fighting a boss and wondering \"why was he so easy?\" and suddenly I get attacked by the Statue of Liberty (and no I'm not kidding) which turned out to be surprisingly hard and I went \"ah, that's why\". Unfortunately, Team Ninja didn't want to completely nerf the game so we have certain bosses that still feel cheap like Momiji going up against 2 guys at once with incredibly powerful attacks and while I thought this game was supposed to fix the move spamming from NG2, 2 bosses in a row literally did their most powerful attacks back to back without any pause.Another big new addition is Team Missions, the co-op aspect of the game where you and computer-controlled AI or an online buddy take on enemies for high scores. It's quite fun and with the ability to play as any of the 4 characters, it's a blast but not really revolutionary for the series and probably won't have big lasting appeal unless you're a high-score seeker. However there's one flaw in this is that you can't filter incoming fight requests by region so you can literally be fighting with a guy from halfway around the world and you're going to have lag like you've never been lagged before. I do have 2 complaints aside from the aforementioned cheapness of some bosses. One is that the camera is still not that dependable and more than once I almost lost because I couldn't see whoever jumped on me because he was offscreen and 2 is that the game for some reason wants you to be on PSN the whole time and if you sign out or your connection briefly goes, it literally cuts you off and brings you back to the title screen so you could be playing on Master Ninja, about to get to a save point and BZZT, your internet connection decides to screw with you and you're sent back to the menu. Unbelievably frustrating this is and a really stupid move on Team Ninja's part.I still consider Ninja Gaiden Sigma to be the most balanced of all the games. If I was terrible at that game it wasn't because of cheap AI or BS attacks or glitchy programming but it's because I needed to improve. Sigma 2 on the other hand is waaaaay more balanced than the original Ninja Gaiden 2 but there's still a couple of moments that stand out as being strangely difficult despite the toned-down difficulty. But if you want that visceral satisfying action, arguably nobody does it better than Team Ninja.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

One way or another you msut own this game.The continuation of the Metal Gear series hits it's 4th chapter in this game that will goe down in history.  You control Solid Snake in this 2 chapter game for chapter 1.  Your primary objective is to get photos of the New Metal Gear Ray.  However when Russian Mercenaries take control it's up to Snake to guarentee that it does not get into their hands.Chapter 2 you control the new guy Rayden.  FOXHOUND has been reformed and he is the first to fully complete their training.  In his first real mission he is sent in to rescue the PResident of the United states from a terroirist trio known as Dead Cell, and from the same Russian Mercenaries found earlier.  Along the way you meet up with Lt. Pliskin, Mr. X, Emma Emerich and Stillman all of whom help you on your mission.  Meanwhile the rumor of an even more powerful Metal Gear looms on the Horizon.What makes this game so incredible is it's accuracy and enjoyment factor that make sthis hours of fun.  For example you can hold up guards and steal their dog tags (for bonus items), once held up you can torture them....Another cool factor is the ability that for once you don't have to kill the guards, you can get a tranquilizer gun and shoot them with that so you don't inadvertadly alert the guards.  Depending on where depends on how effective and how long.Over all this is one fo those games that in the end everyone needs to hold in their library.

Stanley \"Viper_29\"","summary":"The third time is the charm...","reviewText":"I have been able to play and beat each and every one of the Splinter Cell games. The original set such a high mark for the successors to meet with it's realistic graphics and tense storyline. The second came in with an unbelievable multiplayer experience that was unheard of at the time. Now, with Chaos Theory, all of those wonderful qualities are back and better than ever.In this newest game to the series, you once again take on the role of Sam Fisher, a wisen and extremely efficient character the can't seem to enjoy the laxed lifestyle of retirement. This latest series of spy laden adventures has Sam traveling to more remote and exotic locales that look better than anything offered before. I must say that I have Chaos Theory for my Xbox and my laptop. I run a Alienware 5500 with a ATI 9700 video card, and the Xbox isn't lagging too far behind in quality to my laptop. That says a lot for what Ubisoft has been able to do with the Xbox. While the game still plays in a linear fashion, you now have multiple paths that you can take to accomplish your missions. You won't ever have to worry about getting lost in a level and not knowing where to head from your position.Sam has a few new moves that are a joy to watch and execute. As nice as this is to be added to the game, you are restricted in where you can employ these new moves. A new weapon that Sam uses is his combat knife. This will aid in stealth kills and also allow you to cut fabric in certain locales within the levels. There are also new additions to the combat rifle that enables it to fit a shotgun and a sniper shot style to it, although during my first go around in the game I didn't use them, so I can't say how well they add to the game. The graphics are definitely polished and have niceties about them that add to the realism. One example will have you in the early part of the game walking thru a level that is exposed to adverse weather. Sam will change in appearance from \"wet\" when he is in the rain to \"dry\" when he seeks shelter. It is a nice touch to see the look of the characters reflect the environments like this.Now, for the truly best part of this game, the COOP play. As of now, there are 4 levels in which you can play COOP. Hopefully, Ubisoft will add more for download thru Live in the near future. COOP will have you and a friend, either thru Live, Split screen or multiple Xbox's connected thru LAN, you can play levels that are stragically created to allow for the COOP in that you cannot move past certain points of the levels without a partner to help. You can stand on their shoulders to get an unobstructive view, you can also use each in a form of a human ladder to reach a upper landing. Clearly a wonderful addition to the series and a definite genre buster. The Versus mode is for the most part unchanged from Pandora Tomorrow. The mercs will have a few new moves to help counter against spies chokeholds that were abundant during Pandora Tomorrow gameplay.One other little nicety and extra realism to the game with multiplayer allows for the NPC's (non playable characters) to hear you thru the Live communicator if you speak too loud and come investigate. If you were a fan of the first two, you will love this game without a doubt. If you are new to the series, 30 minutes and you will have the basics down with the controls of this game. Ultimately, this game offers great replay value thru the linear, yet multiple path single player campaign, and thru the return of the wonderful multiplayer and exciting COOP game play styles. Definitely worth the money to buy, and at the very least worth a rental to check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2005"}

I'm really enjoying playing this. Darn, it looks great and plays like a dream. It's not some quantum leap forward in terms of gameplay and graphics, but I would call it something of a move forward. However, I was aware before I bought this that it didn't have a single player campaign, and I think that this just cries out for it, especially if Microsoft and EA expect this game to be the biggest selling point for the Xbox One. Don't forget guys, there are some of us who much prefer a single player campaign. Then again, and to illustrate my indecisiveness about this review, it's a whole lot of fun anyway and I hope that EA wait a long, long time before doing there usual trick of pulling down the game servers, something they have hit people with far too many times.At that point, this game becomes nothing more than a drinks coaster. In the end though, I'm happy with my purchase, having a ball playing this, but I can't help but think this should have been single player also.Era defining? Well no .... A great, fun experience? definitely.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0047TG2R0","description":"","reviewerName":"Laura Lambert","summary":"I actually thought it was great!","reviewText":"I was very worried when I read the reviews for this game...I was a late bloomer when it came to this series, having played the first one only this past April. I had read so many critical reviews of this sequel that I was afraid the whole series would be ruined for me, but I'm so glad now that I bought this game (I got it used on this site for only 22 dollars, but I feel it would have been worth the 60 bucks anyway!).Yes, the maps are reused ridiculously. I almost considered giving this game 4 stars just because of that, but when I weighed all the other aspects of it, I realized that it didn't matter that much to me. At least there were always sacks and crates and chests and the like to loot every time. I enjoyed switching the city from day to night because even if I'd already explored the entire city during that \"time period,\" there were often new quests or enemies to fight if I'd comb over the areas again.I thought the graphics were so much better in this game than the first one! This game was actually a joy to look at. I have HD for my Xbox 360 so I don't know what it looks like on a regular TV, but it looked great on mine. The voice acting was also very well done, as was the character development. Story-wise, I also enjoyed it. Sure, I found the idea of the Blight fascinating in the first game, but maybe I'm just a nerd...I enjoyed the politics and twisted storyline that this game holds. I know it's a good game when I actually feel for the characters and feel the need to stand up for certain races in the game.I didn't mind so much that you couldn't equip your party members with as much as you could in the first. I also think there were still PLENTY of quests that made the game interesting. I plugged in about 50 or 51 hours into my first playthrough, and that was without playing on the hardest difficulty or leaving the game on to walk away for awhile and then come back. Sure, the first game without the DLC gave me about 30 more hours than that, but for me it was pretty satisfying. I thought Mass Effect 2 was great and long, and with all the DLC that still only gave me 46 hours.This game also has replayability because I'm eager to start it again as a different class and side with opposite allies and romances this time, just like in the first one. I enjoyed the combat a lot more in this one too; it was a lot faster and there were some pretty epic special attacks. Lots of button mashing, sure, but that can get addicting in itself and it's fast paced enough to stay interesting.A few times my xbox sounded like it was gonna blow up while loading things in this game, but it could be that I just have an old box. There were also only a few instances where the game kind of froze and I had to reload, but that's forgivable in my book. Some have said that there's a feeling of being \"trapped in town\" but although you spend the majority of your time there, I didn't find it so stressful because it was big enough and plenty of quests.I think that people who loved the first game shouldn't be afraid to try this one. I went into it expecting to be disappointed, and I found myself pleasantly surprised and immersed in the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2011"}

All you get is 3 activations before having to call EA Tech Support and beg for an extra one. So even though you are paying for it, you don't actually own your copy of the game. This is even worse than StarForce. At least with StarForce I could install and play the game without being connected to the internet.Basically it means that you can NOT install the game when you want, or where you want. While pirates enjoy a painless gaming experience, all fair usage rights are removed from us paying customers. The whole online activation process is very inconvenient; especially in the future when the activation servers WILL go down, or when you will want to install the game on a computer that's not connected to the internet. I guess this is how EA likes to thank their paying customers.Oppose this oppression of our fair usage rights (yes it sounds cheesy, but obviously that's exactly what EA's intentions are).

It really feels like a good movie.-----------------------------------------------------------GRAPHICS:Seriously the BEST looking faces in a video game eveer, very realistic face textures. Nice lighting, gives you the feeling as if you are watching a movie. Very detailed surroundings and buildings. Clothing looks most of the time very good. Some items look really good, and some are seriously very bad looking, such as a napkins or paper.-----------------------------------------------------------SOUND:Superb voice acting!.Very nice, orchestral music, it really helps giving you the mood depending on the situation.(not that I actually payed any attention to the music lol)alsoo something that I really liked is that the game gives you the option to choose the language and subtitles you want it on.-----------------------------------------------------------ANIMATION:Characters faces and bodies move realisticly thanks to motion caption, though hands seem to be a bit off sometimes, a good example is like when people clap. (seriously looks very crappy lol). Ohh also I noticed and I'm sure other players did also, that clothing movement looks very odd, when a character is wearing it looks very good, but not when they are moving it such when they change their clothes.----------------------------------------------------------EXTRAS:There really aren't many extras in this game (well atleast not in the US version). You have some clips to watch and a few drawings, and that's about it.----------------------------------------------------------CONTROLS:I really liked the quick time event thing, but I have to say that the game developers really screw up in how they made the characters to move, you have to use your annalog stick to choose were you want to move, but you need to press R2 to actually start moving. Infact that isn't that bad until you are in a small space or with a bad camera angle and your character starts to move like stupid.---------------------------------------------------------DIFFICULTYSuper easy, I never died even though I used the hardest mode.And I actually suck at playing games lol.In this game you will never get lost, or get to a point were you don't know what to do next. It's kinda linnear gameplay, but you choose the path you want to take.-----------------------------------------------------GAME DURATION:Seriously, this was a huge dissapointment for me, such a greaat gamee with awesome story, but supeer short!It is the only game I've ever finished on the ps3, and I finished in only ONE day, I mean come oon, all this time wating for this game to come out to finish it in only one day u_u.-----------------------------------------------------TECHNICAL ISSUES:I noticed a few bugs during gameplay such as sound being clipped or being offsync sometimes. Two times the game froze completely and had to hard reset my ps3. A few save issues, that when I continued a saved file it wouldn't start, or it would leave my character out of the map literally forcing me to restart the game.Probably they will make patches later on; well, atleast that's what I hope so..-----------------------------------------------------REPLAY VALUE:It is pretty high, well only if you want to get the platinum trophy.-------------------------------------------------------CONCLUSION:I really liked this game, most of it because of the story which sucks you in. If you like great story telling like me, then you should GET THIS GAME. If you hate short games DO NOT GET THIS GAME lol cause it will piss you off when you finish the game under 12 hours even though you didn't rushed through the game and you interacted with every single thing you could in the game.It really is a movie...or game whatever..

Almost undoubtedly, many PS2 owners will overlook this game, thinking it's simply kid's stuff. Well, know now that Sly Cooper is the most original game to come along in quite awhile, and for kids and adults alike, it's one of the best titles out there, hands down. Everything, from gameplay to presentation, is perfect, and it's truly a rewarding gaming experience.The game is a typical 3D platformer, with the hero, Sly Cooper, master thief, trekking through various locales in hopes of restoring the five pieces of his \"Thievius Raccoonus\", his family's great book of stealing. The book was torn apart by the group known as the Five Fiends, and now, it's up to Sly and his buddies to overcome the villians and steal what is rightfully theirs.The graphics are splendid, taking full command of the PS2's capabilities with gorgeous -- and fitting -- cel-shading. The voice-acting, while a little hokey, has its moments, but the real prize of the game is its overall presentation. From opening credits to cut-scenes, Sly Cooper weaves a fun, truly original tale that can only beg for more sequels.The gameplay is precise, with Sly a cinch to control. A quick tutorial mission acts as the first \"stage,\" so novice gamers will have no problems figuring out how to make Sly climb, jump, swing, and do other marvelous things with his unique cane. Special \"Super Sneaky\" moves are available with a simple press of a button, and special techniques can be unlocked by finding \"clues\" (bottles) throughout the levels. These special techniques are fun to use and add some flavor to the game, but they're not necessary to complete your missions.With colorful characters, memorable villains, rewarding gameplay, rich graphics, and a terrific story, Sly Cooper should find its way onto your PS2 soon.

The storyline is very confusing, and the backtracking is tedious and ridiculous. Nothing is explained in the beginning to let you know that you need certain items found in the beginning to get past points later on! The game also requires you to ditch some items you've found in the beginning! I would have been so mad if I would have not cheated.

I assure you that this is not coming from just another fanboy.  In fact, after playing the first game and loving it, I played the second one and was a little jaded by the bioshock experience as I reached the end of the game.  I still loved the second one but it wasn't as impactful as my experience with the first game.I say this because when I heard a third one was being made I was skeptical since I didn't know how they could make the bioshock experience feel fresh.  I thought the experience would just grow stale this time around.  So, going into this game with that attitude I wasn't really planning on having my mind blown.Well, it wasn't just blown. My mind was strapped to a rocket, shot into the stratosphere and detonated.  Everything about this game is just brilliant! This is an extremely well crafted game with only very minor flaws.  Everything from the gameplay, music, voice acting, setting, visuals, etc. has been created with so much care and attention that it's staggering.This is especially true for the story.  This is one of the best stories I have experienced.  Not only does the ending redefine the beginning moments of this game, but it also adds a new layer to the franchise as a whole.  It's truly amazing and something you have to experience.I get very frustrated when I read and hear that this isn't a true bioshock game.  I don't understand that accusation one bit. This definitely felt like a bioshock game to me in the best ways possible.  This is just a bioshock injected with fresh ideas. Ideas that created for me the same amount of awe and wonder the first bioshock did.  Ideas that perfectly fit within the bioshock franchise.  Explaining this would spoil the game.

It's an RPG of a dying breed. Your character is silent, the lore is extensive, and success only comes about after trial, error, and numerous deaths. A game that all but demands that you invest yourself emotionally and fill your character's shoes as much as possible. It follows the classic D&D; tradition that few games submit to these days (not even DRAGON AGE II will be in the same vein) and a masterful story that only the good writers at BioWare could deliver.If you haven't had a chance to play this game, start with this \"Ultimate Edition.\" No question about it. DA:O is certainly good enough as is, but BioWare released a series of add-ons since its release that aren't quite worth the price tag they were given. This collection, on the other hand, is a great deal. Buying DA:O, its \"expansion,\" and every piece of DLC at release would have cost you a grand total of $160. Unacceptable and insulting, especially considering the quality of some of the DLC. On the other hand, the cost for the \"Ultimate Edition\" is a fine price for you to enjoy the heck out of DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS, and make up your own mind about the add-ons without conflict.NOTE: The package includes two discs. The first contains only DA:O, while the second is an installation disc for the add-ons. You WILL have to install the DLC from the second disc to play them. They're not terribly big files, but people with limited HD space should take this into account.-DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS (5/5 Stars): In my old Amazon review, I gave this game 4/5 stars because of its difficulty, but that was nearly a year ago...and I'm still playing. If the sheer amount of content doesn't keep you playing, then maybe the fact that merely playing as a character of a different gender will dramatically change the way the story progresses. You will never play the same game twice. This is fantasy fiction at its best, and one of the best fantasy RPGs in years and years.The writing is great, the lore is perhaps TOO detailed, and the characters are extremely likable. If you love in-depth or classic RPGs that stay away from modern trappings, this is the game for you. Perhaps one of the LAST games for you.(The DLC reviews are in the order I think they should be played for full enjoyment. The first three, you should play before you complete the game.)-THE STONE PRISONER (3/5 Stars): The quest itself is largely uninteresting, but it unlocks a new party member, Shale. It's a well-written character to be sure and is sure handy in a fight, but don't expect to get a ton out of its backstory.-WARDEN'S KEEP (4/5 Stars): This has a nice little storyline that's only about an hour in length (as is most of the DLC). You are tasked with helping a descendant of a Grey Warden clear his family's name. To do so, you must clear out a place called Soldier's Peak, which, afterward, will grant you a place to store your goods. For the impulsive looter, this is a gift, though I think it should have been a part of the actual game. Having a guy in your camp asking you to buy Xbox Live content doesn't do much for immersion.-RETURN TO OSTAGAR (5/5 Stars): This one worked so well on account of its emotional significance to me. Ostagar is The Place where your adventure begins, where you become a Grey Warden, and lose quite a bit. To come back to it was a heart-wrenching experience. It won't take you very long to hack through it, but the items that you can find throughout have great meaning, and the ending brings with it a satisfying sense of closure.-DRAGON AGE: AWAKENING (4/5 Stars): Without the outrageous $40 price tag attached to it, you can now enjoy this in full confidence. This is a 13-15 hour adventure through the Arling of Amaranthine, which will give you new locations, party members, armor, and an opportunity to rule over the land. It's definitely the best out of all the add-ons, but it probably won't sync up very well with your ending from ORIGINS, which is definitely a downer. And the ending was a bit rushed for my taste.-GOLEMS OF AMGARRAK (3/5 Stars): I liked the idea of my Warden answering a call for help, but I DREADED going back to the Deep Roads again. AGAIN! There are other places to explore in Ferelden, BioWare...Anyway, this wasn't bad, but there just wasn't much to it. You explore an old dwarven thaig, uncover a few ancient secrets and fight a boss. If it takes you more than two hours to complete, I'd be surprised (that goes for most of the DLC).-WITCH HUNT (4/5 Stars): The infamous Morrigan romance. If you felt it didn't end the way you'd expected in ORIGINS, here's your chance to get that feeling back again. The story takes place a little over two years after the end of ORIGINS, and your Warden is searching for Morrigan (your intentions, good or ill, are up to you). There's quite a bit of lore to be found here, some humor from your party members, and it provides you with enough foreshadowing to make you remember DRAGON AGE II is right around the corner. Beyond that, Witch Hunt is little more than a fine way to kill an hour, but I liked it. NOTE: This DLC will pretty much serve as the end of your Warden's story until DA2, so plan accordingly.-LELIANA'S SONG (2/5 Stars): This DLC didn't serve much of a purpose to me. Leliana told her story sufficiently enough in ORIGINS; there was just no reason to play through it. It actually made her character all the more confusing because it doesn't really give you a good, meaningful reason as to why she joined the Chantry. It almost makes it sound like she joined \"just because.\" Way to take a neat story and make it boring. Also, the almost French accents were terribly annoying and poorly done here.-THE DARKSPAWN CHRONICLES (1/5 Stars): Another pointless piece of DLC. It basically shows what would happened if you, the Warden, had never been found. You command a Hurlock and a party of other Darkspawn through the final battle, killing all of the Warden's companions along the way. This would have been a neat little \"what-if?\" story, but there is absolutely no voice-work here. Not one word, so it just amounts to an hour of killing things with no real purpose. And all the locations are recycled, let's not forget that.So, in closing, I do want to reiterate my love for this game and how much of a true RPG experience it is. BioWare might have gone a little crazy with the DLC, but this is a truly great package when everything is said and done. This is my second time buying DA:O (my copy was throughly abused and broken after my friend and I were done with it), and it was my first time playing and of the add-ons with the exception of AWAKENING. I had a lot of fun, despite the questionable quality of a few of them.This really is as good as it gets. And judging by the current \"simplified, modern, give-a-voice-to-the-main-character\" trend in RPGs, this may very well be one of your last opportunities to enjoy a game inspired by the classics of the genre.See you at the Joining, Warden.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00D96BNGM","description":"","reviewerName":"Koala1356","summary":"Comfortable, sounds great, but lacks documentation. Transmitter positioning critical.","reviewText":"I was excited to try the Phantom headset by Turtle Beach on my Xbox 360, but I ended up with it on my Xbox One instead. TB includes no less than six different cables and adapters for various hookups... except the one I needed for my original Xbox 360.  If you have an Xbox 360 slim or E model with a digital (SPDIF) output, then you'll probably be in good shape.  But if you have an older model with the hard drive mounted externally (no SPDIF), then you'll need something called an Xbox 360 Audio Adapter (sold separately), like this one:Turtle Beach Ear Force Audio Adapter Cable for Xbox 360The included instructions are absolutely zero help, if you actually need information with a setup that doesn't use the SPDIF connection.  Example, there are red/white RCA inputs on the back of the transmitter, but no mention whatsoever about how to setup this connection, or why/when you'd even want to try. I downloaded the .pdf manual hoping for more detailed information, but it too fails to impart anything useful to the customer regarding setup or the headset's functions.For example, please tell me what the multitude of buttons on the headset actually do, rather than just repeat a list of the labels that are printed on the earcups.  Same goes for the included cables and adapters.  There is more information printed on the plastic bag they ship in than what is written in the included setup guide or the downloaded manual.  My headset light is flashing blue--what does that mean?  I don't know, because neither the included setup guide nor the downloaded manual mentions it.Failing my Xbox 360 hookup attempt, I turned to the Turtle Beach website and discovered that the Phantom is (allegedly) compatible with the Xbox One, which does have a SPDIF out.  So this hookup seemed a lot more straightforward--XB SPDIF out to SPDIF in on the transmitter, and XB USB out to DC in on the transmitter.  After charging the headset via its USB charge cable (which incidentally, turns the headset 'on' whenever it's connected, so you can't turn the headset 'off' while it's charging), I had no sound at all.  I figured that was my fault, but by now the included user guide and the downloaded .pdf were in the trash.Through trial and error, I discovered a little slide wheel on the underside of the headset that's labeled \"Game Sound.\"  This is separate from the \"Volume\" control buttons, but turning this up enabled me to hear sound through the headset!  Joy!  Again, the manual could have mentioned this little nugget of information and saved me time and a headache by informing me that there's a difference between \"Game Sound\" control and \"Volume\" control.  Who knew?Unfortunately, my joy was short lived.  While TB claims the Phantom to be compatible with the Xbox One, if you want to do more than just listen (ie: chat) then you'll need your Kinect to handle the outgoing audio part.  That's right, you can't use the headset's microphone to chat on an Xbox One.  Yet.  At the time of this review, there is talk/debate about an adapter that allegedly in the works for 2014 which will enable you to use the headset microphone for chat.  Until then, you're stuck with the Kinect for the chat part, which means the people you're playing with will hear what's going on in the entire room in addition to what you're saying.But for solo gameplay or watching movies, this wireless headset is absolutely the best.  The Phantom headset is very well made--you can feel the quality the first time you lift if from the box--and extremely comfortable to wear for long periods.  In fact, this is probably the most comfortable headset I have ever used.  They sound great too, and with the positional Surround Sound, you can micro-adjust it to suit your own tastes.  I'd like to know what all the other buttons do too, but... you know, that \"no help\" manual thing again. The on-board voice prompts from \"Call of Duty: Ghosts\" is pretty cool.  It says things like \"Powering Off\" or \"Game Mode One\" (whatever that is).  There's configuration software you can download, and then connect the headset to your computer and customize these too.If there was one thing I would say could be improved about the Phantom headset then it would definitely be to include a better written user guide--like one that actually covers the headset's many cool features, multiple hookups, and the basics of how to use it.  In hindsight, this all seems simple enough, but if you're not a techie, then you might find the available documentation about as helpful as if it were written in Latin.  Until such time TB produces said detailed, helpful user guide, you're pretty much stuck with trial and error and figuring things out for yourself.UPDATE: Jan 20, 2014.  I have a negative to add to my review, and I am deducting a star for it. Like most people, I am limited to where I can position the transmitter from my Xbox because of the length of the SPDIF cable.  My Xbox also sits within close range of my wireless router (about 6 feet from the headset transmitter).  Whenever I try to charge or use the headset (ie when the transmitter is ON), I completely loose my internet connection because the transmitter overpowers my router signal. Thus, I can only use/charge the headset OR be online.  I can't do both simultaneous.  Pretty useless if you're trying to play while actually using the headset.  You might say, \"move your router\" or \"use Ethernet not wireless\" which would be the logical solution for some, I am sure, but neither is an option for me.  This is a huge dysfunction of this expensive headset that needs to be noted.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

The number of people who claim that this is the best game they've ever played lead me to wonder...what other games they've played.Still, there is a very undeniable charm in this one that is hard to put your finger on, but there nonetheless. It makes for a tough job to even review the game, let alone play it. I've been a fan of FROM Software's \"King's Field\" Series from the ground floor, and this game shares much with that series, but it certainly isn't like that. It's CERTAINLY not like the RPGs you are accustomed to (either American or Japanese), but there's still some nuances from those games that appear as well (and I'm not talking simply about the levelling/grinding aspects). But anyway, here goes:The Good:1) Atmosphere - Another reviewer used the word \"personality\" to describe this, and it's almost perfect as a metaphor. This game has personality. The worlds have a unique character. The enemies run the gamut from cute to cool to horrifying (however, they are all mostly difficult). You are constantly on your toes, never knowing if around that next corner lurks an enemy that is 1000x stronger than any you've faced previously (if you think I am being hyperbolic, you are wrong). I can't count the number of times I've actually gone to the end of my chair in anticipation and fear.2) Combat - while there are problems, overall the combat engine is solid. Different weapons play VERY differently. There is a vast difference between using a spear, a straight sword, a curved sword, or a mace (to name but a few). Spells have advantages and disadvantages. Overall, balance is good here. If you lose a battle (and you will lose many), for the most part, the fault is yours, not the games. There are exceptions, but combat feels...right, for the most part.3) Bosses - I can't stress enough - you feel a sense of accomplishment when you beat one of the game's many bosses. When you stare down the giant Tower Knight, or come face-to-face with the Flame Lurker (who are merely major demons, by the way, and not the monstrous arch-demons you'll fight later), you realize that this isn't a battle you're going to win by simply slashing away. You're going to have to think, and when you beat them, you'll heave that sigh of relief (if not bellow a cheer of victory).The Bad:1) Camera - I wanted to like the camera, but the biggest problem is this: the lock-on function is controlled by the same stick as the camera. Thus, if you try to lock on to a single enemy during a multi-enemy battle, the camera becomes mostly inoperable, as you will simply change the enemy on which you are locked. It would have been much better to make lock-on the LS button (which is instead used for the completely-useless shield push), and have the right stick devoted to the camera. There are other issues as well, but this is the biggest.2) Cheap tactics - OK, I said above that combat was mostly fair. This only serves to make the instances in which it is not vastly more frustrating. An attack which wasn't hurting you before will suddenly pummel you for no good reason (e.g. the \"lightning bolts\" of the storm beasts will...start hurting you through walls, for no good reason). Moreover, the dark demeanor of the game is great for mood, but really bad when you have to cross small bridges in the wall. The unfair platformer elements (which there are precious few) are just stinky. \"Oh, that bridge that looked solid gave way under my feet for no reason, and now I'm dead!\" This game is difficult enough as it is - there is no reason to cheapify things further.3) Story - What a miss. This might be the biggest problem with the game. It is clear that there is a good story lurking here. I can understand that, in a solo venture, it's not reasonable to have tons of characters with whom to talk and flesh out the story. So, why not use a codex, a la \"Dragon Age\"? There are literally HUNDREDS of dead bodies in the game. Would it have been so hard to put...journals on some of them? Stolen documents? \"King's Field\" for the PS2 did a great job of this. It is a damn shame that it is missing here.So, in short: this isn't the perfect game, and more than likely, this isn't going to be the best game you've ever played. At many times, it's a frustrating exercise in level grinding and equipment building. I did in fact throw my controller once. But I can't deny that this game constantly brings me back. It is one of the first games that I feel like I have accomplished something when I succeed.I have not commented on the multi-player aspects, because I am a solo player. I hear it is excellent, however, but you'll have to read about it elsewhere. Happy gaming!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2009"}

Honestly, it felt like the game designers were just really lazy, and swapped \"crappy game controls\" for \"this is a really hard game for hard-core gamers.\"  The \"clues\" others can leave (don't forget, this is really an \"online experience!\") are fairly useless at least 50% of the time.I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because there really is potential here.

The storyline is about Spyro and his dragon fly companion who want to go to the beach, but instead get caught up in trying to stop an evil villain named Ripto and have to retrieve fourteen talismans to stop Ripto and save many worlds in the process. This game may revolve around killing stupid enemies, finding items, and collecting a lot of jewels, but it never really feels repetitive, mostly just fun and over the top because of your strange companions and enemies. The biggest problems with this game are the graphics, controls, and camera troubles, which can get you killed during certain gameplay sequences. But while this may sound like a long list of complaints, this game never really feels hampered by its flaws, but rather fun that anyone can enjoy if they appreciate it enough. Too bad the series seems to suck with critics these days, ever since the time Insomniac Games and Sony Computer Entertainment officially sold the rights of the series to Vivendi (a.k.a. Sierra). Hey Vivendi, can you get a developer who's good at making games to make the next entry so the series doesn't suck anymore? Because it really doesn't deserve it. This game will always be a fun platformer and while it may not compete with other platformers of its time like Super Mario 64 and Tomb Raider, it does put up a good fight despite its age.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I094AC","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Fox Flies Again","reviewText":"Hard to believe that it has been 15 years since Nintendo unveiled the N64 game system, which revolutionized how we see games, in the richest graphics around. No question about Nintendo and the joy they've made so many gamers all around who've loved Super Mario 64 and The Legend Of Zelda: The Ocarina Of Time, it really is a time for Nintendo gamers to celebrate. But it also has been awhile since Nintendo came out with a driven Star Fox game. It feels like the series with Fox McCloud and company with Slippy, Falco and Peppy had lost a lot of way with gamers. After the lackluster performance of Star Fox Adventures and Star For Assault (which I personally enjoyed on the Nintendo Gamecube,) many wondered why there is no Star Fox game set for the Wii, but there is one now for the Nintendo 3DS. This one though is a nice blast from Andross' past.Star Fox 64 3D for the Nintendo 3DS, brings back all the action from the classic Nintendo 64 game. Yet, nearly 15 years after it debuted, it still feels just like yesterday seeing the madness and mayhem as Fox and company go after the vulgar Andross from invading and destroying the Lylat system. The gameplay feels strong and well, as Fox and company battle through 15 planets and satellites to try and defeat Andross and his foes including the Star Wolf team, villianous bosses like the Sector X robot, and a series of tracking missles set to destroy the Great Fox aircraft in Sector Z. Everything from the original Star Fox game has been brought back to the new Nintendo 3DS well.What is new to the game that can be a bit shaky is the new 3DS control scheme. Like Star Fox Command from the Nintendo DS era, it can be more frustrating at times to maintain for those who've mastered the game before. Thankfully, you can play only the control pad and traditional N64 scheme which works much better for die hard fans from the past, as well as new gamers. But aside from that, the game looks great re-designed for the 3DS. Nintendo did a good job making it look better than before like they did with The Legend Of Zelda: Ocarina Of Time 3D, taking the N64 legend to a new generation of fans.The music sounds good as well, by keeping a new take on the score and voice acting from the original game to its core and no re-scripting the game. The multiplayer does add a few wrinkles with handheld gaming, but not really anything that makes it feel different against gamers than what the gameplay was before.Overall, Star Fox 64 3D is a good reboot of why the Nintendo 64 had great games, and bringing this game back to the core for those who own the Nintendo 3DS. It is a good game from start to finish, but not anything fresh and new for veterans of the original game. Still, it is nice to see another classic deliver well to a new audience of gamers. If you've played the game before, whether it is from the Wii because of the virtual console download or owned the N64 edition, Star Fox 64 3D is  worth a try. If you are new to the Star Fox games, it also is worth the arwing flight.Graphics: B+Sound: BControl: B+ for N64 control scheme, C for 3DS motion gameplayFun & Enjoyment: B for solo play; B- for multiplayerOverall: B","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWZHS","description":"","reviewerName":"Jon","summary":"Began slow and glitchy, ended too fast but exciting, reminded me of The Unit","reviewText":"**Quick Addition April 2014 - one last thought**Now that the news has been out for awhile that this game was an unfortunate commercial failure and the series has been benched, I hope EA will not just permanently give up on the brand, but rather look at how boring and generic all these \"modern/future warfare\" games are becoming, and bring back the WW2 era games.  Medal of Honor was GREAT with those.  All of them, with each having its particular low points but also high points.  I would think with a few years now of constant quickly-becoming-mindless modern/future warfare games being shoved down our throats, gamers might be hungry again for games with historical value again.  I remember I believe the very first Medal of Honor game had a level where the gamer had to combat Nazis destroying art - even historically-accurate levels like that one are impressive in hindsight.Ultimately, this game is still more original and fun then I frankly and honestly found Call of Duty: Ghosts to be (both offline and online), but EA just doesn't have half the marketing campaign the Call of Duty people have, unfortunately.  I hope EA gives the Medal of Honor games another chance.  Maybe more WW2 games, or try other less-used historical conflicts.  And with much better advertising campaigns!Bottom-line with the April 2014 Addition: At the current varying prices of this game (seems to generally be under $15, I paid $5 new when I re-bought it this month), I believe you will be amazed at the game you get for that price.**End of Addition, Begin Original LONG Review**First, since I think I wrote an actual novel about this game, I will begin with: I love the Medal of Honor series, I have owned at one time or another all of the Medal of Honor series from the Playstation 1 to current, but I would say do not pay more than $40 for this game.For some reason Medal of Honor has always been a brand I have been a huge fan of.  This, Medal of Honor: Warfighter (\"MOH:W\" from here on out), is the second of their modernizing the series to present day.  As with the previous MOH game, simply \"Medal of Honor,\" MOH:W was very short in the one player game, but the storyline became riveting enough I felt like I was basically playing multiple episodes of the now-canceled CBS show, The Unit.Main Cons: Length of game, slow start to game, glitches near beginning, headshots difficult to get, cost of FPS games for length.The main gripe I had for the first few levels was how slow and ambiguous it all began with the storyline.  And before that, as the game began, I had the misfortune of initially not being connected to the internet at the time, so from what I have heard around the internet that was a BAD mistake.  You will want to make sure to download the automatic patch/update before playing.  One of the early ways this helped was with a sniping portion of a level, and while I figured out what I needed to do, it wasn't until I had internet again that I could actually pass the part after installing the update.Besides that, a really bad glitch was near the beginning of the game (the 3rd level, \"Shore Leave\") right before you are supposed to control the robot.  The first time I somehow fell through the level a couple times such that I was running around behind the buildings with no way back to where I was supposed to go.  Then when I played through a second time too (after having erased all data before restarting) in the exact same spot the game just would not progress - they didn't mention the robot and the guys just stay there, waiting, so you have to restart the checkpoint.  I found that to ensure progression you have to follow all the guys, then drop down to the right by the fire, and that makes it so the game doesn't seem to glitch there.  Pretty bad.I had headshots on guys who apparently did not get programmed with the memo that when you get headshot you go down and die.  And the non-EASY automatic aim took a bit of getting used to.  It makes you realize how much with certain other brands (COD) they let you basically just press the aim/sights button and you immediately are aimed right at an enemy.  The weapons you have are easy enough, but it takes getting a tad used to - to switch between a zoomed sight and the regular sight you have to aim first, then press the switch button which seems strange to me.My next gripe is more of a general gripe about FPS these days.  I don't think these games are worth paying $60 at all.  As I have also said clearly in the past, I do not care whether a game is MOH, COD, or any other popular brand, I only care whether it is well-made, fun, and worth the money.  That said, I think Call of Duty 3 and 2 were both worth the money, since in addition to the regular campaign mode - WHICH WERE fairly LONG - and whatever online stuff, they also had actual offline co-op multiplayer and those were actually fun.  Past Medal of Honor games for the PS2 and PS1 were plenty long compared to other similar games out around the same time.  Killzone 3 was worth $60 to me because of the features and aspects it had.  This game, no matter how solid it was, was just too short with not enough features for ME, to be worth anything over $40, even though it WAS fun.I imagine we people who actually like playing these kind of games with other real people who are real friends sitting next to us are in the minority now, which as I've said before but won't get into too much, I think is a real shame.  It's what used to make me LOVE the PS1 and PS2 Medal of Honor games and play them over and over and over with a buddy.Now I play these games, and I replay the campaign mode levels repeatedly because they are fun (I am looking forward to tackling that ship in the solo escape/revenge mission again), but this is now twice in a row with the MOH series where all I can think is: WHY, WHY did I pay $60 for this game?  At best it is worth paying maybe $40.  I will try to truly have more will power if/when they make another one of these and wait until the price comes down $20.  Because now, it's replay, replay, replay in ONE player campaign mode and then pawn.  Loved the storyline, love the character development and continuation from the previous game, WISH they would make the darn games longer!!!Those are the main cons I had besides how short the game was.  But like I said, short single player campaign does seem to be the way of Medal of Honor and every other game now.  I just wish they would harken back to the days when you could play with a buddy sitting next to you.Positive notes: storyline, sequences, fun!The storyline of the game like I said begins slow, but ultimately the game does pick up.  The side storyline with Preacher and his family continues, and it makes you respect the lifestyle special forces folks have to have even with their family.  It was really after a few of those scenes where the game felt less like a typical/generic FPS game and more like a true special forces game.  Sure you had the scenes where you were shooting dozens of the enemy, but then you had levels mixed in with driving, with stealth, with machine gunning from a helicopter.  It felt \"tight\" and not loose to put it one way.  The plot runs right alongside you.  It is what made the game for me.I have not read other reviews, but I personally LOVED, and thought was SO amazing for a FPS game like this, to have the Dubai driving portion.  It was like a scene out of Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.  You're not expecting it so when it starts you think, \"oh great, another driving level in a FPS game...\" and instead it's a blast while you're doing it!Bottom-line: Just like the previous MOH game, I am disappointed (but not so surprised this time) at how short the single-player campaign mission is.  Once I had internet access and sat down, it took me two sittings of a few hours each to pass this game in one day.  I'd guess 5-6 hours.  I have no idea how the online stuff is and I don't care, since as I've said I wish they would have longer campaign modes in the actual CD game and then include downloadable content later on for those who want to play online.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2012"}

I do enjoy extra pockets and slots as much as the next person, but if I'm shopping and look at something that calls itself \"Mini\", I tend to think that it's the sort of thing they've designed to be as small as possible.The main reason that I gave it four stars is that the construction is really solid and they were obviously not kidding about keeping your game system safe. There is a lot of padding here, possibly more than is really needed. I have a vague idea in my head that this was probably motivated by the fairly high original price point of the 3DS, and the fact that someone buying a game system that expensive for their child might be feeling quite a bit of motivation to throw a heavily padded and very sturdy case into the bargain.It's a little on the bulky side, so if size is concern I'd probably suggest getting a look at it in person before you decide whether you want it. I still have a DS Lite, so while I received this for the purpose of reviewing it, the amount of padding makes it more than a little bit of overkill for protecting what I have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2011"}

Created by award-winning producer Koji Igarashi and the creative team behind the critically acclaimed Castlevania - Aria of Sorrow","reviewerName":"smullins","summary":"Another good castlevania game","reviewText":"Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow is a another iteration in the series of Castlevania games for Nintendo's handheld systems. This game is well done with tight controls, variety in weapons and skills, interesting levels, and takes advantage of dual screens.If you're a fan of this series, this title fits right in. If you're new to the series, Castlevania is an rpg-like platformer set in a huge castle. You fight various villains in different areas of the castle, leveling up your character, finding new weapons and armor, and capturing souls from enemies that give you special abilities.What this game gets wrong:The only complaint I have about this game is the use of the stylus. I personally think games should either use the stylus exclusively or just rely on the face buttons, but not both. This game has you switching between the face buttons and the stylus during boss fights. As you drain a boss's health to zero, you must use the stylus to draw a symbol to seal the boss away. If you fail to draw the symbol, the boss's health regenerates. Several times I fumbled switching between the face buttons and the stylus, resulting in longer boss fights. I'm not against the stylus, I just didn't like having to switch rapidly at the end of a boss battle - but that's my preference.What this game excels at:Having the top screen be the map is just amazing. You'll pause so much less because you can look at the map as you continue to go through a level.Exploring the castle is great. Its the classic style of you explore everything you can, then kill a boss and get a new ability - e.g. double jump - and then you can explore new areas of the castle using your new ability. Its not new but it sure works.Story is interesting and keeps you engaged throughout the game. There are multiple endings to the game, one of them really extending the length of the game - necessary to play, otherwise the game feels too short.Overall, a pretty good Castlevania game. I'd describe it as mostly more of the same - which isn't necessarily a bad thing. But its new content, weapons, abilities, areas, etc. I'd recommend this game for Castelvania fans, its a good addition to the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Paul Arellano \"Last Days on Earth\"","summary":"Best all-around next gen system- beats PS3 and 360","reviewText":"In an industry where awesome graphics and fancy features are viewed as the selling point of a console, in comes Nintendo Wii, and with it, they gave gamers a second look at why they play games- it's all about interactivity. The Wii is all about being IN THE GAME. If you're after eye candy then the Wii is not for you. The Wii runs at a low 420p so in the graphics department, they're way behind than PS3 and 360. But gameplay and interactivity, coupled with user-friendly interface, this system is a winner. No wonder people young and mostly old buy this system, waiting it out in the cold January morning just to get this machine.The size of the console is pretty small. I'd say half the size of a cereal box in length and thickness. Installation is straightforward. Plug the cables in the back of the TV. The only step that's different is installing the sensor bar. The sensor is a black bar, about a foot in length. It's the device that senses the Wii's wireless controller, almost like a motion detector device. You place it ( I recommend) on top of your TV and then calibrate it with your controller. Once it detects the controller, the Wii is up and running.The system comes with a game called Wii Sports. It casts several sports games e.g. boxing, tennis, baseball, etc. Tennis is what I play the most. You start \"hitting\" the ball and the controller is very responsive. Boxing is useful if you want to lose weight. Holding the nunchuk and the controller and throwing punches in the air can get pretty exhausting. But it's GREAT FUN! Golf is another game worth mentioning. It does feel like you're hitting the ball in a golf course. When Tiger Woods comes out for the Wii, I'll make sure I get it.There are other games out there worth getting for the Wii. Zelda, which is by itself an instant hit. Then there's the hilarious Wario Smooth Moves where you have to perform action using your remote to solve a puzzle.All in all, I have been playing with my Wii that my 360 and PS3. I've logged in more hours with my Wii than my 360 or PS3. If you want to get off that chair and play interactive games, get a Wii. You'll fall in love with it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2007"}

We've seen Assasin's Creed 1 and 2, Oblivion, Uncharted 1 and 2, Fallout 3, etc. Dragon Age Origin's graphics looks really mediocre compared to those games I mentioned. I understand it takes more than 12 months to develop a game but BioWare seemed to concentrate more on storyline instead of other things. Just like other review about this game, the characters are like from Mass Effect, inventories like Baldur's Gate. And after spending over 30 hours on the game, I only got 8% trophies.I was hoping the game would be open sandbox like Fallout 3, but the graphics are very limited. When you see a hill, doesn't mean you can climb as you like. When you see water, doesn't mean you can walk or swim in it. Even the cutscenes not really that impressive. Game play feels like Baldur's Gate and Mass Effect combined together.I wish BioWare invest the same amount of time on the graphics as much as they invested on storyline.

Excellent voice acting and gradual exposition of the characters, whether main characters friends, or villains, presents a very interesting and easy to follow story. Blood and gore are pretty intense here but they are not what makes Darkness II stand out.

I am gonna simply talk bout what features I like best bout this system I own all three now I have different reasons why I like each one. First off bluray  being able to watch great movies in high def makes this a must have and seeing it has wi-fi internet connection means firmware updates which makes this the best way to get a bluray player but also bonus you can play games too that way. There is wide array of games to choose from for this system . The graphics are outta this world. The price is steep but in our world you get what you pay. You get something that can browse the net, play games, watch high definiton movies. dvds, listen to music on. The new playstation home is something new they added a fun cool new way to interact with friends kinda similar to imvu where you get a 3d avatar to represent yourself. With all sorts of games to choose from and assortments of bluray players you get a bargain when You do buy . Mine is the 40g model but is big enough for what I will be needing it for plus if you want the HDD is upgradeable. The con to this machine is the price but thats the only con it seems to have in the long run you get a savings on this cause your getting both a bluray player and a new generation gaming console. Plus the built in wi-fi unlike the xbox you gotta buy a separate thing which is no biggie there but still. Be nice if they would of put wi-fi inside that.Overall this is a good console and too I see they got a rather good library so far and continuing to grow new games best ones coming out will probably be on the ps3 no doubt bout it.

{"product_name":"B000MUXLOK","description":"InBurnout Paradiseplayers are treated to a rarity in the video games universe: a complete reinvention of an established franchise that equals, if not betters any of the previous games in the series. Yes, this is a large claim, but one that can be explained in a single phrase: Next-Gen Freedom.Driver's heaven is a wide open worldIn Paradise City even cars can fly.View larger.Go for broke in 'Marked Man' Mode.View larger.Nothing is off limits, even head-on crashes.View larger.Start a race any time with 'Easy Drive.'View larger.Although theBurnoutseries&#146; over the top mobile action has been its calling card since it ignited audiences on the PS2 in 2001, and later on the first generation Xbox console,Burnout Paradiseis the first game in the series that has been designed specifically for play on Next Generation consoles. This has allowed game developer Criterion to rip the training wheels off the game and rebuild it from scratch. The result is a new, expansive world that players can roll through at will. And what a world it is.Enter Paradise CityHeaven on Earth, at least to road-raging, crash-causingBurnoutfanatics, Paradise City is your domain and ultimate proving ground inBurnout Paradise. This expansive driver&#146;s playground stretches across 250 miles and encompasses all sorts of road driving conditions, from fun-in-the-sun seaside cruising boulevards, to mountain roads and downtown gridlock. But regardless of what stretch of asphalt you find yourself on, the beauty of this place is that nothing is blocked off and your wits are at least as important as the horsepower under your hood when it comes to racing here. Check out Paradise City&#146;s five sub areas (click the links for sample images):Downtown Paradise CityHarbor TownPalm Bay HeightsSilver LakeWhite MountainBurnout Your WayUnlike in previousBurnoutgames,Burnout Paradisenot only puts the keys to your ride in your hands, but places you squarely in the driver&#146;s seat when it comes to where you can go and what you can do.Along with wide avenues and crowded highways, the open game design of Paradise City is also jammed full of hidden side streets, back roads and alley ways. These can be used as short cuts in races, that is, if you know where they are. As you explore, commit these potential short cuts to memory because they will definitely come in handy in a tight race. And since we are talkingBurnouthere, players should not expect uneventful, genteel contests of speed and precision driving. In Paradise City players are always free to slam, shunt and wreck opponents in their bids for supremacy and they will. Also, new to theBurnoutseries, races can now start anywhere, anytime. Just pull up to a stoplight and spin your wheels to start one in one of five different event classes:Classic RaceRoad RageBurning RouteStunt Run (new)Marked Man (new)Instant OnlineBurnout Paradisealso keeps the mobile carnage coming while simultaneously setting the new standard in online social gameplay. With the new &#145;Easy Drive&#146; feature you can find friends online and with the click of a button invite them to a race. Once they&#146;ve accepted the race will start immediately. That's right, no more annoying wait times at online lobbies and servers. And keeping in touch with friends is easier than ever.Team up or TakedownIn the winner-take-all universe ofBurnoutteaming up usually isn&#146;t the first option that comes to mind, but on these rough and tumble streets it's a good option to keep in mind. With more than 300 FreeBurn Challenges packed into the game, players always have the choice of going it alone against the field as a whole or joining forces with up to seven of your buddies in user-created race routes. Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Modern Blue Argonaut \"No I do not have a shoe...","summary":"250 miles of realistic heart pumping fun in Paradise City","reviewText":"I'm not a big video game player. I don't care for Halo type games or ogres running around. But, I was very excited to be able to try out Burnout Paradise as I've always been a fan of racing. Unlike several other racing games, Burnout Paradise has approximately 250 miles of open road set in beautiful Paradise City (Hollywood/So. California).This newest burnout game did away with crash mode and replaced it with Showtime mode, which allows the car to continue to crash all the way across the map if you'd like. Each time you hit a car you get a boost and the crash gets more spectacular.The map is sometimes difficult to follow, and if you make a mistake you have to find your way around on your own. You can't just restart from where you were. I think this is nice because it's more realistic and challenging. Overall, you can unlock about 75 cars in this game. So far I have only a handful and they do handle and sound different from each other.The music is standard fun rock, and I haven't found any curse words or sexualized images, which makes the game fairly appropriate for kids unless you are opposed to them crashing cars and developing road rage.It's also fairly fun to crash through fences and drive through areas cars would not normally be able to drive such as train tracks, tunnels, and parking garages. Did I mention the graphics are simply amazing? They are incredibly realistic and gorgeous.Overall, the game is fun and relaxing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2008"}

Webb \"Trajedi\"","summary":"Regarding the MOVE functionality (NAV SUPPORT 2k ASAP!)","reviewText":"I love playing the DEMO versions of the yearly BBall titles but I never commit as they never feel like the next step, to be fair when I tried the LAKERS CELTICS demo (360) I wasn't overwhelmed, controls were tight and graphics looked pretty good but now that I picked it up for the PS3 I have no regrets.  When I fired this up and played the initial Bulls Lakers playoff game the controls were letting me down. My release on the button was a little off as I tried to get a handle on how to switch players, steal, and block.  Then I switched to move controls and the natural rhythms of raise and shoot movement, wrist flicking steals, and up movement blocks that I had mastered from countless Wii basketball games came into play.  The complex controls of the Dual shock scheme gave way to a much more natural game with the depth of control still mostly there, including an incredibly natural free throw feel. However HOLDING THE DUALSHOCK in your left hand for player movement instead of THE NAV CONTROLLER (which is just not getting the support it deserves in any title) starts to hurt your wrist.  Even as a Knicks/Sonics admirer I love the Bulls era Jordan teams and playing as the exalted one himself not to mention all of the classic squads.  There are so many modes here it is silly and the polish in the menus, music, sfx are great.  I think this is a more accessible NBA title with all the depth, strategy, and complexity there if die hards want to exploit it.  The slider and gameplay options make it a very customizable game if you just play with the settings. If you are curious about the move controls try them you might be pleasantly surprised, but Please 2k I NEED a NAV Controller patch, it is all I want for Christmas.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2010"}

It's basically the sequel to the Wii Sports pack-in, and features more mini-games for the casual gamer.I have to admit, despite the general low budget nature of the product, when Wii Play works its a very addictive experience. A lot of the fun with Wii has been re-discovering classic games with the new gesture controls. So you're still playing stuff like Duck Hunt, table hockey, pool, etc, only now the wii-mote controls make those simple diversions refreshing again. Where the package fails is that not every mini-game is a classic. The 'where's waldo' game is a dud for me, as is the one where you have to turn your Mii to fit inside a bubble. Others like cow racing and fishing are middle of the pack. All of them make for decent diversions with friends, but there's not quite as many mini games that stand up to extended play. Wii Sports was the better 'demo' package.Of course, you're also getting a wii-mote when you buy this, which may justify the overall value. While I'm glad Nintendo has shown us there's still room for simplicity and the casual gamer, it's time to move on to bigger things with better production values.

I was a little worried about the fact that it was no longer being develop by Infinity Ward (the devs of Modern Warfare 2)  instead Treyarch. Developers of the dismal \"world at war\" installment. But having played Black Ops for a couple of days i can say that this is a big improvement over Modern Warfare 2. Which WAS the best FPS of all time until nowThe single player is not really BO's strong point. The AI mostly just stands there or charges at you like a rampaging horde. Their are times when my AI controlled members of my team, ran right past an enemy and didn't even fired and their were also times when i just happen to be standing next to an enemy and the guy didn't know i was there. Thankfully though, the weak AI isn't a game spoiler and the game is indeed challenging at some points. That is if you remember to turn off the auto aim feature  in the options menu. I do enjoy the whole story of a covert secret ops team working for the CIA. Which is told mostly through flashbacks from the main character. Their are some excellent cut scenes which are similar to those in \"World at War\" shown in between each mission. The entire look of the classified files, meshed in with film clips of the 1960's cold war as well as main character Mason's own memories just adds to the suspense.. Just try not to get a seizure while watching them. Fans of World at War can also expect some cameos from several of the Russian characters.Multiplayer is the beard and butter of the COD franchise and BO's is one the best on the market. The rules work similar to that of earlier COD games but instead of just working up experience points, you are awarded in game currency to purchase equipment, guns, killstreaks, and perks. Thus allowing you to work right away at creating your specs. Of course, some of the equipment and guns will still have to be unlocked over the course of time. Some of the most biggest complaints of the previous COD games has been addressed. No juggernaut, no scavenging claymores allowing you to camp, noob tubing isn't as bad as before, no game ending Nukes, as well as kill streaks not being the spawn camping nemesis they were in the MW2. It is a much better experience this time around. Some may be relieved for the changes to multiplayer while others may find it not to their liking.  I myself like it. Wager matches are a great way to break up the monotony of an online FPS. As well as earn money faster.Graphics  and music are movie quality. In fact Black Ops was actually produced with the same techniques as in the movie Avatar. This really sticks out in the Nam mission in which you can see even the smallest details of facial features. It almost makes me want to buy a 3D TV. I did notice that Treyarch reused the old \"URRUH\" chant from it's previous game as well as recycling other sounds. I only encountered one bug in the game so far in which i just simply killed myself and went to the last checkpoint.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}
