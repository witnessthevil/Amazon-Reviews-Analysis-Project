{"product_name":"B003RS8HG6","description":"","reviewerName":"T Boz","summary":"One of the Best Rock Bands Yet","reviewText":"Now, being a huge Beatles fan, BRB will always be one of my favorites, the visuals were just too amazing.  However, Harmonix has taken Rock Band 2 and improved it in almost every way with 3.  The tour mode is much more animated, showing your band huffing it to gigs on the subway, character creation is more involved with facial adjustments available of every kind.  You also unlock clothing now as a reward, not sure if there's a money system since I've only had it for one day.The other review endlessly complained about the instruments and USB hub availability.  Well guess what, all previous Rock Band instruments work, so if you have a problem shelling out for Pro instruments, don't!  Also, of course Harmonix would try to shuck their keyboard first, just wait a few weeks and almost any MIDI keyboard will work with the hub.Next, the songlist.  We get a much more even spread of tracks by decade, instead of trying to cram every emo rock track from the 2000s into the game.  The limited-time Doors downloads are nice, as well as the Amazon pre-order guitar.  In a week you will be able to download John Lennon's Imagine album, which couldn't be a better initial DL package.The sound seems to be a little better balanced this time, with the option to boost the bass, and the Dobly Digital isn't as brickwalled as last time, giving your speakers a break.  Visuals are nice as usual, although I see some recycled backing characters from Rock Band 2.One note - I've had minor problems calibrating my HDTV to the guitar, done several auto-cal and it gives me a different offset every time.  Assuming Harmonix will patch this soon if it's widespread.  Overall, a great and engrossing game, my girlfriend and I love to play together, and plan on hosting several Rock Band Nights during the holidays to spread the joy and perhaps initiate a few new converts.as Ozzy would say - \"Rock N Roll!\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2010"}

MY KINGDOM FOR THE SUIT!","reviewText":"This game took the reaaaaally scenic route before, finally, finding its way home. Release dates were pushed back, again and again; publishers were changed (from ATARI to SIERRA), like horses while crossing a river: an equally bad idea. What finally reached the shore was nothing to brag about...TIMESHIFT runs for about 10-15 hours, not short yet not long either by regular standards (I mean \"regular\", mind you, not HL2-Episodes which run shorter than demos). In all those hours the story never manages to engage you. Time travel has always been a mind bender to grasp - and this is especially true when the story is tissue-paper thin...True, most FPS games do not have thicker stories - yet all *Great* FPS games surely did.In the original UNREAL you tried to escape an alien planet you crash-landed in a prison-ship. In HALF-LIFE you either fought in an alien-infested underground Black Mesa or were doing Mr Smith's biding in combine-controlled City 17. In FAR CRY you were thrown onto a tropical island with a wild bunch of mutant-creating mercenaries. In MAX PAYNE - oh, don't get me started on MAX PAYNE...In TIMESHIFT you try to, well, get back a time-shifting suit from the evil doctor and then go back in time to amend  the bad things he already did. Yeah, really exciting...TIMESHIFT manages to stay afloat by improving on old idea. Remember MAX PAYNE's bullet-time? Well, in TIMESHIFT you can actually stop or even reverse time. This is not unlimited of course and it has rather slow recharge cycle but it provides with a number of interesting possibilities: dodge bullets, throw back the live grenade, disarm the opponents and then use their own weapons against them...(if you die though, you do stay dead).AI? What AI? I don't know whether it is due to going back and forth in time, but your enemies never raise above flatlined braindead. Even without slowing time they will just walk in front of your mawing machine gun...The one thing that DID improve by the long wait were the graphics. Compared to early-released demos, there seems that a lot of work has been put into all of textures, surfaces and shadows. Slow time and watch for the explosions: they are really impressive! Combine this with a collection of really imaginative and impressive weapons and you have TIMESHIFT's major success. Incendiary projectiles anyone? And I really liked the abundance of ammo! (some FPS are so stingy with their ammo crates, you would think they actually had to pay for them!)Now, these high quality graphics do require the latest beta drivers (in fact the installation routine will direct you to the appropriate site for this reason), have pretty steep system requirements - and expect a number crashes. Ah well, that's what patches are for.All in all, give it a try - but there are much better choices out there...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0045U01OG","description":"","reviewerName":"korova","summary":"Rockstar's Rashomon","reviewText":"Long time fans of Grand Theft Auto know that each of the games in the post-PS1 era is thematically linked to a particular genre of movie. GTA III is heavily indebted to Mafia movies such as Goodfellas and The Godfather, as well as to the cable television series The Sopranos. Vice City is clearly influenced by Miami Vice and Scarface, while San Andreas draws a great deal of inspiration from Colors and Boyz N the Hood.GTA IV-The Complete Edition carries on this tradition by transforming Grand Theft Auto IV into an homage to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon. As in Kurosawa's film, a set of events is seen from multiple points of view, leaving the player to decide which perspective he or she believes is the most credible. Niko Bellic, Johnny Klebitz, and Luis Lopez, the main characters, each bring a different experience and interpretation to GTA IV's story line. Niko is an immigrant, forced to assimilate and adapt rapidly to a world completely new to him. Johnny is caught in a classic master versus apprentice situation. Luis, who is the only character with any kind of insider status, must choose between building his future and honoring his past.These are all familiar character situations in videogames, of course, but Rockstar creates deeper and richer stories and characters than most other game developers. The majority of games stick to the bare rudiments of character motivation and development. Rockstar has given us THREE strong stories in the GTA IV series, each with a complex and compelling main character. It was ambitious of Rockstar to release Niko's view of the story first, in isolation, without any indication of what was to come later. Many of the events in the Niko version of the story, in fact, aren't fully explained until the Luis and Johnny episodes. Compare that to the usual rote or clich&eacute;d story arcs found in too many games, even multi-episode games. There are a few studios that consistently produce well-written games in addition to Rockstar--Bungie, Valve, and Kojima Productions are three standouts--but the vast majority treat story and plot as afterthoughts.Story and influences aside, the bigger question is whether or not GTA IV and the two Episodes are fun to play. The answer is YES, even though it is clear that Rockstar devoted a lot more development time to Luis' episode than it did to Johnny's episode. TLAD feels somewhat stripped down and is similar to GTA III in many ways. You'll spend most of your time following the main story, driving or riding to combat missions. If you fully explored Liberty City in Niko's episode, there isn't a whole lot to discover or do that you haven't already experienced. On the other hand, TBOGT contains a much broader variety of missions, side activities, and minigames. Most players will spend more time with TBOGT than with TLAD--but now that they're both part of this value priced disc, it's no big deal. The important thing is to play the series in the order in which it was released (GTA IV then TLAD then TBOGT). If you don't, you'll miss out on properly experiencing how the full story unfolds.Well worth picking up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2010"}

And this port is even better than the original.  Four characters and tons of minigames, not to mention all-new levels and new goals in old levels, mean this game offers even more bang for players new to the game than the original did.  As for me I played the living daylights out of the N64 version so this one got old fairly quickly, but it still kept me playing to 150 stars (and I had fun doing it), and it's got me still coming back periodically to improve on coin totals and minigame scores.  The minigames are really good by the way.The only possible drawback to this version is the lack of an analog stick.  The N64 analog stick was designed specifically to play Mario 64 believe it or not, but this system has nothing so designed for this game.  So you have to make do with one of three control schemes.  Please, PLEASE for your own sake learn to control this with the touch screen.  The game is so much better with analog control rather than holding a button to run and using the standard 8 directions.  I use Dual-Hand mode using the stylus in my right hand.  Believe me it took some time getting used to, BUT IT WAS WORTH IT learning the touch-screen control scheme.  And I had a lot of fun while learning the control scheme, since so many stars in so many stages are so easy to get that you don't need perfect grasp of the game's controls.Like I said, since I had played Mario 64 so much before, it did get a bit old.  But it was still a very fun experience.  Mario 64 is the best thing on DS except possibly Kirby's Canvas Curse (play it!!!  you'll like it :) )  And in my case, the lack of an analog stick just added to the fun, since learning a new control scheme added challenge to stages that, for a Mario 64 veteran, would have been too easy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2005"}

Pokemon Platinum was a blast to play, but it had many deficiencies that appeared to be fixed with SoulSilver. SoulSilver fixes many of those problems and includes a Pokewalker that is fun to use and very useful at the same time.The music quality is excellent and many of the overtures reminded me of the anime. The 3D rendering of Lugia flying through the ocean floor was superb and shows the power of the Nintendo DS/DSi/DSi XL. The in-game graphics are very good although there's not a huge difference from Platinum and other 4th generation games.The best part about SoulSilver is the updated menu system for items and other in-game activities. Platinum required scrolling a wheel with the stylus that became cumbersome and annoying after doing it for the 300th time.The bicycle no longer has gears like in Platinum, it's 1 speed only and it works fine. The use of 2 registered items is also a big plus. I frequently like to use the fishing rod and it made no sense to register only 1 item at a time. Now, pressing Y activates your first registered item while you can touch the second one via the menu.The Pokewalker is a fantastic add-on to the game. I am able to exercise and level up my Pokemon at the same time. The one thing I would change with the walker is allow multiple leveling of Pokemon rather than waste my steps by stopping when it levels up. In addition, allowing the Pokemon to learn moves automatically would save me time as well. Then I could return it to the DS and pick the moves I want to keep. I couldn't get the walker to register steps when I taped it to my ceiling fan, but a lot of people seemed to have found cheats using various contraptions.The Pokegear system is not very easy to use. The radio isn't intuitive, and the cellphone has to be the dumbest idea ever. Everytime some Joe or Jane schmo calls me up, it's to discuss a mundane topic. The mother calls (if you give her a cut of your earnings) to tell you how she bought you some items and to go pick them up from the Pokemart. The older Pokewatch system from Platinum was very nice and had useful functions.Pros: Another excellent Pokemon game for the DS, although it is a remake of Silver / Gold. The menu system is vastly improved, and the Pokewalker is fun to use.Cons: Pokegear is a downgrade from the Pokewatch in Platinum.Overall: 4/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"The Race Is On","reviewText":"For Nintendo, some of their most popular games have been revised over and over again.

Luckily, the game truly makes up for it in the Vs. mode, where you are head-to-head n a battle with up to four players in the race.Mario Kart is absolutely worth checking out for the Nintendo 64, despite the fact the Nintendo 64 has no more new games for the system.

I don't know maybe 2 stars is enough. The game is worse than i expected. I didn't expect it to be that good, but it turned out a lot worse than what i had expected. This is more of an online game, everything is based online. Here are the pros and cons to make it easier:Cons:- way to dark!!! the whole thing is way to dark and there is no way to actually adjust it. Its hard to see anything so it makes the game sort of unplayable.- No 2 player!! Really capcom?? why when RE5 had 2 player. That's not much fun seeing how it takes forever to find someone to match up with and most of the time you can't find anyone!!- Story isn't that good. (kinda unbelievable) why does nemesis in parts look like a robot instead of something extremely terrifying? even the lickers don't look as scary anymore. The brains on the outside just don't do it for me. expected something better (not that many scenes). IT honestly doesn't really feel like a resident evil game and i played every last one that came out on game cube before getting a ps3.-AI is really stupid. its really annoying to have 4 partners that don't do anything. It's bad when its 1 but 4? Most of the time they are running around getting killed leaving you to go in the open to try and heal them because you need back up and it ends up putting you in a bad spot.-herbs and first aid don't heal like they used too. Unless you have the medic Bertha the first aid wont get you full like it used to in the previous resident evils which makes this game suck even more...- Did i mention one of the worst parts is no 2 player? I would rather have someone playing beside me that i know instead of having someone online or the stupid computer to always rely on...- weapons suck. hardly make any impact. worse weapons by far. I even pre-ordered this and had an extra weapons added on but they all suck so it was pointless anyways. even the extra costume pack that came with the game sucked cause all it did was change the costume color not the costume itself....- no item organization which makes it annoying and really feel like its not a RE game. IT also makes it one of the worst parts in the game. They were really lazy on this one... I have to constantly drop my weapon to pick up another one to use for the time being than try and find my weapon somewhere on the ground. No more can i switch between weapons so i don't have to carry the same two weapons all the time. no more can i assign a different weapon to one of the keypad slots like i used too. If resident evil 6 turns out like this you can count me out!!!ProsThe graphics are a bit better more realistic looking, but that's about it. there are NO improvements in this game.In the End, I really wish i would have never pre-ordered this game. Another game that got me all hyped up only to let me down (hint ssx).I will be renting before buying again because i don't want to have to go through this again. There are so many cons to this game im pretty sure im not getting to them all because im so upset. I haven't said anything about the multiplayer as far as versus go because i don't like to play RE games online so as far as online play go im not rating just only the campaign. oh yeah another con to this game is that there are TOO many online trophies which makes it hard to plat. I love plating the games i play and this one is beyond me..... That really annoys me too. I will be trading this one in asap.Another con - when i say weapons make no impact i mean they literally don't. i can shoot a human in the face 10 times and they won't go down. I can shoot a zombie 3 and they fall no problem? why is it easier to kill a Zombie than a Human? That makes no sense!!! why does it take like 20 shots just to take someone down??","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0053BQREE","description":"","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"I have mixed feeling about WWE 12...","reviewText":"For this year's edition game publisher THQ drops the Smackdown Vs Raw moniker in favor of the new and simpler \"WWE 12\" but it's still clearly a continuation of the franchise, and I can't say that there any drastic change except perhaps the controls. Each year there are things to like and things to hate about every WWE/Smackdown Vs Raw titles, rarely do we get perfect or near perfect games (Smackdown Here Comes The Pain and Smackdown Vs Raw 2006 both come to mind as excellent wrestling games) and WWE 12 is no different. It hits and misses in some departments but it's playable and offers some WWE fun.I like the new controls, when I first heard of them I was skeptical and thought I would hate them. They're a little hard to figure out initially but as with any games it gets easier and now they've grown on me. They pretty much ditched the previous controls and now you use A for grapples, B for strikes etc. and for the most part the controls are just fine. I can appreciate that they were trying to mix up the gameplay a little, the old controls were working fine as they were I think there should have been the option of keeping the old controls at least. The only real problem in the gameplay is probably the AI level. On Road To Wrestlemania the AI can be pretty harsh on you at times and often it's very difficult to execute a reversal. Something about the reversals is just not right with WWE 12.To make things worse, sometimes the game will indicate the need to repeatedly press the A button to regain balance but 95% of the time it never works, no matter how many times you press A. The AI beat me plenty of times and I've had to replay some matches more than I would like to admit. It's \"challenging\" alright but also frustrating. Graphics are excellent this year and look better than ever. The superstars, their facial expressions, the arenas and the crowds...everything looks gorgeous.I find most of the problems with the game to be in the Road To Wrestlemania mode. First off, everything is scripted, every match has been pre-determined. You can't lose technically, because the game won't let you continue past a match until you win it OR have the outcome pre-determined that you lost. It's all about wrestling until you either win or beat your opponent enough to press Y and then a cut scene sequence is launched and all you do is watch. While you're backstage you can't run or turn the camera which makes backstage play fairly mediocre. All you do is walk slowly until you get from point A to B (and most of the time it doesn't lead to anything interesting) and sometimes you have to guess where you need to go. The backstage fights however, are fun. You unlock a lot of the roster, different suits, titles etc through the completition of the mode. Add to this the mode isn't all that long; you go on for basically a few weeks per wrestler. I remember when story mode used to be about a year long, leading up to Wrestlemania and all the Pay-Per-View events.You get The Rock as a free downloadable character with the game already, but I feel roster isn't exactly WWE 12's strong point. There aren't as much wrestlers as I would've expected and not enough Legends and Divas unfortunately. THQ has announced some download packs for Wrestlers like Batista, Trish Stratus, Shawn Michaels, Mick Foley and Jerry Lawler but I feel that this is a cheap move from THQ's part and that they should have been included at least as unlockables. Why pay $59.99 and then have to pay extra for superstars that should have been included in the first place? Sad move by THQ. I've noticed that occasionally bugs will happen, but not the kind that freezes the game. It happened twice so far that an opponent performed an Irish Whip in the ring and sent me in a frozen motion in the crowd. One of these happened in an Elimination Chamber match.I was certainly glad to see the WWE Universe mode again. In the past I would spend hours making my own scenarios in my head and executing them in WWE games. Maybe I'm one of the few who likes this mode but this helps justify my purchase of WWE 12. Create matches is still here and this year they've added create an Arena which is a very cool addition, you can build your own Arena to your liking. Create A Wrestler is for many one of the best aspects of the WWE series and it continues to be excellent here. For me, a lot of the fun is found in exhibition play with some friends defending titles and playing our favorite match types over and over. It never gets old.The game is very fluid which is what THQ goes for, looks and feels fantastic, and it plays very much like a real wrestling match by which I mean you can interrupt finishers and grapples from another wrestler, you won't just stand there waiting like previous titles. For all its flaws, WWE 12 remains a fun and entertaining wrestling game. The in-ring action is spectacular at times and always appealing. It offers the most realistic possible WWE experience a video game can offer. It even has all the \"WWE Presents...\" before the PPVs adding to the realism factor. I also like the commentaries in this title. In retrospect if THQ offered a larger roster and didn't try to rip us off into buying wrestler \"packs\", had a better and longer Road To Wrestlemania it would've made WWE 12 a better game. For all its worth I'll give WWE 12 3-3.5/5 stars, I like the gameplay and I'll be playing and enjoying the game for some time but I think the average gamer and WWE fan should rent before buying this title at full price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2011"}

This generation there were a good number of them but, aside from Rockstar (Grand Theft Auto IV, Episodes of Liberty City, Red Dead Redemption, Undead Nightmare, and L.A. Noire), there were only a few notable entries into the genre - Saints Row 2 and Saints Row The Third, as well as the Infamous and Prototype games (though they were less in the crime genre and more into the superhero arena).  Now, Sleeping Dogs was originally being developed by Activision as True Crime: Hong Kong, and intended for current generation consoles but the powers-that-be at Activision felt it was not substantial enough to challenge Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto franchise or THQ's Saints Row games.Eventually the game (not the True Crime rights) was purchased by Square Enix, re-labeled as Sleeping Dogs, and continued to be built up and developed.The biggest question anyone has when it pertains to games like these is this: is it worth my time? The answer, simply, is yes.There are five areas to look at when it comes to Sleeping Dogs - Story.  It has a great, believable story that you'd swear was a movie before with the likes of Chow Yun-Fat or Jackie Chan.  It has twists, turns, drama, thrills, and an endless army of bad guys.The controls are next - though a little different than Grand Theft Auto, you get used to them - and they are designed this very way to allow the protagonist to use martial arts during action sequences.  Plus, you are able to learn new moves that are devastating to your enemies and easy to pull off.There are firearms to be used in this game, though, to be honest, they are not as much of a focus as fist fights until about halfway through the game - but the gun controls are smooth and easy to master.The graphics are great - not the best for this generation - but very impressive and the whole vibe of Hong Kong gives you a sense of excitement when playing, whether you're progressing through the story or doing side missions.The sound  is nice. Music on the radio, ambient sounds, and voice acting are all top-notch and add a lot of depth to the story and the game as a whole.Lastly is replay value - there is a ton.  From illegal car racing and underground fight circuits to cock fights, boosting cars, and singing karaoke (yes, you read that right), Sleeping Dogs has a ton of stuff to do.  In addition, you are able to purchase clothes to change your appearance, energy drinks and food to give you more stamina, strength, or speed...or a large variety of vehicles, ranging from sports bikes and sedans to luxury and exotic racecars.While this game is not at the level that Grand Theft Auto IV was, it is close - and a blast to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2013"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"Impressive short offering until Halo Reach","reviewText":"Halo 3: ODST pits you in the shoes of a rookie ODST (thats Orbital Drop Shock Trooper for you laymen) during the siege of New Mombasa, a futuristic city on Earth in the Halo universe. Unlike previous Halo games you are not a super soldier, you do not have much of a shield, your health drops quickly and you cannot duel wield like the Master Chief. Nor do you have regenerating health, rather you have to find health packs to heal. Halo 3: ODST offers up a new glimpse into the fabled Halo story, and takes you through another amazing Bungie narrative.The one thing that has always impressed me about the Halo games the most is the storyline and the voice acting. First of all the story lines are definitely Hollywood A-list cinema quality with epic twists and turns and the right amount of action set pieces and emotional depth to keep the gamer long engaged. Halo 3: ODST is no different, featuring a well written and well executed storyline that is both epic and entertaining.The game starts out with you and your crew dropping down onto New Mombasa from a ship high above the Earth (Halo 3: ODST takes place during Halo 2). However things quickly go awry and 6 hours later find yourself alone in the darkness and the aftermath of an invasion. Destroyed cars and fires litter the streets and an eerie silence pervades the air (aside from the occasional police siren left unattended and blaring) and your team is nowhere to be found. So, you are left to wander the streets of New Mombasa in search of your team mates, dodging Covenant patrols along the way. The game is actually split into two sections: one portion of the game has you wandering the dark and ravaged streets searching for your team mates, and once you find clues to their whereabouts the game shifts to a flashback and you get to experience what happened to your team mates from their eyes. Its an ingenious method that allows for the player to not only experience different terrain and levels but also experience large scale battles and it fully fleshes out the story of New Mombasa.Graphics: Most of the game takes place in the dark, forcing you to use your visor night vision to see enemies and the path forward; this lends a creepy essence to the experience, almost desolate and bare. Though you spend a good portion of the game in the dark the graphics are pretty impressive, if a little outdated (Bungie is still using the Halo 3 engine), however they serve their purpose of creating a futuristic looking city that had recently been through an invasion. The city itself looks great with tall odd shaped skyscrapers, futuristic cars, phone booths and UNSC recruitment kiosks; its unmistakable that you are in another world. Character models look good, again with some minor hitches due to the outdated graphics engine (face models look like they could be at home on the original Xbox system), but any graphical issues are easily brushed aside when compared to the epic storyline of ODST.Sound: Everything you have come to expect from a Halo game is here; from the laser blasts, the taunts from the Covenant to the excellent voice acting to the Hollywood blockbuster musical score, its all here.Gameplay: Halo 3: ODST plays more like Halo: Combat Evolved than it does Halo 2 or Halo 3. You are not a super soldier so you don't duel wield weapons, you cannot regenerate health so quickly and easily and your shield ain't much. Oh, and they also brought the amazing pistol back! Zoom in with that bad boy and watch the headshots rack up. On easy ODST is a piece of cake, however like all Halo games ramp up the difficulty to Heroic or Legendary and you will surely face a challenge, often eschewing flat out firefights for the safety of the darkness when you spot a patrol. Another really cool feature is that the game is pretty much open ended. No, you can't do anything you want but you can choose how you want to complete the missions you are given, which gives you a sense of freedom. You can pretty much roam around the city at will, however some areas will be cut off until you complete certain missions, but overall its a nice touch.Halo 3: ODST also offers an up-to four player mode called Firefight, which pits players against wave after wave of Covenant forces. How long can you last? Think of Horde mode in Gears of War 2 or the similar one in Resident Evil 4. It plays out like an old school Arcade shooter.ODST also comes with a second disc that houses the complete Halo Multiplayer experience. Not only do you get the Forge and Theater modes, you also get all of the DLC content as well as the multiplayer game itself. Not too shabby if you ask me.Overall I would highly recommend Halo 3: ODST to all First Person Shooter fans, not just Halo fans, since the game plays out more like a Sci-Fi shooter than necessarily a pure Halo game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2010"}

But it's a major departure from the Splinter Cell series.  Here's one big caveat to my review: my standard for a game is how likely I am to pick up and play a year or two down the road - by that standard, very few games deserve more than an average rating.The good:Most of the good things about this game are in sync with the SC series.  The voice acting is top notch and totally credible.  The graphics are great, and there's very few visual distractions.  Stealth is still the prefered method of completion - rather than running and gunning through levels.  The co-op story added a solid 4-6 hours of gameplay on completely new maps and was well thought-out and definately not tacked on as an afterthought.The bad:The \"mark-and-execute\" feature dramatically alters gameplay.  It's easy to \"mark\" four enemies, drop a flash grenade, grab a 5th, and then execute the remaining four enemies.  In previous games, a room with five enemies in it would pose a challenge that would require some serious sneaking and planning.  With the \"win button\" there's significantly less challenge.  They've all but removed the goggles from the game - replacing night/thermal/electrical vision with a goofy sonar vision that blurs terribly when you're moving.  Even then, they're only available in later levels. It's no longer possible to move bodies out of brightly lit areas into storage closets or shadows (although you can grab enemies and walk them into shadows).  The lock-picking mechanic and minigames are completely gone. The cover-to-cover mechanic makes moving from one concealed position to another easy; but sometimes that exposes pretty serious AI flaws.The ugly:I am not a fan of the contextual messages or black-and-white movies that play on objects.  They're often hard to read/see.  They do not make the movie feel more cinematic or real or whatever it is they're going for.  The \"enhanced interrogation\" (let's just call it what it is: torture) is brutal and you'd have to be a sociopath to actually enjoy it.  The story is a convoluted mess (although that is, in fact, true to SC form). The mark-and-execute sometimes has you shooting through objects. There are remote cameras and guns that cannot be knocked out by EMP - for no explained reason. On the hardest levels, the enemies are slightly better at spotting you - but otherwise, there's no noticiable difference if you play the game as intended (getting headshots, hand-to-hand takedowns, and mark-and-executes). My last gripe is the black-and-white gameplay.  Everything except enemies and traps turn black-and-white when you're in shadows.  It's unnecessary, and should already be pretty obvious.So by my (admittedly high) standards, this game is pretty average.  It's solid gameplay and decent story that should be beaten in under 6 hours.  The co-op was a great addition that deserves high marks.  But in a year, this game will be gathering dust.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}

So I was reluctant to purchase D3, and wanted to wait till it was $29 bucks or something. Got it anyways on a gift card FTW.The bad:* D3 has to have the worst story line I've ever suffered through. While the voice acting is \"ok\", what's being said is so utterly stupid. It's almost like watching some B movie that's trying to be serious. I wanted to like this story line. It's impossible. Listening to it three times already all I want is some setting that allows me to turn it off.* Always online. Now I've played D3 I understand. Blizzard is greedy and some folks are actually stupid enough to use real money to win this game. Awesome. Thanks for the lag you created designing the game around this greed.* The game is tailored to make you spend gold/money at the AH. At level 40, the gear dropping for you is 30ish. Anything that drops for you is trash loot compared to what you'll buy in the AH for 1000 g.* Loot drops. Why does a wooden stump give me an upgrade when those three elite mobs I fought for 5 minutes dropped trash loot?* Zone size. You can walk around any \"zone\" in less than 5 minutes once cleared. That means it's smaller than my neighborhood. One day maybe we'll play a Blizzard game that doesn't feel claustrophobic. Highly doubtful - they spend all dev time working on RMAH stuff.*Crafting - Why does a boar drop better gear than I can craft? Does Blizzard ever get tired of boars? I'm really &*#&%$ tired of seeing armored boars in Blizzard games. What do these boars eat to become powerful enough to drop yellow loot?The good:* It's mindless fun. I can't stress \"mindless\" enough. There's no thinking involved, just click and dodge. Don't spend more than 10 seconds analyzing gear, just vendor it and go to the gold AH.Conclusion:Buy it if you like mindless grinds, but don't take D3 seriously and certainly don't torture yourself with money generating Inferno mode. It's maybe a little better than Torchlight 1, but I don't think it's a good as Titan Quest. Play the game till it's no longer fun, then play something else.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2012"}

This is actually good.","reviewText":"I normally really do not like online games (although I keep trying them), but I got hooked by this one. At first, the game seems like all other online games. In fact, there are even space-rats to kill in order to gain experience (its almost like a parody, actually). However, once you get into it a bit more, this is a very good and entertaining game.For one, the game has incredible depth. Where in other games, you spend boring minutes to find your monster to kill, and then click on it to kill it in the most boring fashion, here you actually need player-skill to kill other things. Different weapons, different stands, different strategies. Although combat does depend on your character's skills, it also depends on your own skills.And then there is a lot more than killing rats. In fact, you do not have to kill anything at all. Crafting and mining resources is quite interesting. Even things like entertainers. If you ever want to see (or be) a drunk wookie doing an erotic dance with an overweight twi'lek women, this is the game for you! I think spending time in bars and cantinas is one of my favorite things to do in this game. I don't think I ever laughed as heartily in any other video game.Also, there just is a ton of things to do. Wanna visit Jabba's Palace? Well, you can do so (among other things you may know from the movies). You will not be able to do so right away, and even once you get there, it will take you a while to get into the inner areas of the palace. But the point is that there is a whole bunch of stuff to see that is actually worth seeing. For me, this is the first ever game where I went around sight-seeing, just because it is worth it. In fact, I actually had my character sit down for a few minutes just to watch the sunset of the dual suns of Tatooine. The sight was spectacular!And hey, at this point I haven't even left Tatooine (my home planet in the game). In fact, I hardly left my town...You must be aware however, that this game will take up a ton of your time! You can not run around right away and be a Jedi or any other character of high significance. At the end of the day, this is still a MMORPG.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2003"}

I don't buy games when it first come out.  I'll wait a year for the price to come down.  This game is one of the games that I've been waiting to buy.  After reading all the good reviews I was a bit excited at first.  Now that I played a few hours of the game, I think I can give a few comments of the game.The concept is interesting.  However, the gameplay can be frustrating.  I've never played the first one so I'm not sure if it is relevant to the 2nd Bioshock.The story itself is intriguing.  The controls of BD make sense.  As I first met with some of the denizens, I realized how difficult the game is.  I think the developers tried to make it real by having Big Daddy to suffer damage easily because of the 50's technology.  For one thing, BD does not have any shield and the health does not regenerate.  A single shot taken by BD can easily take half of BD life.  Two or three shots and I have to start all over from the nearest vita-chamber with the supplies lost.  At some scenes it gets really frustrating - I died at least 10 times before I could get past the stage.  By the time I'm done, I lost all my ammo, fuel and EVE.  Walking around with either is asking for trouble.  At this day and age, I think it is ridiculous to make a game so difficult to play.  I play games to release stress from my daily life.  Games like this really take the fun out of the equation.  While I don't deny there are some good qualities of the game, but making the player really work to get the good qualities is just a little too much.Update Feb 22, 2011I put down the game for a month.  Retried it yesterday and boy was I dissapointed.  I consider myself a casual gamer and I've done pretty good in a lot of shooting games.  By far, BioShock 2 is one of the worst game.  It is extremely hard and the mechanics are extremely frustrating.  The logic in how you spend your bullets are ridiculous.  After just 30 minutes of game yesterday, I decided to sell this game.

You play as either Ghost or Niobi on missions that run parallel to the latest Matrix movie.The movie sequences were probably the best part of the game. The cutscenes were shot while the movie was shot, so the look is very authentic. The story, much more complex than the first Matrix, is explained a little by the game.The driving sequences were difficult, and more frustrating than challenging. The hovercraft gameplay was infinitely more frustrating.The graphics are pretty good. Most of the levels looked pretty good (the hovercraft and sewer levels looked absolutely terrible). The graphics are about as good as your typical 3rd person shooter. The characters looked a little boxy, and Niobi and Ghost look a little awkward when fighting.The controls are a bit counter-intuitive: with black as the firing button, and the right thumbstick bringing bringing up first person zoom. You cannot control the camera angle. Sniping is damn near impossible. The kung-fu fighting is not as good as a genuine fighting game (Tekken, DOA, etc), but it's not so bad as to really take much from the game.The focus element of this game is, perhaps as expected, the most fun. The characters can focus, slowing down time so you can do cool stuff (run along walls, jump long distances, dodge bullets, etc). There are a lot of cool things to do in focus mode, and it makes the game worth playing.This game will keep you busy for a lttle while. The bullet-time makes it worth playing and the cutscenes keep it interesting. If you're not a Matrix fan, definately try this before you buy.

The Social Expressions, while entertaining when you first pick up the game, soon grow tedious and monotonous; however, if you are a fan of \"The Sims\" then you'll likely love the fact that you can scare, intimidate, and woo NPCs with the same expressions over and over again.The D-Pad customization for expressions and items falls behind the series' first game.  In Fable 2, if you wish to grow fat or become the town drunkard you'll have to bring up the menu window (which is still as cumbersome as in the first game), click on a single drink or pastry once (at which time the menu system will close), and repeat the process 5 or 10 times.  Health potions work the same way; you cannot map them manually to the D-Pad.  I'm not sure if this was an over-sight by the developers, but I can't see a reason for it.The biggest disappointment I've had with both Fable and Fable 2 is the inability to freely roam throughout an expansive world.  In both games, the player is given small, restricting, modulated environments with which to interact.  With such games as \"Oblivion\", \"Lord of the Rings Online\", and \"World of Warcraft\" on the market it seems that the developers would have done their homework a little better.Also, the choice of weaponry remains as limited as in the first game.  Yes, it's very cool to be able to carry around a gun, but if you wish to play as a rogue don't expect to find a dagger anywhere in Albion.  Same is true for a wizard's staff; don't expect to find one . . .anywhere.Despite the title's myriad of short-comings and disappointments, the game is still great fun and is a little like \"GTA 4\" meets \"Grimm's Fairy Tales\" (minus the stealing of cars).

At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular.

At least they were if you liked 2-D platform games, andYoshi&#x92;s Islandis indisputably one of the best ever made.Yoshi&#x92;s Islandgoes back in time to recount the touching story of the various Yoshis' attempts to unite Baby Mario with his parents. You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Rebecca","summary":"Good, Quality Yoshi","reviewText":"A really good game, especially among Yoshi fans, follows the style of other Yoshi games.

Prepare for a slow-paced, frightening, and dark adventure.","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"Brutal and Scary!","reviewText":"Condemned is a high-octane scarefest.  It reminds me of games like Resident Evil and Dead Space - if you liked those, then you will probably like Condemned.The strangest thing in the world of Condemned, from a gameplay point of view, is the lack of an inventory.  You can't horde health packs, you're limited to one weapon at a time, and there are no special items to keep track of.  This is very odd for a combination FPS/survival horror game; both of those genres typically love to give you lots of things to collect.  It's somewhat refreshing to play a game of this style and not constantly worry about rationing out bullets and health packs.Firearms are very rare in Condemned, and when you do come across one chances are it will only have a few bullets left.  Normally this means that you'll have an easier time taking out the next few bad guys, and then it's time to find a new weapon.  The majority of the combat takes place in up-close melee battles.  Your weapon?  Anything you can find - almost literally.  During my playthrough of Condemned I bludgeoned enemies with the following items (not a complete list): papercutters, different types of pipes, locker doors, desk drawers, fire axes, signs, shovels, mannequin arms, crowbars, sledgehammers, meat cleavers, fire pokers, and many different 2x4s (straight up, filled with bolts or nails, flaming).These weapons are plentiful and scattered everywhere through the world.  They each have different attributes in strength, speed, blocking, and reach - it's up to you to decide which weapon attributes are most important.  Finished firing off the last shell from the shotgun that you picked up?  Head over to the corner and yank a pipe off of the wall to continue your assault.  Or maybe you want to grab the 2x4 filled with nails on the ground over there, the choice is yours.The combat takes a bit of getting used to, for two different reasons.  As mentioned above, it's largely melee combat - which is not very common for a first person game.  You do get a taser and the occasional firearm to bring things back into familiar ground - but the majority of the game you'll be slugging it out hand to hand.  Once you get used to blocking, parrying, staying out of range, waiting for your opening, and taking fights a bit more slowly than usual the combat system is a lot of fun.  Running ahead and swinging wildly is definitely not a recipe for success; if you're looking for a fast-paced action game, then Condemned is definitely not for you.The second attribute that gives combat in Condemned a unique taste is the subject matter.  You play as an FBI agent tracking down a murder case, a bizarre serial killer who poses his victims with mannequins after taking them out.  One thing leads to another and you end up on the run from your own agency, scampering through the mean streets (well, mostly the mean buildings) of a completely broken down New York-ish setting.  Your goal is probably pretty obvious: get the bad guy before he gets you.  In addition to the combat there's some minor evidence gathering, after all you are a detective.  This consists mostly of small mini-games to find and collect samples to wire back to the lab in order to get some information about the crime scene and move the story along.Condemned's version of New York is 'Metro City', a strange world where the subways still run on a schedule but there isn't a single normal person anywhere to be found.  Well there are a few (the supporting cast), but other than that you will spend the majority of your time with 'the influenced' - people of the street strung out on some weird drug that apparently compels them to grab a crowbar or shovel and just start swinging at whatever is moving.So how does all of this give Condemned's combat a unique taste?  I've played a huge number of violent games, and they rarely cause me to miss a step - but most of the time these involve blasting demons or taking out zombies.  When they do involve 'real life' violence, maybe something like Grand Theft Auto, it's usually very over the top or abstracted.  This is not the case at all in Condemned.  The battles are violent and not really glorified.  When you finish beating down a strung out drug addict with a sledgehammer, you really feel like you just finished beating down a strung out drug addict with a sledge hammer.  There's no glorious UI sound with a health pack drop or anything, just a dead homeless guy with perhaps the last remnants of his dying wail still echoing through the concrete and metal.  You definitely have to be ok with this to enjoy Condemned.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000B69E9G","description":"In Resident Evil 4 you'll know a new type of horror, as the classic survival-horror action returns with all-new characters, controls and storylines. We last saw Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 2 - a rookie cop in Raccoon City, fighting to stay alive. That was six years ago. Since then, government forces have managed to control the zombie threat and Leon has become a Federal agent. When the President's daughter is kidnapped, Leon tracks her to a remote, hidden fortress in Europe - where he'll relive the horror he faced six years before.   Players will face never-before-seen enemies that make Nemesis seem like a kitten. You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","reviewerName":"David Foskin \"SneakyGoblin on XBL\"","summary":"Thank god its not GC exclusive!","reviewText":"A few years ago, while I was reading my favourite Playstation magazine, I came across an article on Resident Evil 4. Yes!! I am a massive fan ever since I played the original. There were a few pictures and brief insight as it was very early news. I was all worked up and excited! You play as Leon Kennedy! He was great, almost an equal to Chris Redfield! The next month I was devastated. My trusty magazine had just informed me that it was to be Nintendo Game Cube exclusive! Nooooooooooooo....!!!!But then, on the 4th day in November, I collected my copy for the PS2 from the Royal Mail Office (It should have been posted through my letter box but I won't go into that now, read my \"10 things that annoy me\" review to find out). It seems Capcom didn't forget about its fans after all....Resident Evil 4 gives a very warm return to Leon S Kennedy, the rookie cop from Resident Evil 2. It is six years since the Raccoon city incident and the notorious Umbrella Corporation has been destroyed. Now he is a government agent assigned to rescue the President's daughter, Ashley Graham. Information leads him to a small village somewhere in Europe. Leon arrives escorted by three local policemen.Walking down a narrow path through the trees, Leon advances towards a small cottage. Inside there is a man with his back turned poking at a fire. Upon approaching him, the man picks up an axe and starts walking towards Leon. The latter has no choice but to open fire on the assailant. Leaping out of the window Leon finds that there are more armed attackers waiting.Welcome to Resident Evil....Changes------------------------------------There have been a lot of changes to the latest instalment of the Resident Evil series. All of them are a massive improvement!How annoying was it in the previous games when you knew there was a zombie around the corner, but you didn't know if you were shooting it due to the fixed camera? Admittedly, the fixed camera did help to make the scary atmosphere as you couldn't see what was around the next corner, and it did mean that hi-resolution backdrops could be used. Well, forget pre-rendered backgrounds, this beauty is in Full 3D! That's right; the camera is now close-up behind Leon, so you see what he sees. There is still the tense feel of the old camera as it is easy for enemies to sneak up from behind or the side as the camera is so close.It now means that aiming can be used fully. With each weapon (except the rifles) a red tracer laser shines out of the gun, a tiny circle at the end indicating when a target is locked on. It also makes it possible to have sniper rifles (Yes!).Who can forget those infamous door clips from the resident Evil series? (Every door you went through or most steps had a short intro, in the 1st person, of the character going through) Thought not... Well those of you who thought they were tediously annoying will be pleased to know that it has been scrapped completely! Most doors are opened by Leon in real time, while some have a short loading screen.Leon opens the doors slowly when you click on them, but double click and he will burst through with a good kick! Nice little touch!Another big change is the Inventory. The previous games allowed you to hold between 8 and 10 items (6 for Chris in Resi 1). It was always quite annoying because a key took up the same space as a shotgun!? Boxes were located around the game so that excess items could be stored until needed. Now you get a case with lots of little slots. Each weapon or item requires a different amount of space depending on the size. This means you can carry multiple weapons and herbs etc. Larger cases can be bought later on in the game.It is now essential to find money (ptas), either hidden in crates or from killing enemies. The amount you find varies and will not necessarily be in the same place each time you play. For example you might find 900 ptas in a vase, then die and load back up, and the same vase might hold 800 ptas or ammo. The money is used to purchase weapons or upgrades, which brings me on to the next big change...The item boxes have been scrapped as Leon can now hold much more. In its place is \"The Merchant\". This guy pops up all over Resident Evil 4, noticeable by the blue torches. There are three options to choose from, Sell, Buy or Tune Up.Sell gives you the opportunity to make money from any treasure you have found. Also if you want another weapon and have no space left, you can sell any item including weapons. The latter can be bought back at a higher price if needed.Buy lets you purchase weapons or rare items, such as treasure maps or larger cases. There is also the option to buy a First-Aid spray; there is only limited amounts so don't go thinking you can replenish whenever he's around.Tune Up allows you to improve almost all your weapons, at a high price of course! There are four parts to improve, Shot Power, Firing Speed, Reload Speed and Capacity. These can be upgraded to a maximum of level 6, although some weapons cannot. There is also the possibility for an \"Exclusive\" upgrade to some weapons. This comes about much later on and costs heavily. The Exclusive upgrade has a special enhancement on the selected weapon; for example, the Handgun has a x5 chance increase of Critical Headshots, and the Shotgun has the same Shot Power from all distances!The structure of the new Resi Evil is very different from it's predecessors. The old games were one big long level, divided into different places, but with no obvious level start and finish.Now it has taken on a \"Devil May Cry\" type structure; although it is still one long level in a sense, it is divided by sub sections that are divided themselves, e.g. you could be on level 4 - 3. At the end of each section you are shown your accuracy, number of enemies defeated and number of continues taken. You are also giving the option to save the game.Ink Ribbons have been removed totally. The typewriter is still there, but you can now save to your heart's content! This is a welcome loss, as it was so annoying when you wanted to save but didn't have an Ink Ribbon. And to make things even better there are excessive amounts of typewriters everywhere (OK, maybe not excessive, but still loads)Enemies--------------------------------------The main enemies of Resident Evil 4 (Surprisingly!!) are humans! Well, I say humans, but they seem half human and half zombie?!?They talk (In Spanish I believe...) and they are intelligent to the extent that they dodge where your gun is pointing and sneak up on you. They also run! Which is quite terrifying when you need to reload! Also they climb through windows and open doors. But there is something not quite right with them. Remember the groaning zombie noise of the former games? Well it's back, but this time it's got more depth in the sound! (Don't ask me how but it just has!) And with it comes a quiet chant to themselves, so you can hear them before you see them.If one spots you they will point and shout to their companions of your presence. Keep your senses alert as they can come from anywhere; off roofs, through windows and form the doors behind you.They come with a range of weapons, from knives and spades to crossbows and even chainsaws! Some are protected by a wooden shield (a quick blast from the Shotgun should sort that out!) and there are others with a bullet proof helmet!To deal with the monsters most effectively you have to get a Critical head shot to make their head explode. Blood spurts out from the neck which is quite cool close up! But be careful later on as something can sprout from the neck.........Shooting the men/women in the legs causes them to fall to the floor, very good for when faced with multiple foes.There are sections with new and different foes, but I won't give too much away...!Interactive--------------------------------The Resi Evil world is now more interactive thanks to it being 3D. Crates and vases can be smashed and hold valuable ptas or ammo. Also there are treasures hidden throughout the game that you shoot to make them drop. Some doors and windows can be shot through, breaking them with each shot.There are a lot of puzzles or objects that need to be shot in a certain place in order to progress, e.g. a drawbridge stuck half open, shoot the brackets on the wall to make it fall.Graphics----------------------------------The graphics in resident Evil 4 are exceptional! Everything is so smooth and highly detailed with a great use of colour and lighting. The latter seeps through windows and cracks and looks misty from the dust. Even the caves in the game are packed with detail, the walls really look real! The animation and detail on the Bosses is the best I have seen in any game (Watching the endless body parts shoot out of a man's body will leave you in awe!).The water is again amazing, with great colour and depth to it. The scene on the lake is jaw-dropping; it has fog and bits floating in the water, and it moves with excellent realism! Not to mention the creature that lurks beneath.....!!Sub Missions---------------------------------There are a couple of sub-missions in the main game, most notably the Bottle-Caps. The Merchant runs some shooting ranges in the Castle; select your choice of weapons, either automatic or sniping. The idea is to earn as many points as you can to gain Bottle-Caps. There are 24 to collect and they can be viewed in the treasure menu. Click on them for a close up, and they even have a sound effect! A small, but fun little extra to distract you from the chaos outside...!Weapons---------------------------------There are many new weapons in Resi Evil 4. I won't ruin any surprises by mentioning them all; instead I will give a brief description of a few earlier in the game:KnifeIt wouldn't be Resi Evil without the trusty knife. This time it has a greater use and is easier to use. Hold L1 and the knife is quickly taken out. Use it to smash crates etc to save on ammo.+Advantages - Doesn't require ammo-Disadvantages - Hardly any damage, can only be used at close rangeHandgunSmall but effective, the 9mm handgun will be the weapon most used as there is a lot of ammo and is fairly easy to get that precious head shot. It only takes up 6 slots too.+Advantages - Lots of ammo available, accurate-Disadvantages - Lacks powerShotgunA must carry at all times weapon. Ideal for multiple enemies or when confronted by a stronger foe as it will send them flying backwards. Ammo is sparse so keep an eye on your supply.+Advantages - Very powerful close range, excellent for dealing with multiple enemies-Disadvantages - Not very good at distances, takes up a lot of spaceRifleAn old bolt-action rifle with a scope fitted allowing Leon to zoom in on far away targets. A more powerful scope is avaliable from the Merchant.+Advantages - Extremely accurate, Powerful-Disadvantages - Slow reloadGrenadesThere are three types of grenade; Hand Grenade Large explosion), Flash Grenade (Blinds enemy) and Incendiary Grenade (Bursts into flame). Equip like a normal weapon and throw in the same way.+Advantages - Large damage radius, helpful for blinding Bosses-Disadvantages - Too many can take up a lot of space, can cause damage to yourselfBroken ButterflyA powerful Magnum that comes at a high price. Get this in for those tougher monsters!+Advantages - Extremely powerful, Size of a Handgun-Disadvantages - Limited ammo, Expensive to upgrade, Long reloadRocket LauncherThe ultimate weapon! Use this against the Bosses or any tough situations!+Advantages - Kills virtually everything, large damage radius-Disadvantages - Very expensive, only one rocket a time, Takes up a lot of spaceFlaws------------------------------------The only real flaw to this superb game is that you cannot side step or move while aiming. It means that in order to shoot round a corner you have to run forward and turn, exposing yourself to the enemy. But then it may have been intended to keep the tension high as it is very difficult to see what is round the next corner, and you have to stay rooted to the spot while enemies lunge at you which is quite terrifying! So maybe it's not a flaw after all......Another flaw is that at certain points in the game you find yourself running or dodging various attacks. This is fine in itself, but when running you are told to vigorously bash 'X' then have to press either the buttons or 'X' and square when prompted. It doesn't allow you much time to perform this action so your reactions have to be fast! The trouble is that I found myself constantly dying and it became a trial and error process. And sometimes the buttons change! It's not too bad a flaw, just gets a bit tedious after the 3rd attempt...Summary----------------------------------Resident Evil 4 has a more tense atmosphere than it's predecessors. This is mainly down to the music and sound effects. When an enemy is present, the music kicks in and doesn't stop until they have all been eliminated.The scariest moment for me was the small maze. You can hear the dogs breathing heavily but you have no idea which corner they lurk around! I jumped on more than one occasion when a dog has snuck up on me! Being able to hear the monsters before you can see them gets your heart thumping and every little noise gets your adrenaline going.The enemy eyes are another big 'chill' factor; they are a dead red and close up their stare can be very intimidating! All the more reason to blow their head's off!The infamous puzzles of the previous games have been reduced dramatically which thankfully doesn't slow down the games pace. There are some puzzles, but they are so easy you hardly notice them.Amazingly there is hardly any returning to previous places. Other Resi Evil titles depended on this to extend the playing time, which could result in frustration. RE4 hardly suffers from this problem at all, thanks to the vast size of the levels. The maps are like a narrow tunnel, with barely any branching off, but it goes unnoticed thanks to the superb aiming system that fools you into thinking that you can play it how you like.Capcom have done an excellent job redesigning the whole structure, and have pushed the PS2 to its highest peak!Overall: 97%-------------------------------This game is a virtually flawless, action-packed, enjoyable masterpiece that is quite possibly the greatest game of 2005!This will keep you entertained for a good few weeks, and when played alone in the dark will get your heart pounding and your forehead sweating!The main game takes a good 15-17 hours to complete (Not including dying) and there are also some extras to unlock.Most notably it has five extra Ada Missions that were not in the Game Cube version (Haha), expanding on her background and why she's there. It coincides with Leon's missions and shows just how she helped him out. And it takes about 5 hours to go through so it is a very welcomed addition!There is also another Ada mission, and the good old Mercenaries, which has unlockable characters!And if that wasn't enough, on completion of the game you also get a \"Professional mode\" for those of you who love a good challenge!A must buy for all fans of the genre (and everybody else actually...) If you enjoyed any of the previous games, you will love this!I know this was a long read, but it is such a good game that I had to put it all in! The game is worth it! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did writing it :D","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2005"}

They all have the older blue-lit one and apparently it is superior to this new orange-lit one (and prettier to look at in the dark).Normally Logitech makes a fantastic product so I'm surprised these are such junk.  Like many others I've had the key I'm pressing just stop registering.  A few times, it has stuck and my character won't stop running around or jumping or filling the screens with the letter \"s\" over and over.In addition, the keys just don't register very well and their design is really poor.  Some are really sensitive but others aren't.  Some depress easily and some don't.  And still others are \"Squishy\" and stick.  Unfortunately, that is the case with my spacebar of all dang keys.  You know how often you use the spacebar? My typing speed has plummeted because I have to press the spacebar key sometimes 3 or more times before it registers because it hasn't lifted back up since the last time I used it - and when I do press on it it takes a lot of pressure to get it to go down.  It feels like air is getting under it.  Weird, I've never had a keyboard act like this one.In the end, I'm not really impressed.  You get a cool looking keyboard and lit keys, but you pay out the nose for it.  And it doesn't work very well - so the people it is designed for (serious computer folks) are going to get tired of its behavior really fast.Oh, almost forgot to mention.  You only get a 1-year warranty on this pile.  Even Logitech knows it is a junk product.  If you buy one, hopefully you'll get a good one that will last for you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2008"}
{"product_name":"B001CRM3YQ","reviewerName":"Twins Daddy","summary":"5-Star Game From THE Creators of the FPS!!","reviewText":"Wolfenstein is MORE than just a video game...It's a STATE OF MIND. It isn't Resistance, MW2 or the COD series. It's WOLFENSTEIN and it's just about a PERFECT game for this FPS theme! I've read reviews here that claim such nonsense as \"it should've come out years ago\" and games like COD4, RE5, etc now make this a \"dated\" game...Ridiculous! Of course it isn't MODERN warfare because it's a WWII era game. And if you compare it to the original shareware Id games of Wolfenstein & Doom that practically CREATED the FPS genre of video gaming, then you'll be floored by just how COMPLETE of a game this Wolfenstein version has become!Someone wrote it's \"one of the worst video games I ever played\"...That is, until you read his other reviews because he specializes in 1 and 2-star game reviews. He also had a problem with how \"hard\" the enemies were...Come on! That's why there's a difficulty LEVEL. I played this SP campaign through on Normal over the course of 5 days. Yes, there are sufficient challenges, particularly in some boss battles. But if it's just too much for you to take, then maybe you have it dialed up too much on difficulty or perhaps FPS games just aren't for you.Wolf excels in many areas, including audio. The SOUND, VOICE TALENT and IN-GAME SOUNDTRACK are flat-out some of the BEST I'VE EVER HEARD in a PS3 game! I played this game in a video game rocker (Pyramat PM420W) and I could hear EVERYTHING: Nazis screaming orders, water trickling, gunshots and explosions that constantly gave me a subwoofer massage -- JUST EXCELLENT!! The sound, voice talent and music are just so PERFECT for a Nazi-killin game that it truly created an immersive gaming experience. Near the end just hearing Hans Grosse mock you and scream things like, \"You're just one man Blaskowitz...You can't defeat the Third Reich!\" and \"Zis is FUN!\" while he's constantly blowing you away is just AWESOME. I'll admit it got a little old hearing the same things over and over (because this is a multi-stage final BOSS battle where you'll probably die several times before you get the Endgame Trophy). But who wants an anti-climactic pushover boss battle to end a game?Another reason it's nonsense to complain about how hard the enemies are is because they DO give you the weapons and resources to defeat each one in their own way. There are 8 Weapons and 4 Crystals that can be used in various combinations when confronted with a certain kind of bad guy -- That's called GAMEPLAY STRATEGY. You don't just pick up an SMG or Panzerschreck and go off unloading your ammo, pick up more ammo, unload your ammo, etc. You have to THINK on your feet and plan your way through this game and I LIKE IT that way! This is especially true when using \"The Veil\" and/or crystals that require constant recharging. When you consider the weapon/crystal combinations (somewhat like the weapon/plasmid combos in Bioshock), you really have an amazing amount of FIREPOWER at your disposal...And who doesn't like THAT in a shooter game?!? Like the audio, weaponry is PERFECT in this game!Video is just amazing to me too...But it's a different kind of video excellence than that in Uncharted 2 or MW2. For example, Uncharted 2 gives a feeling that you're starring in an action movie while Wolf NEVER LETS YOU FORGET that you're indeed playing a video game. It doesn't try to be something that it isn't. The Veil turns the screen into a dismal, even ugly place that's straight out of a John Carpenter nightmare...But it's INTENTIONAL. This isn't a flaw in video quality at all. In fact, I'm amazed that you can view the \"normal\" screen of whatever you're looking at and with a push of the down button you hear a quite unique \"chant\" and your view almost instantly transforms to this unearthly green...No frame rate drops or hiccups, just smooth as a baby's bottom. This HAD to be some kind of video technology feat of engineering because it's just not something you find in any other game...EVER. You can use the Veil or not, or use it sparingly. I actually found myself playing through the entire game with the Veil ON, since it shows \"secret\" doors, enemy weak spots and it helped me get infinitely more Nazi head shots. Video quality is EXCELLENT throughout Wolf and some of the weapons produce \"special effects\" that would look right at home in a summer blockbuster!The story is EXTREMELY WELL-DEVELOPED, almost to a flaw. They could've left half of the stuff out and I'd still get it: We're hunting Nazis that have been developing Top Secret occult-based weapons that could end the World as we know it...So get em any way you can! And the developers put in quite a few well-done \"cinematics\" that clear up any questions you might have. While they aren't movie quality like Uncharted 2, do they really NEED to be? I don't play shooters so I can sit back and watch movies...Give me something to shoot at, man!The checkpoint save system is also good so you don't lose 20 or 30 minutes of progress when a Nazi gets lucky and puts you down. Plus, it's AUTOMATIC. The \"Gold, Intel, Tomes\" scavenger hunts may seem like a burden to some, but it's an INTEGRAL PART of the game and your degree of FUN. You don't want to show up at the Black Market with empty pockets. There are ALL KINDS of upgrades you can buy that improve your gaming experience. For example, out of all of the fancy weaponry at my disposal, I mainly stuck with the trusty Kar98 and the MP43 MG...And that's where I upgraded. Scopes & silencers on both, double-drum mag for the MP43, big bore mod, etc. I also liked the crystal upgrade that lets you see enemies through walls! You don't spend time & $$$ upgrading weapons only to find you can only carry 1 or 2 at a time. In a Half-Life 2 kind of way, you can press R2 to temp stop gameplay and L-Stick to the weapon of your choice when you need it. So EASY, but so often overlooked by other shooter developers. Again, PERFECT here.Something that did annoy me was how much time had to be spent in the City, and in particular, going back and forth between Midtown East/West and Downtown East/West. This seemed to be filler and because the same environments kept coming back up again and again it did get repetitive...And even though different mission objectives, weapon upgrades and new enemy types kept things interesting, I can say I was glad to finally leave the city. Along the same lines, I also got tired of going to the Safe Houses to listen to boring people give new missions. But if you have to cut some development corners, these are common areas where it's done. These annoyances never got close to making me pull the plug on the game...One reason I haven't played Wolf before now is because of a couple of bad reviews here on Amazon and average published reviews. But if you're a hard-core shooter like me, those reviews are PURE NONSENSE! An experienced player on HARD level should get nearly 20 hrs gameplay out of Wolf the first time through the SP Campaign and the game will even track your total playtime for you along with other stats (nice touch). Beat it once and it opens up the CHEAT Codes if you so desire to use them...I've played most of the shooters on the PS3, and the best ones have each carved out their own little niche in the genre. Wolfenstein is no exception. In terms of Nazi killing, Wolf's SP Campaign is far superior to COD: WaW and it makes COD3 look like a PS2 game. It's got to be extremely difficult to create an atmosphere that sucks players in to the extent Wolfenstein does...And it requires EXCELLENCE in every area of the game: gameplay, audio, video, controls, weaponry, strategy, uniqueness and a progressive pace. Wolfenstein is COMPLETE in every one of these and makes for a memorable gaming experience for all FPS fans who understand that every game isn't a Modern Warfare title...If they were, we'd all get bored pretty quickly with our PS3s.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-21-2010"}

The Campaign is good & the Forge is alot deeper than the previous installment. Firefight is also fun. That being said, The multiplayer is a disapointment. There are improvements in animation/graphics & customizables such as buying new peices of armor by earning credits from playing, but Im sorry to say the heart of the gameplay is lame. It has aleady bored me. Instead of adding and improving on what was near perection in Halo3, they screwed with major parts of the game mechanics such as armor ablities and reticule bloom. The vechicles have also been rewened. The maps are mostly dull and not well thought out in  my opinion. The only thing better about Reach multiplayer is the Headhunter gametype. Coming from a person who has spent countless hrs playing big team battles in H3, i can say that after playing Reach for only a few days, I am kinda bored with it. I belive these changes have been made to apeal to the casual gamers( thats code for u dont need skill to play this game). This is probably why most people will like it, cus most players have no skill. Its also the easiest Halo ever. Not long before I go back to Halo 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M4","description":"It's often argued that Nintendo makes the best video games in the world,  but one thing the company isn't known for is scary games. If you thoughtLuigi's Mansionwas  frightening, then quite frankly you've led a sheltered life.Eternal  Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, however, is the real deal: it's scary, it's  gory, and it's really nothing likeResident Evilat all.The game starts when you find out your grandfather has had his clogs popped by  some unspeakable monster. While rummaging through his stuff (alone, at night, in  his huge mansion) you come across a jolly little hardback calledThe Tome of  Eternal Darkness, and upon reading it you suddenly find yourself controlling  a Roman centurion in 26 B.C. Persia. And this is how the game continues--you  find and read a passage of the book in the mansion and then control a series of  11 completely different characters over the course of two millennia.Apart from the innovative structure of the game, the other big selling points ofEternal Darknessare its sanity effects--every time you see a monster and  fail to kill it your sanity level will drop. If it drops too far, you start  seeing things: flies walking along the inside of your screen, messages telling  you your controller is unplugged when it clearly isn't, and all sorts of other  clever freakery.The game's not perfect, though; the combat is a little too fiddly, and it's  still not quite as scary asSilent Hill, butEternal Darknessis  an unusual and rewarding title that should finally shut up those annoying twerps  that insist Nintendo only makes games for kids.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Martin Carbonella","summary":"Undoubtedly the best unknown game on the Gamecube.","reviewText":"A Classic seriously under the radar!

It is without question one of the most unique video game experiences to be had anywhere.  I am not sure how to describe or classify it.  It isn't really a life simulation, even though some aspects of it do mirror the gameplay mechanics of Electronic Arts' \"The Sims\".  I have played \"The Sims\", and I must say that even with all that it has to offer, it lags behind \"Animal Crossing\" where sheer fun is concerned.Animal Crossing has cartoony looking characters and animals, but this aspect really only adds to its charm.  Looking at screenshots, one gets the impression that the game is childish, and may only have been designed for kids.  The game really has to be played for several hours (spanned over several days) in order for the player to begin to experience what this game is all about.  The graphics, while they do have slightly blurry textures, are completely charming.  I love them.  The character design is brilliant.  While the game does not showcase the GameCube as the graphics powerhouse that it can be, the player becomes so engrossed in the game that you will never even think about the graphics.  In several instances, I actually found myself marveling at the subtle graphical touches this game employs, even though they are low resolution or low polygon by todays standards.Gameplay is where this game excels.  Be careful and ready to be completely consumed if you buy this game.  Although I don't wish to repeat everything other reviewers have mentioned, this game can't be given an honest weighing-in without mention of the real time clock.  When it is 11:21am on March 3rd in real life, it will be in Animal Crossing too.  If you don't play the game for a week, the next time you do your neighbors will wonder where you have been and there will be weeds growing all over town. This adds a very real aspect to the game.  Characters sleep at night.  They buy things, get mail, send mail, build igloos, go shopping, visit other towns, move in and out of your town, go fishing, donate items to museums, catch bugs, catch fish, find fossils, garden, listen to music, play classic Nintendo games, make clam chowder, design clothing and umbrellas, visit a tropical island, and the list goes on and on.Game Boy Advance (GBA) connectivity feature:  If you own a GBA, you can enjoy even more features in Animal Crossing.  Yes... This does sound gimmicky, and it is at first.  You will soon discover though, that Nintendo has implemented a feature that is currently immpossible to duplicate on any other company's game system.  That feature is that there are about a dozen or more classic Nintendo NES games that you can gain access to in Animal Crossing.  These games are downloadable to your GBA, provided you have purchased the Nintendo GameCube/GBA cable.  Yes, you can walk around and play Donkey Kong on your GBA, but only if you are fortunate enough to uncover it in Animal Crossing.E-reader feature:  In addition to owning a GBA, if you purchase Nintendo's E-reader, you can collect collectible Animal Crossing cards and upload them through your GameBoy Advance and into the Animal Crossing game itself.  These cards can contain characters, music, furniture, other 8-bit NES games,etc.  I don't yet own and E-reader, but I will buy one soon.  There is just so much to do in this game, that I can't currently imagine adding a whole other aspect to it.In summation:  Animal Crossing is easily the most innovative game of the year.  It takes the addictive concept of \"The Sims\" one step further by acutally making it... drumroll please... ENJOYABLE.  It gets even more fun when there are more players because they can leave mail and gifts for each other.  The music and graphics while not technically groundbreaking, are charming and of the highest design calibur you could ask for.  The songs actually get stuck in my head sometimes because they are so catchy.  I have never enjoyed non-violence and creating friendship so much in a game because these are usually things that players are never rewarded for.  I only wish that games this unique and well-executed graced our consoles more often.  In my opinion, Animal Crossing is the best game of the year... and yes I have played Metroid Prime which is the best adventure game I have ever played.  Enjoy!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2003"}

I tried it for about 2-3 hours and just couldn't get into it. So I traded it in on my next visit to that every popular game place.Then came the dreams. Waking. Sleeping. In my car. At the grocery story when deciding on which brand of frozen waffles to buy. Filling my car up with gas. EVERYWHERE I went I heard Pata-Pata-Pata-PON. I could not get this out of my head. It was like a mantra---and it wouldn't let go.So couple more weeks pass while I try my best to get this out of my head (and my life...I mean I didn't even have the game anymore!). Finally one day I just completely caved. I bought another copy. Good to know I've supported this game not once but twice.I tried it again and this time kept playing when I got to the rain juju part. I figured out what to do with an online walkthrough which really helped me. I now play every night but for only about an hour. I figure if I feed my addiction it can't get the best of me right?

In Chrono Trigger prepare yourself to journey into the forgotten past, distant future, and even to the very End of Time.The Worlds of Past, Present and FutureIn Chrono Trigger you'll journey back to Prehistory (65,000,000 B.C.) where humans and reptiles battle to wipe each other from existence. Antiquity (12,000 B.C.) is an age where the world is divided between people whose continent is buried in snow, and the magical kingdom of Zeal, a highly advanced civilization. The Middle Ages (600 A.D.) is an era of swords and sorcery, a dark time when the armies of Fiendlord rule over the land.The Present (1000 A.D.) is the time period in which Crono, Lucca and Marle live. It is a bright and peaceful age. However, in the Future (2300 A.D.), an era of despair has taken hold with rogue machines ruling the world. After the day of the apocalypse in 1999 A.D., the prosperous civilization of humanity crumbled and the remaining people struggle to stay alive. And, finally, there remains the End of Time -- a place with no era to call its own. This confluence of time's streams transcends spatiotemporal boundaries. It is here at the gravitational center for all temporal flotsam that Spekkio -- the Master of War -- serves as your guide on time's treacherous roads.Battle Systems and gameplayThis game utilizes a revised version of the groundbreaking Active Time Battle (ATB) System. Chrono Trigger features exhilarating combat in which the clock is constantly ticking. Characters must first wait as the ATB gauges charge, and then perform an action. This makes strategic timing a crucial element in your battle plan. In addition to standard attacks, each character has an array of special Tech skills and powerful combos known as Dual and Triple Techs. Cooperate with other characters to unleash over 50 unique and devastating moves!Chrono Trigger utilizes great story-telling, interesting characters, action-packed gameplay, and the unique controls of the Nintendo DS to deliver a fun and well-rounded role-playing game on a portable platform.","reviewerName":"Stephen G.

This is both good and bad,  if you enjoyed playing final fantasy 7 you may want the same thing for every game that came after that,  but the same old thing can get a little dull.  I have enjoyed every final fantasy game I have played, because I am a big fan or the series,  they are not perfect and they have their flaws,  but this game gives you an experience it keeps you playing for hours and hours,  if it was really dreadful why keep playing why not return it to block buster or trade it in for a new game,  it kept you playing and that says something.This game is a little to linear,  it seems to be missing the open world feel that most of the other games had,  When Final Fantasy came to the ps2 for the first time final fantasy X, and X2, were the same way, you followed a path until you got an airship and then you could pick locations on that path,  this game is slightly worse in that regard,  there are no towns to visit,  there is no chatting with people or exploration which is disappointing for an rpg which is supposed to have an interactive quality,  the game play is more like a shooter game in which you move from point to point.I have seen huge reviews of this game and want to keep mine short if you want an entire list of the faults this game has other people have written them out ad nausea,  I am just here to say its not perfect,  but it will keep you entertained,  it like all the other final fantasy games are a progression,  this game will inform the developers how to make the next one and that one will help with the one that follows it,  and so on.If your looking for a smooth fun game you can spend time mastering and having fun with you may enjoy this game,  it may be worth renting it first to see how you like it,  but it's not the worst game ever,  in fact it is quite fun,  if you can relax and stop getting upset about what you don't enjoy and focus on the positives,  such as amazing graphics, and some what interesting narrative, and the fact that the story is less convoluted then some of final fantasy's other works.All in all it's a game meant to be enjoyed, and debated over, if there is one thing final fantasy has perfected it is creating games that some people love, and some people hate and that people in the middle play and enjoy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003O6EATE","description":"","reviewerName":"OJ Silk","summary":"Big Power, Small Support","reviewText":"The Vita Challenges:No one can deny that the PS Vita is the most powerful handheld out there. It's obviously not as powerful as a PS3 but you can take it with you everywhere you go. The 5-inch OLED screen is phenomenal. It's two major issues at the moment have nothing to do with the system itself, which is fantastic on it's own merit. Lack of games/support is challenge #1. In addition, the heavily advertised cross-platforming is almost non-existent. I use it with \"MLB 12 The Show\" and it's great but \"Madden 13\" (coming 8/28) won't have it, for example. Less than a handful of games have it at the moment. That's very disappointing. Challenge #2 is the price point. Not too many consumers will shell out the money for it until it's priced below it's more powerful, console big brother. Therefore -- I for one -- hope Sony will drop the price so it will sell more, gain momentum and hence, support (because I'm plenty happy with what it can do).Other notes of interest:I use the Vita for gaming only but it has a nice camera, ok browser and other features like Music & Video Players. I simply prefer the iPhone/iPad for those -- just the same as I don't like playing games on the iPhone/iPad. I'm not particularly thrilled with the User Interface, as I wish I could customize it more. I would have preferred a PS3 style UI & don't like that I can't delete pre-loaded stuff. Battery life is ok (about 3.5 hrs). That's to be expected -- I think -- with such a powerful handheld. Although, I'm not pleased that the battery can't be taken out and replaced (meaning I'll HAVE TO go the Sony route to fix it, if needed). Overall, the system is a 4.5 to me (rounded up to 5). It's very good & can be great with more support.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2012"}

Crafted by one of the co-creators of Call of Duty and other key developers behind the Call of Duty franchise, Titanfall is an all-new universe juxtaposing small vs. giant, natural vs. industrial and man vs. machine. The visionaries at Respawn have drawn inspiration from their proven experiences in first-person action and with Titanfall are focused on bringing something exciting the next generation of multiplayer gaming.KEY FEATURESFast-Paced Future Warfare &#x2013;In Titanfall the advanced warfare of tomorrow gives you the freedom to fight your way as both elite assault Pilot and agile, heavily armored 24&#x2019; tall Titans. Titanfall rethinks fundamental combat and movement giving players the ability to change tactics on the fly, attacking or escaping depending on the situation.The Future of Online Multiplayer Action  &#x2013;The game is entirely multiplayer, in a new experience that combines fast-paced online action with the heroic set piece moments traditionally found in campaign mode. The intersection of the two is a big part of what gives Ttianfall its iconic identity.The Visionaries that Defined Gaming for a Generation are back! &#x2014;Founded in 2010, Respawn Entertainment was formed by Vince Zampella and Jason West, former co-founders of Infinity Ward and two of the co-creators of the multi-billion dollar franchise Call of Duty&#x2122; They are building on their pedigree and taking a new approach to game design and creating an all new universe with TitanfallSystem Requirements:Supported OS:&nbsp;Windows XP&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows Vista&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Originaccount required for game activation and installation","reviewerName":"Adron Gardner","summary":"Call of Titan:  Vanquish Warfare","reviewText":"Don't get me wrong, Vanquish is one of my favorite games and though Call of Duty has worn out it's welcome, it can still be fun.Titanfall takes the shooting mechanics of Call of Duty and mixes it with the futuristic glittery bullet storm of Vanquish to mixed effect.  The explosions are great and the shooting is solid, but there's a lot missing in this game.SINGLE player campaigns aren't really that great in Call of Duty, but it feels sorely lacking here in Titanfall.  The \"campaign\" feels like it would be an offline co-op mode in any other game that hasn't been on such a hype train as this.  But despite some decent maps, one or two that are downright cool, you'll find yourself wondering over and over again, if this is worth $60.  What is here is mostly well done, but it feels thin.  You get TDM, Domination and Capture the flag modes with the Last Titan Standing in there too, but it's a mixed bag as I'll get to below.  There's just not much here to justify the price.  You can easily pick up any number of equally entertaining MP shooters that are as good or better for half the price right now or even free to play.  I really wish I had paid $30 for this instead of $60.WARNING:  the game is like a 50 gig install, supposedly because of the audio, whatever the case, that's insane and just poorly packaged.  I have not touched the XBO edition, but after I gunned through the beta and now purchased my own full digital copy of Titanfall, I'm very surprised how poorly it runs on my rig.  No doubt better drivers and patches will surely improve the experience, but on a GTX 780 paired with a fairly new OC i7 rig with 32gb of RAM, the frame drops and stuttering are head scratchers other than some poor threading or memory usage. Kill the 16x texture filtering at 2560x1600 and things get better. Flip off the V-Sync, you end up with some abominable tearing in its place.  While the art design is untouchable - spectacular even -  and the waterfall of color is a breath of fresh air to so many gloomy looking games, a Source Engine based game with so little graphic bells and whistles, the game should absolutely run better than this.  I'm not sure where the glitch is, but if Battlefield 4 runs like glass on my machine maxed out, then I'm not sure what the excuse is for Respawn other than they ran out of time.  Last Titan Standing is a pretty good place to see where the frame rate \"Falls\" so to speak.  Maybe there's just too many articulated pieces to the Titan models chewing up memory.  I have no idea.WEAPONS don't get much more interesting when you climb to the top of the ranks after a week and when you do get to the top, there's just not a whole lot left to do.  What could really give this game legs - other than an interesting story to fit the interesting Titans - would be the ability to customize the heck out of the Titans themselves.  Color, outfits, the whole nine yards would be a boon to this.  But it's not here.  My guess is this is just a demo for Titanfall 2 which wouldn't surprise me were it to show up in less than a year.  I think the biggest knock to the game is not really the shooting, which feels pretty much like Call of Duty but the actual combat.  It's a mess.  Chaos can be fun, but half the time when it's Titan to Titan, it feels like a whole bunch of button mashing.  This is what we've come to in games for 2014?OVERALL, if you think you'll be cranking out the hours on this gunning through Robot Jox the game, then pick it up, however, if you want a polished, revolutionary product packed with content ------> give it 3-6 months, no really.  The price will certainly drop and the DLC will certainly come packed in a GOTY edition down the road.  If you're lucky, the game will run a lot better by then too.  That is unless they pull a Valve like LFD2 and release the sequel by the end of the year.For what you get so far, forget paying $60 unless you know what you're getting in to.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2014"}

For 16-bit rendition, it's epic and very time consuming. There's loads to do, and the story's very compelling.

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Jon Snow","summary":"Always people on Xbox Live playing Halo 2","reviewText":"This game is an average FPS, but the fun of it is you always have competition on xbox live","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2005"}

Fulkerson","summary":"a great addition to the Madden series","reviewText":"Madden 2010 is a definite improvement over last year's game, and it looks absolutely amazing.  The inclusion of an expanded franchise mode, the online gameplay and the controls have all significantly improved.  However, there are a few faults that make me scratch my head.  After all, this is the 2010 addition, so I shouldn't have to remember back to an earlier addition where some aspects of the game seemed better.As I stated before, the graphics are incredible.  Everything from the lights shining off helmets to the players facial features are painstakingly detailed, and it makes the gameplay extremely realistic.  The online franchise mode is superb.  I haven't fully delved into this yet as you need to have quite a few friends to play with in order for it to have the depth it needs, but the options you have here are truly impressive.  Another really cool aspect are the actions that happen in addition to the game, such as fans screwing around, coaches screaming, and QB's babbling on the phone.  It definitely adds some realism, and it can be pretty hilarious as well.  I have heard some complaints about the in-game commentary, but it isn't any worse or better than the old Madden/Michaels chatter.  However, it could be better, and I sincerely hope EA attempts to better this part of the game.  For instance, the commentary rarely ever mirrors what is actually happening on the field.  If I complete an 80 yard touchdown pass, I want Collingsworth to wet his pants with excitement.  Instead, he sort of mumbles something about a \"good play\".The issues I have with this game are in the controls.  I know that EA is trying to make the gameplay more realistic, but sometimes I feel like it's a hindrance to the fun of the game.  Playing defense can be frustrating in particular.  In the older Madden games it was much easier to play defense as the controls were as tight as possible.  In this game, the defenders kind of lumber along, and most interceptions happen out of total happenstance.  I feel that EA is going for more realistic delays and adjustments as the defense adapts to the quickness of the offense, but it can be annoying when you're trying to free up your safety and he moves an additional five feet in the wrong direction after you push the stick on the controller.  Another issue I've always felt about the Madden series is the ease of executing the offense.  I've always thought that if you want a truly realistic football experience it shouldn't be so easy to score.  And boy is it easy in this game.  Another thing that is slightly annoying is that all the running backs run the exact same way.  None of them have their own style, and they all seem to lag a bit when cutting and jumping.  One aspect of this game that I could do without are the actions of the referees.  There are too many penalties, and in a video game this is where the realism gets in the way of the fun of the game.Having said that, this game is, by far, the best looking Madden addition in the franchise, and the franchise modes will keep you playing for years.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2009"}

Berri is the grey chipmunk on the right side of the cover in the pink two-piece. The control-response starts out really bad because Conker is drunk stupid. Then things clear up a bit after he talks to a marijuana plant. From there on, things just seem to get weirder.

As soon as I put the disc in, I was in gamer heaven. From the options, to the graphics, to the AI, and the fun factor, I was extremely happy with the game. It felt like new territory, stuff that hadn't been done to death before.The gameplay mechanics of fighting, puzzle solving, platform jumping, and simple exploring are mixed together perfectly. I love the control scheme, even the camera was well placed most of the time, though I wish I could have zoomed out more at times.The story, characters, and environments are great, but most important, I had fun all the way through (in about 12 hours). And I started a new game right after finishing it, now playing the whole game in German! It's great for us bi-linguals, that they have included other localization translations.I always liked adventure games a-la Ratchet and Clank etc, but Uncharted topped them all at this point. The mix of exploration comparable to Prince of Persia, with a good dose of humor and great action makes this one of my all-time favorites. Even the cliche *SPOILER* Evil German Nazi Zombie Monsters :) feel like a fresh addition. They are quick and when you have 20 or 30 of them coming at you, it's great clean fun for the whole family.Uncharted is a gem, and gamers should be hopeful that there is more to come from Naughty Dog. They did an awesome job with this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2007"}

I myself couldn't even make it through the original's campaign but in this one I put twenty hours in. I enjoyed my play through, but it wasn't without its faults.First off the missions themselves  tend to get a little too repetitive. Most of the game you must find your target using the big red crosshairs on the screen then kill him and finish off his guards to advance. That is better than the boring missions like sitting on a bench from the original, but it's still a little annoying at times. Yes there are some breathes of fresh air to the campaign like stealth, protection, and vehicle missions but these are the minority throughout the game.  There are burial tomb missions that are an excellent blend of platforming and killing. These are the most fun you'll have in the game, but there are only six of them.The graphics are nicely done even though you can tell that the graphics engine is getting a little outdated, but for a world this big I guess that's a small complaint. Most of the cutscenes look good and the voice acting is very well done. Nolan North and Kristen Bell return and give great performances. Ezio himself could have done a little better job but it's nothing that was too damaging. The climbing is faster this time around and works well most of the time, but there are times he just leaps off a building instead of grabbing the wall next to it.The combat has been updated and you now have a gun along with other assassin weapons. Even with the new weapons and customization to your outfit the combat is basically block and counter attack the entire time. You can now though hire whores, and weapon wielding men on rooftops to help you either distract or kill your foes respectively.There are side missions which include assassin contracts, message retrievals, and uncovering the truth puzzles. They are mostly just to add game time except for the Uncovering the truth missions which unravel a conspiracy as you find symbols throughout the world. Also there 100 feathers to collect along with buying upgrades to your town to earn you money.The story has its strengths and weaknesses. The beginning and end are riveting and very well done, but throughout the middle of the game you are simply on a path of revenge and the enemies seem to blur together as you take down dozens of conspirators. Desmond's story is much more interesting throughout even though the present day time doesn't get a lot of screen time in this one. Overall the story was good but if not for a sometimes boring middle section could have been great.Assassin's Creed 2 is a enjoyable twenty hour experience. Yes the game has its flaws that keep the series from being a five star success, but overall it is a fun bloody romp through Italy. The story when it is in stride is excellent and leaves you wanting more when the credits roll. Even the campaign missions themselves are exciting albeit a little repetitive. If you think you would enjoy being an assassin in early Italy then give this game a try. For its price tag it has a lot of content to be enjoyed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2011"}

I could spend hours just exploring the cities, admiring the architecture and pointlessly romping around. So I was concerned at the trailers for AC2 - it looked like it might be a more regimented storyline. Would AC2 limit your ability to just goof when ever you wanted off for the benefit of a plot? Would the missions be too long and be too convoluted? Would it lose the soul of the first which was exploration first, storyline second? Thankfully all of my fears were unfounded. AC2 is quite possibly the best sequel in any art media. They've taken the budding roots of AC1 and built a tree - not just any tree but a huge redwood full of branches and interesting knots, twists and turns. And you can explore it however and whenever you want. Missions are short and sweet and reward your character with just enough growth to make continuing with the story preferable, despite the OCD collector in me desperately trying to get out.There's simply so much to do and see and learn about, and such a varied way to do it all. From attacking to defending, stealth-play to exploring, everything is bigger and better. Even load times are faster despite the much more massive cities on offer, and there's no more forced listening to a god-awful cutscene before you can jump-in. Plus avid in-game item collectors such as myself are in heaven - I'd say I haven't seen this much to find in a game since Donkey Kong 64. Thankfully for the most part it's not just a case of randomly stumbling on flags either; now you can buy treasure chest maps for every part of the cities which pinpoint an item's location... and yet still finding some of the chests is still a challenge.Ubisoft have made such a vast game that there's little point in highlighting the features and fun stuff, I'm bound to leave something out. We're talking a 30+ hour single player game here folks. I applaud that duration heartily especially after washing the bitter taste of COD4:MW2's 5 hour SP campaign. So it's clearly it's hard to fault AC2 but it's not impossible... the opening sequence and build up to going back in the Animus is far, far too long and tedious and the mandatory timed missions are the bane of the game (ugh), but that doesn't mean that AC2 is not absolutely THE game of the year and the sequel of the decade.If you were put off by the first not quite working for you then don't hesitate to get this - it completely fulfills the promises of the first game and manages surpasses them beautifully.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWNZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Southpaw","summary":"If you liked Little Big Planet, you'll like this.","reviewText":"I usually play \"E\" games with my six-year-old nephew. So I appreciate it when developers work local co-op into games. This game has a drop in/drop out co-op mode. There's no split-screen that often accompanies games such as the Lego franchise. It's a charming, dark fairy tale. It reminded me a lot of Little Big Planet in terms of its charm. However, unlike LBP, its setting is dark. Initially, my nephew was a bit daunted by the musical score and environment. He found it to be ominous. However, once we began playing, he confided in me that his reservations about the game went away.The game is a 2D side-scrolling platformer and it takes place on a stage of a puppet show. You have the option to play it either using the Move Motion or Dual Shock controller. I am playing it using the latter. The first player plays as Kutaro, a puppet who's literally lost his head because the evil Moon Bear ate his head and transformed him into a wooden puppet.Like Little Big Planet, there's a narrator in Pupeeter. It's isn't long after you begin playing that Kutaro obtains a magical pair of scissors. With this pair of scissors, you can battle bosses and make your way through the different stages. You can glide upwards/downwards/sideways by cutting through fabric, paper, strings etc. The environment is made of arts and crafts.The boss battles consist of cutting through fabric instead of the traditional way of taking out any boss. In my opinion, this is what sets it apart from other traditional platforming games. (There isn't much of a learning curve while wielding the scissors and I managed to get the hang of it quickly. You get a basic tutorial after procuring the scissors.)Kutaro finds heads during the different stages. The heads are an eclectic bunch ranging from banana head to Spider head. It had my nephew laughing at the different heads we've amassed. You can carry 3 heads with you during a mission (and have the choice to choose between them).  If you lose a head, you lose a life, so it's important  to not lose your head. In the event you do lose a head (which is a lot), you can run after it and retrieve it. But it has to be done quickly, otherwise it will vanish and you'll end up losing a life.The second player plays a cat who can fly. Then, after defeating the first boss, you play as a fairy/princess. There isn't much that the cat and fairy/princess can do except for investigating certain objects in the environment and help Kutaro. If I'm not mistaken, you always use the Circle button, so it's pretty straightforward. My nephew enjoyed playing as the cat and fairy and I heard no complaints from him. Personally, I've gotten loads of help due to my nephew playing as my companion. Even though he is my sidekick, he helps me find heads and protects me from harm's way. I think this role is best suited to younger kids who want to play with their parents and/or older siblings.The game is punctuated by applause and gasps from the audience, which I found to be pretty neat. The artistry is imaginative and vivid. I was so taken by the visuals and graphics. The game looks amazing. I was more into the visuals than the story.My only gripe is that I'm not a fan of Quick Time Events (QTE) and this game employs it during the boss battles. I ended up losing my head quite a lot due to QTE. But  that's just me. If you like QTE, then you won't have a problem.This game auto-saves quite frequently, so rest assured that you won't have to wait long before the game saves your progress. Another thing I noticed is that you get bronze trophies VERY easily. I think of all the games I've played, this is the only game where I've gotten trophies easily. So if you're a trophy collector, this game will appeal to you.I'm mid-game and my nephew and I are enjoying it. If you're on the fence about it, I say go for it. It's a good game for the entire family.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2013"}

Swinging through the city and climbing on buildings is wonderful. The busy streets below is a great touch. Everything is highly detailed. The only thing I don't like about the graphics is the character models. The game developers didn't seem to have put much time into it. They're pretty stiff and lifeless. Also, there are dark areas in this game where it's hard to see just about everything that is around you. It helps to make your TV screen brighter. The control in this game is pretty good. I was worried that it would be too difficult and frustrating but it seems pretty solid. I picked up all of Spidey's moves very easily. The sound in the game is pretty good. Tobey's voice is a little flat and boring but that's just his personality. The music and other acting is pretty good.

Most importantly, innovation.THE MOVIES is a cross-genre hybrid, beautifully combining a SIMS game with a business-RTS one and a highly creative movie suit. Not only do you get to step into the shoes of a Hollywood mogul, but you get a shot in \"realizing\" that film you always had in you.The game starts with the design and building of your Studio (using up the allocated funds), complete with Script stables, Sound stages, Production offices and (ahemm...) casting-couches? (no...strangely THAT part of Hollywood was not included). Casting is prety straight forward, plucking some lucky characters from the waiting line and turning them into stars. Or script writers. Or directors. Or janitors. Yes, life is a bitch.What I liked about this game was its historic accuracy, simplified efficiency and clear-cut design. Not only are most stages in making a movie readily available and the means to achieve this evolve as time progresses, but everything has a familiar feel and self-evident practicality as well.Stars throwing tantrums and directors relaxing too much with the sauce; aging stars in need for nip/tacks - and always keeping an eye out for whoever has the bigger trailer!What I loved about this game was the opportunity to plan out the script in a detailed story-board and then shoot my own movies. The bad news is that if your visions are long and complicated your studio will be... bankrupt in no time, as it will release fewer and more expensive movies. But that is besides the point, is it not? What is a bankrupt studio in the wake of a iconoclastic new director towards his vision?In the end, although very entertaining in many ways, the strong suit of this game is not its Movie-Business Management Simulation but rather its Movie Creating editor.

WHY AMAZON PUT MY REVIEW ON THIS PAGE FOR A DIFFERENT PRODUCT, I DON'T KNOW. SEE THE BOTTOM FOR DIFFERENCES OF THE 2 STRAIGHT FROM THE TURTLE BEACH WEBSITE.==========================================================================================================I bought this based on someone talking about it in a SOCOM match. The reviews here also were good. First off, I don't have a true surround system. You really need that when playing shooter type games to hear where your enemy is around you. This headset does a pretty good job in helping you locate the enemy. But it is far from perfect. First off, its not built that well for the price. In \"Stereo Expander\" mode there is a loud background hiss. Chat Boost does not work at all. The quality of the headphone speakers are what you would expect from a $[...] pair of headphones. I know headphone quality, I have headphones ranging in price from $[...] to $[...]. And one of the most annoying things about this headset is the noise the plastic makes every time you move your head. All that being said, you can hear much more in a game then you would normally. I play SOCOM and my gameplay got better because now I can hear people walking around and tell which direction they are from me. The increase in my score was enough that if offsets all the negative things about this headset.PROSLong CordEasy Set UpHelps you locate the enemy in shooter gamesSeparate game and voice volume controlsBass Boost works moderately wellSeems sturdy enough to last awhileYou can turn the mic offGood for when you want to not play and wake people upCONSBackground hiss in expanded modeMaterials make noise whenever you moveSound quality not that greatEarphone cups are a little smallChat Boost doesn't work, at least not inSOCOM: US Navy Seals Confrontation Stand AloneOverall, if you don't have surround and play shooter type games I recommend it. Otherwise, I would not bother.UPDATE:  Keep an eye on the metal pin that holds the clip in place. It barely locks in and can work its way out. Took about 15 minutes to get it back in, pain in the butt. So check to see if its working its way out every so often.========================================================================================================FROM THE TURTLE BEACH WEBSITEEar Force P21 vs. PX21 ComparisonIf you're wondering what improvements have been made in the Ear Force PX21, here's a summary of how it compares to its highly acclaimed predecessor, the Ear Force P21:The PX21 Works With XBOX 360.An XBOX LIVE mic jack on the PX21 amplifier makes it compatible with the XBOX 360. All of the features that make the PX21 a great PS3(tm) headset also function on the XBOX 360.Works With PC & Mac Without Adapters.The PX21 replaces the P21 dual RCA jacks with a 3.5mm audio plug, so it works with PC's and Mac's without the need for an extra adapter.Acoustically Tuned Ear CupsThe PX21 ear cups, ear cushions and speakers are acoustically tuned for optimum fidelity. That means you'll hear crisper highs and deeper lows for an improved gaming experience.Improved HeadbandThe PX21 headband has been increased in size for greater comfort.Improved USB Audio ConnectionThe PX21 uses a stereo USB audio chat channel with improved fidelity, compared to a mono USB chat channel on the P21. This means you can use the PX21 as a stereo USB headset for listening to music and other stereo sources on your PC or Mac.Improved Ear CushionsThe PX21 ear cushions use the same soft fabric weave as the popular X31 and X41 headsets, with deeper and softer cushion material for even more comfort than the P21.Improved DesignThe striking chrome rings on the PX21 make it stand out as a high-quality headset that looks like a natural companion to the PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2009"}

I eventually bought it and I'm happy I did.This game grew on me in a short time and I love it.  Its an open world with plenty of racing events and rivals challenges after each race (as long as you're connected to XBOX Live).  You can keep racing new rivals (with bigger money) by pressing the X button after each Rivals race.  There are many events off-line and it grows with additional ribbons earned, and many events on-line just like other Forza games.There are also races against airplanes, helicopters, balloons, plus there other skill challenges.  I'm far from unlocking and playing everything this game offers.I believe the major goal of the game is to beat Darius Flynt who has won the Forza Horizon festival the past three year and has become a brand name bigger than the event.  You need to work your way up to get to that level to race beat him (I'm far from reaching that level).  You unlock a whole new set of events after you earn so much XP.  First you start off with the green wrist band events.  Then you'll eventually graduated into blue wrist band, pink, yellow, purple, ect., ect., ect. events.  There are three stations to choose from to listen to in while driving and racing.  The radio announcer sounds like the same woman in Saints Row 3--good.  You have a female manager narrator who talks to you--good.You can upgrade your car or have it auto upgraded or down graded when needed at the start of events.To get the most of the game, turn all the assists off.  You can also select from manual and automatic transmission.All the cars handle and perform differently.  With the assists off, you get the full challenge out of each race and each car. The less assist you have, the more money you make so you can buy more cars to race and re-race events.  Since no two cars handle and perform exactly alike, every race is a new challenge using a different car.Unlike other Forza games, damage is cosmetic only, if enabled.  I don't think it affects the aerodynamics of the car when you get damage.Performance IS NOT affected when you take damage.  Slipstreaming/drafting is apart of the driving experience.In other Forza games, you can tune every part of the car as long as you have an adjustable part installed or buy and install one.  So far, no tuning.You can buy car parts from every car manufacturer on the planet, just like the other Forza games.  You can customize the paint job and create your own style (I haven't done this yet).You can set the difficulty of your opponents and adjust all the assists just like other Forza games.This is a much simpler game than Forza 3 & 4.  Just open world racing with more and more events, location, and race types and skills challenges added as time goes by, in addition to all the events on-line, and a so many different cars for a different racing experience.I love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004ML44Y6","description":"","reviewerName":"paper tiger \"Adriel August\"","summary":"Fun Stylized Game with Repetition and Frustrations","reviewText":"This is just my opinion of the game. I have completed the single player campaign and played around with the online/offline Vendetta co-op game and with my high expectations, I was greatly let down. We are all entitled to our opinions. Please voice your comments and questions. Also, I don't hate the game and I did enjoy parts and particular aspects of the gameplay, however the bottom line is that it is not worth $60 and I would be embarrassed to have this on my shelf with all my good games. That it why I sold it the second I finished it.I was very much looking forward to this game. I played the demo and was impressed with the entire style of the game. Sadly, The Darkness 2 falls into some of the same issues as the original game. Just as before, we are given fun graphics with a very cool unique idea. Unfortunately we are also given some of the same issues with linear level design, high repetition and frustrating combat. The game does have its fun moments, however that is outweighed by frustration and repetition. The interesting concept and style only take the game so far. It quickly becomes a dull game to play.PRO's+ Very cool graphics. Nothing outstanding, but the animated style is unique. Sort of has a Bioshock feel to it.+ Quad-weapon capability is very creative, however fails in particular situations.+ Ability to upgrade your powers is nice, but due to lack of connection with the game I felt like it was not a huge achievement.+ Controls are decent; I had to up the sensitivity. Control feels natural, as we have played many 1st person shooters before.+ Some new interesting concepts and situations due to weapon system.+ Online gameplay can be fun if you have the right team.CON's- Story decent, but quite short, simple and predictable. Has a twist here or there, which I saw coming.- The game is very short. Can be completed in 6-7 hours MAX! Less if you're rushing, but slow down and enjoy the game and you won't mind the shorter length.- Very low replay value. I wanted to quit before I even finished. I will never play this game again!- When using your Darkness \"whip\" you can't turn your view left or right for a second. Very annoying!- There is no good block/shield feature in basic combat. Yes you can use a car door as a shield, when they are around, but not in the light.- Light is your enemy for your Darkness powers. However when in the light the screen lights up bright white and is devoid of color. Due to the intensity it is difficult to pinpoint where the light is so you can shoot it out. Does get very frustrating when enemies are firing at you. Also some enemies later in the game hold these large light guns or flashlights which again makes it difficult to see where it is coming from.I am ashamed at myself for having paid $60 for this game, but it is enjoyable at times. It does very much have its moments. It may be worth a rent as the game can be finished in a weekend, but after one play through you will be done with the game. I had no desire to go back and get more trophies or play New Game +. I simply wanted it off my shelf. It seemed to grab my attention and interest very quickly, but left just as fast. The repetitive game play and casual story was enough to quickly create a just ok feeling for this game. I have played much worse games, however The Darkness 2 could have been much better if there would have been more level pathways and a long enough story for me to get attached to the characters.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2012"}
{"product_name":"B001UW9ZW6","reviewerName":"irukandji","summary":"Not as good as Marvel Alliance 1","reviewText":"So, what makes Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 fall short of the first? First off, it was made by a different developer Vicarious Visions, where as the first one (and previous X-Men Legends) were made by Raven Software. Vicarious Visions made the PSP/Wii versions, until now.You can't customize your heroes if you pick Easy mode. So you pretty much have to play the \"Normal\" mode (or Heroic, as it is listed). It's not very hard, but I think that was unnecessary. They changed where the Health bar of the enemies is located. It used to be a big bar on the top of the screen, similar to Final Fight or Diablo. But now it is a tiny bar over every enemy. This was a bad change, for one, it is hard to tell how much damage your characters' attack did when you are trying to compare them to each other. Secondly, that bar gave you information of the enemy, such as \"Energy Resistant\", but now how are you supposed to tell what they resist, it doesn't show.There is not much diversity in the enemies or environments in this game as compared to the first. In the first game every act was different and unique. In Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 it is hard to tell what act you are even on. It is not listed in the pause screen or anywhere else for that matter. You can't go back to previous areas. The only way to replay a section is to use the simulator.You probably already know the main story, a Civil war among the heroes. Depending on which side you choose for the Civil war, it will affect what you can upgrade for your heroes. It is silly you can't fully upgrade your character because you chose one side over another. The only way to fully upgrade would be to play the whole thing over. The storyline also creates more problems, through a good portion of the game, characters became \"locked\" so you couldn't play them, because of their involvement with story. In a short game, not being able to play certain characters is really stupid. The game is short, despite reviews saying it was 12-15 hours long, I finished in 8 hours. And I was not rushing. The first game took me about 20+ hours. On top of it all the storyline was pointless, as if only to exist to justify making this sequel. I'll avoid spoilers, but many times I was left with the feeling, \"All that for nothing huh?\". The first game seemed like it was written by Marvel, this one seemed like it was written by the game developers.All the changes they made were for the worst. The reviews I read from IGN and such said this was more of the same. I wanted that, because I loved Marvel Ultimate Alliance. But they were wrong. They were very wrong.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001UW9ZW6","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Fun? Yes. Epic? No.","reviewText":"I've never played Ultimate Alliance 1, so I can't compare the two. I got really excited when I heard about this game because I felt it brought something different to the table. I expected an epic experience based on all of the characters and different powers incorporated in this game. Well, I got an experience alright enough, wouldn't necessarily call it epic though.Ultimate Alliance 2 initially appealed to me because it gives you the ability to choose from a host of characters, as well as play with 4 characters on the screen at the same time! I'm sure there are other games out there that allow you to do this, but this is the first game I've played that offers that.The combat in this game is actually pretty fun. Each character has about 4 different abilities/powers that he/she can chose to use at any given time. You start off with 2 powers but you'll upgrade to 4 pretty quickly. You can also punch, kick, and throw bad guys just like you can in many other action type games. You are also granted a special power called 'fusion powers'. You can combine your unique fusion attack with another character's fusion attack to create chaos for anyone in the area. But, this may be minor to some people, but I absolutely LOVE that you can use the environment as a weapon!! You can throw boxes, crates, trash-cans, cars (depending on who you have), etc. The fighting can become redundant after awhile because you really can get through many of the enemies with simply punching and kicking, more on that later.The variety of enemies is where this game starts heading in the wrong direction. I honestly believe I only fought around 4 or 5 different enemy types throughout the entire game. Batman AA is the only game that can get away with not having a huge variety of enemy types to fight, and we all know AA is a special game :) This is how it works: Enter a room, fight about 20 bad guys. Walk forward and enter another room, fight the exact same 20 bad guys that you just recently dispatched, repeat, repeat, repeat. Yes, you can use your super-powers to get through the bad guys, but you really don't have to. You can simply button mash your way through most of the enemies, I really hate that. Now, there were different bosses to fight, well somewhat. Although they WERE different bosses, they all fought the same way to a certain extent. I'm accustomed to games where the boss has a specific weakness, and you have to find it and exploit it. In Ultimate Alliance 2, you can use the aforementioned fusion attacks and send many of the bosses to an early grave; with the exception of maybe one or two. If you want a challenge, just hack and slash the bosses I suppose.I was fooled into thinking that the 3 other heroes in my group were actually helping me through battle. Well, they don't.....My team was Storm, Deadpool, Thor, and Iceman. If I'm fighting 20 bad guys, simple math tells me that we should probably kill around 5 guys each. Yeah right.... you'll end up killing around 95% of all enemies. Sure, your team will hit the enemies, but they don't kill them for whatever reason. They do a great job of keeping enemies 'at bay' until you're able to help out. When I think of an army of 4, that's not what I envisioned...The length of the game is around 12 hours, although you can play through again and see a different outcome, depending on which side you choose. I'm not complaining about the 12 hours because if the game was any longer, I probably would have killed myself :(I deducted 2 stars from this game because of the lack of variety with enemies, and because every level really felt the same. I felt as if I was playing the same levels over and over again, with the exception of the Jungle; they all looked and felt alike. I'm thinking this game could have been a 4 or 5 star game, if the developers put a little more thought into the enemies and the level designs.I should have listened to the Amazon community on this one. Anytime a game has more 4 star ratings than it has 5 star ratings, that's a red flag. Although I had fun moments in the game, it just didn't live up to my expectations.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

Galasso","summary":"Mortal Kombat","reviewText":"It was \"Portal Kombat\" week,  and if you're one of the cool and geeky gamer kids you know exactly what I mean.  I had my toss up between buying Mortal Kombat,  or Portal 2 (or even both).  I made my choice and I went ahead and pre ordered Mortal Kombat off of amazon.  I got my pre order 10$ credit,  and my pre order bonus code for a character,  outfit and fatality.I am so glad I had gotten Mortal Kombat (9).  The story mode is amazing.  It kept me so interested.  It's like a remastered remake of Mortal Kombat 1-3.  Also there's added background story,  and some new characters like \"noob\",  \"kratos\",  and \"cyber subzero\".  Even background story on \"cyrax\".  Mind you I know nothing about mortal Kombat history except what I was told and what I've seen on Mortal Kombat versus DC Universe.  Anyway,  I was so excited to find out why cyrax became cyber cyrax,  and I even got to play with his human form and such in story mode.  I felt so bad for Scorpian,  even worse for Subzero.  Raiden is amazing in the story as well.  Oh I even learned some history about kitana,  and gosh... that Mileena girl is a freak.  I'm trying so hard to not give any story mode spoilers.Oh,  okay. So there's this challenge tower, full of 300 challenges.  It's so fun,  once you hit 25 you ding a achievement then another for completing 100... But some challenges are tough as well..Online play right now is laggy and takes forever.. Not sure if a update will correct this.  The game itself comes with a online play code which will activate the online play,  (meaning don't buy the game used or else you buy the code from xbox.  one time use only).The ladder/arcade has some hidden fights (so fun, I love secrets and they ding achievevements).  The ladder is fairly easy to complete.  Complete it with every char and ding a achievement.The graphics are superb and absolutely stunning.  I am very happy with this game,  I am still playing it,  I've only had it about a week now,  but I'm loving it.  I'm sure any fighting game fan or Mortal Kombat fan will feel the same.

The developers have a reputation for great visuals, and this game is excellent in that department.  There is a bit of brief texture pop-in here and there, but overall the game looks fantastic.  Environments and character models are well-rendered and make for an immersive environment.  The gameplay, in terms of both the FPS and driving modes, is also very well done.  This is already definitely one of my favorite shooters in terms of mechanics and physics.  Rage also does not waste its time settling the player into the world.  The missions (the game calls them jobs) follow a generally similar pattern but some are more memorable for their distinct enemy types.  The developers also seem to have felt it unnecessary to engage in much exposition, for the emphasis here is on the action.And, therein lies Rage's most glaring flaw...a real lack of engaging story.  I mean it has its little moments, but there's just never a crescendo in the narrative.  Even the characters populating the world were mostly more interesting to look at than to listen to.  Though they have completely different settings, for some reason this game made me think of Bioshock quite a bit...stranger in a strange land, strangely mutated people out to kill you, interesting weapon mods, errand boy mission structure, etc.  The major difference is that one tells a genuinely compelling story that really helps to cover any weaknesses in gameplay.  Don't get me wrong, I had a lot of fun playing Rage and enjoyed it right up until its end (an ending, by the way, that definitely accentuated its narrative shortcomings).In closing, if I could send a memo to Bethesda and id, it would state the following:1. Create a sequel2. Craft a more engaging story and characters this time3. Be a Game of the Year contender4. Make me one happy camper!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2012"}

Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Medal Of Honor Airborne Could of Been Made  A Better Game","reviewText":"First of all, Medal of Honor Airborne only has six missions to play in and that is it.  The game should have had at least twelve missions to play in it to be called a full version game.  This game is suppose to be a full version game.  Not a add-on or an expansion game. I feel like I have been ripped off by someone.Of the six missions, only the first four missions honor the brave soldiers that fought in World War II.  The last two missions do not honor the brave soldiers who fought during World War II.  The last two missions are fantasy made missions that remind me of going to amusement park.  You have super Nazi's in the last two missions that take forever to kill. Shoot them in the head or blow them up with grenades it doesn't do any good. It takes at least fifty to a hundred shots with your weapon to take down one of these super Nazi's.  I felt like I needed to find a super weapon like a laser gun to bring them down.I notice in the fifth mission (Operation Varsity) there are railroad cars that are not European made rail cars.  They are North American made railroad cars.  What is up with that?  It is quite obvious that somebody just slapped some North American railroad cars into the mission just to finish it.In the last mission, (Operation Der Flakturm) American paratroopers land on a German Flak tower in Germany right after Operation Varsity.  This mission never took place during World War II.  The Russians were the only ones to assault German Flak towers during the war. In fact, the Flak tower used in the game never even got built in Germany.  There was three generations of Flak towers built by the Germans during the war and only the first two generations of towers were built in Germany. Those towers were built in the German cities of Berlin and Hamburg during the war.  The game shows a third generation built Flak tower built in Germany, that was actually built in Vienna, Austria during the war.  Somebody screwed up.It almost seems like two different teams of game developers work on the Medal of Honor Airborne game.  One team worked on the first four missions of the game which were realistic and actually happen during World War II while another team worked on the last two missions in the game which are more sci-fi and fantasy.  I really wanted to like this game because I'm a big World War II fan.  With all the actual events that happen during World War II, why would the game developer need to makeup any missions for the game?I have to say, too, that this is the hardest PC game that I have ever had to load onto my PC.  I have never seen a game with more bugs and problems.  There is virtually no tech support from EA.  I was very, very frustrated with trying to load and play this game.This another example of a game that should of went somewhere that ended up going nowhere. Either the game publisher or the game developer just wanted to hurry and finish the game just to try to beat the holiday rush. Somebody was trying to hurry and make some money on this game before the other big name titles come out later on  this year.  I hate to say it, but Call of Duty 4 is going to be the game to beat this year.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000I10PY2","description":"","reviewerName":"Micheal Hunt","summary":"5 Star System... it's a shame about some of the games made for it tho.","reviewText":"The DS lite is a little more compact and smaller then the the original DS. It's capability is far greater then a lot of people give it credit for. It pretty much has the ability of the Nintendo 64 in a small hand held device. However, what brings it down a lot is the lack of thought put into quite a lot of the games released for it. Games vary in quality and playability, depending on who makes them, of coarse when Nintendo release a game, they are of top quality and really show what the DS can do. Games like New Super Mario, Mario Kart and Zelda are created to use the full advantage of the DS's abilities, which is why those games are the leaders when it comes to sales for the DS. But unfortunately there are a lot of cheaply made games, such as pretty much anything that says something like 50 in 1, or 100 games in 1 cartridge. They might sound good and are fairly priced, but go and have a look at reviews of games before you buy anything. If you love Mario, Zelda or even those Pokemon games, then the DS is a great device to own. However, if you are into more adult content games, then the games on the DS may not be what you really want to play, and you might want to look into a different gaming console. There is a few first person shooter games that are adult orientated, but they usually are on a rail system or are not really any fun to play.What I would recommend you do, is look into R4 cards or similar things. I wont go into much detail on that, but it will be worth your while to research it, if you don't know what it is. Games that I highly recommend are obviously the Nintendo games. Anything with Mario in it might take your fancy, Zelda, Brain Age etc..Racing* Side Swiped - most underrated action racing game of of all time, imo.* Dirt 2 - Excellent racer with nice soundtrack* Hot Wheels: Beat That - May be a kids game, but it's a lot of fun!* Monster Jam 1, 2 & 3 - More fun then they sound!!* Trackmania 1 or 2 - So many tracks, and you can build your own later!Fighting/Shooter* Ultimate Mortal Kombat* - even comes with an awesome mini game of jewels.* Contra 4Card/Puzzle* Jewel Quest* - there are many versions of this.* Bejeweled Twist or 3* -Unfortunately I can't HIGHLY recommend much more then that. And as you can see, what I have listed is not a great variety, as these are games I like. I personally do not like Pokemon or those dress up games, Dogz Catz etc... but if you want a gaming system for you kids, then you will have no trouble finding suitable games for them on this system, as that seems to be what dominated the field when it comes to the DS.The DS also has a port to play Game Boy Advance games. If you had one of those, you can plug them into here. They can be emulated too if you research the \"M3 Ds real\" you can also emulate nes, SNES, sega ms, Sega Gen, game boy/color, atari and probably a few more if you look into it.What really brings down the DS is so many poorly made games. It's really annoying to me that games like Street Fighter and NBA Jam have never seen the light of day on this console, and they would have worked perfectly. The other thing I can't beleive is how bad some of the controls are, or they don't utilize the touch screen feature well. On the Ipad/Phone/Pod you can get excellent touch games like Angry Birds and what not, and yet nothing on the DS compares to it when it comes to games of that style. A lot of the graphics in some of the cheaper games look like poorly made flash games and use very bad graphics. So it's a no wonder some people play a DS once, and think badly of it because of such poorly made games. So if you are going to try one out, try one of the games I suggested and give it a real go before dismissing it as a learning facility/brain trainer device or a strictly kids only console.. it is much more then that, but it will depend on what games you play, and who made them.One thing you will need to be careful of tho, the upper right shoulder button of the DS often wears out and can snap right off. I would recommend you buy a DS protector case with the DS. They snap around the DS and make them a bit stronger. However, I am now on my 2nd DS console, and even with the protector on it, it is still wearing down and the flip screen doesn't stay up any more. It may be a better idea to just go for the newer DSi, which has bigger screens, an inbuilt camera and ability to connect to wifi games to download free/expansions of a lot of games. Or maybe even the 3DS.... but keep in mind, I was reviewing the DS lite here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2011"}

I was hoping this was one of those cases where the game got a bad rap because of overhyping, etc. And, while this game isn't broken or overly terrible, it just isn't memorable of interesting. The controls aren't the greatest, the sound gets very old very fast, and the landscapes feel realized but void of anything interesting. In short, this game really does feel like it lacks a great deal of punch. It has a few laughs, but they're shortlived and often followed up with lots of frustration. The one positive thing I can say for this game is that it was much harder than I had anticipated. I was glad to see that at least the difficulty wasn't watered down. Still, I couldn't help but wonder why an enemy could attack me without worry after 3 shotgun blasts, but often went down easily when I hit them once with the butt of the gun. With the price being as low as it is, you may want to check this game out. Trophy hunters will take more away from this game than the casual gamer, after all. But there are certainly better games to be played. Still, that doesn't make this the complete disappointment I've heard people claim that it is. Yet my advice is: Don't expect much, because you won't get much. But if you still just HAVE to try it, then the price is close to fair.

So, in all fairness, I now have to say this: DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS IS A GAMER's DREAM! It is an excellent game - and it comes FREE of any DRM madness. So, thank you EA for listening to your customers (let's only hope this new trend holds...).This is one of those games that are easy to control, a joy to roam through and fun to play at no end.I am a huge cRPG fan and cannot remember such a great companion/squad cRPG ever since theBaldur's Gate Saga. And to tell you the truth, this is the game I was dreaming of being able to play one day while playing BG (yeah, by now we all know that NEVERWINTER NIGHTS never delivered).There are about a dozen gender/race/class/background choices and a great many combinations in forming your party. The armor and the weapons are exceptionally made and everything shows on your characters. And the graphics are truly beautiful! You have to see the rendering of flames to believe them.Nevertheless, what really stands out is the gameplay. Every battle is a puzzle to be solved, pausing ever so often to reallocate enemies to the best suited party members (a feature I loved in BG!). Of course one can always turn off the autopause feature and let the AI take over the rest of your party and turn the game into an hack&slash; action RPG (not exactly my cup of tea but, hey, it's still nice to know it's there).Finally, this is a game made just like the classics in many ways, including duration. I am now playing the game for over 20 hours and I feel that I barely scraped the surface! DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS is one satisfying RPG!My only gripe is this: I did not appreciate such short dialogue options. Most fit a single line and more often than not they consist of a couple of words. I like my RPGs to be wordy and challenging to my verbal imagination as well - and I want my characters to participate in the humor, not just provoke it or react to it. Remember the long dialogue options in BG? Well, expect to find DRAGON AGE: ORIGINS much more laconic.I guess 10 years of fast-paced FPS and blitzkrieging RTS do take their toll...The blood sprays, the swords clang and the spells explode. The animations are beautifully made and add a lot to both enjoyment and immersion. There is a verse in Homer's Iliad I love: \"the warrior fell and his armor echoed around him\" - and I was reminded of it many a times throughout the game.This game will stay with you. Do not miss on it.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"aka TRAP","summary":"Copy 'n paste","reviewText":"Ever since this game was announced back in March, anyone with half a brain should have known what to expect.  They had already \"leaked\" the entire story in June, they showed off some of the multiplayer maps a month later, they had the CoD event in California, and come November 8th, people did the same thing they do every year: Rushed out to buy it.  I decided to wait (like I did with Black Ops) a few months before I got my hands on a copy.  I actually liked the game the first two times I played it.  Granted, the times I played were matches offline, but I still decided to pick it up once the price went down.  Amazon obviously can read my mind, since it was $40 at the time I bought it.So how is it?  Well, for those that don't like to read long reviews, I'll leave you with this.  It is the definition of copy and paste.  Take that as you wish.  For everyone else, keep reading.Modern Warfare 3 takes place directly after Modern Warfare 2.  No shocker there, right?  Neither is the rest of the campaign.  You fight your way through New York against the Russians, blow up their navy fleet, head to Africa, then England, France, Germany, and finally you head to chase after the same bad guy you were after in Modern Warfare 2.In all honesty, there is nothing new here.  It honestly feels like Infinity Ward thinks I'm a male that's either between the ages of 13 and 18 (or still has the mindset of such age), or I'm just incredibly stupid and all I want to see is action, action, action, action, action.  You know those \"guy movies\" that are action-packed, but repetitive?  That's Modern Warfare 3's campaign.  This is also where some of the cut and paste comes in.  Remember back in Modern Warfare 2 when you were a Marine and at the start of one of the last levels, your character looks down at his bloody hands?  Same thing happens in Modern Warfare 3, except you're a part of Delta Force, your hands aren't bloody, you're in Berlin, and your name isn't Ramirez.  You remember the map Pipeline from the first Modern Warfare game?  Remember the tallest building in the map, how it had three levels and people sometimes sniped from the very top?  Yup, that building has made its return in the campaign of Modern Warfare 3.  But more on the copy and paste thing later.Continuing on, a lot of the missions start off the exact same way.  You're usually either hopping out of an airplane, or you're playing the stealth role.  I would say half of the missions featuring Price and Soap (yes, they're back) started the same way....in some bushes, trying to sneak past militia without alerting them, only to alert them later on in the level.  Even parts of the missions themselves feel like they were ripped straight out of previous Modern Warfare titles.  Remember \"All Ghillied Up\" from the first Modern Warfare?  Remember how part of the level had you going prone underneath some trucks?  You do the exact same thing in Modern Warfare 3.  Only this time, the trucks are perpendicular to you, and one doesn't come after another to give you more cover.  Overall, if you've played Modern Warfare 2's campaign, you already know how this one is going to play out.  Funny thing is, Modern Warfare 2 took me four hours to finish on Regular, while Modern Warfare 3 took me almost five.  Still, a very short campaign mode, and clearly not the reason why people would buy this game.Just a quick statement for Spec Ops.  Spec Ops has not influenced this review in anyway, shape, or form, because I find it very unentertaining and repetitive, though I know some people love it.  Some of my own friends can't stop playing it, where as I'm bored within the first five minutes of firing it up.  Basically, if you like Firefight from Halo, Horde from Gears, or Zombies from the Treyarch-developed CoD games, you'll like Spec Ops.The majority of the fans stay for the multiplayer.  Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer is, again, hardly different from any Call of Duty game you've played before.  You have your Deathmatch, Domination, Ground War, Headquarters, Search and Destroy, and Capture the Flag modes we have all seen for years, now.  A new addition to the roster is Kill Comfirmed.  It's a Team Deathmath variant where, if you kill someone, they leave behind floating dog tags you have to pick up.  However, anyone can pick them up.  If a teammate picks them up, it's a point for yout team.  However if someone from the opposing team picks them up, or the person you killed comes back and picks them up, neither team gets a point.  And also there is a Community Playlist that, as of now, features only one game.  Only time will tell what will be added and dropped, but for now, it really isn't anything special.The multiplayer works the same way as previous games in the franchise, as I mentioned earlier.  There are a few new weapons and attachments, but overall, if you've played a Call of Duty game before, you've played this one.  The only difference is there is a seperate ranking system for each weapon you use, and those are also separate from the main ranking system.  However, some experience points you earn throughout the game go to both your rank and your weapon rank.  Your weapon levels up everytime you score a kill, destroy equipment with it, or use it to take down killstreaks.  Leveling up your weapon unlocks new attachments, camo, and proficiencies.  A Prociciency is like a perk, but for your weapon.  For example, you can have one taht reduces the recoil, or one that increases the range of your weapon.  I think it's a nice touch, for once.  Unneccessary, but still a nice touch.  But gone are the days of buying attachments like in Black Ops, though earning items in this game isn't really much harder in my opinion.My main issue with the multiplayer is, once again, lag.  We already know Activision and Infinity Ward spend as little money as possible to keep this game afloat and selling, but seriously, it's starting to show in a horrid way.  There have been numerous times where I would shoot an enemy, he's almost dead, I'm still shooting at him, haven't moved my sight off of his body, and he kills me.  As I sit and wonder \"How could that have happened?!!\", I watched the killcam to see that my last five rounds didn't even register.  They came out, and you can see me still shooting him, but it's as if the game just said \"OK, you shot him enough; he gets to kill you\".  There are also random moments where the game will literally freeze while playing online.  And I mean freeze to the point where you think your console has frozen.  I've seen random slowdowns while playing online as well.  You know how when the game shows the last killcam, it slows down a little bit so you can see the killshot?  Imagine the game slowing down a little bit while you're sprinting, for no reason.  You would think that Activision would treat its new cash cow a bit better than that.  Hopefully a patch later down the line will fix things.  I highly doubt such a patch will be released, knowing their track record with Modern Warfare 2.But to continue from my copy and paste mentioning earlier, it's very hard to deny this game being in copy and paste form.  The red dot sight attachment is literally ripped from Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and touched up to look pretty.  A lot of the guns sound the same, and virtually every single attachment that you saw in Modern Warfare 2 is back in Modern Warfare 3.  The only new addition I've seen is the hybrid sight, which combines a zoomed scope and a holographic sight.  The perks are mostly just re-used perks from previous games, as well, though (of course) there are some new ones.  Blind Eye makes you immune to air support and sentries.  Assassin makes you immune to UAV, sentries, thermal, and heartbeat sensors.  Those two perks make Cold-Blooded from Modern Warfare 2.  Bling from the same game is now a proficiency for weapons.  Scavenger is the same thing is has been since Modern Warfare 2 (though I don't mind this since I like the perk).  The Main Menu layout looks exactly like Modern Warfare 2, except it's a different color scheme and has different pictures to represent the modes.  The campaign even feels like the previous games.  You're basically doing the exact same thing over and over again.  Kill this group of enemies, move foward, kill another group, move foward, go in this building, kill the people that show up, move foward, kill another group, move forward, random action scene, random \"Jump and reach for the chopper!!!\" moment that was cool in 2007, use some random turret, move forward, use some random vehicle, move forward, yet ANOTHER AC-130 scene, move forward, repeat in the next Call of Duty game that was announced just weeks after this one was released.It's unfortunate that Infinity Ward and Activision proved some people right with this game.  I was hoping they would actually back what they said (remember when they told us no Final Stand?  they lied) and would at least TRY to push out something different, even in the slightest sense.  But instead, we get the \"just add a few things so we can call it new\", different.  Instead of your mother making you baked chicken and corn for dinner, she made you baked chicken, corn, and seasoned the corn with a pinch of salt, but she had to tell you she added salt, or else you wouldn't have noticed it.  However, at the same time, it should have been known this was going to happen.  Overall, I would give this game 3 stars....BARELY.  It's more like a 2 1/2 stars.  I wouldn't even care if they had re-used EVERYTHING and changed nothing new.  I just wish they would get the multiplayer right and fix the horrid lag issues people have been complaining about for two years.  Hopefully a patch will fix this along the lines (and if one does, I'll update this), but I wouldn't hold my breath.If you've been playing Call of Duty since the second one, like me, either wait and see what happens with future updates, or completely skip this one.  You're not missing anything.  And if you loved Call of Duty 4, like I did, I HIGHLY recommend you skip this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2011"}

Thankfully, the drawing-spells-from-enemies feature that was in Final Fantasy 8 is replaced with the old style magic points system.  While some of the characters are new and original, others seem like watered down versions of past ones (Kuja is similar to Sephiroth from FF7).  The card game is back also, although it plays a less significant role this time.  The bottom line is, you'll see many features that are new, but you'll also see things that are tired and old...like the names of the summon characters and spells for example (I don't understand why that in every Final Fantasy Square has refused to change them).

Trying to play this game is frustrating to no end because you have to struggle with the weird 2.5-D perspective which makes moving between the foreground and background an absolute chore.  Jumping is also way more frustrating than it could or should be.  I just don't get why they couldn't tweak the controls to make them more crisp and predictable.  The game ends up being hard not because it's actually hard but because of the bad controls!  FRUSTRATING!!!  One other minor thing I absolutely hate and would like to mention is that BLINDING white screen you get every time you finish a level and return to your pod.  I literally have to close my eyes and turn my head away from the screen every single time, it's so insanely bright.  That gets a little bit old.Edit: I'm upping my previous 3-star rating to 5 on this game because I've forced myself to keep on playing it despite the control issues and it's actually a great deal of fun!  I've probably played this game for more hours than any other game I've ever owned and I want Mm to continue creating sequels!!  You kind of get used to the bad controls and start to anticipate them, sadly.

As time passes, his lonely town of one becomes a town of two, three...until it grows into a town to behold. The town is not the only thing to behold. Among the newcomers are beautiful ladies who have moved to the town to start a new life. Which one will be our hero&rsquo;s lucky lady? However, our hero is soon faced with a problem. Creatures of the frontier, many of them hostile towards humans, pose a great threat to the safety of his townsfolk. To find a way to live in peaceful coexistence or perhaps destroy them along with the danger they bring &ndash; the decision is up to our hero.GameplayAs with previous related games,Rune Factory: Frontierfeatures a myriad of Life Sim activities like farming, raising livestock, building relationships with NPCs, etc., as well as role-playing elements like dungeon crawling and item collection and leveling, but in structuring gameplay it goes to great lengths to incorporate an open-ended structure that allows players to choose the type of game they wish to experience at all points in the game. This means that although at the beginning of the game players will find themselves presented with the familiar opportunity of starting a farm, selling their crops at market and by doing so improving the overall prosperity and size of their town, they are not necessarily tied to the land. Although farming is an excellent way to finance adventuring, the rich RPG elements of the game can be pursued at any time. These elements present themselves mostly in the form of battling monsters and bosses that have found their way into the land, but seem to be coming from the mysterious 'Whale Island,' which floats in the sky above your town. Players can either battle the monsters or make friends with them, raising them as a kind of livestock. As with everything inRune Factory: Frontier, the choice is yours. Whether it's growing crops, expanding the town, fighting (or befriending) monsters or even falling in love, the experience is unique to each player.Key Game Features:Lifelike Interactions- NPCs will come and go based on the player&rsquo;s actions. Want to get along with your neighbor? Want to give fellow townsfolk something they might hate? Go ahead, but they may get upset and leave the town. Be nice to attract more newcomers.Natural Ecosystem- Breathe life into the barren wilderness by cultivating it and planting crops. Small creatures (spirits) will gather first, triggering a food chain to later attract larger and rarer creatures. You are responsible for bringing more fertility to the land.Floating Island to Explore- There is an island that floats in the skies. When you see it, you must quickly find a way to get on it as new discoveries await.Intuitive Wii Controls- Use the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to do everything. Plow the land, shake hands with townsfolk to strengthen relationships, or even wave it around when you&rsquo;re on a date with a girl.

In fact this game is held back from true greatness only by some seriously questionable and very annoying \"features.\"  In the end, the good outweighs the bad by a good margin.If you've never played a Harvest Moon or Rune Factory title, the premise is really basic.  You move into a town, you start a farm, you interact with townsfolk, go fishing, raise monsters, cook foods, go mining, craft items, do some adventuring, and try to start a family.  It has a very open ended design allowing you to play in whatever style you prefer.  In fact, the game allows you to do so much it is almost overwhelming.  If you like farming you can stick to farming.  If you like dungeon crawling, go for it.  As the seasons change and the years go by, more and more the game gradually opens itself up to you.THE GOOD:+++ Addictive gameplay.  Several times, long after I should have gone to bed I've said \"I'll just play through one more day...\"+++ The graphics are simple yet beautiful.  Lush colors are used throughout the game to good effect.+++ Huge amount of variety.  Sometimes there is too much choice it seems, but there is nothing in place that really keeps you from going back and doing other stuff in the game as long as you've unlocked a feature.+++ Deep RPG experience that allows you to steer your character's life the way you want to.  There is a lot of strategy for those of you who want to look for that depth, or you can just plow through it headlong.  Either way the game will let you succeed in your own way.THE OK BUT COULD BE BETTER:=== The relaxed gameplay flow can get repetitive.  You only have so much time each day to accomplish tasks and so much energy before you collapse.  Because of this it isn't uncommon to take days of time in the game to accomplish a goal.=== The game map is made up of independent sections or districts, such as Church District, Homestead, Business District, etc.  This isn't bad or good in of itself, but learning the layout of the entrances and exits to each section honestly takes far longer than it should have when it should have been absurdly easy.=== Music is sometimes excellent and other times annoyingly repetitive.=== The \"Runey System\"... I'm really on the fence as to whether I hate the Runeys or think they are a good idea.  Basically you use the Runey System to help keep the environment in the different areas of the town in balance.  On the surface, the Runey system works, but... see later in the review for some harsh criticism of the Runey system.=== What voice acting exists in the game was done by some good voice actors, but with some really awkward scripts that didn't make it through the translation from Japanese to English so well.=== Controls are functional and tight, but questionable design decisions keep them from being great.  For example, it is too easy to accidentally pick items up instead of performing special actions because pick-up is mapped to the trigger (B) and special actions are mapped to A+B.  This also causes extra strain on your hand while farming.  The good news is that the Classic Controller is supported on this game, which is very nice and reduces hand fatigue.  The bad news about the Classic Controller is that you can't knock on doors because that action is mapped to shaking the nunchuck.THE BAD:--- Fixed camera angles.  The player has absolutely no control of the camera which results in spending a lot of time running towards the camera.--- Load times... lots and lots of brief four and five second load times.  Every time you go though a door or move to a different section of the map you will be greeted with a load screen.--- Lack of logical direction regarding some of your tool locations and plot devices, such as the Axe.  Why does the nun have the axe?  I have no idea.  Why do you not get the axe until after you've used the hoe 40 times?  I have no idea.  Why is the Pet Brush tool acquired randomly from a conversation with the carpenter?  Absolutely no idea.  What's worse is that the game doesn't give you any decent hints to speak of.  Luckily the internet is the perfect solution and some folks have already written excellent tutorials on how to quickly get all of the tools in the game.--- The Runey system is good idea gone bad because of a few really bad game design decisions.  While not completely broken, the Runeys are dealt with very clumsily almost every step of the way.  1) The game explains the Runey system very poorly.  I still don't understand it, but I have found out the hard way that neglecting the Runeys and allowing them to go extinct will cause your crops to stop growing.  2) Collecting Runeys is slow, time consuming, and kind of random.  3) Distributing Runeys is also slow and time consuming, but at least it isn't random.  4) Checking on the status of Runeys in each district requires you visit a specific part of town instead of just going to a simple menu option.  Status checking is probably the worst design flaw of the Runey system.  Luckily, if you focus on the runeys about one day out of every two weeks or so you should be able to keep a lid on it.The good definitely outweighs the bad in this game.  While it may look like I don't like the game based on the number of criticisms I have, I would like to emphasize that this game is VERY fun and most of all, addicting.  I can easily see the most obsessed gamers getting well over 100 hours out of this game and more casual gamers could easily break the 40 hour mark.  If you enjoy Harvest Moon, Rune Factory, or The Sims and you haven't burnt yourself out on life simulation games yet, pick this game up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2009"}

It came extremely fast and was in mint condition. Now for the game ;pI am an old fan of harvest moon games. Have beaten all of them from the PS1 to the to the GBA, NGC, Psp and now I'm gonna be working down on the Wii. we all know harvest moon has alot of spin offs, like Innocent Life, which in my opinion couldn't touch the originals. It just felt like gimmicks that got in the way. I have heard of Rune Factory since it's NDS launch but never paid it any mind, so this is my first Rune Factory game and I must say, FINALLY, A GIMMICK THAT WORKS! People compare this game as a mix between Final Fantasy and Harvest Moon. It's true to a point, but not exactly, as they left out it's also a mixture of The Legend of Zelda. This is truly a sweet package with alot to offer and great open end gameplay. You don't HAVE to do anything, and that is what makes the game sweet. You can be a farmer, adventurer, alchemist, heck you can do all of them if you wanted too. You're not forced into anything. You make your own choices. This game has a distinct Japanese touch and all the female characters are made to suit this really well. Mots of them are cute as hell and stuck in a constant blush every time you interact. Alot of work was put into each character's roll and personality and the voice acting, music, controls, and graphics are all very good. We all know harvest moon games don't put much into graphics, it's a low budget game with high rep. I'd say in terms and graphics though that this game takes you higher, and I'd love to see them continue in this direction. It feels grand to be submerged in old school RPG-like culture. You got your wizards, warriors, half-elves, everything all in one. The environments were made just right for this, and the soundtrack which comprises of some great Celtic/Folk works of art ties everything in. I've played part 2 before part 1 and I must say, part one is way better. If you're looking for a great rune factory or just great harvest moon game, THIS IS IT. Rune Factory 2 Oceans, kinda strayed in my opinion. It was good, but I wouldn't say it could get close enough to touch Frontier with a stick in terms on old school Harvest Moon flavoured gameplay.EDIT: Just to let you guys know the Kind of replay value this game has, I've already clocked in about 150 hours of gameplay in this game and STILL haven't completed the story line, STILL haven't complete all side quests, STILL haven't fully explored everywhere or beaten all the bosses, STILL haven't married yet, and am still dating all the girls to see who I like best. And believe me, I didn't spend the last 150 hours doing nothing. I've been strictly following the storyline since I popped the disk in the first day I bought it lol. Only taking small side quests here and there and little time frames where I'd be level grinding to increase my players strength, combat, and magic skills. Damn I love this game :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-18-2012"}

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story.

While the formula for Mass Effect 2 went through some changes, the game that came out of the oven might just be superior to the original (Depending on your view)*** I own the STEAM version of Mass Effect 2 so I can not comment on the DRM included with a physical copy ***GAMEPLAYA majority of the changes between ME and ME2 happen here in the gameplay department.  If you played the original ME then you pretty much played ME2.  The game is an RPG w/ sci-fi and shooter elements to it.  When you aren't landing on planets to explore for salvage, distress beacons, storyline missions, side missions etc  you are engaging in RPG based dialogue segments.Dialogue: If you ever played Neverwinter Nights or Elder Scrolls when in conversation you will be presented with dialogue options that will affect the outcome of your conversation.  A simple slip of the tongue could end up giving you Paragon or Renegade rep (good or bad).  More rep you have in one category the better the opportunity to pull off a special rep action.  For example if you are pretty high in the Renegade rep, during dialogue you might be able to whip out your pistol and threaten the person for information (earns you MORE renegade rep) Through the dialogue the storyline will get deeper and you will learn secrets about your crew, even affecting the ending of the game.While dialogue has remained the same from ME,  the combat has gone under some major changes as well as character customization.  GONE from ME is the ability to custom outfit your characters with gear.  This has been replaced with a simple load-out screen and passive boosts to overall effectiveness in combat through the Tech Lab.  Also gone is the advance leveling system.  While the system is similar to ME, your crew has gone from upwards of 10-15 skills down to 4-6.  These changes remove much of the RPG \"loot/customization\" element that ME had in it but makes ME2 a lot easier for the casual fan to pick up.Combat: Combat had very little change.  The only real MAJOR change to the combat system was the introduction of ammo clips.  This replaces the \"overheat\" method from ME, and turns combat into more of a 3rd person Shooter w/ abilities.  Depending on the class you pick in the beginning you will be able to unlock special abilities.  These could be as simple as Cryo Ammo(bullets slow enemies) to abilities like WARP and OVERLOAD.  The classes available cater to all forms of play-style. From the gun-happy soldier to caster based players who enjoy biotics.* The mix of RPG Dialogue, planetary and galactic exploration, third person shooter combat mechanics make Mass Effect 2's gameplay some of the most addictive play around.GRAPHICS / SOUNDThe graphics on the PC are fantastic.  With settings turned up pretty high the game looks great, armor and biotics have great effects.  You easily will get immersed in this game because of its graphics.  When wandering on alien worlds, each planet feels different and has great backgrounds, and unique ambient effects.  **  Audio is spot on.  This game is like 50% dialogue / 50% combat you could say... both aspects are polished in the audio department.  Main characters give fantastic performances and even extras do a great job. Weapons can sound a little primitive at times but it works in the games favor.  These are futuristic weapons after all and don't rely on varying amounts of gunpowder. The sound track will also blow your mind!STORY / REPLAYIf you played ME then you know the storyline.  In fact if you have a ME save file on your PC (or 360) you can import your old character.  They will start with bonuses and key storyline points will be altered based on what happen in ME.  If you are buying this for PS3 or never owned a PC/360 copy of ME  then the game will automatically start you \"neutral\" with the IDEALISTIC ending to Mass Effect based on the story written on paper.  The story is of course top notch giving you plenty of changes to alter the final outcome which gives you varying endings (same overall ending just slightly different outcomes/conversations).  ** REPLAY value for this game is just through the roof. A single playthrough could be 30hrs to 60hrs in length .  Not only will a SECOND playthrough allow you to alter the storyline, unlock additional dialogue scenarios (be a bad guy instead of good?)  I'm on my 3rd playthrough already and the game has not gotten old.OVERALL (98% 9.8/A+)Mass Effect 2 is a game worthy of \"Game of the Year\".  It brings everything to the table!!  Simple yet fast paced combat...In depth dialogue/storyline with great voice action. Fantastic soundtrack to help immerse you into the game.  Crazy number of things to do in the game and so on.  This is a game any RPG fan needs to own or at least play once.  Even if you have not played Mass Effect, the opening does a good job easing you into the game w/o making you feel totally lost.** I highly recommend this game for your collection as it is an experience that will last for a lifetimePROS- 30+hrs of gameplay- Amazing voice acting / music / graphics etc- Amazing Replay value w/ alternate dialogue and scenario paths- Ability to alter cut scenes using Paragon / Renegade actions- Fun mini-game by probing planets for resources (and doing so uncovers hidden mini-missions)- Deep storyline w/ a well balanced combat system that makes this game suitable for a much broader audience.CONS- Changes made in ME2  take away from the  RPG feel that ME had.- Far less customization / skill variety for characters** Pro-tip ** Travel or locate the solar system.  ^_^  Once there go into an orbit around Uranus.  Attempt to probe it  ^_^  that's all I will say.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Wisdom Twin","summary":"Pretending to be a DJ out of a box....","reviewText":"OK, so I must preface this review with the fact that I received the DEMO kit and not the full version.  Demo kit includes a \"wired\" turntable and only 3 mixes... so the replay value becomes rather bland after a day or so.  I was ready to come on here and rip apart the fact that it was a demo but now I understand the company's logic behind it all and we have found ourselves rather hooked.Now onto the review... we are not DJ's or DJ experts in any shape or form.  We enjoy club music or anything that can be danced to.  Even though it was only 6 songs/3 mixes I can see the potential of the full version.  I have seen many reviews where others who are experienced do not feel that this is realistic at all; from the turntable record size not being standard, to not being able to control the speed of the scratch and at time finding the controls cumbersome.  I would whole-heartedly agree with the professionals', but would put in my unexperiened two cents.  The whole gimmick is to pull in a different genre that isn't interested in the \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band\" series music; respectively (with the expeption of the Beatles).  Personally the tracks from those games, besides a few classic popular songs does not pull me in.  Where I feel that those into the \"rock\" scene LOVE the music, for me it is just not my cup of tea.  That is where DJ Hero was born into the franchise to pull in the Hip Hop/Club scene individuals.  I personally feel that it accomplishes that feat.The learning curve is indeed a slippery slope.  After completing the tutorial, you feel like it is easy.  Easy mode is a piece of cake and then after that is where it all goes down the aforementioned slippery slope.  Once you introduce the cross fader, we began to lose control.  It is rather difficult to use the cross fader, and press the blue button.  Attempting the 360 degree rewind is just a sad sight to behold because each time we would lose control and our fingers lost the buttons which sent us fumbling into a 7 second u-turn.  If we were DJ's we would have been pegged with shoes until we left the stage.  Hence, why this game is made for us!  We aren't DJ's and will never be.  One of the main complaints is that this is just too restrictive and doesn't feel as authentic as the real experience; coming from someone with no experience it presents a wonderful peek into the DJ's world.  The more we play the bigger the streaks and the more of the on-screen prompts mastery.The demo mix for the guitar vs dj battle is just horrible... it didn't keep our attention and made us fumble so much more.  That would be a great example of the music being right up the \"rockers\" alley.In the end, I would highly recommend to those that aren't into the Guitar Hero/Rock band music and love games with repetition/mastery movements.  If you love to be challenged and love those genres of music then you will be intrigued for more than a couple of hours.  This is something that you pull out when company is over because it is a crowd pleaser while you \"boo\" your friend/family attempting to a mix master.  A major negative is the price point slated for it's October 27th release... it is just too high for the regular version and just insane for the \"Renegade\" edition.  The \"Renegade\" edition includes a different colored turntable, stand and it is named the Jay Z & Eminem edition.  How could you not want the Jay Z & Eminem inclusion?  I just can't stomach the price tag and lack of product information for that version.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2009"}

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

I enjoyed the PSP's GTA games but I couldn't imagine something this great on the DS. First of all it's amazing how they managed to put all of GTA IV's Liberty City on a tiny DS cartridge. Even though it returns to the top down view of the early GTAs, it's still a blast to play. The combat is fun but not really challenging since the auto aim system makes it easy to aim and take out your targets. I also like the new cop evasion system that that allows you to loose your wanted level by disabling the cop cars. Oh and her parents just because this is on the DS which is usually a child friendly system does not mean this is kid friendly, this game has everything that gave the console GTAs an M-rating. There's graphic violence(although cartoony) including violence against police, frequent profanity, drugs, and explicit sexual references.

Created by famed game designer Peter Molyneux, Fable 2 for Xbox 360 features an epic story that picks up 500 years after the first game. It offers an open world environment giving players a massive amount of freedom to explore and play as they please, with every decision made contributing to the game itself..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Fable 2Players:Offline: 1-2Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player, offline cooperative multiplayer, online cooperative multiplayer.The new combat system lets you master different fighting styles.View larger.You are free to roam the world of Albion any way you like.View larger.Every Choice Has Its ConsequencesFable 2 provides players with a truly immersive experience where a virtually limitless number of choices can be made, all of which have their own consequences, making each game unique. When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life.

But, for gamers like me I find a lot of reviews difficult because they are so outdated.  Anyway, I actually bought Fable 2 as a gift for a friend and then ended up playing it when he finished it.  I also had played Fable 1 on XBox.  As a Morrowind vet I was disappointed with Fable and Fable 2 was not much better.Overall the experience is ok.  The game is fun, don't get me wrong.  The graphics are great, the character interactions can be silly and fun, the music is nice, and the learning curve is low.  You can spend several hours just walking around and messing with the townsfolk and enjoy it.  But this is all style.  RPG's are supposed to contain substance.Fable 2 really doesn't offer a lot for the hardcore RPG fan.  I describe Fable 1 and 2 as basically the Disney versions of Diablo or to some extent, Morrowind/Oblivion.  Like Diablo the game is just a dungeon hack.  Wander around and kill the same bad guys over and over, collecting orbs which let you raise your stats, so you can go out and kill the same baddies a little easier.  At least there is a story compared to Diable but nothing compared to Morrowind or Oblivion.Anyway, Fable 2 is very short.  I think the main game story could probably be completed in a few hours if you didn't bother with side quests or the additional content.  I have mixed feelings about this.  It's fine to me if a game is short as long as it is fun and yeah Fable is that.  But where I get kind of ticked is that the additional content in the game is very monotonous and requires a lot of time performing menial tasks.  Since I did a lot of the additional content as I was advancing the game the game took me a lot longer to finish.  I don't know what my actual hour count was but it was probably around 10-12 hours of actual play time.  I would say probably 90% of those hours were spent raising money to buy houses, messing around with the family I started, and doing goofy side quests.  While the buying of real estate helped me amass a ton of money with which to buy the best weapons early on in the story, it offered me little other rewards.  On top of that, when I returned to the main quest and finished it so quickly I was let down at what a waste of time it all was.  Unlike more in depth RPG's that rewards hours of grinding with better gear and skills, Fable doesn't really have a high difficulty curve so the grind isn't necessary for most gamers.That means you just have to enjoy the experience to be rewarded.  Well, some of the side activity is fun.  Having a family, or engaging in affairs and evicting people or whatnot can be amusing.  Finding creative ways to manipulate the game (involves your imagination) is the most rewarding.  But frankly the game itself (without your imagination) can be pretty flat.The game markets itself as having a deep side quest feature particularly the Real Estate function.  Not to me.  The buying of property was better than Fable 1 in that you could buy most buildings.  Not everything mind you.  You could then rent them out to raise cash.  This is good for players because you can just buy some stores early on and have a constant income.  But the houses are a pain.  Yes you can redecorate them but the process is limited and BORING.  Each house only has a set number of items to be changed.  Usually a bed or two.  A table, dresser, book shelf, and stove with a couple others.  All you can do is just upgrade the quality and you can;t move the furniture from where it is, just replace.  This means the house will always be the way it is.  This is compounded by the games limited shop inventory system.Basically every shop in Fable carries usually only one (sometimes 2) of every item it sells.  The player then has to wait some amount of time for the store to be re-supplied which is usually a few days in game time.  This makes buying furniture annoying especially if you buy more than one house.  What happened to me was I owned most of Bowerstone and was trying to make decorate all of them to max my rent.  The furniture store only sold a couple of 5 star items and only 1 of each.  This made my remodeling endeavor take FOREVER as I had to wait over and over for the store to resupply.  It is silly to me that the developers let this kind of limited economic system in the game.  It exists for every store and item, not just furniture.For instance, potions.  If you want to stock up on potions you basically have to travel around the map and buy up potions from every store instead of just buying multiples from one vendor.  This was a complete waste of time.  The worst was as a joke one night I decided to get my character drunk.  I bought 4 bottle of wine from a bar and drank them.  It was a funny experience however it left my character extremely fat.  Morbidly obese honestly which was also kind of silly.  The problem is the only way to get in shape again is to eat celery. (???)  Exercise or other healthy foods do nothing.  Problem is there were only 2 vendors who sometimes sold celery and like everything else, you could only buy one stalk at a time.  It took me over 20 pieces to get my character thin again which took me hours to do because of the economy system.  This is frustrating and pointless really.  What kind of fruit and vegetable vendor would only sell one piece of celery and one apple???Then there is the game itself.  The game is straightforward and it educates you and constantly tells you what to do.  The star track makes it easier to navigate around however finding things on your own is darn tough.  The map system is pretty lame.  The star line is the best way to travel or use the auto travel feature.  The world is pretty and interesting but like usual you can only walk on the paths.Combat to me was pretty lame.  Hack and slash = monotonous button masher.  The ranged combat was the same really and I enjoyed having guns.  Magic though was worthless for the most part.  I don't think I even tried some of the spells.  In Fable 1 I used magic a lot, especially when fighting multiple enemies, but in Fable 2 I found the system more difficult.  It was harder to target magic and generally spells just had a standard charge time to blast a radius.  Charging spells left you vulnerable to attack.  In the end I found that Melee combat was pretty easy if you just smashed away so I rarely bothered with magic.  In some places it helps like at the Spire where you are weak and have to fight a lot of enemies with limited potions.  Beyond that I didn't need magic at all to beat the game especially when you max your strength and dexterity skills.Items.  With enough money you can buy most of the best items pretty early on.  I took advantage of the real estate feature and had plenty of cash to do so.  Once you do so there is not much need for cash.  Once I had a good sword and a gun I was all set.  There is no armor to speak of.  In fact there are only a handful of different clothing items.  This to me was pretty lame in and of itself.  The developers basically just made 5 or 6 outfits with little to no advantages and then put dyes in the game so you can change the color of them.  No armor at all.  No idea what they were thinking.Potions and some foods are the best items as you will need to heal sometimes.  I found that the key to the game was exploiting the Arena before going to the Spire.  You can run the Arena over and over as many times as you like.  Doing so is a short battle of about 10 minutes, maybe more, and you get tons of experience orbs, cash, and whatnot.  Then after every few levels there is a vendor waiting from which to buy potions.  Not only can you heal from him but you can also buy experience potions which speed the process up.  I ran this arena probably 20 times and my character was all but maxed before the midway point of the game.  I never bought any weapons or clothing after this point as well.  I spent all of my money on houses.So realistically I found most of the items in the game to be worthless.  Kind of sad.Some other features.Character interactions.  This can be fun with some of the silly ones but you have to learn them over time.  They aren't always important but they can make the game a lot more enjoyable.  I found that most of the enjoyment of this game came from acting like a fool to townsfolk and then letting my imagination to make the experience more funny.  Overall though the interaction experience can be annoying.  If you are a virtuous person you will attract huge crowds of people wherever you go.  Annoying.  It makes it hard to talk to one person and you never have privacy.  Also it causes you grief.  Do something mean or accidentally cast a spell and you upset a lot of people.  Not fun.  The most absurd is that these crowds will even follow you into combat or into your OWN HOUSE.  Plus everyone falls in love with you.  I couldn't go anywhere without having at least a dozen men and women asking me to marry them.  It was out of control and not a lot of fun.The dog.  I loved the dog.  Thought the dog was a lot of fun.Enemies.  Most enemies are the same over and over.  There are only a few different types and varieties.  The enemies are specific to spawn points so clearing areas does nothing.  Leave and come back and there they are again.Saving.  The game has an autosave which cannot be over-ridden.  This is a pain.  It means that no matter what you do you cannot undo anything.  I understand the developers wanted to have you live with your actions.  I guess it's ok but there are other reasons why it's a pain.Bugs.  Late in the game I found numerous bugs which causes the game to act funny.  In some cases this is made worse by the autosave.  For instance in the end part of the game you can buy a massive castle but if you try and move your family there, the game will bug completely.  Because of the autosave I cannot undo my attempt to move my family there and now it's pretty much stuck.  Whats worse is there is a quest involving your kid which bugs as a result of this as well and if screwed up will cause you to fail and not be able to continue certain things.  I have even read some people having these bugs ruining their save game so that they can no longer play.  I never experienced that but the game was a let down by that point.The story.  The main quest was really short so when I finished it I was let down.  All of the hours I spent buying homes and improving my character were pointless.  I could have beaten this game in probably 4 hours if I really pushed.  Kind of upset I wasted so much time with monotonous tasks like buying furniture and celery.  Also the final choice has 3 outcomes and 2 of them are pretty lame.  Meaning if you don;t choose the obvious one, you are meant to feel bad.  Kind of stupid if you ask me.The end game quest lines are also forgettable.  For instance there are certain things you cannot do in the game until after you beat the game.  These tasks are cool but they offer little enjoyment because the items or benefits you get don't help you in any way.  There are no bosses to fight so why do I need a better sword?All in all I found the game enjoyable for a certain spell but not as a whole RPG.  The game feels incomplete to me.  Just like Fable 1, I get the impression that the game never reached the actual vision and it was just polished and shipped anyway.  A more in depth character building system, a better game economy, and more player freedom earlier on I think would expand the appeal of the game and drive more people to do everything in the game.  I have never tried to open many of the demon doors and I doubt I ever will if I can beat the game with a sword I bought 1 hour into it.I will probably pass on Fable 3 or just give it a rent until the developers decide to add some substance.  This is way too much like Diablo for the new generation of RPGers.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days.

It's more different from the other FF games that I played, but its not all bad. The jobs are fun to play with, and the storyline is interesting. I have never played Final Fantasy Tactics (just FF1-7 for the NES, SNES, and Playstation platforms) so this kind of gameplay was new. There's fun stuff in here.However, the time it takes to build jobs for promotion is frustrating, as well as having to equip weaker items just to teach skills. The second time I played this game, I admit I used a cheat code to get full AP after every battle so I was able to skill up my players quickly, and I also kept my team limited. (only two extra members of each of the five races beside Marche, Montblanc, and the hidden characters)The endless battles and the arbitrary rules (I EFFING HATE THE EFFING RULES) are what dampen a game with a lot of potential. The battles took a long time, longer than in a regular RPG. Now I understand that battles were a important part of this game (hence the title) but it takes a ridiculously long amount of time to really play the game due to the battles, and can become very time-consuming unless you use cheat codes for level-ups or the like. Personally, I admit that the game is improved with one or two cheat codes (not all).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"C.T.","summary":"A phenominal achievement","reviewText":"First off, when Gears of War came out I did not own a 360.  Once I did though this was the first game I picked up.  I'd seen the videos, I'd heard the hype, now it was time to ask the question \"does this game live up to the hype?\"  If you want to skip the rest of my review, the simple answer is a resounding \"YES.\"First, lets take a look at the storyline.  Wait...there really is one there somewhere?  That's the single biggest gripe I have with the game.  They really don't flesh out the story at all.  I knew what was going on simply because I'd been online and read the \"history.\"  In short, an enemy known as \"the locust\" came from underground and in one fell swoop moved the human race to the verge of extinction.  Now the humans are making one last push to survive.  Simple enough.  You are a soldier who has been imprisoned for treason and the humans bust you out and reinlist you to help fight the locust.  While the story isn't very deep at all after a few minutes of playing the game you will probably forget it.  This is the biggest reason I gave this a \"4 of 5\" overall, but in the grand scheme of things it's not terribly important...as long as you have Xbox Live gold, but we'll touch on that later.The game is very linear so you won't spend any time wandering around wondering what to do next.  I guess it would have been nice to have it a bit more free roaming, but I still enjoyed it.  The advantage is that it's less than likely that an enemy will come up behind you.The big new thing in this game is the cover system.  It's really simple and works pretty well.  See a stationary (and sometimes not so stationary) object and hit the A button to put your back against it.  You can see around the edges and even fire your weapons blindly.  The system works pretty well with the exception that many of the actions you can take in the game require the use of the \"A\" button.  It seems that other people have alot more problems with this than I do, 99.9% of the time it works fine.  Once or twice it's hindered me but typically it isn't a problem.Anyways, the cover system works pretty well.  If too much of you is exposed you can still be hit, but generally if you're on level ground with an enemy he can fire away all day and won't hit you.Graphically the game is just beautiful.  The colors are dull but I think that serves to enhance the feeling of bleakness in the game.  The human race is almost gone, what is there to be cheerful about?  The textures are very sharp and the particles and blooms look great.  This is easily the sharpest game I've seen on the 360, and one of the sharpest I've seen on any console (PC included).The sounds are also great.  I wish the main machine gun you'll use in the game, the Lancer, had a bit more grunt to it, but overall the sounds are fantastic.  Grenades exploding next to you, bullets bouncing off your cover, it does a good job of immersing you into the game.The weapons in the game, while I wish there were a few more, are all a good bit of fun, and all must be used a different way.  You won't find yourself rushing anyone with the Torque Bow (basically a cross bow that shoots exploding arrows).  The Lancer, probably the most used weapon in the game, serves it's purpose well: shoot from long(ish) range and if something surprises you switch to easily the coolest weapon in the game, the chainsaw bayonet.  This death dealing device will (literally) reduce your foes to spare body parts in a matter of seconds, spraying the screen with bloody bits the whole time.  It's almost shocking the first time you see it, it's just so...gross.  But at the same time it's so...fun.  I will give the nod to Epic for making this by far the most satisfying use of a chainsaw in any game I've ever played.Finally, we come to the part of the game that you will spend the most time on, multiplayer.  And my goodness is it fun!  There are three different modes and typically I find myself playing the standard \"Warzone\" which is basically a team last man standing.  The maps cover a variety of enviromnents and all are a pleasure to play.  Also, one feature that you'll come to both love and hate is that often you won't simply kill a person, he'll fall to his knees.  At this point you've either got to hit him a time or two more to finish him off or a teammate can revive him.  The upside is that I've been saved numerous times when an enemy had to reload, the disadvantage is that my enemies can be revived.  It is a nice touch though.One thing I find a bit annoying about the multiplayer is the game's most fun item, the chainsaw bayonet.  It is a 1 hit kill, and if they start it they WILL finish it.  If it connects you are dead no matter what.  I wish that EPIC had made a way to either escape or have it not kill you if they didn't completely finish sawing.  It is simply TOO powerful.Overall the game is an absolute blast and I can see myself playing the multiplayer for months to come.  The game is extremely well designed and will leave you with Gears of War fever.  Does the game have flaws?  Yes, every game has a few.  But is the game great enough to overlook these flaws?  Easily!So do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this game and get to it!  I don't think you'll be dissappointed.*warning* This game is NOT for the young or innocent.  The game is extremely violent and the language is very rough.  If you are mature enough to handle that though then nab it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"paper tiger \"Adriel August\"","summary":"Finally! A True Next-Gen Game","reviewText":"Like many of you, I purchased a PS4 on release day and have played through all the major PS4 titles (Killzone, Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, Call of Duty: Ghosts, Battlefield 4, Thief, Tomb Raider) and we've been waiting for that true next-generation game which we were promised. I must say, inFAMOUS: Second Son is that game and is simply phenomenal and blows all others away in graphics and over-all gameplay.On a personal note, I played through the game with good karma as well as playing through a second time on expert difficulty on evil karma. I have the Platinum trophy. Great game, very fun. If anyone needs any tips, please don't hesitate to message me or add me as a PSN friend.What They did Right!+ Amazing graphics! Smooth, crisp and very Detailed. Great use of the PS4 potential.+ Very fun open-world Gameplay. Lots to do an see, plenty of exploration.+ Very good character voice acting and story building. You really get into the characters.+ Solid story with characters you learn to love, or hate. Different path or story outcome depending if you play to be a hero or be evil (I've completed the game twice, once for each karma path).+ Fun and rewarding ways to earn and upgrade new powers. There is Smoke, Neon, Video and Concrete. Each with different uses and capabilities depending on what you're doing.+ The city of Seattle has changing weather, rain which cause fog and puddles. Very real feeling environment.Frustrations...- A.I. is basic, almost the same as in past games. I expected a little more at times throughout the gameplay. Over-all, you take away the amazing graphics and you have a basic game with some fun powers.- Sometimes frustrating when you're trying to suck power from smoke, neon, video... and you keep getting shot and interrupting you regaining some of your power. At times, you cannot leave the area to get out of the line of fire as you're playing a mission. Sometimes can be frustrating.- Over-all the game didn't feel as long as the past two games. Sure there is a lot to do and plenty to explore, however I found every single shard and completed ever single side mission and it still did not take up as much time as past games. Still, ate a big chunk of time and was quite enjoyable to play through multiple times.- As in past games, you sometimes accidently walk into a mess of bad guys and die, then will be ported back to the nearest checkpoint, which may be 10 blocks away. As the game is huge, sometimes when you go back to the nearest checkpoint it takes time to find where you just were. The good news is anything you accomplished (shard collection, drug bust, other side mission) will be saved when you die and go back to the checkpoint.The graphics are amazingly detailed and very smooth. Eye poppingly crisp with lively colors. The control is perfect and the voice acting is some of the best I have ever witnessed. It is clear they put a lot of time and effort into this game and it was well worth the wait. They made good use of the power of the PS4 while also utilizing the PS4 controller speaker and touchpad. The story and attention to character building is great. It is a completely new story with all new characters, just as we suspected. Though there is mention of Empire City and you'll see some familiar faces as you progress though the game. Very fresh feeling gameplay with lots to offer and plenty to do and explore. This is a very open-world game and every block of the city has lots to do and explore.There are new and improved powers and abilities and new interesting ways to upgrade your abilities. You start off with utilizing smoke as an energy source instead of electricity as in previous games. Then you \"earn\" neon, which is nothing short of amazingly beautiful at night, taking neon energy from the neon lights around the city. You also earn more and different powers as you progress through the game like video & concrete. The powers are very different and are a lot of fun to use in different situations. This is a completely new gaming experience as compared to the two previous inFAMOUS titles. The in-game clips are directed like movies and the cut scenes are cool and artsy, similar to previous games. You can jump, climb, hover, push or run up walls, and even quickly swoop through vents in buildings to get to the roof or new areas, depending on what powers you have. It's very well designed and thought out. So much fun to play. You quickly can choose your karma by progressively doing good or bad. You can be a hero or a villain, good or evil.Some of your enemies also have abilities which make the gameplay more challenging. The city of Seattle is huge and there is so much to explore and see. I've played through twice, good and evil karma as well as completing all side missions earning me the Platinum Trophy. The game is very fun and for those Platinum Trophy hunters out there you won't be disappointed and you'll have a blast. Very fun game to take your time with, play and enjoy.Highly recommended for any PS4 owner. The first true graphically next-gen game.PSN: adrielaugustPatches!- There was a day-one patch to correct some minor issues, add about 5 hours of gameplay and some other minor additions.- Also, there is a new patch mid-April which brings photo mode, disable the HUD, change the time of day as well as a few game fixes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2014"}

The collector's edition is worth every cent of the extra price. And it's the ONLY MMORPG that's as good as Guild Wars. Although you have to pay monthly fees unlike in Guild Wars and like in every other MMORPG, this is the only one that's worth it. The stories are awesome and very satisfying for those who were left hanging at the end of Revan. If you were devastated that they got the Emperor's look totally wrong, don't worry: that wasn't the real one! It was the new Voice after the Sith Warrior class killed the old one (the brown brainy guy) on Voss. I know it sounds like a cop-out but they have to leave it open for expansions. ;) Anyway, there are only a few negative things about this game:1.

{"product_name":"B004S5PBM0","description":"","reviewerName":"Don Walton Jr.","summary":"Strong teaching tool...","reviewText":"Rocksmith is a natural progression in the series of rhythm-action games that have been hitting the gaming market in the past eight years.  With Guitar Hero, you were given a plastic guitar with five buttons.  With Rock Band, they upped that formula with the addition of vocals, drums and, eventually, keyboards.  Now Rocksmith brings that same formula to a real life musical instrument.  Gone are the plastic buttons, here are the real metal strings.The formula is largely the same as that of its plastic instrument forefathers: notes fall from the top of the screen, press the corresponding note at the right time to perform the song with accuracy and success (both in terms of points and audible integrity).  I tried the game with a '95 Fender Strat (electric guitar) as well as an Ibanez acoustic guitar (with 1/4\" jack), and the game worked fairly well with both guitars.  HOWEVER, there is a slight delay from my strumming to the sound as it comes through the game and your speakers.  There is an option to change the delay, but there is no way to test it while in the delay menu!  So you have to switch out to the 'Amp' (the game allows you to unlock effects and use your xbox as an amplifier!  Very cool!), to test the delay.  While switching in and out, the game pauses to save.  Irritating.This brings me to my biggest problem with Rocksmith.  The menus are miserable.  You must keep a controller active to navigate the menus (unlike the plastic guitars which come covered in control buttons).  Even with the controller to navigate the menus, finding your way around is confusing and messy.  I just wanted to play a song!  You gotta go all the way out to the main menu to sample songs.  There are rehearsals and performances, and never the twain shall meet.  So you end up playing all these blocks of songs, just to move along in the game.  Very little control in taking a fun path through the 'game'.  There are a ton of options and modes, for better or worse.  The menus often feels cluttered and downright confusing.What Rocksmith does right... It really is a great teaching tool!  It walks you through the songs, little by little, building on what you've learned as you rehearse.  You may start by playing only two notes of a riff, then a little more and more, and soon you are playing the whole riff!  On a real guitar!  It's pretty neat!  I learned guitar tablature in high school, and this gave me a huge DISADVANTAGE.  In tablature, the high E is the top most 'string', in Rocksmith, the view is placed behind the guitar, so you are looking through the neck.  As such, the high E string is now the bottom most string.  Not a big deal when you're just messing with the E and A strings, but then they start throwing in G and B strings and my hand kept wanting to stay on the low end.  I had to relearn and constantly focus on what I was seeing.  This took some of the fun out of it, as it was hard to naturally move around the guitar.  I wish there was an option to flip it.  (maybe there is... but MENUS... *COUGH*) EDIT Another user replied that there is a way to invert the strings in the options screen!For a new student of the guitar, the game is a great tool.  Sure, many of the songs are by obscure artists, (only a few heavy hitters like Nirvana and the Stones appear) but it still offers some variety in genre and walks you through it.  Many rehearsal sessions are available, as well as technique training moments.  One of the smartest things Rocksmith does, is it allows you to play around on the guitar.  As the game loads, you can doodle around.  Even in the songs, there is no penalty for hitting the wrong notes, so you can mess around as much as you like as long as you're hitting the right notes when they pop up.Rocksmith also throws in little mini-games, anything from playing chords to stop a zombie invasion, to simply hitting the right note to shoot a duck, Space Invaders-style, and more. A nice touch.Rocksmith is a great piece of software, but it requires some serious practice to experience the most from the game.  Even in my first 'performance', the first encore was a song I'd never heard, and it deviated from the single-note structure and started tossing in chords.  It was overwhelming, but thrilling when I stumbled through it and activated a second encore!  It was also pretty amazing to hear these 'hit' songs coming out of my hands on a real instrument.  Much more fun than guitar lessons and running through chord progression practice for hours...Overall: A for effort... B for execution...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Pikminfan \"bobsworld3\"","summary":"Pleasure and pain in equal doses","reviewText":"It's hard to really pigeonhole the the new Prince of Persia game.  With a mishmash of gaming styles, it's more of a patchwork quilt of sorts than either a dedicated action or platforming game.  But therein lies the problem.  On one hand the game is fantastic, on the other I could almost say that I hated it.  Epic in scope, Prince of Persia is a well made game with beautiful graphics, sweeping music & incredibly fluid motion.  So why am I just so \"meh\" about the whole thing?The game's most defining feature without question is its graphics.  Few other games take their visuals quite as seriously as the Prince of Persia series and this entry in particular is a remarkable achievement in that regard.  Every object, every character, every vista in the entire game-whether minor or epic was meant to be looked at.  You can even earn achievements for doing exactly that-and rightfully so.  This game is a true work of art. Standing on the edge of a beam from dazzling heights staring out at an enormous vista beneath your feet is nothing short of breathtaking.  This game is pure undiluted eye candy especially on a big screen hi-def television.  The vivid colors, vibrant atmosphere and sense of scale really make you feel as if you are part of an incredible, magical landscape.As for the gameplay itself, the platforming segments of the new prince quickly call to mind the POP trilogy of last gen with one big (and somewhat disappointing) difference.  Where as last time around a lot more emphasis was placed on careful timing and trial and error to maneuver your way through the game's many obstacles, this game encourages constant movement and forced momentum.  That in and of itself is not a bad thing, but here's the real problem- every time you seem to get into the grove of things, swinging along, running across stone walls, climbing ceilings, etc-an enemy shows up to hinder your progress and suddenly the thrilling \"ballet\" of movement you had been enjoying up to that point comes to a grinding, earth shattering, pavement splitting halt.  The player is then thrust into a boring as nails block, attack, block, attack, throw, block attack some more-ad nauseum \"battle\" which lacks even the slightest smidgeon of finesse of the game's platforming segments.  Sure, a game can't be all running through platform areas, but I'm sure the combat could've been handled so much better.  Just take a look at the last gen Prince of Persia games for proof of that.  The combat in that series was spot on.  Half of the time during combat, this game didn't even seem to accept my button presses and the other half, it expected me to \"anticipate\" which button I was supposed to press to stop an attack.  I guess you have to be a clairvoyant to play video games these days.  The point is, the combat in this game is an absolute bore.  It's frustrating, slow, repetitive and completely lacking in any kind of real strategy and really puts a big fat pungent stink on an otherwise fun-to-play game.Another real problem with Prince of Persia are the horribly implemented running and flying plates.  In a game that just oozes with class and polish, the design of these segments seem like a complete afterthought.  It's amazing to me that in a game where technically you can't die-how a large portion of the game still remains incredibly frustrating-these flying and running plates especially.  And don't even get me started on the final boss encounter.  The whole square-off is one big drawn out frustrating mess-and only for an ending that truly disappoints.If I were basing my review solely on the game's platforming and graphics, I would say Prince of Persia is incredibly fun and amazing looking game but that I still miss the more strategic movement and puzzling aspects of the earlier games.  However, if I were basing my review principally on the combat-I would say that this is a terribly un-fun, repetitive bore-fest-a-thon of a game with frustrating and stupid boss battles.  50%  fun, 50% the opposite of fun.  Here's hoping that the creators at Ubisoft go back to the drawing board for a sequel.  Hint: just look at Prince of Persia: Sands of Time and do everything that game did, but in hi-def.  I'd gladly take that game over this one any day.  This game is definitely worth a look, but don't expect it to hook you like the last gen games did.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2009"}

And it is, sort of (and I'll be qualifying that statement in a few seconds). But if you like Tetris, isn't this a good thing?The way I see it, every handheld system needs a good puzzle game. For whatever reason, Tetris is not currently available. Maybe because it is already available in so many other cheaper forms that they figured no one would be willing to pay $40 for it. Lumines has taken the skeleton of Tetris and built upon it to make a more complex puzzle game with awesome music and sound effects.At first, Lumines seems kind of basic and simple. Each block consists of four bricks that are any combination of two colors. You have to place them to form blocks of the same color. What adds so much depth to Lumines is the timeline. A vertical line sweeps across the screen at differing speeds depending on the level, and clears the blocks you have formed as it goes by. After playing for a few minutes you realize that you can use the timeline to your advantage by adding more blocks and creating larger combos for bigger points. Once you get the hang of it, this game becomes just as addicting as Tetris.I can't talk about Lumines without mentioning the music. If you have ever played the game 'Rez' for PS2, you should have an idea of what the music was like as the same guy did the music for both games. The music changes in each level and becomes interactive with the way you move your blocks. On all my other PSP games, I turned off the music to save battery. It would be a crime to do this with Lumines.Bottom Line: If you enjoyed Tetris, because believe me I've played Tetris as much as anyone, you will not be disappointed with Lumines.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2005"}

Roman","summary":"Long load times and rubberbanding = infrequent fun.","reviewText":"I'm not a big racing game person, and most of my experience with the genre involves the Mario Kart and Crash Team Racing games. In fact, I just plain don't care about cars, and never even played a 'real' racing game like Gran Turismo or anything like that. So ModNation Racers had my interest since it looked like it was going to be Sony's answer to Mario Kart. Well, the gameplay is very, very similar, but there are a few big problems that keep it from taking the portly plumber's title. And I'll get this one out of the way right now- yes, a patch for the long load times has been released. But you know what? It only cut down the times by about 1/3. You'll still spend a lot of your time waiting for 1-3 minutes for a simple customization menu to pop up, or even for the track to load, even if you just played that very track seconds before and want to re-race.ModNation Racers is a simple game to get into, and if you've played a Mario Kart before, it's just like that but with some differences here and there. Instead of doing a hop to drift, drifting has been assigned to the X button, so you can drift whenever you want with one simple press/hold. Drifting's an important part of the game too, since drifting fills your shield meter, which allows you to block attacks from the other racers. You can also stack weapons. When you drive into a weapon bubble, and if you don't use the weapon when you reach another bubble, your weapon will be upgraded. A regular homing missile (the red Koopa shell of this game) can be upgraded into a massive air strike that'll obliterate whoever gets caught in its zone. Unfortunately, there are a lot of weapon bubbles on the tracks, and with a lot of racers, that makes for a lot of weapons. When playing against the computer, be prepared to replay tracks over and over again after going from 1st to 12th when a lightning bolt takes you out just before you hit a ramp, and everyone else passes you while you're trying to recover, only to be hit by another weapon. I swear, the AI waits until right when I pass a car before using a weapon, usually on the final lap.The Career mode's the basic single player game, and has some pretty fun cutscenes to move the story along. It's nothing special, but younger players will get a kick out of some of the jokes. There are also the usual split screen and online gameplay modes, and setting up races with other people on PSN is easy. You can also report any obscene material. I had way more fun playing online with other people, but even that was crippled by the long waiting and load times.The main selling point for MNR though is the creation aspect. You can make your own characters, tracks and cars. Do you want Mario or Samus? Make 'em or download 'em. How about one of the monsters from Where the Wild Things Are driving a school bus? You can do that too. The tracks can get pretty creative too, but there's one thing I thought could've been handled better. You're limited to what you can create at first. Like LittleBigPlanet, you can only create levels and characters with items you've unlocked or won in the main game. Each track has different goals- just winning the race wins you some basic items, but meeting the other requirements gives you the really good stuff. These goals are usually easy to earn, with some of them being just hitting 3 other racers with weapons or activating panels on the tacks. But again, good luck getting those on the first try with how often the computer lays the smackdown on you. I had to replay one track 18 times before I finally came in first place with the goals met for some stupid stickers to use on my car.Overall, I wanted to like ModNation Racers, but stupidly cheap AI and those damn load times kept me from getting more out of it. Yes I know that it's more of an online game than a single player one, but if you want to get items for customization, you need to get really, really good at the single player mode. Also, I couldn't help but feel like this would've been better suited as a downloadable game for half (or less) the price it's currently going for. With all the great customization elements...the tracks, framerate issues and loading times made it feel a bit cheap. This is one I'll definitely wait on getting until the price goes down a bit more. 'glad it was only loaned to me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2010"}

Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"A worthwhile game with a disappointing ending","reviewText":"Fallout 3 takes place in a post-apocalyptic nuclear holocaust destroyed world, specifically in the Washington DC area.  Your character is a \"Vault dweller\" -- a person born and raised inside a Vault which is basically a super bomb shelter designed to keep it's inhabitants safe from the horrors of whatever lays outside.  Fallout 3 is, first and foremost, a role playing game packaged in an almost first person shooter style container.  The game is as deep in scope as it is wide in breadth.  While you begin as a nobody in a tiny little world, you quickly grow to become a big player on a gigantic stage.  Fallout 3 mixes a very driven series of main quests with the option of massive open-ended play distractions.Fallout 3 was a far more robust experience than I had anticipated.  I didn't play the first two, but I was a _huge_ Wasteland fan, so games of this genre really appeal to me.The environments are absolutely stunning.  All too often we get wrapped up in the game, in a tunnel-vision style mode, where we are just focused on what is immediately in front of us.  In this game it is worthwhile to just go to different places and look off into the distance.  Some of the views, both in majesty and in content, are unbelievable.  The art in this game is certainly a ten.  Not only is the outside environment impressive, but the inside environments are good, too.  They aren't Dead Space quality, but they are good none-the-less.The non-main quests are a mixed bag.  Some of them are definitely interesting, others are just mail delivery quests.  I will say that there are generally a few ways to finish a quest, and some of them can be short cut or extended depending on how you go about them.  There is so much to do, side quest wise, that you can take a break almost any time you like from the main quests and just lose yourself in the immense and beautifully done DC Capital Wasteland.  Fallout 3 does a good job of presenting you with many distractions while you push along down the main quests.Combat.  The temptation is to think of this game as a FPS.  It is not.  In fact, if you play it as a FPS you will pretty much get yourself killed.  You really do have to rely upon the VATS system -- which is very skill dependent.  You can fire a high damage weapon at an enemy and barely scratch them if you aren't proficient in that item.  Keep that in mind when you approach combat.  Occasionally FPS style combat is useful -- or even necessary in the case of sniping or the Fat Man -- but it is wise to just surrender yourself to the points based skill dependent type of play that the VATS does a good job of enforcing.  If you approach this game as an FPS you will be sorely disappointed.There are a few little issues here and there with the game.  Combat can be repetitive.  Early on the game is a struggle due to weak skill levels and poor equipment, but once you cross a certain threshold it swings the other way and the challenge evaporates.  The main quest(s) tell a good story, but most of the story is fairly standard fare.  The ending of the game, I thought, was fairly abrupt and anti-climactic.  There are a few different endings to the game, but that mostly depends on two or three choices you make _immediately_ prior to the end of the game.  The journey was excellent, but the end was poor.One other minor complaint:  The game, in a way, scales with the character.  Not quite like Oblivion did, as I understand Fallout 3 scales an area to your character once you enter it -- and then as you progress that area stays at its original level.  This dynamic, much improved over Oblivion as it is, takes away any sense of accomplishment that leveling really has.  True, that when you level you gain perks and skills and such, but to some degree it doesn't really seem to affect your relation to the difficulty of the game.  People who go after leveling up early will be disappointed -- my recommendation is to just proceed down the main quest, using side quests as distactions, and enjoy the leveling as you go.To conclude this review I will say that I found Fallout 3 very entertaining.  I'm not sure on its replayability -- if you are a completionist type player then you will have a staggering amount of stuff to do -- but I'm sure in a few weeks, during a lull in game releases, I will be back to playing this game again.  The game had quite a few impressive moments, both visually and in concept, and I would recommend it to anyone who finds themselves to be a fan of the Bethesda style RPGs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SWYTC","description":"","reviewerName":"dookerJ","summary":"Almost perfect FPS","reviewText":"This game&#8230;  is really amazing.  A stellar FPS game that controls extremely well and feels like you might as well be playing it on a next-gen console.  Gorgeous visuals, panoramic scenery, every little detail given tons of attention.  The campaign (single player) is VERY long; frankly longer than I remember any of the first three games being, and longer (at least for me) than Killzone: Shadow Fall.  I've been playing it on Normal mode for days upon days, and still haven't finished it.  They really give you your money's worth.  Then the stuff you earn in single player carries over to multiplayer, like a whole other game!  It's really a tremendous value; it was worth every dollar and then some.  I'm really surprised at how great this game is.I only have a few complaints, and they were enough to take off a star.  In the campaign, the Intel Terminals are virtually impossible to unlock.  Sometimes you're lucky if you can get to the last piece on the last screen.  Hitting a wrong cipher symbol takes off 5-10 seconds from your already paltry amount of time left to complete the puzzle.  It's almost like they didn't play-test these portions of the game; overwhelmingly gamers on forums have said the Intel Terminals are way, way too difficult.  I'm usually a master hacker in games, do well in puzzle games, etc, and have NEVER seen anything this demanding.  It's a shame, because you usually aren't able to see what are really pretty well done pieces of intel; you can tell they really put some time and thought into them.The other thing, is the lack of checkpoints.  While playing, the checkpoints are &#34;okay&#34;; sometimes they have you repeating quite a lot of gameplay, and you die a lot, but it's fun, so it's not a huge deal.  On the other hand, when you need to leave the game, if you quit, you can only continue the campaign by restarting the latest mission unlocked, from the *beginning*.  So it's like, if you aren't willing to sit through an entire mission (which can take hours), you might as well put away the Vita and wait until you have time to commit to it.  Granted, you could play until the system goes into hibernate, and pick up from there, but it's less than ideal; you won't be able to play/load any other games in-between.  It makes you feel kind of locked-in.The last thing I will say is, the Vita is kind of oriented towards younger people and kids&#8230;  I happened to pick one up because it was bundled with my PS4.  I might not have gotten one otherwise (but the second screen capability should come in handy); anyway, just saying, if you're a parent, and considering this game for your kid, stop and watch some reviews and do a reality check.  This game is extremely violent.  The increased focus on melee combat means you see a lot of really gruesome, up-close, knife-in-skull, knife-in-groin, all kinds of deadly combat.  This is definitely a &#34;grownup&#34; game.  If you're a grownup, though, that makes it all the better, though, since it's good to have some &#34;adult games&#34; on the Vita, widening its base of games and making the platform better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2014"}

The ending was a big surprise and worth the trip.Overall this is a solid FPS that is worth your time!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2011"}

I am not sure how they messed up the previous ones, but I must admit I bought resistance 2 day one and didn't even complete the single player, went to online it was just as bad. To say the least I was totally annoyed with it. However, that is not the case with resistance 3 they totally remade the entire game and did a great job at making it a better experience for the consumer. The weapons are upgrade-able which adds to the fun as well as there being some cheats, you get points when you unlock the trophies for the game which in return allow you to purchase a cheat if you have enough. and you can pay online with a friend at all times through the campaign. The online MP was re-done and I spent a little time there, but there was no need too really because there were no MP trophies. The most outstanding part of this game is the 3D I felt like I was in the game because from debris flying in my face like rain to the enemies!! I found myself jumping outta my seat a few times when something popped out when it was really quit lol. Though the depth that the 3D adds too the game makes the game incredibly fun. I honestly want every game I play like this now. This is probably not until next gen but at least Sony for-saw a chance in 3D when they made the ps3. I do realize a lot of people do not have the money for a 3d TV but SAVE UP, I saved for a year and man its worth all my savings. A sure buy if you had a 3D TV even if you don't the game is still good enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2012"}

(that part is cool) and make the difficulty easier so you don't need extra health?  why place more obstacles in the way of action?also when you die, the screen loading takes too long and you don't get to start again right away.  i want to play a game, not wade through cut-scenes i already watched.now my issues with the action..  the picture is too small and by that i mean, it's too easy for dante and the enemy(ies) to not be shown in the same damn screen!!  sometimes i'm shooting at enemies i can't even see!  what's up with that?  it would be so much better if you could see what you're doing at all times.  also all the different moves kind of get on my nerves.  i don't like having to memorize a lot of moves, not to mention, even when you learn them, they don't always work!  you might have to try a move 3 times and it works the third time.i've never played ninja gaiden, but it seems quiet similar and if it's better than this, i'd like to try it.  this game is pretty good but it's not capturing my interest for very long.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2007"}

So as she fights the Collectors on a new and stronger space ship, while still trying to prove the Reapers' existence, Commander Shepard has to recruit her former and new comrades for her mission, rekindle or have a new romance, and reconsider life after being dead for two years.Visually the game is sharper than ever. The character designs are awesome, and the models look closer to reality than before. As usual, you can either play a male of female Shepard,, use your Mass Effect 1 saved game to import your Shepard's actions into the second game, but you can also customize your character's face, since Shepard has died, and either give his former or new powers (ex: going from Soldier to Engineer). Even though you can decide to keep your former powers, what's awesome is that you can decide to add an extra power that one of your teammates employs, even if his work has nothing to do with yours. You just have to complete his personal quest and you can get his powers if you succeed in getting his loyalty. And you better consider it an important asset because the more loyalty you receive from your mates, the more chance you will have to find them still alive after the final mission.About your crew, I was glad to get my former mates back like Garrus, Joker, Tali, along with new people like Thane, Samara, Mordin, Jack, Jacob, Miranda and Wrex. Of the non-playable crew, I was glad to have Joker back, but also of having EDI, an artificial intelligence in control of the ship, but whose relation with Joker gives out hilarious situations. And of the new additions, I can say that each character, whether I used one more than the other, brings out richer scenes and incidents than in the  precedent game. Not only on the field, but also on the Normandy's deck. For my romance, I was happy that they finally consider other alien relationships with humans. That gave me the occasion to have a romance with Garrus, whose reactions to this new way of life makes him say funny quotes. Among some of the characters you get to interact with, you have scenes with Cerberus's boss, the Illusive Man, voiced by Martin Sheen, who gives a perfect performance. As usual, Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, Steve Blum, Seth Green, and all the other actors give excellent performances.The gameplay follows the RPG s-adventure part of the game, although this time it is more action oriented. As such, no more rides for you on the Mako. You get to the location the action happens on the planet right after a loading time, and you dive right into the action and story scenes. As of your character interactions, your level explorations still allow you to find new content about the places you visit, or weapons to help you fight, but your characters now move as they speak, giving them more life to their scenes. Not only that, you can also do Paragon or Renegade actions during your dialogues. For instance, if a crew member is telling you that he wants to use a dangerous weapon on the enemy, you can, if the paragon command appears on the screen, convince him to not rely on that tactic. Of course, if the opposite happens and you want a certain rag journalist to shut up, you can do so if the Renegade symbol appears. Of your spaceship explorations, you can still find resources thanks to a probe that you launch on a specific position on the planet. But be aware that it is also useful if you need to find a proper location to a side-quest if EDI catches weird signals on the planet.For the music and sound effects, they are still as top notch as in the first game. Playing the game with a Dolby 5.1 system is essential if you want to fully experience the game's effects.  For the Dowloadable Content, it is interesting enough to use it since one of them offers you to use a Bounty Hunter, while others offer you extra quests whose consequences will follow up to the start of the final game. Whose story brought a polarizing reaction from the fans this year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2012"}

Two years after the first game takes place, quite a bit has happened.  As Commander Shepherd, you must return and rebuild a crew to assist the morally ambiguous organization called Cerberus in their quest to stop an alien race from raiding human colonies and kidnapping the colonists.  You can import your character from Mass Effect 1 and continue with this game.  One of the primary features of this game is the use of Dialogue Trees.  Whenever you talk to another character, you can control what Shepherd says.  These decisions affect the outcome of the story.Gameplay:  8/10The game plays like Gears of War, where you must cover and shoot.  The random die roll hit / miss stuff from the first game is gone and now your guns are more accurate and responsive.  During a firefight, you can pause the game to switch weapons or use your abilities like Warp, Throw, Slam, Incinerate...  Or you can play the firefights in real time by mapping your special abilities to buttons.  The combat has been greatly improved over ME1, but it feels like there's still some room for improvement.  There isn't enough variety in the enemies and the \"spells.\"  It's too easy to just duck, cover, and use biotic powers to throw enemies around the room.  The combat could use a bit more decision making and some more complicated spells or spell combinations.The awkward Mako Range Rover from ME1, does not appear in ME2!!!Instead, you can scan planets for resources.  This is somewhat tedious, but it's fast and the rewards are great.  You basically move a cursor around a planet and when you detect minerals, you press a button to launch a probe and collect them.  These minerals are used to upgrade your weapons.Level Designs:  9/10Most of the Level Designs are great.  They drive the story and put YOU in the action.  The designs are also straightforward so it's almost impossible to get lost in the levels.Graphics:  10/10The Cutscenes are amazing.The Science Fiction Worlds are amazing.The alien races are amazing.The special effects are very good.Mass Effect 2 looks great!Replay Value:  8/10You can import your character from ME1.  You can play as good or evil.  When you finish this game, you can keep your current abilities and explore the galaxy, or start over with your ME2 character.  There are different difficulty modes for greater challenge.  You pretty much have to play this game twice to see everything.  Each play through could take anywhere from 16 - 32 hours, depending on how much you want to explore.Flaws:There is one minor flaw.  The button that you use to skip the line of dialogue is also used to select an option from the dialogue tree.  So, if a character starts talking and you want to skip to the next line of dialogue, sometimes you press the button as the dialogue tree appears and accidentally say the wrong thing, which may affect your quest, reputation, etc...  I'm astonished that Bioware didn't use the B button to skip to the Dialogue Tree, X to skip everything, and A to select.  In the grand scheme of things, this is a minor complaint.Weapon Upgrades:  10/10No more sifting through 400 different guns to find your favorite.  There are basic weaponry that you can upgrade by finding schematics and minerals as you play the game.  It's very simple.  As you and your allies go up in level, you can also unlock new powers.  It's nice and streamlined, allowing you to get back into the action and save the galaxy.Maturity:  MThe violence is mild, there is some harsh language, and some mild sexual situations.  This is a very light M.Overall:  9.5/10If you want to play a Sci-Fi RPG, this is it!  There isn't a better one.If you love Bioware games, buy this now!  It's also much better than Dragon Age.If you like easy shooters and want a game with loads of story, you should also buy it.If you're a fan of RPG's, this is a must buy.Avoid this game if you hated the first Mass Effect.Avoid this game if you want really difficult deep shooting mechanics, too.  The combat here may be a little light for you.If you enjoyed story of Mass Effect 2, check out Oblivion and Fallout 3!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2010"}

The gameplay is awesome, too! It's very easy to pick up, and it's well worth the effort to improve your character. Hunting is some of the best I've found in a videogame, and Rockstar really nailed the atmosphere here. The landscapes, the guns, the wildlife, everything seems just in its right place!

It's more of a tip for those who are looking into World of Warcraft and are wondering if they should invest in the expansion early.I was told that unless you wanted to play one of the new races, that the expansion wasn't worth buying until you were getting close to level 60.  Granted most of the material that comes with the expansion is level 58+, I found that it's worth having at the lower levels, even though I haven't tried EITHER of the new races, and don't have any high level characters yet.  Basically, I bound my hearth to Shattrath, which has portals to all 4 main cities within your faction.  There's also an enchanting trainer in Shattrath, so players won't find it necessary to travel to Uldaman just for training.

Couldn't Sega add the option of whether or not u want to? While we're on the subject of Sega, it's still hard to grasp a Sonic game on the GameCube. I guess that's because Sega and Nintendo were once competing against each other.The Sonic and Shadow levels obviously are tight because they're so fast paced, but this game is lacking.

{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Gears of War 3 Review","reviewText":"The final chapter has been written, and it is time to once again battle the Locust with Dom, Marcus, and others. Will this finally bring an end to the war, or will humanity fad into the past? Only you will be able to determine that. There is also the very important question of a certain bloodline that seems to meet misfortune at every turn in the series, will this Carmine actually see himself live through the game?Graphically this game looks stunning. I had a chance to play around with some of the multiplayer at PAX, so I did know what to expect. The character designs actually show the wear and tear on the characters as this part of the war has progressed, which personally tells me that a lot of thought went into this game. There's also the new enemies that you'll have to deal with that not only look amazing, but also look a little bit scary (especially when it comes to trying to take them down). There's also the variety of different landscapes that you'll be playing through that not only makes you feel the games progression, but also give you a sense that not everything has to be barren in a war ravaged world.The music has basically stay constant through the series, and that's probably for the best. As the saying goes \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\", and from the first time I picked up Gears of War I thought the music fit. There's also something to be said about getting the same voice actors to come back and lend their vocals to the series. There was no feelings of who said that, or have I seen you before, I thought I did but you sound different.The controls, I think, are the only piece of the game that regressed for this game. The controls did not feel as snug as they could have been with several issues with having pressed the aim button but having something happen while still holding the aim button, and no longer aiming. I do like the fact that when using the Longshot you are able to keep your zoomed in look when reloading after every shot though.So here you are, probably as Marcus Fenix, unless you are playing co-op. It has come down to this, and it is you who will have to put the final nail in someone's coffin. I'm not exactly sure what else to say about this game. There are going to be some twists in the story, and there are going to be new characters to meet, and you'll get to meet some old one's as well. There will be secrets revealed, battles fought, and a very large body count. You're going to get to play around with some new weapons, and use some of your favorite weapons from the past. This game is going to wrap up some of the biggest questions in the series, but it will also leave you with a couple of extra questions that I guess might be answered with DLC, or perhaps in the books.If you've played the first two games you need this one to find closure. If you're new to the series I recommend starting from the beginning and then playing this game. I think you could probably start straight off with Gears of War 3, but you'll have to watch the quick previously on Gears of War video just so you get a little background. They definitely made multiplayer feel more fleshed out and give you a leveling up system to unlock characters and other goodies. Bottom line this is a very good third person shooter, and though it doesn't match up in some regards to its predecessors, this is still something that must be added to your collection. This game gets an 8.9 out of 10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"Cut Scenes of War","reviewText":"This is a tough review for me. I really liked GoW 1, thought GoW 2 was a step in the wrong direction in terms of having too much, and, having just completed 3, I feel the franchise has gone completely overboard with everything - cast mates, enemies, cut scenes, boss battles. Everything is over the top. However, it's pretty much what I was expecting so who's to blame if I didn't really like it?Firstly, I haven't played co-op or MP. Those modes are of no interest to me so my money was plunked down solely on the basis of the single player and that's what this review will concentrate on.Rather than narrow down the intricacies of the game here's an overview of what it feels like to play Gears of War 3 - walk down a corridor, cut scene, spray three enemies with the garden hose that is supposed to be a futuristic weapon, cut scene, open a door, cut scene, walk down a corridor, cut scene, walk down another corridor into an elevator, cut scene then surprise at the top, kill bad guys, cut scene, cut scene, loading...  cut scene, open door, cut scene, take three steps which you're forced to slow jog in because you have your finger in your ear, cut scene, climb into a vehicle which you can't drive, cut scene, cut scene, cut scene, get out of vehicle, cut scene, many more elevators with an ambush at top, cut scene. Repeat the previous paragraph about four times.Game ends. Well done. You managed to survive the onslaught of cut scenes.It's quite clear that the devs, specifically CliffyB, would rather be making mediocre animated movies than video games. The actual amount of gameplay in the single player campaign is LESS than the length of cut scenes. And since you're always surrounded by three other colleagues, for the most part you can run past everything into the next area that triggers... another cut scene! As I played I disliked the game more and more. Unexpected elements such as ambushes at the top of elevators became so frequent they no longer were surprises. Weaponry is pretty much limited to the Hammerfist for 70% of the game and the rest of the time you're scrambling for a couple of rounds of boomshot ammo or grenades.Gears of War 3 is a spectacular yet extremely tedious game. If you like games that heavily rely of cut scenes and are prepared to 'get into it' I can totally see the thrill. In my case however, any time I felt I was finally digging it, another boring cut scene would do the opposite of its intention; it would break the immersion and bore me to death.Who's to blame if I didn't like GoW 3? The person who decided that story was more important than gameplay. And that wasn't me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME6O","reviewerName":"Nate","summary":"Pretty Cool, But Needed Fine Tuning","reviewText":"I don't know, but it just didn't live up to the hype for me. Although Silent Hill 2 is a great horror game. I just couldn't connect and the combat was so awkward at times the mood was over lapsed with mild frustration, but I did enjoy it to some extent. What separates it from the other Silent Hills? First off the soundtrack for SH2 is Akira Yamoaka at his best. It's seriously one of the greatest things I've heard in a video game. Some songs are most memorable and liked by many. Also the immersion is awesome in this game. It doesn't hold your hand, which requires the player to explore the town and find out how to get to the next objective. That involves solving puzzles, finding keys, and crafting stuff to acquire key items. Very Neat! Last but not least.... Pyramid Head. Of course. This enemy is like a stalking presence that follows you the whole story and you don't know when he will strike next. There were times I really didn't want to explore a room or hallway because the heart stopping music would start and it felt like he was near. Then nothing. Other times absolute silence, then there he is chasing you with a spear to stick you in the back. Ouch! Very well done and this was something that really impressed me. Then the final showdown with two Pyramid Heads accompanied by intense music was cake. Amazing.*One last thing I really appreciated about Silent Hill 2 over the others is that it doesn't include all the occult demonic mumbo jumbo the other installments harp on throughout the story. Not everyone likes that kind of junk thrown in their face when trying to play a video game and I'm one of them. So major plus there.  Alright on to dislikes.What was mentioned above the combat just frustrated me at times. Swinging weapons at enemies only to hit walls again and again. While the enemy just stood there and smacked me to death. Did I mention most confrontations take place in tight hallways or small rooms? I'm a big melee person when it comes to horror games, so definitely a personal dislike. Konami has improved this over the years with recent installments. Guns on the other hand are great and get the job done. There is also an over abundance of ammo throughout the town, so I never felt the need to conserve which did subtract some survival aspect to my over all experience. Going back to melee though where are all the weapons? All I picked up was a wooden plank and a pipe. A character gives James a knife, but when trying to equip it for use he refuses to do so. Also you can steal Pyramid Heads sword from his room. I personally loled at this. It's fun to swing around like you're all that, but it's slow, awkward, and will most likely hit a wall when attacking enemies making it utterly useless. Funny none the less. Also the chainsaw is the same way. Awkward, slow, and isn't fast enough for attacking. For some strange reason it just shuts off when James is attacked or isn't in combat stance too. Which isn't how a chainsaw works in real life. So yeah melee/combat was my biggest gripe with SH2. There's just not enough weapons in SH2 and barely any unlockables like in other games. And what weapons you do get just aren't that cool..... Minus that buster sword xD Anywho I've overkilled the point already, but yeah it just bothered me that much.  There were other things that effects my rating a little like the awkward scripts for the characters when they interacted with each other. Kind of ruined the atmosphere. Also I didn't care for most the characters in the first place, except for saving a certain companion named Maria. But all that aside this was a great game I highly recommend. Final verdict 8.2/10Hope this helps","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00020LZBG","description":"The third installment of the Ratchet & Clank franchise incorporates new elements of gameplay not seen previously in the series, including online and offline multiplayer capabilities that will appeal to a wide variety of players.Ratchet and Clank: Up Your Arsenalreturns gamers to Planet Veldin, the setting of the originalRatchet & Clank, where the duo set off on a gripping new adventure through a multitude of diverse planets to fight for galactic peace. Players can earn up to 20 weapons (including online and offline) with up to four levels of upgrades for most weapons, plus new high-tech gadgets to help them through their journey.After word spreads of Ratchet and Clank's recent conquest inRatchet & Clank: Going Commando, Clank finds himself recognized as an interstellar robot of mystery and intrigue after starring in his own television series, Secret Agent Clank. While Ratchet is dismayed by his new sidekick status, the feelings are put aside when the twosome is called together by the Galactic President to bring peace to the universe. They find themselves traveling back to Planet Veldin to battle Dr. Nefarious, a robotic supervillain who has devised a diabolical scheme to wipe out all organic life in the galaxy. To reach his goal, he has instructed the Tyhrranoids, a race of multi-eye aliens to annihilate the organics. However, while Dr. Nefarious is aware that if the Tyhrranoids are successful, they will end up causing their own extinction, the Tyhrranoids are not aware of this danger.To fight back, Ratchet and Clank are able to recruit Captain Qwark, a favorite from previous games, out of retirement to lead the Q-Force, an unlikely band of heroic space cadets comprised of some of the most memorable characters from the Ratchet & Clank franchise. This includes Helga, the robotic seductress; Big Al, a techno-geek with the ability to encrypt technology systems; and Skidd McMarxx, a former hoverboarding champ and pro slacker turned spy. Together with the Q-Force, Ratchet and Clank set off on another hilarious interstellar romp to uncover the schemes of the sinister Dr. Nefarious and keep the galaxy safe for organic life.The Starship Phoenix, headquarters for the Q-Force, is the flagship in the fight against Dr. Nefarious and serves as a key information hub. The Starship is also where players can expect to receive new missions and training, and purchase armor and weapons. In addition, players will gain access to new vehicles, like the Turbo Slider or Hovership, to compete in races and combat enemies in intense battlefield missions. Refined intuitive enemy artificial intelligence means non-playable characters behave more intelligently by gathering information about their environments and forthcoming attacks, ultimately providing the player with more challenging gameplay.The multiplayer gameplay featured inRatchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenalis naturally suited for both the offline and online universe because it includes the variety of weapons, gadgets, vehicles and gameplay made famous throughout the Ratchet & Clank franchise. For those who want to experience the split screen multiplayer capabilities, up to four players can play offline, while the multiplayer online mode accommodates up to eight players over a broadband connection. In addition, six new levels are introduced for online play, featuring several elements that encourage team-based activities in modes such as capturing an enemy's base. For example, destructible environment obstacles in battlefield environments create strategic gameplay decisions and general mayhem. Commandeering multiple vehicles further encourages strategic co-op gameplay by allowing players to work together as one person navigates the vehicle while the other works its weapon's arsenal.In order to promote community gameplay, voice communication is supported online via the USB headset (for PlayStation2), allowing players to communicate with fellow team members during online games, either in-game or in the main lobby. The lobby area features an online friends list, allowing players to be matched up based on their gameplay statistics and will offer the ability to select from a variety of player skins.","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Still the best of all the R&C games","reviewText":"The title pretty much says it all.

The games are beautiful and if you look at early Xbox 360 games you see how much the games have improved until now and as the developers learn to utilize the Xbox One I can't see any reason you won't see similar progress.  I think this generation of consoles limits the need for the average gamer to get into the PC.  This console takes the place of the HTPC and adds PC quality gaming into it.  I love the fact that I can walk into my room and say \"Xbox, on\" and it turns on my t.v. and cable box too.  I can then say any number of commands and watch t.v., start a game, watch Hulu, watch Twitch, surf the web, start Skype, join a party, etc...  So far the PS4 is the only thing that has Twitch actually built in but the Xbox One does have a voice activated game DVR that allows you to record and share all those cool gaming moments.

San Andreas is still my favorite.San Andreas is the definition of a sandbox game to me.  It is a game that showed me that you really can do pretty much anything you want.  The map is gigantic and full of variety.  You want to cruise around a big vegas type city? Go ahead.  Do you want to hang out in a small quiet suburb? Ok.  Or do you want to go in the back country and jump over mountain tops or even cruise in the sand dunes? You can do that too.  I was amazed at how this world feels real and it is fun to explore and see it all.Yes the game has its problems.  It isn't the best looking game and it may have its fair share of technical issues but I almost don't even count these minor complaints.  A lot of them are more comical than annoyances.The story is long and the missions are crazy and fun to complete.  Plus, there are a whole bunch of fun side missions to earn extra cash and respect for your gang.  These include but are not limited to: gang wars to take over turf, robberies, pimping, races, sky diving, and many more. Add in the fact that you can customize the main character how you please(clothes, hair, physic, etc) and almost all the vehicle types in the game(color, decals, tires, tinting, etc) and how you can upgrade your weapon skills in order to handle them better(dual pistols and smgs, etc) and you have so many options to choose from in how you play the game and you have one complete game.The voice work in the game is awesome as well.  There are so many characters you meet in the game and all of them have their own distinct and interesting personalites and their voices are excellently acted.If you haven't played this one and your wondering if you would be able to go back and play a last gen game definitely give it a go anyway.  I have kept my ps2 all this time because I pop this one in every now and then to play it again among other select titles.  I think the fun in this game holds up after all this time. I love GTA 4 but was a little disapointed at how toned down it was.  It kind of seemed like a step back for me in a way.Bottom line: if you want to play a game with almost limitless freedom to do what you want then definitely play this game.

Everyone I game with always spoke of the awesomeness that are the Turtle Beach headsets but I usually prefer to avoid trends given they're the things that gave us Ride to Hell and every show on MTV2.  However, I decided to maintain an open mind when given the opportunity to test the X04 Turtle Beach headset and, after a month of prolonged usage I feel as though most of the hype was somewhat warranted but not without some limitations.First off, setup and syncing up the XO4 was easy enough especially without the cross-floor cables and cords to watch out for (although the headset connects to the controller via short cable so it's not entirely wireless but, details!).  To me, this is a huge plus as nothing annoys me more than having to continually adjust and readjust cables whenever I change positions on the couch, which is frequently.As for the comfort of the headset, that is where I experienced some limitations as the headset seemed more tailored towards teenagers and kids with smaller heads.  Granted, I'm 6'5 with a proportionately sized noggin, but I would expect some degree of latitude when it comes to size adjustments, especially with an alleged premier quality product.  It felt tight and got annoying within an hour so I had to take it off every half hour or so in order to stay comfortable.As for the sound quality, it's not bad.  My RIG is pretty good and has 5.1 surround as does the X04 and they seem pretty comparable albeit the X04 costing less.  It's not exactly the ear-opening super-awesome experience everyone told me it would be but it was far from terrible or mediocre.  It was just&#8230; good, not bad.Truth be told that after a month of prolonged use I was rather indifferent about the X04 mostly due, in fact to the lacking size.  I can see how others would love this product but I, myself, don't see it as much due to my size.  It's still a good purchase for your average gamer below six feet tall, but not for me.  I'll continue looking for a larger headset to fit my noggin.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2014"}

It is, however, important to note that this particular Logitech wheel was specifically designed to be used almost entirely for current and future iterations of the GT game series (the nifty backlit 'GT' logo on the horn should be a dead giveaway) and therefore if your intention is to use this product on other PS3 racing games you won't quite get the same 4-star experience as you would with GT.With that out of the way, coming out of the box the wheel feels quite sturdy as is the pedal board.  The main hardware components are all quite responsive and unlike many similar products manages to stay grounded in place no matter how hard you think you are pushing it.  The wheel itself is capable of a very smooth 900 degree rotation and the contextual force feedback is accurate and greatly enhances the overall gameplay experience.  Another great future when used with 'GT' is the hardware addition of a real-time adjustment dial allowing you to tweak settings as you'd like on the fly, in the middle of your game.Some minor caveats - shifting is counter-intuitive as the device requires you to up-shift to drop gears and vice versa.  Also, as mentioned above this product doesn't function quite as smoothly when used with non 'GT' driving games.  There is a fairly comprehensive option menu that allows you to adjust the wheel for other games but it is a rather long process and will take awhile to get the proper setup in place.  That said, if 'GT' is your thing the wheel is a terrific complement that will greatly enhance your 'GT' sessions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2008"}

On offense, you pick either run or pass play. From that, you can either run one play of to the left, right and middle. That's it, the whole game, but on different drives and downs the three basic runs change the route it takes. If you pick a pass, you can either cdo pass short, medium or long. That's it, the whole game but again even though it's still one of the three the actual plays themselves change with each drive or down. On defense it's more of the same. You either pick run or pass defense on every play. From there you either pick defend pass short, medium or long pass defense. That's it, all game long.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Despite some flaws, Force Unleashed delivers","reviewText":"The eagerly anticipated Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is finally here, and Star Wars fans will find plenty to admire and enjoy here.  Others however may find a certain degree of disappointment to be found with Force Unleashed thanks to some noticeable flaws and glitches, but if one overlooks these, a good time is to be had.  Featuring one of the best and most compelling stories you may ever find in a video game period, Force Unleashed also features some thrilling and jaw dropping moments that will make even the smallest Star Wars fan squeal with joy.  You play as Starkiller, the secret apprentice to Darth Vader, and you are charged with eliminating the last remaining Jedi in the universe.  Interacting with your pilot Juno Eclipse and a droid named PROXY, Force Unleashed also features some compelling and inventive characters to boot; so much so that you'll actually be caring about what happens to them as the game progresses.  As said before, Force Unleashed is loaded with thrilling moments, but a good amount of these moments are few and far between, and some technical and gameplay glitches really hurt the game as well.  Including times when the camera seems to want to work against you, the targeting system is frustrating in in every sense of the word.  Force Unleashed also comes off at times as being too epic in scope to fit the final product of what you're playing; it just feels as if something is missing here that shouldn't.  Still though, the game looks wonderful, the music is superb, and the art design is simply spectacular.  All in all, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed isn't a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination, but despite it's flaws, the game delivers the goods that Star Wars fans will be looking for, and it is definitely worth your time and attention.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003VR5PPY","description":"","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"A Good But Flawed Game...","reviewText":"I'm a big point-and-click adventure game fan, so I was naturally interested when I heard about this game.  It had awesomely positive reviews, so it seemed like a winner!  Unfortunately, I was busy with other games in my backlog so I didn't get around to playing 999 until now.  So, does it hold up to my high expectations?  Let's find out!Graphics (score 8/10): The art style of this game is best described as \"anime-inspired\" without being over the top about it.  It also seems very familiar to me, and I think I know why: it reminds me very much of the art style in the Persona games.  I don't know if they are actually related or not though...  As for the animation, there's some fully animated cutscenes here and there, but for  the most part, there's just static images paired with text.  The characters are also 2-D and they do move their eyes and mouths occasionally, but compared to a game like Phoenix Wright, it feels like there's far less movement.  It also feels like there are less static images in general compared to other games in the genre.  Limited budget perhaps?  Oh well.Music (score 7/10): No voice acting, but there IS some sound effects and some music.  It's pretty understated music.  There's just enough of it to be background noise, but it doesn't really stand out as much as I'd like.  That being said, I can't really say the music is bad, it's just a bit bland and unnoticeable.  That's really all I can say for this section.Characters (score 9/10): There are eight major characters that you spend the majority of the game with, all of them with cool codenames (everyone decides to use codenames instead of their real names when they meet in case that psycho who kidnapped them is listening in - more on that in the story section).  I'm not going to go through everyone, but you play as a young man named Junpei (who is just your average college student).  He's pretty likable and it's obvious he's supposed to represent a sort of \"everyman\" character for the player to relate to.  Even though the game is pretty short (it takes about 10 hours to get through one playthrough), it does a very good job of making you feel like these characters are real people through the use of very little actual knowledge about each of them.  That's a hard thing to do and I'm truly impressed.  Plus, even if you don't necessarily like all of these people, you at least empathize with them and their plight.  That, too, is rather impressive.  This would've gotten a full 10 points out of me except for one ending of the game that features a character acting like a complete psycho when it was rather out of character to do so (I'm not going to say who, but it so stunned me that I couldn't like her after that no matter what).Story (score 9/10): In a genre that's absolutely saturated with games themed around being a detective/investigator of some type, 999's story is a really refreshing change of pace.  Don't get me wrong, I love detective-style adventure games, but it's really nice to see something new - and it's a horror-themed game no less (the only other horror-themed adventure game I can think of on DS is Theresia)!  999's premise is that your main character, Junpei, has been kidnapped by a mysterious (aren't they always?) psychopath who's trapped him and some other random people on a sinking ship and is literally going to kill everyone if they can't solve his/her puzzles and escape.  Sounds intriguing, huh?  Well, the story is pretty good.  I do have a bit of a complaint, though.  I'm sure you've heard the old phrase \"show, don't tell\"?  This game has a bad habit of doing to opposite.  Rather than show you something, it just has long bits of text to exposit it.  So, for example, instead of showing Junpei's face reacting with fear, it'll just have text saying \"Junpei reacted with fear\".  I suppose it's related to the limited animation (see graphics section above), but I've certainly seen this sort of thing handled better elsewhere (namely in Phoenix Wright and just about every other adventure game on DS ever...).  In fact, if you are the sort of person who hates long cutscenes, then this game may have you huddled in a corner, begging for the sweet release of death...  I thought this wouldn't bother me; I mean, I played through all three games in the Xenosaga series (an RPG notorious for its long cutscenes), but it started to grate on me after awhile (I clocked one round of scenes as lasting at least 1  hours!).  When you have to hit the X button or tap the screen after every few sentences, the scenes get tedious really fast.  It's especially annoying when you're fast-forwarding through stuff you've already seen before (on previous playthroughs, more on that in the gameplay section) and you just wish you could press one button and skip it entirely.  I will say one thing, though, the multiple endings ALL add some value and enjoyment to the story (once again, more on that in the gameplay section).  Well, anyway, if long cutscenes don't bother you, then I can safely say you'll enjoy the story immensely like I did since it's quite good!Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Games in the point-and-click adventure genre can have the best stories and most compelling gameplay ever, but usually they don't have much replay value.  I mean, if you're like me, you'll want to replay them eventually just to re-experience the story, but most of them don't have anything past that.  Well, 999 has very kindly tried to fix this problem by giving us multiple endings!  In fact, you really can't get the good ending without replaying the game.  Now before you start moaning about the tedium, the game let's you fast forward through dialogue you've already been through so it doesn't feel like such a slog fest.  I do sorely wish though that you could skip the entire scene by just pressing a button once instead of having to hold down a button to fast forward.  Oh well.  The really cool thing is that each ending (even the bad ones) is that they all add something to your knowledge about the story/characters and don't feel like a waste of time.  All I can say is that I appreciate the developer's attempt to add some replay value to this game when it's in a genre that often lacks it.  As for the actual gameplay, all the controls work well enough, and it's just what you'd expect for an adventure game; there's (long) scenes, then there's times where you wander around to explore various rooms, and there's puzzles to solve.  It's pretty standard stuff.  The puzzles themselves aren't too bad, but some of them are kinda tricky, especially if you don't understand math concepts like hexadecimals and magic squares and stuff too well (like me - sigh).  This is a very math-centered game.  Other than that, there's not much to say!Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  Well, this is an interesting game...  As for my expectations, I'm surprised that people gave this game such high scores.  I mean, I've seen tons of professional reviewers giving this game perfect scores when games like Ghost Trick got good, but less awesome, reviews.  If I were to be completely honest, I'd have to say that I enjoyed Ghost Trick a great deal more than this game because the whole experience (from storytelling to gameplay) just felt more polished to me.  That doesn't mean that 999 is a bad game; quite the contrary - it's got a great story and great characterizations.  I've heard that the developers are releasing a sequel to this game on the 3DS.  If they manage to balance out the length of the cutscenes vs. actual gameplay while still maintaining the same story and character standards, then I'm sure it'll turn out fantastic.  Even if they don't improve on anything, I'm still looking forward to playing that game.  I'm sure it'll still be a great experience!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2012"}

The strengths of the franchise regrettably come with the same annoyances of the prior installments - punishing rubber band AI.Rubber band AI is Mario Kart's way of leveling the playing field for novice computer opponents and also applies to other players.  In a nutshell, the game discriminates against skilled players.  It does this by providing more powerful items to players (both human and computer) that are behind in the race.  A first place player is hard pressed to get anything other than fake item boxes, bananas and green shells, whereas the player in last place is far more likely to get POW boxes, lighting bolts, bullet bills and the like.The benefit of rubber band AI is that my friends who've never played the game before can jump in and be competitive.  The downside is that it is maddeningly infuriating to play single player against the computer.  You WILL experience a race where you are in first place for the entirety of the race only to be struck by a blue shell and subsequently paralyzed by repeated red shell bombardments.  One questions the logic behind the blue shell item (an item that automatically takes out whoever is in first place): is it fun playing a game that is so obviously \"race-ist\" against first place (har har - sorry).The game is still fun, but you'd think that after so many iterations of the Mario Kart franchise, Nintendo would wise up and allow some customization of race options - such as toggling on/off items to your liking or setting items to \"true\" random distribution instead of favoring lower placed racers.  This flexibility would allow me to play a multiplayer race based on pure \"skill\" against fellow Mario Kart pros, while retaining the ability to simplify for casual games with novice friends.The lack of options is even more glaring in \"battle\" mode - where you are forced to play red vs. blue two team matches.  And unused multiplayer spots are filled by computer players.  Again, IMO, it's absolutely inexcusable to not include the option to set the total number of players on the field, number of players per team, number of teams, etc.Alas, Nintendo once again has favored simplicity over function - as is a consistent theme for the company.  Much like how I wish the Wii had more robust networking capability, much like Xbox Live, regrettably Nintendo insists on keeping it's console simple, compact, and censored.  I can't even type custom messages to opponents when I play them online!  Give me a headset Nintendo!  Sheesh!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2008"}

Stealth, guns blazin', or you can use a blend. One thing this game does the best than any other stealth game (including 3rd person) is that you can do it quickly and on the fly. It keeps the game fluid and fast paced whereas most stealth games get frustrating with too much mechanics.I wasn't a big fan of the multiplayer thus the 4 stars.

Well Dead Space 2 clears that up, this game is not for the faint at heart, its very gory, very dark, and very disturbing, please Mom's don't buy this for your kids. On the overall game, you really need to play Dead Space, and (unfortunately) Dead Space Ignition, if you want to understand the story behind Isaac, The Marker, and the Sprawl, and trust me the story is very good, and very twisted. The music is very good, and blends in well with the atmosphere, the graphics, and the art design are top notch. The gameplay mechanics are tight, which is good, because this is a game with endless replay value. But I do caution casual gamers to start it on Normal, not on Survivalist mode, thats the one I first started on, and it was brutal, but I got through.

But many of us are disappointed in  this game because...it's a Batman game that SHOULD be better!  It's really sad to see that after Arkham Asylum and the pinnacle that was Arkham City this game come out and almost ruin it for the one shining light in super-hero gaming. It's frustrating, it's slow and tedious and it's just plain not fun.  This game takes place before the 1st two and is supposed to be a 'year one' game. Which is fine, but when playing it, why does it feel like an extension of the last game?  You make your way around Gotham beating up criminals which gets monotonous and trying to deactivate towers so fast travel can be unlocked and it's so sloppily done. Oh yeah, and you are supposed to stop Black Mask and you spend so much time just trying to get through the 1st hour of the game you may forget that this is your main task.  Then to further exasperate matters is that I wound up with 2 defective disks.  The first one locked up prior to even starting and the second one stuttered for awhile before I managed to play at a clip before it did it again at the boss fight.  Which told me that this was a waste.  The small saving grace is that Roger Craig Smith does a good job with the voice acting for Batman but even he can't really save this game from itself.

{"product_name":"B000056KDW","description":"After making a name for himself with horror classics such asThe  Damnation Gamenovel,The Books of Bloodshort-story collection, and  the feature filmsHellraiserandCandyman, Clive Barker has slowly  moved away from the horror genre toward more fantasy-centric work. Barker hasn't  completely forgotten about his first love, however, andClive Barker's  Undying, a first-person action game from Electronic Arts and DreamWorks  Interactive, beautifully captures the type of horrors that populated Barker's  earliest works. And not only is this game genuinely frightening, it's also a lot  of fun to play.Cast against the backdrop of Ireland in the year 1923,Undyingfollows  Patrick Galloway, an investigator of the paranormal. Galloway has been summoned  to Ireland by his old war buddy Jeremiah Covenant to put an end to the strange  occurrences at the Covenant family estate. What Galloway finds is a house of  horrors that is populated with Jeremiah's dead siblings (and other ghastly  creatures), all of whom want to snuff out Jeremiah so they can complete a spell  cast when they were children.Graphically,Undyingis first rate. TheUnreal Tournamentgraphics  engine has been used to great effect and the result is amazing character models  and environments. The haunted mansion is suitably dark, with wispy draperies and  macabre paintings. The estate's grounds are a mix of lush Irish countryside and  crumbling ruins, all set against vivid skies.Pretty pictures aside, the most impressive thing aboutUndyingis its  atmosphere--this game is flat-out scary. Every element of the game, be it the  gothic architecture, eerie story, great weather effects including rain and  lightning, or amazing sound effects, perfectly complement each other. The result  is a gameplay experience that rivals theResident Evilseries in terms of  generating sheer terror in the player.The great atmosphere isn'tUndying's only innovation--it also features a  very cool two-handed attack system. Most action games saddle the player with an  attack system where one hand controls all the weapons and the other hand does  nothing. InUndying, the left hand (and left mouse button) controls the  standard weapons, such as the pistol and shotgun, while the right hand (and  right mouse button) casts spells. This is a great gameplay device and ensures  the action stays at a frantic pace.Of all the spells in the game, the coolest is the Scrye spell. When cast, it  lets the player see and hear past events--some of which are quite  horrific--and  occasionally it shows you how to progress beyond a certain level. This help can  come in the form of highlighting certain objects or unveiling a portal, but  whatever the method it is a very well-designed gameplay element.The only real complaints withUndyinginvolve the long loading times  between levels and the system requirements, but even those aren't enough to  derail this excellent--and terrifying--action game.--Kilmic RobbinsPros:Very, very creepyAmazing sound effectsExcellent graphicsSlick controlsCons:Long loading timesStory is a little convoluted","reviewerName":"Knewace","summary":"Clive Barker's Undying","reviewText":"Clive Barker's Undying is an fps with a fantastic single player gameplay. It is a horror based fps and one of the most scary games i have ever played. Set in 1923 Ireland, you play Patrick Galloway an occult expert, he is asked by his war time buddy Jeremaiah Covent to find out the mystry of the curse which killed his family members and since Jeremaiah saved him some time ago he agrees. Gameplay is very good and has a great replay value. Patrick handles the weapons in his left hand and majic in his right, quite unique but does not affect gameplay, controls are very easy to learn. The level design is great and the art direction is perfect. The mansion look really haunted and like there were people living there one day. Levels are very scary and a lot of fun to play, the atmosphere is great and very creepy. Selection of weapons are very unique but good, best is the scythe a powerfull but close ranged weapon. Patrick knows a lot of majic spells, with the scrye spell he can hear voices and events which happened in the past at his current location and many others. Like when you look at the family picture on the wall with the scrye spell you will see what the charecters have become. Other spells are also great, skull storm fires skulls at enemies, shield protects you from damages, invoke spell brings dead enemies back to life but to help you, a spell makes you fly a short distance. Patrick writes down every event that has happened and scrolls he picked up in his book. Even though the journal entries are big, i would recommend you to read them all and also dont forget to use the scrye spell when the voice calls you, Gamers who play it without doing them will have a different experiance.Undying is built on the unreal tournament engine but OpenGL is not here, only Direct3D and 3dFx are available, Software is here but it is unsupported. I played it on the Direct3D and it runs very smooth, load times though frequent were not long. The graphics are fantastic with lots of beautifull textures and great weather effects, the heavy rainfall and a lovely waterfall in the eternal autumn level look great and one can see the hard work that went into crafting this game. Humans look real and creatures look scary. The sound recording is great and they add up to the creepy atmosphere, it is even better than system shock 2, The sounds of water dropping when i was in the celler of the mansion fooled me that the noise was comming from my bathroom. The voice acting is also first rate and there are also lots of scary and very well done cutsences. Undying is a fantastic action game, i cannot belive the game bombed and the planned sequel was cancelled. Many gamers must have stayed away because it does not have a multiplayer, dont worry about that because it has a really great single player. Any gamer who played it would agree that it is one of the best games they have played. Undying is a must buy if you like fps.Finally i went to the display setting in the advance option menu and set the \"screen flashes\" to False.

B","summary":"Battlefield 3 does so many things right","reviewText":"I have no idea why so many people are crapping on this game with one star reviews.  I have played through the single player campaign and have enjoyed the multiplayer immensely.Single Player:The story beats are well done and I personally didn't mind the quick time events.  They might have been overplayed a bit but when they work well they only add to the immersion.  The level design is well done and the difficulty seems on point for what one might expect from a \"normal\" difficulty setting.I don't want to give to much away but the story involves Russians, missing nukes, and major world locations.  If you've played a call of duty game or a battlefield game you know what to expect.  Fast action, little character development and a lot of gun play.The texture pack download (about 1.5 GB) is necessary, I played the beta and was worried because it looked worse than Battlefield Bad Company 2 (BC2), but once the texture pack was downloaded, ta da, looks sharp and a step previous Battlefield games.  The lighting and dust effects really stand out.  The flashlights and red lasers on guns are a nice touch.Hands down, this game has the best war sounds in any game I have ever played.  Nothing sounds better then this.  Bullets ricocheting off walls, it seems as if every gun has its own sounds and a grenade exploding near sounds completely different if it's far away or in a room etc...everything sounds great.  They have added additional soldier screams when players get shot which add to the chaos.Multiplayer:This is where the meat is.  I have experimented with all classes and every class seems to be well balanced.  All of the unlocks I have received have come in a steady consistent progression.  You unlock different class specific items and your guns unlock additional attachments separately from your class unlocks.  Of course the vehicle gameplay adds a great dynamic to game.  The jets are slow but they have to be and it's extremely fun to fire a rocket a tank and then watch a jet fly down to take out the fleeing soldiers.  That is one interesting thing that sticks out to me in comparison to BC2, the rockets used in the engineering class do a lot less damage then they did in BC2.  It's still fun, just takes more rockets to get the job done this time around.This will be my go to shooter for a long long time.Final Thoughts:Do yourself a favor, if you like FPS's and you're into Battlefield Bad Company games or Call of Duty games, this is a no brainer.  It's worth every penny, pick it up and get out there on the Battlefield!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2011"}

It's like a cross between Onimusha and Prince of Persia.Basically, you are in the times of Athens and Sparta. There are a bunch of monsters you have to fight, which you will probably recognize. There are medusas, sirens, cyclops', minotaurs, etc. There are also gods, such as Ares, Athena, and Zeus. The story revolves around you trying to get your sins from the past wiped clean. You must do this during a war the gods are waging with each other. So right away the story is pretty interesting. They manage to work in different monsters and gods at just the right times to keep you hooked. Right when the game started to get boring, I witnessed Ares for the first time and couldn't imagine what would happen next.The fighting is good. There are basic attacks and strong attacks. As you progress, you can unlock new moves. There's a large enough variety of moves that you won't become bored too easily. There are god powers, which keep the game interesting. The cool thing is, you can do so much while fighting. The right analog stick lets you roll to evade things. This is very clever and one of the best uses of the analog stick I've ever seen. If you wonder about the camera, fear not. It is always in sort of fixed places. You always see what you need to see, and you never have to fiddle with the camera to solve a puzzle. Hoo ray.The reason I compared this game to Onimusha was because the glowing spheres that come out of dead enemies. In this and that game, killing enemies results in different colored spheres. Green restore health, red let you power up, and blue restore magic. In Onimusha you have to hold down \"O\" and be real close to suck orbs up. In this game, it's automatic and they will absorb from far away. This saves you alot of time, and makes killing enemies meaningful. The game reminds me of Prince of Persia because of all the platforming. It is very easy, just like Prince of Persia. The thing that makes this game better is the fighting. Prince of Persia has you doing a lot of cool platforming, but the fighting is stupid. In this game, both the platforming and fighting are good.Lastly, the graphics are great. They aren't mind-blowing, but they are really good. The textures fit well with the game. The landscape doesn't seem to be all squares and circles. What's better is that you can usually see a lot. The camera is always fixed, but you will always be able to see something interesting. I was climbing some vines and I noticed a battle off in the distance. Later I got to witness that battle.The last reviewer said it best. It's not long, but that's only because the creators didn't want to add in a bunch of stupid crap. I'm impressed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2005"}

I have been playing Mario since SMB/Duck hunt was released and this is the first time where the farther I got into the game the more I was underwhelmed.

I have played them all. Every silent hill. Only ones I treasure are Silent Hill, Silent HIll 2, Silent Hill 4 : The Room, and Silent hill: Origins. The others I will never play again for many many reasons, so this way you will understand my review a little better.Ok, first off the game is amazing. I havent finished it yet so I cant say on the ending but the game is self feels like old school silent hill. Clunky combat system is back but is a plus. Will explain that later. If you are a fan of the first few you will be pleased. Go out and buy now, im so excited to see what happens next in every part of the game. Way better than Homecoming was. Here is the rundown-Pros+Creepy set up for the town, you can really search around and check almost everything you want. Some rooms are empty, just like in real life. So you have to search real good. And the set up of the town just looks and feels real.+Nice change up of weapons. Not too much ammo so you dont feel like rambo. Otherwise play Resident Evil. Not too much health either, tho is a pain in the its better for fear.+Nice music, not as good as the guy he replaced but close. Real close.+Strong Characters, you want to know more about each. Creepy characters just like the first few silent hills.+Replay value, side missons you can go back and redo. Option on harder puzzles. Find new things within the town.+New part of town to search, makes it feel like Silent hill one all over with new everything. Like the first time your entering the town again.+homeage to the other games is fun to find.+Clunky Combat system, its a plus because thats all we have known in silent hill. It reminds me of the first and its scarier that way. Your not Arnold from True Lies, your some con from jail who is trying to live!CONS (not much)-Game will freeze for a second between frames sometimes. Not much, and not enough to bug me too much. Only thing that it does I dont like is it reminds you your playing a game. Not real.-WEapons highlight, glow when you get close and the option \"pick up\" comes up. Im not five years old, I dont need you to tell me everything I can pick up. If it looks like a pipe just let me grab it.-Intro Theme (not the actual game but the pause menu) is by Korn, first off even tho I like metal I hate korn and they are so wrong for the game! Maybe Nine Inch Nails? Jesu? Charlie closure? But Not radio friendly KORN!!!!! Lucky enough, I dont have to watch it so I pretend its not apart of the game at all.In a nut shell, I can talk all day just buy it you will be happy. It has its downside like every game out there.

In short, don't even read this review, just PLAY IT and then get \"Ico\" if you don't have it. Ico is one of the best 3rd person puzzle games ever made and the quality of the 3D art on display is beyond belief. When it was released as a demo in late 2001 (a year after the PS2 came out) it made quite an impact on those who played it with its bleached out overexposed Manga cartoon look and the stunning free camera mode which is used by moving the right thumb pad with zooming ability, left everyone flabbergasted. The problem was that the game was in Japanese with subtitles and so distribution was sadly poor in the West with very few shops bothering to stock the game when it came out. It is even hard to track down on the internet. Thus if getting Ico is difficult then sadly most of the PS2 owning world is never going to play one of the best games of all time. Now you maybe wondering, what is all the fuss over an unknown game called \"Shadow of the Colossus\"? The problem with SOTC, the prequel to Ico (don't worry about playing them in order, the games are very different but do contain some references to each other), is that is suffers from the same distribution problems as Ico, and is only getting recognized by word of mouth. Like Ico, SOTC is simply gorgeous for every single of its many moments, from the opening sequence, to riding the photorealistic horse, to the first time you climb onto a Colossus, right the up until the vortex finale. Take any still shot of any section of the game and you can easily hang it as a painting on your wall. Imagine a game that looks totally stunning but is also possibly one of the best adventure games of all time! Not only have Sony Computer Entertainment with designer Fumito Ueda proven that there is still scope for some wholly new gaming concepts, but have launched it into the playing field as the best adventure game the PS has to offer. SOTC could very well be that candidate. Shadow of the Colossus has no villages or mazes with no character interaction, and instead simply serves up sixteen colossi that you must beat in order to resurrect your dead love. You travel barren lands to track down each colossi. You are in trepidation of your next encounter. What will the next colossi be like and how many brain cells will you need to put to good use to figure out the correct plan of attack? You must think your way through each action packed battle as you literally swing from a clump of colossi' mane like a rodeo cowboy. You only have a sword and a bow and arrow. You must use your environment to win. I played this on and off for so long just trying to defeat each Colossus as the days went by. I didn't even know that the Playstation could be this much fun. It is the kind of game that comes along once in a blue moon and just makes your jaw hit the floor every time you boot it up in the DVD-ROM drive. Like I said, SOTC is as if you have a PS4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2006"}

McKenzie","summary":"Payoff?  Or MacGuffin?","reviewText":"One of legendary filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock's techniques was the MacGuffin, in which an object or plot point would receive so much attention, but then suddenly it wasn't important anymore.  Think of the briefcase in \"Pulp Fiction\", or the identity of George Kaplan in \"North By Northwest\".Why in the world do I compare the suspense filmmaker to an artistic, subtle, and unique game like \"Shadow of the Colossus\"?  Because sometimes enduring a seemingly repetitive plot point, or in this case the same fundamental gaming task, is not always worth the big twist.I'm not here to compare this game to \"Ico\" (2001).  The similarities are there, but regardless of whether or not this story has anything to with that game's tale, it has no bearing on why I like this game.STORY---We know only of a horse-rider who is journeying to this forbidden temple with a lifeless woman in his lap.  For reasons we soon discover, Wanda (yep, his name is Wanda) can only resurrect this woman by defeating 16 monstrous stone creatures known as the Colossi (the titular foes).  Why is he doing this?  Is it worth battling 8 hours to find out?  More on that later.GRAPHICS---The environments and landscapes are beautiful.  Even if interaction is minimal, the vast expanse of the land Wanda must travel is a sight to see.  Sand brushes as Wanda gallops through, and shadows are ever-present.  The graphical acheivement of this game is the Colossus creatues.  These stone beasts are monstrous, inventive, intimidating, and spectacular!  Someone should get an award just for conceptualizing these creations.  Wanda and Agro, his horse, look fine, but they aren't anything we haven't seen before.SOUND---There's not much music, but what's here is really good.  The music is actually an interesting technique, because after Wanda defeats each Colossus, this tune that blends success and tragedy plays every time.  It's not redundant, but actually quite haunting because using this same music is not a cop-out...it's toying with the gamer to give him a sense of unease.  I'm not sure if the dialogue that is actually spoken in this game is Japanese, or if it's originally-written for the game.  Either way, I'm not disappointed or blown away by it.  It's just there...But anyway, the sound quality in this game is soft-spoken and gentle, but very effective.GAMEPLAY---Hunting and searching for the 16 Colossi is both boring and exhilerating.  You get a sense that you're in for something big, so riding around with nothing to do but view the landscape doesn't seem so bad.  The battles with the Colossi are breath-taking.  Some of them are pretty straight-forward battles, but there are quite a few brain-teasers.  If you complete the game, you'll have your favorites, and encounter a few that you don't really want to fight ever again.  What's weird about this is that you are given clues to find the next Colossi, find it, kill it, then are transported back to the forbidden temple, and repeat the process but in different points of a vague map.  Sound fun?  To me, I had fun with the quest...but others won't agree.CONTROL---Here's going to be (or has already been)the problem that polarizes - the controls are not very tight.  The camera doesn't always help, because it's semi-automatic.  Wanda moves a little stiffly, and the horse-riding isn't as tight as one might want.  Climbing and platforming work well enough, but could've been a little better.  Now, the last thing you need is a skyscraper-size foe trying to pummel you (or eat, or electricute...whatever) when you can't see or don't feel in control of your bearings.  The game plays fine and works well enough so that's it not a broken mess, but Sony's design choices are understandable, but not executed to perfection.PAYOFF or MACGUFFIN?---I don't want to give away too many details, so I'll be vague enough for the uninitiated, and try to speak to those who've already beaten the game.  The ideas and twists at the end are great, but there's not enough sympathy (or hatred) against anybody to really feel any strong emotional impact.  I liked what I saw, and loved the story that they went for.  I just think the actual plot could've been given more depth.  Here's my only comparison to \"Ico\"---\"Ico\" doesn't tackle any moral values.  You find an angelic princess and escape together in a lovely tale.  \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is obviously going for a morality edge, but doesn't completely fulfill that goal because not enough sympathy to the characters is built.OVERALL---While I enjoyed the game, and still recommend it for its undeniable strengths, you're gonna have to take this game with a grain of salt.  It's a good game, and worth checking out.  But since replay value is fairly minimal, plus since the experience is almost too unique, \"Shadow of the Colossus\" is probably best served as a rental.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2005"}
{"product_name":"B0021TVYCG","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"Really tried to like it but......","reviewText":"Ok, before I get attacked for \"not giving this a chance\", I put about 9 hours into this game.  I know that's not a ton of time to dedicate to an open world RPG, but sometimes you can just tell there are flaws that won't improve as the game progresses.  To start with, right off the bat you'll notice the voice acting and character movements are horrible.  I rarely skip through dialogue sequences early on in games, but this one makes you hit the X just to get through the inane conversations.  Yes, they are that bad.Second.  The battle system is terrible.  Any melee fight winds up being a hack and slash event, there is no strategy or any real blocking mechanism.  Ranged weapons are usless because your enemies know exactly where you are as soon as they are hit once. I shot an enemy from about 50 yards away, and hid behind a rock.  Not only did he respond by running in the exact direction I was hiding, he found me immediately.  Not even a delay where he \"looked around stunned\", just got up and ran right at me.  There is simply no tactical strategy in this game whatsoever.  Why bother leveling up in ranger skills, when every battle becomes a melee slugfest where you just push R2 until your opponent dies.In addition to the poorly constructed battle mechanics, all enemies respond exactly the same way when attacked.  They have varied enemies, such as ostriches, cheeteahs, baboons, etc. etc.  But, every one of them does the exact same thing.  They just run at you and attack and you hit back.  They might as well all be the same exact enemy.  The developers put in a lot of varied opponents to creat the illusion the worlds are huge.  Fighing a rhino feels the same as fighting a skeleton.  Hack and slash, hack and slash.  No blocking, no tactical positioning, no nothing.Third.  The graphics are sub par.  Everything is blurry, and slightly out of focus.  I have no idea why IGN rated these grapics so highly, I have set the bar at Uncharted-esq graphics.  If Drakes scenery is a 10, Two Worlds is about a 5.  And don't tell me that open world games have to sacrifice graphics, just look at GTA or even Oblivion from three years ago.  Both far better.And finally, one of the most annoying features is the lack of freedom.  When you're in a town, you can't do anything except pick up items and have conversations.  If I want to walk up to a guard and kill him, I should be able to.  If the rest of the guards gang up on me, then so be it.  Two Worlds doesn't give you that option.  If you attempt to hack a guard or towns person, nothing happens.  Your sword goes through them and they continue talking as if you're standing there doing nothing.  That is as stupid as RPGs from the nintendo days.  No one reacts to your behavior at all.  In one quest, there is a guard preventing you from getting through a gate.  You could easily kill him and open the gate, but he says no entry and you can't get in without a pass.  Stupid!  If I want to attempt to be a rebel in an RPG and fight my way through, that should be MY option.  Not a predetermined developer option.In closing, I would describe this game as a bad combination of Dragon Age and Oblivion.  Anything you didn't like about those two titles has been combined in a terrible hybrid RPG called Two Worlds.  The only redeeming feature is the weapon upgrade system, so when you find seemingly useless junk, you can actually use it to strengthen your weapons/armor.  The problem is that the controls are clunky and ruin any positive building blocks, so even with a powerful sword you wind up dying because you accidentally hit the \"sheath weapon\" button when you meant to his \"strike\".I was hoping this would be a nice bridge to get me through until the next Oblivion release, but it looks like I will have to just wait for the next Dragon Age instead.  Quite a disappointment.  Most other RPGs are making progress in leaps and bounds, yet Two Worlds appears stuck in some mid-90s limbo of poor design.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}

Follow the Steps....\"","reviewText":"When the original Dead Space came out, it was the new kid on the really, REALLY crowded block of mediocre survival &#34;horror&#34; games that were not even all that &#34;horror-y&#34;. After impressing critics and fans alike for its amazing third person gameplay and being incredibly replayable, Dead Space 2 comes back to reclaim its throne of survival horror. But is it as good as the first one?Dead Space 2 takes everything that was so good from the first game, fixes its few flaws (wonky stomp mechanic, no more!), adds more content, improves the already great graphics, and gets rid of the cheap jump scares and replaces them with truly disturbing scenarios involving Isaac's developing dementia.Speaking of which, the story of Dead Space 2 now takes place several years after the original game on the floating city dubbed &#34;The Sprawl.&#34; Throughout the game, Isaac is haunted by the events of the first while trying to figure out why the government won't leave him alone. His story of survival is a mature, detailed one; something many games that share the title &#34;survival horror&#34; lack.The gameplay of Dead Space 2 is also very, very fun. The controls have been modified to be much friendlier to the player. You can now reload while not aiming your gun, melee enemies quicker, and use your telekinesis module as a weapon in itself for when ammo gets scarce (and on higher difficulties, IT WILL). This makes the overall game much more enjoyable, and it still has the New-Game+ feature, allowing you to play through the game again to find more advanced gear while also improving the gear you already had. This makes the 8-11 hour (varies depending on the difficulty) campaign much, much longer, and much more rewarding when you get the last suit in the game.Dead Space 2 is a massive improvement over the already near perfect first game. Buy this game right away if you have any interest in horror.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00006I02Z","reviewerName":"Matthieu P. Raillard","summary":"So I decided to drink the Kool-Aid...","reviewText":"As one of the 3 people in the universe who didn't much care for the original Half-Life, I was hardly awaiting with baited breath the release of this sequel.  The things I didn't like about the original, namely the clunky and flawed controls, dated graphics even for 1998, outweighed the undeniable genius of the game as a story.  I wasn't ruling out Half Life 2, but I was much more interested and looking forward to Doom 3.Fast forward to the present.  Having just built myself a top-notch gaming PC capable of running both games with ease, I took the plunge, but decided to install and play Doom 3 first.  My initial reaction to that game --awe at the graphics and production value, creepy atmosphere-- was quickly replaced with tedium and boredom as the game played out like a 21st century scavenger hunt (find the key card!  Get lost in the dark!).  When I played Half-Life 2, however, I was BLOWN AWAY.  The graphics are as good as Doom 3, but the big difference is that you can actually see them, because the entire game is not in dark tunnels, but rather takes place over a variety of terrains, ranging from beautiful coastline to wonderfully post-apocalyptic cityscapes.  This game is truly deserving of all of the \"Game of the Year\" awards, and here is why:GRAPHICS: Simply stellar.  The textures are terrific, and the water effects are super, second only to Far Cry.  The character models are very nicely done, and the way their eyes follow you around the room is both creepy and amazing.SOUND: Very, very good.  The sounds and music are very well done, and complement the game's moods quite ably.GAMEPLAY: A gift from heaven.  The game engine is ruled by physics so real, you're going to try picking up every object just to see what happens.  A brick feels and reacts different that a doll, a tire swing responds realistically to a push, and bodies fall convincingly when shot or falling.  The control is simple, smooth and effective, and the weapons are generally balanced.  I wish there had been a better sniping weapon than the crossbow, but hey, that's what mods are for!STORY: Again, stellar.  It's so noticeable when a story grabs you, and when a story is just filler, a pretext for the setting of the game.  In Doom 3, I couldn't care less why I was there.  I certainly wasn't about to read the myriad boring PDA's you find on corpses, and the story is really trite.  Half-Life 2, much like Knights of the Old Republic, makes YOU the star of the game, and gives you little chunks of info, but never overwhelms you with random names that mean nothing to you.  As a result, you internalize the info, and actually come to care about the other characters.  The scripted scenes are always logical and never forced, and they are just plain funny at times.  I can't say enough about the great immersive world of this game.NEGATIVES: Much like everyone, I dislike the \"Steam\" program which basically means that each time you play half life, you need an active internet connection.  It's the company's way of authenticating your software, and while it's logical to be paranoid, (after all, this game's code was famously stolen by a hacker last year) it's a bit much.  That said, most people have internet, so this is somewhat moot.OVERALL: I personally don't care for online games; I find that people often act like children or jerks, and that the few games that are fun to play in multiplayer are shooters like Unreal Tournament of the Battlefield series.  I can't express enthusiastically enough how happy I am to see that a game developer still cares about putting out a polished and amazing single player game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0050SW93S","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"I'm glad the developers stopped making console games...","reviewText":"I know I'm pretty late with this review, but I only just now managed to force myself to finish the game.  I'll get it right out in the open here at the start.  Resistance: Burning Skies is an insult to this otherwise incredible franchise.  Through it's mercifully paltry six-level campaign, it does manage to get a few things right, but there's so much that goes wrong!  If I had to describe the game in one word, this is what I'd say: amateurish.  Nihilistic Software (now called nStigate Games) seems to either have no interest in learning how to make a proper game, or they're still new.  Judging by the fact that this is their sixth game since 2000, I'd say it's the former.  I'm kind of in shock that Sony (and later, Activision) would hand over IP's that are so high-profile to a developer like this whose track record clearly shows they have no idea what they're doing.  Anyway, I digress.  Resistance.Let's start with the good.  This game's best assets are the controls and the musical score.  The PlayStation Vita is the first portable handheld to sport dual analog sticks, and it absolutely rocks.  This game controls like a dream, and truly shows what the Vita is capable of achieving with first-person shooters from a control standpoint.  Even the touch controls are well-implemented...not intrusive, and without that \"tacked on\" feeling.  Since the Vita still lacks the DualShock's L2/R2 buttons, using your weapon's secondary fire is mapped to the touchscreen.  It works extremely well, and it really surprised me.  The dreaded rear touchscreen is barely used (thankfully), being resorted to the sprint controls.  Simply tap the rear touchscreen twice and your character is running.  Simple and easy.  The soundtrack to the game is miles above the rest of it.  Play using headphones and the fully-orchestrated music truly takes on a life of its own.  Kudos to Nihilistic for not skimping here.Now, the bad...let's start with presentation.  Nihilistic can't seem to figure out how to make attractive interfaces.  From the title screen to the menus, everything looks like a pre-rendered background.  Static and unattractive.  Their prior game, PlayStation Move Heroes, had the exact same issue.  It's just lifeless and ugly, and fails to make a good first impression for the game.  Next, the cheap cutscenes.  The first thing you notice is how horribly compressed they are.  They look like YouTube videos being played over a 56K modem.  Do you want subtitles?  Fine...the subtitles are shown in front of a HUGE darker translucent rectangle that covers an unnecessarily large portion of the already-unattractive picture.  Plus they're not cinematic, and more like slideshows.  And then there's one of the many ultimate sins of modern gaming: the cutscenes are unskippable.  Every time you boot up the game, the cutscene has to play in its entirety, and they're not very short.  The same applies to any in-engine cutscenes that happen throughout the level.  If the game decides to do a checkpoint before a scene, then you die before the next checkpoint, you get to hear the entire conversation over again with no option to skip.  This is especially infuriating when you get to the fairly-challenging final boss.  Then, there's the graphics.  The Vita's OLED screen manages to save some of it, but for the most part everything looks bland and rough.  Textures are pretty much missing for most of the game.  The sound effects are weak, sounding more cheap than ever.  Compared to the PS3 games, this is a massive disappointment.Then, there's progression issues.  This is a portable game, yet save points are extremely scarce.  While checkpoints are evenly placed, actual saves are few and far between.  The last 45 minutes of the game have to be done in one sitting.  Thank goodness the Vita allows for suspending gaming sessions and standby.  How it should've been was having each checkpoint serve as a save point like the console games.  The levels are, for the most part, repetitive and bland.  Enemy AI is ridiculously stupid and firefights generally consist of waves of 3 or 4 stupid enemies at once.  You might get multiple waves of them, but each is as uninspiring and unexciting as the next.  Also, the upgrade system is completely not well thought-out either.  To upgrade a weapon, you need grey matter...little grey cubes found throughout the game.  Each weapon has six possible upgrades in two groups of three.  You can assign grey matter to only one upgrade from each group per weapon.  So, with only six weapons, it's not long before you max out each one.  Yet, you keep finding grey matter...the stuff is plentiful!  So after the third level there's really no point in seeking out upgrades, because you can't do any more.  At least the weapons themselves do an admirable job of living up to the console games.  The game actually picks up ONLY during the final level.  This level is actually pretty fantastic, and if the rest of the game were as tense and exhilarating it would be great!Finally, the story.  No effort has been taken to make the player truly care about the protagonist's plight.  You're on a quest to save you wife and daughter from the Chimera.  But along the way you meet a resistance group...some sort of rogue militia...and you help them as well.  The characters are flat and lack any sort of personality, and you don't get a real sense of urgency.What really makes my heart ache with this game is when you compare it to Resistance's previous portable outing...Resistance: Retribution for PSP.  That game, developed by Sony Bend, managed to capture the atmosphere of the series perfectly.  Not only that, on this lesser console, the developers threw tons of enemies at you at once and the entire game was just nonstop adrenaline.  Retribution featured fully-rendered cutscenes, great voice acting, a protagonist you cared about and tons of level variety.  It's just sad that Burning Skies just seems like a gargantuan step backward.So yeah, my recommendation is that you skip this entry entirely.  It's just not a good game, and completely fails as a Resistance game.  But if you have a Vita, Resistance: Retribution is fully playable on it, so I'd definitely recommend that (especially since you can map the camera control to the right stick).  Nihilistic Software went on to make Call of Duty: Black Ops Declassified for the Vita, and that game tanked even harder than this one.  This prompted them to change their name to nStigate Games, with the goal to abandon console games for smaller mobile titles.  That right there should give you a good idea what to expect.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2013"}

A Superhero game that doesn't stink!","reviewText":"Let me begin by noting you don't have to be a fan of comics or superheroes to enjoy this game, but for those of you that are, this is the game you've been waiting for.  While Freedom Force is obviously based on the works of Jack Kirby and to a lesser degree Stan Lee, it manages to capture the feel of the silver age of comics.  It captures the tone, the powers, the corny origins, the melodramatic dialogue, and best of all those flashy costumes in a way that borrows from but pays homage to all those familiar characters we know and love.  What's funny is that it doesn't glaze over some of the stereotypes from the era either....Freedom Force is a squad based tactical RPG, or so it's been called.  In PC game terms, studio's seem to add \"RPG\" to any game that allows you to create characters or update them through experience.  Either way this game is a lot less Fallout or Baldur's Gate, and a lot more Fallout: Tactics and X-Com.  Controlling up to four characters (I would have been a lot happier with five or six) at a time, all with various strengths and weaknesses, you guide your hero's on a variety of missions with specific goals that must be accomplished to move on to the next episode.  You might be required to save structures or people or capture a bad guy, but there is a definite mission that must be accomplished.One of the coolest features of the game is the ability to interact with EVERYTHING on the screen.  Want to pick up a car and toss it at some baddies?  No problem.  Want to pull a light pole out of the ground and use it like a baseball bat?  Simple, and one of my favorite tactics I might add.  On the downside, damage to buildings and civilians can hurt your prestige.  Get trigger happy with grenades or area attacks and buildings will collapse all around you.  On the other hand, walking into a super-villains fortress gives you an open licence to go nuts.  Blow it all up if you want to, and you can.When the mission is over, characters gain experience, adding the subtle RPG element, and when they've gotten enough they are given character points you can use to upgrade powers, buy new powers and generally improve them.  In addition to experience points, the team gets prestige points you can use to add new team-members to your roster.  XP's are usually set, but you can pick up additional PP's by completing secondary missions, beating up bad guys etc.The characters themselves are awesome.  I had a hard time deciding which ones I wanted to use, because of the coolness factor, but tactics usually made the decision for me.  Most of the characters will join your team without using prestige points.  You start with Minute Man, an obvious Homage to Captain America, and from there you come into contact with more and more heroes, most of whom want to join your team, some who have to be coerced with prestige (I advise picking up Man O' War ASAP.  He sounds like Sean Connery and he generally kicks butt.)  The origins are hysterical, and made me laugh out loud with their charming corniness.If you want to really mix things up, you can make up your own character and use prestige points to get them into the game.  You'll also probably want to do this for the multiplayer games anyway.  You can use the skins that are already on the game, or you can make your own.  There are several sights that have thousands of pre-generated skins based on pre-existing heroes from DC, Marvel and other comics.  If you want to make your own, you're going to need to download the mesh editor at the official web site.  You can even make your own powers.I had a blast playing this game.  It's the most fun I've had with a PC game since Baldur's Gate 2 which was probably the best game I've ever played. I loved the characters, the missions were fun and multi-player with custom characters rules.  The only two complaints Ican muster is that the single player is a little too short and I wish the squads were a little bigger.  Hopefully the flexibility of the engine means that there are further expansions and episodes on the way (you hear that Irrational?  Let the saga continue).Cool note to parents: this thing has a \"Teen\" rating, but to me, this thing is a lot less violent than an actual comic book and deserves a lower rating.  No one dies, there's no blood, and the goal is to protect life not destroy it.  For those parents out there concerned about letting their kids participate in first person blood baths should consider getting this game for them instead.  It's good, clean, wholesome promotes family values and the American way.  How can you say anything bad about that?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2002"}

The long and the short of it is: if you enjoyed L4D there's no reason you won't enjoy the sequel too. Consequently, if you didn't like the first installment or found yourself getting bored of the single or multiplayer, then there's probably not much here that will turn that around.Arguably the biggest change is the slew of new weapons that appear in L4D2. If you're a fan of close combat you can now opt for a melee weapon instead of a pistol - offerings in this category pay dutiful homage to the movies and games that inspired L4D and include: a crowbar, cricket bat, samurai sword, and the occasional chainsaw. Most players will stick to the ranged weapons, and this category has been handsomely expanded as well. A magnum has been added to the pistol options while several new assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns and SMGs make their debut it the primary weapons group. Some heavy firepower is also available - grenade launchers and similar ordinance will appear on rare occasions.Other notables :Adrenaline shots can be substituted for pain pills; bottled-boomer-bile can be tossed like pipe-bombs; defibrillator units can be used to revive dead team mates and take up a health-kit slot; Incendiary and explosive ammo rounds offer a temporary boost in firepower; Weapons can be modded with items like laser sights to improve their characteristics.Graphically the game has gotten a face-lift, particularly in the gore and splatter departments. Area specific damage effects have been increased 10 fold, and character motions appear even more realistic. In addition, the game features more detailed environments and weather effects. Strangely enough, the lower body animations have been removed from your own character, so you will no longer see your legs when you look down. I don't know why they opted to leave this out and revert to the \"floating-head\" style - oversight, maybe? Or possibly it interfered with playability?In any case, there's more fast paced zombie carnage to be had here, but even with the new stuff the concept is beginning to get tired. L4D3 will have to reinvent the genre, but for now L4D2 marks another solid entry in the franchise.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2010"}

Young \"Hello\"","summary":"Ok","reviewText":"This is our 3rd PSP already owning two of the older model. This one is definitely lighter. I like the fact it is the color that it is. No more finger prints showing up as easily.One of the pluses is the fact that the screen is much brighter. Looks like the same improvement that the 5.5 Ipod's had.It is great that it is much lighter in weight, but it really does have a cheap feel to it. The memory door is really poorly made. We almost broke it trying to open it not realizing it was so dainty. The UMD door is also has a very cheap feel to it. You do have to be careful not to pull as hard.I have seen no improvement in battery life. About the same or a hair less than the original PSP. Playing a game, I get about an hour and forty-five minutes and then I have to charge.  The load times being faster?  Not at all. My son and I own the same exact game and put them in to compare. The load times were identical (Worms 2).My major gripe is the battery cover. Just a little plastic button to open it and it never really feels like it is closed all of the way. While playing, our hands accidentally push on it and the battery cover comes off while playing.The last annoying item is that when I first turned it on, I went to check for system updates and of course, it said there was one. It comes with 3.6. Well, I wait for the download and what downloaded was 3.3. So Sony obviously needs to fix thier websites. A new product is released and they should of had that annoyance taken care of already.All in all an ok purchase. It is worth the bundle if you happen to like Daxter and Family Guy.  If you like this color, then you don't have a choice right now anyway since it only comes in a bundle.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2007"}

But even if his teams of forced labor managed to build a missile powerful enough to carry an atomic payload, Stalin still faced encirclement by the United States and the Strategic Air Command. He knew that he needed another advantage over the United States, one that would ensure Soviet security and superiority. Then came the chance discovery on the remote island of Katorga-12 off the wild Kamchatka peninsula, of a previously unknown material, Element 99 (E99). E99 became the new source of Stalin's hope: a new energy source of unparalleled power. Unfortunately, the new element also yielded a new kind of contamination risk. But these were acceptable risks to Stalin - anything for the advancement of the Soviet people. Even so, on September 21, 1950, driven to complete the project, and in violation of the safety protocols, a Russian scientist, Viktor Barisov, personally triggered a device powered by E99 that caused a catastrophic event that affected the entire island. What happened next is unclear. However, there are reports that Stalin's final dying order was a handwritten scrawl to quarantine Katorga-12. And so the knowledge of the island remained buried...until 2010, when intelligence reports in the west confirm activity on a remote atoll in the Russian Federation's shadow. The world has no memory of Katorga-12. No concept of what may be on the island off the southeast coast of Russia. It is deemed that the world can't afford another Chernobyl - or worse. America's answer is to scramble a stealth flyby of the area. They need recon - and they need it now.Gameplay and WeaponsAction inSingularityis a mix of combat mission gameplay and puzzle-solving. Combat is against both modern and 50s era Russian forces, as well enemies mutated through exposure to E99. In this players have their choice of conventional weapons including: pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, rocket launchers, etc., as well as as few Sci-Fi weapons very specific to the game. These include the TMD (Time Manipulation Device) and the E99 pistol. The TMD is a gauntlet, which players acquire early in the game that can be integrated with conventional weapons. Its main function though relates it its ability to alter time within a small specific area. The major examples of this are:Reversion- The ability to alter encounters by rewinding the history of an item or entity to the time of your choosing. This can be used to repair broken items, render enemies harmlessly embryonic, etc.Aging- The ability to alter encounters by fast-forwarding the history of objects or entities, rendering the former rusted and worn and the latter decrepit with age or simply dust.Stasis- The ability to freeze time and thus dangerous situations in order to gain an advantage.Impulse- The ability to propel objects frozen in time in a targeted direction.Chronolite- Functionality that allows the player to look back to a time associated with a place, person or object.Players can also utilize the TMD in conjunction with the E99 pistol, a gun that shoots bullets infused with Element 99, to hit targets unreachable due to distance and otherwise indestructible cover. In addition, to the TMD's combat uses, it is also indispensable as a tool for solving the spatial-oriented and other types of puzzles that players will face on the island of Katorga-12.MultiplayerSingularitycontains multiplayer gameplay options, that just as in its single player campaign, integrate conventional combat tactics and weapons with the time manipulation elements.Key FeaturesAn engrossing storyline blending Cold War history and science fiction elements.An arsenal of first-person weapons, including conventional firearms and upgradeable, time altering gadgets.Mission progressing puzzle-solving gameplay.Advanced graphics built on the Unreal 3 game engine.Multiplayer gameplay options.Xbox LIVE support including LIVE Achievements.","reviewerName":"M. J. Sanford","summary":"I really don't know how this rates 4+ stars.","reviewText":"Hiya,I've been looking at this game for a while. I wasn't worried about being an early adopter, as the multiplayer was a dud. I tried it, and only once found enough people playing to get into a game. But I'm getting ahead of myself.SINGULARITY is a military-based first person shooter set in a sci-fi background. There's a time-travely story revolving around an \"incident\". Your character is basically running around to fix things. There are some inventive weapons, as well as the more-common handgun, assault rifle, shotgun, and sniper rifle. The graphics are decent. Visually, it reminds of Bioshock;  the environment is predominantly dark and rusty. Also, similarly, you use your left hand for certain special abilities.These abilities are what make the game more enjoyable, as you can alter time in certain ways, very locally, which makes for some fun kills. The baddies generally fall into two camps: soldiers with a few different weapon load outs, and mutated creatures, humanoid and not, with various abilities and attack styles.Here's what kills the game:No saves/limited checkpoints: There's no option to save anywhere. If you die, you get sent back to your last checkpoint. I reloaded a couple times to try and loot certain areas. Even upon completing the game, you cannot replay any chapters, except your last checkpoint. The one time you can replay is the ending. So, you can play all the endings.Extremely linear game: which seems a little ironic for a time-travel storyline. In any chapter, you're going from point A to point B. Open doors shut behind you, preventing you from back-tracking. There are some very small side trips or rooms to looting options, which are dead ends. You'll walk miles of hallways with endless doors,but the only one that opens in the one that leads to point B. I missed at least one upgrade because I couldn't go back. Also, your special abilities are given at certain chapters, which seems limiting. There are some upgrade options along the way, though.Special Abilities: Your character has this wacky Time Manipulation Device for most of the game. It can affect creatures/soldiers, and objects. But only some objects, and in the context of the game, not very many. Bummer.The Multiplayer: Seems like it might be fun, as you can play as human, or mutated thing with abilities. But no one's playing it, so it's hard to say. But half the achievements (for Xbox, anyhow) are locked in multi, which stinks if you care about 'cheevos.Length: I didn't clock my hours, but I was done with thing in three sittings. Too bloody short.On the plus side, I got it for ten bucks, and I satisfied my curiousity about this game. But, really, don't bother. Save your time and money for better games.Thanks for reading.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2011"}

Bradford \"scottfbradford\"","summary":"Powerful hardware-but at a price.","reviewText":"I've been intrigued by the PSP since it was released last year, but low supply, high price, and lack of games have kept me from biting.  Fast forward to present day and the supply is plentiful, the introduction of the core package has reduced the cost to own, and the game library is growing.  So I took the plunge and am now offering my early impressions.First of all, don't bother with the value pack that costs $50 more than the core.  Why? 1) The 32 MB memory card the value pack comes with is ridiculously small to the point of almost being useless.  2) The value pack adds headphones, which most won't need since you can simply use a set from another portable gadget.  3) The last addition, a soft case, would be nice but you can buy one for about $10.  Get a 1 GB card for about $60 or a 2GB card for about $100 if you even think you might load music, pictures, and video on your PSP.  There is even a 4GB out now, but its pricey at over $200.So how is the PSP as a gaming device?  Pretty darn good.  I've owned a Gameboy, DS Lite, and now the PSP and the PSP offers the best graphics by far.  However, the controls are a bit awkward at times.  For example, holding the PSP and using the left and right triggers is tough.  Also, the D-pad is not the most responsive and using the analog stick is a challenge.  However, the PSP's LCD display is big, bright, and sharp.Battery life is only about 5 hrs, which is similar to the DS Lite at its highest brightness.  But the DS Lite can last as long as 15 or more hrs at lowest brightness.  This could be an issue on long overseas flights in which case you may want to buy an extra battery.I first played SOCOM 3, a third person shooter.  I was frustrated by the lack of a right analog stick found on the PS2 and Xbox consoles, but quickly adapted.  Next up was Street Fighter Alpha, a fighting game and the sole reason I bought a Super Nintendo console back in the 1990's.  The D-pad is not as responsive as I would like, but I still enjoyed the game very much.  I also played Hot Shots Golf and have no complaints (portables are perfect for golf games).If you are looking for primarily a music player, the PSP is probably not for you.  It is a bit big (but not overly heavy) to take jogging or biking, not to mention the risk of scratching the screen.  I have a 60 GB Ipod that is much better for that.  If you want primarily a video player, then I would recommend an Archos AV500.  It has a similar sized widescreen with a 100 GB hard drive and acts like a DVR-much easier to record content to than the PSP.  Also, the UMD disc format that the PSP uses has not fared well for movies-it is too expensive and studio support is drying up.  However, as an overall entertainment device for travel, the PSP can't be beat.  In additon to movie, music, and game support, it also has built in Wifi for Internet connection.  But all this functionality makes the PSP pricey.  If you only want a gaming device, I would strongly consider the DS Lite.  Unfortunately for me, the DS Lite's game library was not as appealing as the PSP's.  The announcement of Ultimate Ghosts and Goblins for the PSP (this September) provided the final push off the fence.  This is a game that single-handedly got me to buy a Sega Genesis and a Gameboy!  So if you have the money and like the games, then now is the time to dive in and get a PSP.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2006"}

I read the reviews, looked at the pictures, ect., and decided it looked pretty cool. I got it. I put it in my PS2, and played it for more than six hours straight, and it was night before I even unwrapped my other PS2 games. It was great! Now, the much, much anticiapated sequel arrives. I rented it yesterday and am very impressed. The anticipation was well lived up to. Even though it's not as amazing to run around and kill people, steal cars, and all that, it's just as fun. My current personal favorite thing is the motorcycles. I drive around for half hours looking for one. Their the most fun things to drive; very fast, easy to control, and it's great to collide into things and get hurled off, even if it does take some health away. Anyway, the setting is in a Flordia-type place in the (yeah, I know you already know) 80's. This time, our hero, Tommy, can actully talk instead of doing this annoying nods and motions. The radio stations are great, as well, just as good as 3's. The music stations all play songs from the 80's. But the only two stations I really listen to is KChat (I liked Chatterbox on the first. KChat's not as good, basically because the host is NO Lazlo) and VRock, which plays songs from Anthrax to Slayer to Ozzy (and even has an 80's Lazlo as the host, which is AWESOME). The commercials are just as sick, twisted, and hilarious. On your weaponry, you have every single firing-weapon and can have different physical weapons, such as your fists, iron knuckles, chainsaws, ninja swords, golf clubs, butcher knives, and more. Also, you can now go into buildings and explore yourself. Some of these places are the mall (which contains the ninja sword somewhere), Bunch of Tools, and more. You can buy places, such as the Malibou Night Club and Washington Street, and get all the profit they make, but it'll cost ya a couple thousand. The only REAL disappointment in this game is no hooker trick. I liked that, too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00149MEVY","reviewerName":"Brian Martin","summary":"A Great Game","reviewText":"Like a couple of others here I was a bit put off woth some of the negative reviews from game mags like IGN etc. It's defintely not a 5 or a 6 game. Out of all the Silent Hills, I enjoyed this one the most. Silent Hill 4 I barely got passed the beginning before I got bored with it, and 2 was decent. I say that because people think that because Double Helix did the game, something was lost in the process. I disagree.The game does start off a little slow. The story is a little light in the beginning, but midway through the game it starts to pick up steam. I would have loved to see a little more character and plot development. Silent Hills before would leave me perplexed at what the heck is going on story wise. I don't really like stories or games that leave it up to me to interpret what's going on.I play games, read books, watch movies for the story a person wants to tell, not for interperting it with my imagination. The story in 5 was straight forward and progressed nicely. At first I thought it would end up ambiguous like the SH before it, but loose ends were tied up and explanations were made. I liked that. I do wish more plot and character development was had. I still don't know what the heck silent hill is after 10 years of playing the games. Is it a place for the dead, is it a cult, it it pergatory? What is it already. I guess that's half the fun of the games is that you don't really know. I would love to finally get some more clues as to what it really is though.  The ending was a little meh, unless you get the \"good ending\", even that was a little short and light on details. Overall though I enjoyed the story.A few complaints I heard of the combat is that it takes away from the tension of the games. Which is true in a sense, your character is much more compotent in combat, but personally I enjoyed it. While the combat system isn't terribly deep, it's fun and relativly engaging. The dodge system is nice and weapons like the axe and knife are fun to hack away monsters with. It could use some refinement though, but to me doesn't take away from what Silent Hill is like some think.The overall presentation is nice. The box art left a lot to be desired, it intially gave the opinion of a cheaply done game. It just doesn't really tie in to the feel of silent hill. There are no CG intros and endings, which I wish developers would do more of. Like I said, the beginning is a little slow and doesn't draw you in as much as the middle, but it does a nice job. Once you get in the game though the presentation is top notch.Audio is great as well. It isn't all ambient beats like before, you'll hear the signature Silent Hill guitars and Akira music in certain spots throughout the game, and it goes with what your character is currently doing on screen. The music is also great as well. Different types throughout and each tune is catchy and has the appropriate feel. I feel like it's the best soundtrack of the series, possibly outdone by Silent Hill 3, but better than the rest.There are some parts throughout the game that really shine. A torture scene and a couple of others that are unique and different and you sort of wish more of those were interspersed throughout. A couple more of these moments, with a little more plot and character development would have made this game really shine. A few more psychological episodes like the torture scene would have been perfect. The music is great and the combat is fun. Overall the monster design is better than in past series. I like the nurses that are from the movie, and a lot of the monsters are just plain creepy. The previous silent hills had little monster variation and this one suffers from some of that as well. A ouple more varieties would have been nice.One point about the \"ease\" that some players feel. I personally enjoyed it. I wouldn't call it easy, but I wouldn't call it difficult. It was nicely balanced to where you don't feel cheated when you die, and you never get stuck on one certain part as to put the game down and never pick it up. This is the first game in awhile that I actually finished, not because of difficulty, but because it was never so hard that I get frustrated and put the game down saying \"I'll finish it later\". Then later never comes and I have another game I'll never finish. Everything was made to keep the flow of the game up. Sure you'll die a couple of times, but instead of being frustrated, your challenged to try again. Mostly if a boss is difficult, it never takes you more than 3 or 4 tries to figure out what needs to be done to kill them. To me that's great because it keep things flowing.  I hate dying ina  game and feeling frustrated at the game and not simply my own skills. A player should never have to feel like a games limitations are what's keeping him from progressing. I feel like Double Helix did a great job in this regard.Overall this was a great game. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it. The story was nice, the combat felt good, and the atmosphere was spot on. There are a couple of flaws here and there, but nothing worthy of a 5 out of 10 review. I think if Double Helix gets to do a sixth one, they can really make it shine if they combine some of the more tense and psychological elements of the past games with the new direction theyve brought this game. Don't listen to the naysayers and try it for yourself. I did and this is a game I've throughly enjoyed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2009"}
{"product_name":"B006ZPAXYW","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"The Occidental Tourist","reviewText":"UPDATE, 12/14/12:  Once purchased, The Secret World is now FREE TO PLAY:  No Subscription Required.Players of Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games are used to a certain amount of consistency.  There are core components to MMOs that span most titles, and The Secret World tries to retain the most important of those things.  In every other area however, the makers of The Secret World aren't afraid to try to innovate and bring something new.The WorldThe idea behind The Secret World is simple:  our modern-day world has a shadow world behind it where the paranormal and the supernatural exist.  Three organizations vie for dominance in this behind-the-scenes reality:  The Dragon, the Illuminati, and the Templar.  Players can choose which faction to support, but it does not substantially change the gameplay overall so much as it changes the flow of individual missions and storylines.As you create your character, you are introduced to the world through a series of cutscenes, each of which features your character in them.  Your character never speaks, others simply talk to you as if you are there to listen.  The game is cutscene-heavy in the beginning to try to get you into the story clearly.  A few core events have to take place for you before you're let loose in the world and once you clear these hurdles, you're free to wander.  Because there are a lot of places to travel to (more open up as you grow your skills, and as Funcom adds new content), you are introduced to a supernatural travel hub that will allow you to hop from one part of the world to another.  This seemingly simple feature is actually the jumping-off point that gives the creators of The Secret World the freedom to create any possible kind of place they can imagine.Character CreationThe Secret World is a place where anything is possible, so character creation is also fairly open to your imagination too.  You can be a master of martial arts, good with guns, or supernaturally adept at spells.  Each category breaks down a bit more:  for example, \"Guns\" can mean \"Assault Rifles\", \"Pistols\", \"Sniping\", etc.  From there you can tweak it a bit further--for instance, my character uses Elemental magic and over time the skills shifted from just Fire and Electricity to more and different versions, plus an Air-based technique or two.When it comes to looks, you don't start off with a wide variety of faces, hair, or clothes.  The plus is that more clothes can be bought and you can always change your costume any time you like, but the downside is that the smaller selection of bodies and faces means you may regularly see other players who look a lot like you.  Just the same, I have seen some really creative characters wandering around, and I suspect many have an interesting story to tell.Bye Bye Levels - Hello Skills and ActionsAs your character grows, you won't see the typical system of \"leveling\".  Instead, you earn Action Points (AP) and Skill Points (SP).  Skill Points are spent to enhance particular sets of skills, such as \"Assault Rifles\", \"Elemental Magic\", etc.  You choose specific sub-sets, such as \"Assault Rifles-->Damage\" and plug points into those categories to make the skill better.  The downside is that some of your Skill Points need to be spent on equipment--being able to equip talismans that boost your skills or stats may require you to have your Talisman Skill at the  right level.  The upside is that as your skills grow, they grow in a direction that you control.Action Points are then used to buy specific things you can do within a skill set (e.g., \"Fireball\", \"Inferno\", etc.).  They climb a skill tree that branches off as it grows into separate tiers.  In other words, after you get all of the skills in the bottom tier, you can now choose one of three tiers above it and travel up that tier's skill ladder.  This allows for a lot more creativity in your skill picking, and while Action Points are represented as a wheel-like interface, the way it works reminds me more of the skill trees in The Matrix Online.Things you buy with Action Points are split into Active, such as \"you have to press a key to throw a fireball,\" and Passive, such as \"you take less damage from melee attacks\" or \"fire-based attacks do an additional 15 points of damage per second for 10 seconds\".  While this micromanagement of your skills may sound complicated it's all fairly well organized:  Action Points are laid out in a wheel and Skill Points are a left-to-right chart of your progress.If it's still too complicated, they've made things even easier for you by letting you select from 'decks' of skills:  pre-arranged basic sets of skills common to a particular character type that will pre-load your character's configuration for you.GameplayAs you move through the world, you will find that actions run on the same kinds of turn-based and timer-led operations that any other MMO does:  one action might take you 4 seconds to do, another takes only 2, and your opponent is doing their thing at the same time.  Where it gets different is a more action-oriented approach to the world:  if you stand still, a monster can run right up to you and hit you.  If you keep dodging out of their way, they won't be able to hit you without a ranged attack of some sort.  Special attacks the enemies aim at you might take a few seconds to achieve.  Their target path (or radius) will light up the area around you highlighting where the incoming attack is going to land.  An inner circle starts to grow to the outer edge of the radius--it represents the time it's taking for the bad guy to wind up the attack.  If you can get outside of the area of effect before the inner circle fills, you've just dodged the attack.  All your actions are in a hotbar at the bottom of the screen and can be launched at the tap of a key.  When you defeat an enemy, they may drop loot that you can collect.Probably the biggest way The Secret World departs from the norm is that it really does try to be story-driven.  A lot of MMOs offer quests that are so generic that most people don't even read the dialogue:  they click through the instructions, sprint off to do the job, then run back to the contact to collect their reward--rinse & repeat.  The Secret World makes its quests more unique:  each really does benefit from you reading the instructions or watching the cutscenes.  If you have to pick up a map and give it to somebody, you'll see the map pop up on your screen, a piece of artwork rendered as if you were holding the real thing in your hands.  Your missions have icons on the right side of the screen that not only let you quickly flip from one mission to another (some can be 'paused', others will be discarded and replaced with the mission you chose), each icon lets you go back to the steps of the mission and look them over again, even popping that map back up on the screen for another look.The storytelling branches out a bit further:  there are 'lore items' everywhere that you can retrieve, and as you pick them up they fill in details of backstory.  Collect them all and you have a nice little bit of reading you can do to add depth to the story.  The game has an integrated browser not because it's too hard to play without looking up a cheat, but because if you get stuck, you might need a quick look at the details to see where you took a mis-step.  The browser is also there for deliberate real-world interaction.  For example, I found an ID card on a body.  A nearby laptop had their user plugged into a command-line-based OS, but in order to login I needed to figure out their password.  Their password hint told me the password was their wife's name.  Taking another look at the ID card, I noticed a company website address.  I opened the ingame browser, went to the company website, and with a bit of digging I came up with the wife's name and voila, I was in.  Some of the quests are impossible without following clues out into the real world, where The Secret World have set up websites, YouTube channels, and other artifacts to broaden the gameplay.  Don't be shy about using the in-game browser.This is where The Secret World demands a lot of the MMO player:  you have to cool down the urge to level-grind to the top.  You need to be willing to slow the pace and enjoy the story.  Reading and paying attention rewards you.  The blessing is that there is rich solid writing behind your adventures.  The curse is that at times the cutscenes are just plain bad.  The worst example: a Texas-style cowboy, camping out in a forest filled with zombies...outside of a New England town.  This fish-out-of-water feels the need to throw in a line about how he's cooked up some baked beans on the fire, just in case the corny accent wasn't enough to make you roll your eyes.  But for every baked-bean-bad cutscene, or halting-dialogue boring one, there are some interesting ones, too:  who are these two strangers you're spying on?  They appear to have a dangerously dysfunctional relationship.  What is going through this guy's mind, as he tells you what it's like to feel his body overrun by Lovecraftian deep-sea horrors, knowing that when he dies he'll be reanimated into a shuffling, gurgling monstrosity?Playing missions with friends is easy:  no matter what server your friends exist on, you can play together wherever you like with a simple \"/meetup\" command.  Some servers are pre-flagged as being Roleplaying servers so people who prefer to talk in character can be in a world that's more like what they're looking for, while non-Roleplayer folk can get together without having to interact with the RPers.  The only awkward part about missioning with groups is that some missions have instanced sections that mean each player completes that section individually, then everyone gets back together after the instanced part (many MMOs do this).Can it Survive?In a time when every MMO except World of Warcraft seems to be closing its doors or converting to a free-to-play scheme, The Secret World still insists on having a paid subscription model.  The promise is that Funcom will earn your money:  they intend to release new content every month and always keep adding to the game.  How long they can sustain that remains to be seen, because right now you are also going to have to forgive bugged missions and the occasional large patch.  However, the graphics and sound quality are excellent, and if Funcom can fix the bugs as they grow the world, there are those who will find The Secret World to be worth the price.  I've uploaded a couple of screenshots here so you can see graphics quality straight off a player's machine.If you like MMOs and are looking for something new, I highly recommend giving The Secret World a try.  You may find just the right balance of the familiar and the new.  If you're new to MMOs, this might be more accessible to you because Funcom really do try to make the environment easier to understand and to navigate.  Just be patient with your progression and enjoy the storylines underneath.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2012"}

Play through a fun STAR WARS GALAXY that combines the endless customization of LEGO with the epic story from all six episodes of STAR WARS.","reviewerName":"R.A. McKenzie","summary":"The Definitive LEGO Star Wars","reviewText":"Quick history for you:LEGO Star Wars was released in spring 2005, and allowed you to play Episodes 1-3.  In other words, the prequel trilogy of movies from 1999-2005.LEGO Star Wars II was released in fall 2006, and let you play Episodes 4-6.  It was subtitled \"The Original Trilogy\", based on the 1977-1983 films.So, now we've got \"LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\" which packs both games into a tight, inexpensive package.I'll make this simple: If you've never played either \"LEGO Star Wars\" videogame, then this Complete Saga is easily the way to go.  Not only do the enhancements make the game better (at least on X-Box 360 and PS3), but here's the other great thing: YOU WON'T LOSE ANYTHING FROM THE ORIGINAL RELEASES.You see, when videogames are repackaged and enhanced, sometimes the new versions remove certain aspects from the old games.  So if you're wondering what, \"What am I not gonna get from this Complete Saga edition?\", here goes:*  Although not a single level has been removed, most levels have a slightly changed obstacle here and there.  For example, in \"LEGO Star Wars\", you might've needed a bomb to open a certain door.  In this Complete Saga, you may need to use a stormtrooper instead.  Not much a difference, if you ask me, because the levels' designs are identical to the first time around.*  In this Complete Saga, all six Episodes and bonuses are accessed from the Mos Eisley Cantina in Tatooine, similar to \"LEGO Star Wars II\".  The original \"LEGO Star Wars\" had the prequel episodes from Dex's Diner on Coruscant.  Quite frankly, I doubt anybody will care about this change, but if you wanna know, there you go.So, that's all you're gonna miss.  You have to deal with a couple secret area strategy changes and a different level select hub.  Hope that's not a deal breaker, because EVERYTHING ELSE is in this Complete Saga.*  Every character is available to unlock and/or purchase.*  All the secrets and bonuses are back.*  The story cutscenes haven't changed at all.*  The same great gameplay and silly annoyances are back.*  Every level from the Episodes is back, with a few being redone or added.*  Now get this - a couple stages from \"LEGO Star Wars\" got revamped for this disc, but the original versions are unlockable.  If you really want the old Podrace level, the old Geonosis battle, or the Episode IV bonus stage... they're back too.I can't emphasize this enough, NOTHING HAS BEEN REMOVED!If you're unfamiliar with this series, in short, you will play through the \"Star Wars\" movies with LEGO characters and worlds.  It's family-friendly, relatively easy to play, and kinda funny too.  I will warn you that Episodes 1-3 are simpler yet tougher, while Episodes 4-6 are more complex but much more fun.  In other words, if you start with Episode 1, the Complete Saga will take a while to get moving.  But if with it, you can easily grab 15-20 hours out of this sucker, more if you try to find all of the hundreds of secrets and bonuses.\"LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga\" is by no means a masterpiece in the history of videogames.  But for [...] bucks, it's a huge piece of easy-to-play entertainment with a revered film series giving it a nostalgic rush.  Whether you're playing solo or with a friend, this is one of the smartest cheapest buys you can add to your PS3 or X-Box 360 library.(Sorry Wii owners, but those motion controls are too clunky for me).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2010"}

Now, onto why this review was made.I bought this TV because it was on sale and seemed like a great deal. But, the speakers were absolutely useless due to their shallow and crackly sounds. The 3D glasses were very uncomfortable, and would leave an indentation on my nose. The TV had to be positioned away from a window due to it having an extremely glossy finish. No remote is included with the TV, but the Blu-Ray media remote for the PS3 helped remedy that issue. But these are not the issues why I returned the TV. It was the fact that it would black out randomly for 2 seconds every now and then.When I started having issues with the sporadic blackouts, I began to do some research. While playing a game, the screen would go black for roughly 2 seconds. Then, it would flicker back on, and this would occur at least once every 10 minutes. Was it the TV, the HDMI cabling, or the PS3? I did some funky settings that forums suggested, tried different HDMI cables, but nothing seemed to stop the screen from blacking out every so often. After having the TV for a week, I decided to return it. Since the purchase of a different TV (I went with a Samsung instead), the issue has subsided. This means that the PS3 and the original HDMI cable (not the one that came with the Sony TV) were not to blame. Some forums say this issue is not uncommon, and it usually is an HDMI issue in some way, whether it be cabling or the actual ports on the TV. In this case, it was the TV.Also, even though the TV can perform at 240hz, the TV ran at 60hz because that is what the current generation of game consoles run at only. I thought there was a way to adjust this on the PS3, but forums clearly state that it cannot be adjusted. They say TVs need to run at least 120hz in order to do the 3D functionality, but the glasses were so uncomfortable, that I had foreseen this feature going to waste. And, 240hz on a 24\" screen is a waste anyway. I've spoken to numerous TV techs about this, and the common agreement is that any TV under 37\" should not need to run anything higher than 60hz unless it is for the 3D functionality.All-in-all, it seemed like a good deal, but like the saying goes, you get what you pay for.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2012"}

So how's it fare compared to his first adventure?  Quite amazing in my opinion.  I have been reading the publication reviews and seen the critical acclaim for this game.  Now I was a little skeptical it would be much better than the original since I believe that game was largely overlooked.  This game really puts everything together that makes the Uncharted series one of the best in gaming.  I want to give those who may be on the fence or have no idea about Uncharted 2 a little taste of what makes this game so great.First off we have our hero and cover star Nathan Drake.  What makes Nathan so great is that many people can relate to his unassuming ways.  Although by some of the things he does he is an action star he still comes off as an ordinary guy.  Back to the series is Nathan's long time friend Sully and also his slight romantic interest Elena.  We also get new characters that are questionable friends of Nathan.  To say the least the dialogue is what sets this game apart.  From the first minute you get into this game you will begin to think you are watching a blockbuster movie.  Although you are now the star.In the first game Nathan was in search of the riches of his ancestor Sir Frances Drake.  Now on his second adventure he is on a quest to find the lost treasures that Marco Polo was in search of.  The game reminds me of National Treasure combined with Indiana Jones.  Although I would tend to think that some of the acting and battle scenes are actually better in this game.  What I love about Uncharted 2 is the blend of cut scenes and action.  Nothing in this game gets overly tedious.  There are no long cut scenes and the action is intense but not overly done.  Then to top it off you get some wonderful puzzles that keep you thinking.The quest will take you from a lush rainforest to a war torn Nepal and then up into the Himalayas.  To say the least the environments are awe inspiring.  The original game brought the PS3 graphics that hadn't been seen and now this game only improves the formula.  Nothing is more beautiful than being up on top of a building in Nepal and viewing the Himalayas.  Forget the vacation.  The environments will put you there.As far as the gameplay is concerned they have only improved what was already great.  The cover system is excellent.  Although sometimes it's a little tiring when your character stays in the cover position during a battle.  The battle scenes are a lot of fun and can be challenging at times.  The game is not about just plowing down all the enemies.  Sometimes you have a dozen enemies firing at you from all different angles.  That is where you need to use strategy.  Even on normal play level you will probably find yourself dying during some intense battles.  Although for those of you who enjoy punishment they have a hard setting and even hardcore.  I do believe most of you will play this game more than once.Uncharted 2 is what sets the PS3 apart.  This is the game that sets the bar.  Naughty Dog has really outdone themselves with an amazing adventure that should have every gamer giving it a try.  There has not been one game that I would have said you must buy a PS3 for.  That is until Uncharted 2.  This game is by far one of the best adventure games not only this generation but ever.  I would easily rate this as one of the five best games I have ever played.  Also if you have not played the original Uncharted you owe it to yourself to play that game also.  They are two of the best PS3 games available.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2009"}

Notable additions among these include, expansive play levels and new powerups and characters, but by far the most important, and in fact game-defining new feature is simultaneous multiplayer.A Franchise First: Simultaneous MultiplayerSince the very firstSuper Mario Bros.game took the world by storm in the late 1980s gamers anxious to get into the action have patiently and impatiently waited their turn as the infamous 'player 2.'

This game feels like Nintendo didn't put much time into development of this game.  Mario Galaxy truly felt like a full fledged Mario game. Basically this is Mario 3, with better graphics, less interesting levels, easier levels, and multiple player.  The control of Mario is sloppy and difficult to use.  Yoshie is only available to use in the very beginning of the game and is never seen again.  The only new aspect of the game is that you can play with 2-4 people at once.  Other then that it is the same old thing.  I am very disappointed in this game and the fact I spent $50 on 6 hours of game play.  I really do not see much replay value in this game as well as it is very linear.  Overall I felt like I was playing the old games, but not as fun.  Maybe Mario Galaxy 2 will be better.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

But this installment is just a disgrace.  I've already sunk a good dozen hours into the game and I have yet to see a single thing that made me pause and wonder. It seems almost unbelievable in a series renowned for its imagination, but sadly it's true. The settings are generic castles and tunnels that have a haphazard, formless design. The enemies are forgettable - cyclops, zombies , mummies, dogs etc. Bosses are a bunch of random knights and something that looks like the first angel from evangelion. I don't know what happened, but this is a far cry from the other worldly beauty and continually inventive enemies of dark souls one. At one point you are even fighting Viking warriors in 18th century pirate ships. After I saw that, I knew I wouldn't  be playing this game again.  There's really no more I care to say about this generic garbage.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2014"}

From fighting demons in the depths of space to liberating france from the germans there are tons of shooters to choose from. Battlefield 3 was one of the most advanced modern shooters that had a strong single player and robust multiplayer modes. Now EA is coming out with the next installment simply called Battlefield 4 but should you be running towards or away from this engagement?In single player you will step into the shoes of Sgt Daniel Recker part of an elite group called \"Tombstone\". The game takes place in 2020 six years after the events of Battlefield 3. Your team is searching for a rogue Chinese general and missions will be taking place all over the world. Tombstone will be traveling to North America, Azerbaijan and China to name a few taking part in elite missions. The frostbite engine makes a triumphant return as the visuals of the game are absolutely stunning. Using the Frostbite 3 engine this will feature destructible elements on the battlefield as players will be able to make their own path. And we are not talking about just blowing holes in walls either. Giant buildings and structures can be levelled and when they fall they kick up dust and smoke which challenges players to adapt and survive.Multiplayer is where Battlefield 4 excels as there are seven multiplayer modes to choose from. From the traditional game modes like Conquest and Domination to some of the newer modes like Defuse. In Defuse each of your squad has only one life and whoever eliminates the squad wins the round. There is also a mode called Obliteration which is similar to the bomb levels in counterstrike. Team deathmatch, Rush and Squad deathmatch are the rest of the multiplayer modes that Battlefield 4 has to offer.One of the newest features of Battlefield 4 is something that hasn't been seen since Battlefield 2142. The commander mode allows one of the players to coordinate with the forces on the ground. You can monitor how your forces are doing on the ground and send assets that can turn the tide of battle. From being able to send in a gunship to coordinating missile strikes against targets the commander is an essential role to winning engagements.If you want to pick up the definitive first person shooter then you need to go out and get this game.

I remember playing through portions of Need for Speed: Most Wanted and enjoyed trying to evade the cops in a semi-open world style game. I bought this game loving Burnout Paradise and expecting great things from a cops vs. racers game.How can you not expect great things? Burnout Paradise played like a dream and looked good. Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit looks even better. The graphical detail of the cars is drool worthy and the scenery is so absolutely gorgeous that it takes your breath away. If this game was a game where you went around driving for fun and looked at the amazing beautiful scenery then it'd be half way to being a successful game. This game just looks phenomenal, the graphics are wonderful.Hot Pursuit doesn't handle nearly as well as Burnout Paradise--the various cars handle differently often either too tight or too loose.  The engine running this game changes up the way the cars feel and how you control them.  I can't put my finger on what's different or why it doesn't feel right, but they're not as easy to control as burnout paradise. There's no adjustment on controls sensitivity that I could find, and that hurt my overall rating of this title.I've read some people complaining about the music. You can play your own playlists from your own music collection on your PS3, so if you don't like the music simply put on some music from your own collection.It should be noted that I don't have any online friends, so I was unable to benefit from the autolog and competitive online friends features that seem to drive Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit.  I'm sure that hurt my opinion of the game, but I'm not a huge online multiplayer-more of a single player person.But my biggest complaint with this game is that is simply lacks in that cops and street racers feel to it. Ok, don't get me wrong, there are cops and racers in this game and that's what this game advertises to be all about.  But nearly half the events are a sort of time trial whether you're a racer or a police officer. Even when you're a racer you don't always run into the police cars during races. When you race a time trial as a cop even if you bump even the slightest part of the wall the game penalizes you. If you don't manage to find the right short cuts and never crash into anything, you'll never have a chance at even a silver on these time trial events.Even when you do run into opposition, it often feels lame, the Police barricades have a huge hole in the middle of them, the spike strips (which seems effective in concept) are hard to release properly but can be difficult to miss when you're the victim of one.  The other weapons are ok, but not great and not exciting.These various things add up to a rather disappointing need for speed game unless you're looking for another predictable albeit beautiful arcade racer with cop pursuit elements tossed in an over-the-top fun fashion.  But be prepared to slug through so many time trials that you will want to go back to Burnout Paradise.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2011"}

Characters are hard to control, you lose visibility on an already small screen and on some phones it can be easy to accidentally touch the wrong area of the screen causing it back out of the game. Recently it has become more popular to hook up Bluetooth (or USB) controllers to smartphones, but outside of emulators, support for controllers has been anemic. Power A is trying to change all of this and overall they are doing a good job - especially with the new Moga Pro controller.I own both Moga controllers, and honestly the original one pretty much stinks. It operates by using standard AAA batteries, it's awkward to hold which causing cramping in my hand, the analog sticks are terrible, also the buttons are stiff and quite loud. The new Moga Pro improves on the original design in pretty much every way. The Moga Pro is very similar to an XBOX 360 controller, including nice analog sticks which also function as buttons and a chargeable battery. The Pro is also bundled with a simple stand, which can be used to prop up your device (especially handy for tablets). The Moga controller is designed to work with Android devices, so unfortunately there is no iOS support.Although this controller is vastly superior to the original, it's not without a few flaws. First, even though this thing carries a hefty $50 price tag, it doesn't quite feel like a $50 controller, rather it feels very similar to something like an inexpensive Mad Catz XBOX 360 controller. The shoulder buttons feel a bit loose, the analog sticks are nice and springy, but it takes a bit of travel before they register, the analog buttons don't feel right - it just doesn't have that nice solid feel of a true Sixaxis or 360 controller, but overall it's not too bad. Many people find the rubberized grips to be comfortable, but I'm not one of them, I prefer a smoother and less rigid feel. I really wish the phone clip was adjustable. When I'm sitting in a chair it's fine, but when I'm laying down my phone sits too far forward, making it a little uncomfortable to hold for optimal viewing.You can use this controller with both Moga supported games (through their Pivot app) and emulators (though there is no official support for this). Search for \"Moga Universal Driver\" on the Play Store if you want to use the Moga with emulators. Pivot is pretty solid, but game selection is pretty sparse at the moment. Two free games were included, Pac-Man and N.O.V.A. 3. Pac-Man runs flawlessly, but N.O.V.A. 3 freezes, skips and hangs for me, which is odd considering I use a fairly powerful phone (Nexus 4). I did purchase GTA Vice City, which runs beautifully.This controller is a big improvement over the original, but the price is a bit high for what it is and there are still some improvements to be made. Using a controller like this completely changes how games feel on smartphones and tablets, essentially turning them into real portable gaming devices.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-10-2013"}

Why? Because the graphics are absolutely breathtaking! The camera angles are a perfect match to the Playstation 2 counterparts ofGod of WarandGod of War 2.In a nutshell, you get to follow along with Kratos in his forced servitude to the Olympian Gods.There are a lot of combat moves, most of which are transfers from the other God of War games...but had to be changed with the lack of a second analog stick. Surprisingly, after a few hours of playing, you won't even notice because you adapt to the gameplay quickly. There are new weapons to power up, but the good ol' Blades of Chaos are right where they belong, in Kratos' hot little hands.The boss battles are excellent. However, some of them will take a little intuition to figure out exactly how to defeat them, but hey, that's what God of War is all about...try, try again while slicing and dicing!As far as the puzzle solving goes, some are definitely easier than others. Anyone familiar with the first 2 God of War games orResident Evilshould be able to figure out most of the puzzles without too much difficulty.My only gripe about the game: As other reviewers have mentioned, it takes about 7 to 8 hours to solve it, and the PSP battery will not last anywhere near that long. But even if you run out of juice, you can plug the PSP in to recharge, and you'll pick up right where the game left off!This is one of the best features of the PSP, being able to turn the unit off and pick up the gameplay when we're ready to.With the unlockable content, advanced gameplay and extra costumes, God of War: Chains of Olympus is a MUST HAVE for the PSP.Eat well, Spartan...FOR TONIGHT WE DINE IN HELL!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2008"}

First off this game started off not too bad, till I got to the second stage called \"thank heavens\"  Yeah right!!  When you \"take cover\" you still get hit 40 percent of the time which is very annoying and you just end up dying so fast.  And you better hope that you don't die almost finishing a section, because you'll be starting all over to the first glitch of the section.  The \"Machines\" got stuck in the wall in one point so many times, that I was about to break the game in two.  It's not like you can just go on without killing the machine in the wall, because you will be leaving the fight zone and die anyway.  This game had so much potential if it wasn't for the glitches!  If the glitches wasn't there the game would be a 7 at least in my opinion.  So in short it's worth a rent, or a cheap price, but only if you can get past some major glitches. OH yeah, and when you die, you just can't start over, but have to wait to load for like 2 min.  And the sound makes some crackling noise too. UPDATE!!!  I Just finished the game on HARD, and you get all the trophies!  Even tho i did hate the game so much at times, I kept playing it over and over.  Because well, it was actually fun.  It reminded me of being a kid again, trying to stay calm, because it's just a game.  I hate to admit it, but I did like the game, and kinda wanna play it again,, but I'm not.

Within these areas, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Hollywood, Mulholland Drive and Downtown LA, players are free to engage in mission play driving them to attain and customize a wide range of authentic world-class street racing vehicles, or to simply explore the city, taking on all comers in a variety of race types as they wish.

From making sure your car is dripping in candy paint, to adding unique body kits and jaw dropping extras, the garage offers practically limitless possibilities to personalize your vehicle with aftermarket accessories and customizable options.Interior- Don't embarrass yourself by pulling up with an outrageously kitted-up car that has a 'me-too' factory interior.

The cars look great, with realistic reflections.- Races are fast paced and fun. There are a good variety in the type of races, from drag runs to point-2-point to circuit races.- Car customization is just right. There are enough upgrades, both performance and visual, to spend hours pimping your ride. I love the interior customization, all the way down to trim/fabric colors, lighting, etc. Its really impressive that they modeled the original stock interior for all these cars!The Bad:- Maybe I'm in the minority, but I hate having to drive around to find races. This isn't GTA, I just want to race. It is a real pain having to track down the race you want, flash your brights, etc.  Sure it may seem more realistic, but again this isn't GTA.- The pedestrians are idiots and don't add anything to the gameplay.- Music is so-so- Car selection could be better.- Car physics are completely unrealistic and get quite frustrating after a while.- Online play is fun, but there is never a level playing field. You race with your POS starter car while the other guys have Aston Martins... real fair.The Verdict:If you must have a racing game to tie you over until the next Gran Turismo is released, this will do. Just don't expect much replay value.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004P7VGF2","description":"As Vincent, a man recently succumbed to the irresistible beauty of the game's titular diversion, players find themselves swept into a treacherous love triangle. Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Ow, ow OW!!","reviewText":"Catherine is unique, I'll give it that. But although it's slick it's one of the most frustrating games I have ever played. From the creators of Persona and Digital Devil Saga, we have what feels like a dating sim game crossed with a platform puzzle game. You play as Vincent, a guy having a personal crisis about committing fully to a relationship with his girlfriend. At the same time he is suffering bizarre nightmares about climbing never ending staircases, and then waking up with a naked mystery blonde in his bed!The gameplay of Catherine is very, very simple. During the day you play Vincent in a bar, drinking with his friends. The bar is the only playable area of the game (apart from the nightmares) and it's only one room, with conversation options that pop up with people as you walk about. You never play as Vincent at any other time of day. When you decide you've had enough of the bar, you can go home. Once you decide to leave, the other half of the gameplay kicks in...Vincent goes home to sleep and the nightmares begin. In these dreams Vincent has but a single task: to climb an immense staircase made of square blocks. Well, it's not really a staircase because the puzzle is that the blocks can be pulled and pushed and you have to work out how to make an initially unscaleable surface or pile of blocks climbable, so that you can reach the top and end the nightmare.So why do I think this game is painful? Because these dream stages are so freakin' difficult! I ended up screaming, wailing and jumping out of my chair far more often than I care to remember. Ok that's an overstatement, but be warned - if you like brain teasers you'll be delirious, but if that's not your forte, \"Catherine\" can be almost unbearably challenging. The reason it's so hard is that the block puzzles require you to think predictively, logically, and fast. That last one is the killer. There's no luxury of contemplation, because in the dream, you must climb steadily and quickly as the bottom rows of the staircase fall away beneath you at a constant rate and if you're too slow you fall off with them and thats Game Over. Well you get retries, but these are NOT unlimited, and the main menu is not what you want to keep seeing. So things start off simple, but very soon the puzzles become quite tricky, and then they become more challenging, and then they become maddeningly difficult. As they get worse, the game designers throw more evil at you in the form of trick blocks that crack and explode, make you slide off the edge, or kill you with sudden spikes. And every few levels there is a boss, in the form of a giant ..creature that attacks you as you climb and rips away blocks as you scrabble to get higher. As a result I can tell you, that the end of some stages will be a blessed relief, but for me it was not a sense of achievement I felt, but relief at knowing I would never have to go through it again.I should of course praise the game designers for having successfully designed such a devilishly difficult game, but, well maybe people who play for distraction and entertainment don't need their challenges to be quite this...punishing.So in short, you have to like the block puzzles because that really is the entire game. Outside of this, the \"plot\" part of the game (Vincent's real life) is as weak as dishwater. Vincent is a loser with no charm or ambition. As his girlfriend Katherine berates him about not being serious he sweats and fidgets like a spineless worm, even going into full scale meltdown when she tells him she wants to start a family. It's actually quite pathetic to watch. Equally loopy are Vincents encounters with the mysterious blonde babe Catherine, who he can't be man enough to dump even though there's obviousy something a bit psycho about her. The whole plot revolves around helping Vincent come to his senses and make the right decision but he's so dumb I really didn't care about him. Some of this is due to the really terrible script, in which you hear the kind of dialogue they only seem to write for video games, along the lines of: \"Vincent, you've been acting really weird lately\", \"Vincent what are you talking about? I don't understand you?\" and the classic \"Won't someone just explain to me exactly what is going on?\" All of which happens in the bar and the lines of dialogue are little more than cliches tossed about to fill enough screentime inbetween the nightmare stages.The design of the game is drawn anime style, totally flat (and actually quite poorly drawn) in the cut scenes, quite nicely cel-shaded in the bar, and full blown 3D in the nightmares. The best looking part of the game is the nightmares by a long shot, although they always look pretty similar (wall of blocks, always from the same angle), but the bosses are great, really fun to watch..if you can appreciate this while desperately trying to climb away from them!So my bottom line is, there were times when I absolutely HATED playing this game. It's quite hard to recommend, you really need a masochistic streak to keep coming back to it and trying to solve the puzzle stages, but there are sure to be a few people that eat it up. The final few levels are insane, although I have a tip for you, in that things peak in difficulty at about 75% of the way through the game, and then actually feel easier as the last stages are more about speed and dodging attacks than solving seemingly impossible climbs. But it IS difficult, and when I finally finished it (I admit a couple of tricky moments meant I had no choice but to turn to the internet for clues, but the final chapter was all my own doing), I thought to myself: \"Thank God that is finally over!!\"Is that the kind of feeling you want to have as you watch the closing credits of any game?

When I got this game and started playing it, I was pretty disillusioned, to say the least.There are cutscenes and mini-movies galore. The voiceacting isn't bad, but like any sort of \"rebel\" being made by a family friendly company, ole Samus sounds pretty cheesy at points. So, when you see her give her commanding officer a thumbs down, just use your imagination and pretend she flipped him off. It'll definitely enhance your experience!The controls work pretty well. What you do is toggle between playing your Wii Remote like a nes controller and point it at the screen when you want to shoot missiles. I rather like this feature, and I hail it here as a fine use of motion controls.A couple of the boss fights in this game are hard. Really hard, even. Some of Nintendo's other franchises *cough*Zelda*cough* would do well to take notes. For all the lameness of the nonstop cutscene madness and linear gameplay, those bosses almost make me want to play the game again to see if I do better.So, while it's not like the Metroid games I played as a kid, it could certainly be a lot worse.

{"product_name":"B004S5TDL0","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Perspective of 1 guitar player...and his not-so-musical friends","reviewText":"A person could easily review this disc as either a learning tutorial or a video game. I will attempt to do both. If you're just looking for fun, then immediately look elsewhere. If you aren't interested in learning how to play the guitar, then this isn't your game. But the rewards for those with patience enough to keep at this are immense.I play a lot of guitar. My friends who've been around while I experience this game are not. And that has really been helpful in ascertaining how this game strokes different folks. So let's give you an idea of what's immediately in store with this game/practice tool.The game will begin by telling you how to put the guitar on and how to hold a pick. Next it's going to walk you through tuning, which it actually does a good job of simplifying for someone who has never touched a guitar before. After this, there will be a soundcheck, which simply has you strumming the guitar to make as much noise as is possible. I like this too for new players, because it gets them comfortable with not treating the guitar like a newborn baby. And after this the game starts you out in its main game menu, from which you will eventually be able to play venues, single songs, mini games, or even select the amplifier to play the guitar any way you please and make your own effects. The menus can take a little getting used to, but are pretty similar to what you find in most music games out there.Now, your first indication that this is not going to be another Guitar Hero experience (I'm sure real guitar players had already warned you the real deal was much harder) is the fact that you're still using the PS3 remote to navigate. There's no using the guitar itself to move around within the game. And when you begin to play your first song in the game, the differences become clear rather quickly. You'll still have a highway with notes coming at you, and every indication of where you're supposed to play. But that doesn't mean this will be easy to understand. If you can imagine a guitar hero controller with over 20 buttons instead of just 4, and 6 different rows of them with 6 different strum bars, then you'll have an idea of what the game will be introducing you to.It's pretty clear that the designers tried to create this game for people who are already used to using the Rock Band/Guitar Hero highway peripherals. While it was probably a good idea in theory, it doesn't translate all that well, because you'll always have to look at the actual guitar to know where you are. There's no indicator at the bottom of the screen to show you where you are on the neck. When you pluck the wrong note however, it will tell you how you need to move to get it right; whether up a string or down a fret. Spatial awareness and string color recognition quickly become difficult to take in, often frustrating newcomers to the point of giving up altogether. And, speaking as someone who is used to simple tablature (as opposed to a colored, moving fretboard), the game's approach to play may present a steep challenge for experienced players as well. Old dog, new tricks, and all that jazz. What I do like about the playing mechanic though is its emphasis on anchor points. In other guitar games, you'll have your four fingers in the same place at all times. Here they will be moving around pretty regularly. So the game has accounted for this by highlighting four frets on the numbered highway to try and show you where the fingers you should be playing with ought to be at any given time. The dizzying movement of the highway in this regard again takes getting used to, but the highlighted anchor will help less experienced players. I feel the game would have been much better for any kind of player if it had simply stuck with something less flashy, like the Guitar Pro approach to guitar tablature.The approach to difficulty here is both a pro and a con. The better you do, the more challenge the game will give you, until you've gone from strumming one single note here and there to playing the song in its full glory. This appears to work the other way around as well; so if you're doing terrible, the game will let up on the difficulty. I could find no means of resetting it altogether though. This meant that my friends could not play on my save file and expect to do much. I had to switch to another user on the PS3, and let them all play on that save. Time consuming and something the designers could have easily corrected. And I've seen people immensely frustrated with securing that sense of accomplishment in learning a song phrase just to have the game immediately up the difficulty and throw them into very unfamiliar territory; no accompanying explanation to be found.One thing about the game's design that I absolutely loved was its friendliness to lefties. And I do mean extreme friendliness. I am left-handed, but I learned to play on my right-handed friends' guitars. This means that I never flipped the strings, and ended up being more comfortable playing upside down. One look at the game's layout had me worried that I'd be unable to play this at all (would be like trying to play lefty for a righty on Guitar Hero). Fortunately the game allowed me to invert the strings AND switch to left-handedness. A big plus for those precious few who play like I do.Slowly, the game introduces you to new playing techniques and skill-building mini-games. These are playable outside of the game's setlist, and provide the majority of fun for non-guitar players. These things do precisely what they're intended to, and they're damn good at strengthening anyone's ability to play or learn. As you get better at what the game gives you, you'll earn rewards such as new quitars and effects, for use with the amplifier menu option. This essentially turns your TV into an amplifier, and the game slowly becomes a customizable effects pedal. This is one of the highlights; especially considering the low entry cost by way of comparison to buying these things just to play guitar away from the television. And the fact that it gives you different guitars means that you'll likely get a feel for what your next guitar purchase is going to be! I cannot say enough good things about what the disc does for players outside of simply playing the songs.While this game will eventually teach anyone most everything you could learn about playing a guitar, its approach and peripherals are not what I'd call user friendly. This may simply be an unavoidable consequence of trying to appeal to any level of player; in the end, you do them all some sort of disservice. The load times are slow, the menus are off-putting, and the highway layout is not easy to keep up with. But this game WILL teach you something you didn't already know about playing guitar. And there is a fast-building library of downloadable songs in the making. Considering that this disc actually teaches you how to play the songs as well, I would say the value of Rocksmith as a learning tool outweighs what it lacks in the arena of fun for the average video gamer. I thought very seriously about giving this title 4 stars instead of 3. After all, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't using the disc for many different purposes. But when I view this from all perspectives (as my personal life has allowed me to do), I have seen this disc both draw newcomers in AND turn otherwise interested people away from the instrument with its steep and less-than-greatly explained learning curve. There are better approaches to teaching than the way the game begins its lessons, such as teaching some simple chords before throwing you into plucking individual notes on individual strings; so says my experience at least. And the game's highway build, while functional, can quickly overwhelm even experienced players like myself.Is the game worth your money if you're even slightly interested in quitar? Oh hell yes! Will it teach the instrument to those who stick with it? You bet your ass it will. But I would take a few introductory guitar lessons before taking Rocksmith on. Because this game doesn't shine when it comes to introducing people to the utmost basics of guitar, or when it comes to offering the level of easily obtained fun other video games offer up. What this game does extremely well though is strengthening overall guitar skill (mostly with the mini-games), teaching you to play full songs (slowly, but surely), and essentially making an amplifier/effects cabinet out of your television. The disc presents both extreme benefits and extreme drawbacks. I hope that more games like this end up being made. And, although I've only rated this at 3 stars, I hope that every person interested in learning guitar dips into their patience reserves, purchases this title, and eventually appreciates what the creators of this game have done for the musical world at large.

I really really wish it was more like Bioshock where you have a weapon in one hand and a power in another, or just let me pick what goes into each hand... not my left click is my instant kill button and my right click is everything else and I'm literally rebinding it constantly (for example sometimes you want to stop time, blink (teleport) and then lets say... possess an animal? Yeah that's opening up the radial menu 3 times).The story didn't stick with me.  I beat the game today and when it ended I didn't... care. And that's a pity because it could have been a beautiful experience but instead it's a lot like the Penny-Arcade comic about the game... a whole lot of stuff, people like all the stuff, but none of it is very well developed or interesting.  The only characters I cared about was the boat man, Emily and the one in your inventory (Trying not to spoil things). Even the Outsider stuff came off as silly to me and I usually like that stuff.And finally the content. I would say the game's length but that isn't fair.  When Bioshock came out it was heavily criticized for being shorter than some shooters and I still loved it and consider it a 5/5, but this game... Is probably the same length as Bioshock but just felt more empty. Every area has 3-4 runes and 3-4 shards. 1-2 optional things you can do (usually the things you do to beat the mission without killing the enemy)... and that's it.  No real reason for extra exploration.  As long as you get all the runes you witness all the extra scenes with a certain character so there is no extra reason to veer off and look for stuff.  Even Money doesn't matter much, I wasn't even trying but I bought every upgrade for everything well before the games end.The game might be worth a second playthrough for some people, ya know one where you kill everyone, but I imagine 1. that playthrough would be shorter since you'd be avoiding optional objectives and you wouldn't be worrying about sneaking as much, and 2. it wouldn't really feel any different. The game advertises tons of ways to do everything... It really doesn't feel that way in context.  You'll always get to your target, and however you got there won't matter once you're there.But I still gave it a 4/5 because it didn't have many problems.  And for people who never played Thief it may be a fascinating experience since no modern game has tackled stealth like this game has (god I wish it had a darkness meter like Thief had).I personally don't find the game worth 60 bucks by any reason, when it's half that price maybe look into it but you can get a whole lot more bang for your buck with other games out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}
