Nicholson","summary":"Timeshift...an excellent FPS that with some improvements could have contended for 'Game of the Year' honors","reviewText":"This is an interesting FPS that allows you to use 'time' as one of your weapons  in defeating the enemy; time can be slowed, stopped or even reversed. In fact, you won't get very far without using your one of your 3 'time' options to either defeat the enemy, avoid them or solve puzzles.Some brief comments on the good and not so good...The Pros:1.)Smooth flowing graphics, great special effects (ambient lighting, smoke, dust etc.) and good audio.2.)And to show off the graphics there are some stunning visuals once you get out of the urban area and into the country.3.)A large selection of weapons (although you can only carry 3 at anyone time) that have a primary and a secondary firing option. You have, for instance, your standard pistol, automatic carbine and shotgun but you will also come across a guidable rocket launcher, a sniper rifle, an energy gun, an incendiary pellet gun and an extremely powerful crossbow.4.)You have the ability to operate turret guns (both on the ground and on flying Zeppelins) and drive vehicles. Also, you can use 'time' when operating these units.5.)Easy, anytime save/load with F5/F9 respectively, as well as game generated checkpoint saves.6.)But the best (and most fun) feature of this game is the ability to alter time; however, the amount of 'time' you have to use is extremely limited, so using this asset wisely does require some thinking. Initially using 'time' was a huge advantage (especially against one or two enemy), but it soon became an absolute necessity as you proceed into some difficult combat situations (against larger, spread out groups) and also for some puzzles. There were areas that I had to 'inch' my way along (using frequent saves) to get through.7.)I felt the game scenarios and challenges improved as the game progressed.The Cons:1.)Fairly narrow path to follow; very little area in which to 'roam' around or explore. (not unusual for most FPSs I guess)2.)Limited replay value.3.)About the only irritating thing about this game was the non-stop, repetitive propaganda dialogue, spewing from the loud speakers that were everywhere in the first couple segments and the finale.4.)The game has fairly high hardware and video card requirements* (if you want to see it played as the developers intended).5.)On 'Normal' game difficulty I felt there were 2 things that took away from the overall challenge of the game, these were:a.)one weapon (crossbow) was a little too much of an advantage against the majority of the army-type personnel (it gives you the ability to easily pick off individual men from great distances).b.) Ammo was too readily available. There was no need to conserve ammo, no need to be concerned about running low on 'bullets'; ammo seemed to be everywhere.Conclusions:I really liked this game...A game that uses 'time' manipulation to add a definite twist to this otherwise excellent FPS. If the game developers had not given the gamer such an omnipotent weapon (crossbow) with an overabundance of ammo, this game would have been extremely challenging to play and finish. But for this drawback, this game may have been in the running for single player 'Game of the Year' honors**. Nonetheless, an impressive and graphically beautiful game...4-4 1/2 Stars.*System Specs...Played on Vista with an Intel Dual core processor, ASUS P5K motherboard, 2 GB RAM and Nvidia 8800 GTS video card**other nominees (IMO) for single player, 'Game of the Year' would be 'Bioshock', 'Half-Life 2 episode 2', and 'Call of Duty 4', closely followed by 'STALKER-Chernobyl', with 'Crysis' a more distant, second tier contender.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2007"}

The fantastic thing about the game is the graphics, gameplay and simply the AI. The game for the most part is taken as stealth (except for a couple missions which are just as fun) and the AI has to be advanced otherwise you would just be playing another Medal Gear Solid (Huh what was that noise!!). The fact is the AI in this game is beyond enhanced and sometimes is unbarable if put on difficult settings. The brilliant idea of stealth plays in with shadows which is perfectly displayed through this game. Hiding under dark and heavy shadows allows enemies not to see you and giving you the upper hand when killing them. If you cry easily don't come anywhere near this game just go running to your mom.

Rhodes","summary":"The DS launch game to get!","reviewText":"In 1996 Super Mario 64 came out on launch with the Nintendo 64 and completely changed the way we look at games! Since then, Super Mario 64 has been regarded as one of the greatest games ever made! Now, the classic N64 title has gotten a makeover and you can carry with you everywhere you go.Nintendo has been notorious in re-releasing Mario games.  Look at the Super Mario Advance Series.  But Super Mario 64 DS is like a special edition DVD release!  There's new features that make it more than just a simple \"port\".Super Mario 64 DS includes new features.  The game still opens up with Princess Toadstool inviting Mario in (and still getting kidnapped).  This time though, Mario has brough Luigi and Wario along!  The three split up and go into the castle.Yoshi then awakens on the top of the castle (where you found him in the original) and notices its eerily quiet and sets out to find the three characters.  You begin the game as Yoshi who doesn't really attack, but can make enemies into eggs and throw them.If you remember the original Super Mario 64, you'll also remember that to begin a course requires you to jump into different paintings.  Each time you jump into a painting you'll be able to select an objective.As you progress through the game you'll note some courses are changed.  Also, there are 30 more stars in this version (bringing the total to 150) to collect.Each character has his own attribute that makes him worthwhile.  Luigi can jump really high, Yoshi makes eggs, Wario is incredibly powerful and Mario is the only character that can do the triangle jump off the walls.  You can change characters at anytime when you're in a course and you'll have to sometimes. You may need Wario to smash a block, or Mario to jump up a wall.Some powerstars are also more troublesome to get than others.  Luckily the DS has a map on one screen.  This map shows you where powerstars are, making some easier to find than others.  Other powerstars that are shown on the map but hidden may actually require memory of the N64 version.The control scheme is where the problem is however.  If the DS had an analog joystick it would've been easier.  I suffered from falling off a cliff more than not simply because the D-Pad isn't as responsive as the joystick.The other problem with the game is that it doesn't utilize the touch screen.  You COULD use it to run and rotate the camara... but it's much easier just to use the controls to do that.  Not only that but using the touch screen to run proves more troublesome than not.  Sadly, there's nothing in which you absolutely have to use the touchscreen. In other words, it doesn't shower as much of the Ninendo DS's power as you'd like.Some parts of the game have aged better than others.  Some courses are just downright silly!  Others are still classics, but it seems as though the trend Super Mario 64 began it can't live up to.  The \"collecting\" trend it began seems a bit overdone in this title.  The battles with Bowser have not lost their flare though.There are also some mini-games that, dare I say, are addictive!  You'll often find yourself playing them over and over again!  There were moments I was so wrapped up playing the mini-games I forgot about the main quest.  The game begins with only eight at first but you'll be able to catch rabbits that unlock other mini-games.Graphic wise, this game is cleaned up and runs smoother than the original N64 version.  The graphics are smoother and the overall presentation is wonderful!  There's nothing better than seeing an old game get a facelift the way Super Mario 64 has. It also runs at a smoother framerate.Soundwise let's just say it's an awesome thing the DS has stereo sound.  It sounds almost exactly like the N64 version.  A great soundtrack that gamers who are familiar with will hum it all over again.  It's incredible nostalgia.It's great to relive a classic.  Some aspects have aged better than others.  I wish Nintendo would have used this game to shower more of what the DS can do but the gameplay more than makes up for it!The Good+Lavish graphics+Runs smoother than the N64 version+More expanded throughout than other re-release games+More characters to play as+Stil hasn't lost its classic feelThe Bad-It doesn't demonstrate everything the DS can do-Some Power Stars require memory of the previous version found on the N64-The Control Scheme isn't as smooth as the original N64 version","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2004"}

Like the remake of the first one, there's bonus dungeons, extras, and this is the biggest and sharpest version. It's also worth noting that this is the only Final Fantasy(that I know of) that doesn't have a leveling system. That is, you're character isn't given experience. Instead, the more you attack, the better you're attacking becomes. Like using magic? You'll be really good if you use it a lot. However, raising magic abilities will lower physical abilities so it's all about balancing out your party how you see fit. I personally think it's one of the better titles in the series because I never feel limited to what I'm doing with my character due to the flexibility without levels.

If This Type Of Game Is Your Thing","reviewText":"Just to put things in perspective, before I review this game, this is one of the first games I bought when I got my PS3 back in 12/2009. I'd heard a GREAT many things about it, all positive, and almost overwhelmingly so. Naturally, I was definitely curious to find out what all the hype was about. Why then did it sit unopened on my shelf until the end of July 2010? I guess the answer is just this simple : `realistic' / military shooters aren't really my thing. I'm more of an action / adventure gamer (God Of War, Bayonetta, etc.). However, there have been shooters I have enjoyed immensely, such as Aliens vs. Predator, Resistance 2, Dead Space, etc.. I guess what I'm getting at, is that when it comes to shooters, I prefer them with a sci-fi edge or `fantastical' element to them. Having said that though, for what Call Of Duty : Modern Ware 2 (COD : MW2) is, it's exceptional. So let me get to it.....THE GOOD : There's no denying this is a fantastic FPS and one that really strives for realism. Having never played a COD game before, I was really struck by, more so than how realistic everything looked, how realistic everything felt. From the time I started the initial campaign in the Middle East, it was almost shocking as it really made me feel like I was really there fighting a war and that death was imminent at any moment. While most FPS's seem somewhat predictable or `linear' in terms of where enemies are or might be, COD : MW2 did not feel that way. The enemies could be above you, next to you, behind you, etc. and it really heightened the sense of realism the game was brining to the table.  Speaking of heightening the realism, the story helped with that significantly. Sure, some of it draws from current world events, but when it veers in to the realm of possibility rather than actuality, with a bloody, shockingly evil rampage through a Russian airport, resulting in an attack and invasion of America itself, it seemed to ratchet up the tension as you were now fighting on your own home turf, defending  what you are used to seeing as relatively peaceful and unspoiled urban and suburban landscapes, now ravaged by an invader's unwanted and aggressive presence.  Beyond the realism however, something else COD : MW2 had going for it was depth. And to me the depth was most prevalent in two areas. First was the depth of missions and terrains. There were missions in seedy, grimy shanty-towns in Brazil, a frozen Russian base high in the mountains, suburban American war-zones, our Nations' capital, European forests, and others including the aforementioned slaughter of innocents at a Russian airport that  you can't help but feeling a little sick just for playing through, since this should be reprehensible to any sane person's moral code. In all actuality though, this depth of missions was pretty much necessary, because without these diverse environments and objectives, the game would get very boring, very quick. Something else that prevented this from happening though was the sheer breadth of weaponry at your disposal. From being able to take enemies out with knives, grenades, pistols, various  automatics and semi-automatics, and RPG's as well as anti-tank and aircraft missles, you could even beat someone down with a riot shield or even take command of a predator drone . Talk about range of weaponry.  And, you could also control snowmobiles and riverboats as well as even a short interlude in space where you could take brief control of an astronaut!  And most of what I just covered was for the single player campaign. The game also provides `Special Ops' missions which play like short `single-serving' versions of the single player campaign. Think `Batman : Arkham Asylum's challenge modes, if you've played that. And while these can be done as 1-player missions, it's recommended to play them with another player as some can be quite challenging.  And last but definitely not least with COD : MW2, is the online Co-Op mode. This is pretty much the game's highpoint and what most everyone plays it for. It's a fantastic opportunity to run around realistic looking environments and frag real players instead of AI controlled characters. There's just no substitute for playing against a real, live thinking individual. So, between the single-player campaign, the Special Ops Missions and the Online Co-Op mode, this game pretty much had it all covered.THE BAD : So, why if the game has it all pretty much covered and seems to have it all do I even have a section for `the bad'? Well, no game is perfect. To begin with the difficulty levels take some figuring out. By that, I mean, it takes some time figuring out what difficulty level works best for you. The game does make a recommendation for you after you complete `The Pit' which is essentially basic training, but even though I had never played a COD game and it was recommended I try `rookie' difficulty, that was almost too easy, as I blew through the single-player campaign with minimal difficulty. So, I decided to try it on Veteran difficulty and that proved near impossible for me after a certain point. In hindsight, I definitely shouldn't have jumped to veteran difficulty right away but there were mitigating factors for my doing so (READ : trophies. I'm a bit of a trophy hunter). Something else about the game that I wasn't all that crazy about was the story itself.  The hopping all over the globe and assuming different characters made it difficult to really `immerse myself in the game' as it seemed to break the continuity a little....for me at least. But again, I recognize this was fairly necessary as otherwise the game would have been more boring than I found it to be. And that is to say, I did find it kind of boring. Again, I'm speaking about the single player and Special Ops missions, as I know the online modes are what this game is really about. And maybe that's the problem? There's no denying that, as I just stated, the online modes are what everyone seems to play this game for. So, for someone like myself who does enjoy online play from time to time, but isn't primarily into it, it made the single-player campaign feel like something of an afterthought or something that only existed because it needed to, to bring overall value to the product.THE BOTTOM LINE: All in all, as I stated when I started this review, the whole militaristic, `realistic' FPS genre just isn't my thing. So that definitely has a bearing on my impressions of this game - without a doubt. But taking that into consideration, if that genre IS your thing, there's no denying that this game is at the top of its' class along with one or two others (I'd be remiss if I didn't mention I have heard a number people say `Battlefield : Bad Company' gives COD : MW2 a serious run for the money). Unquestionably. It strives for and achieves great realism, has an incredible amount of depth to it in a great many ways and seems to have all it's bases covered. If military FPS's are your thing, this is your game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2010"}

This game is all about doing random task to help you earn money while things slowly, very slowly unlocks. Most of the stuff is really just to make the town and your house prettier. Only a small handful of things are actually useable. For example, you can buy a tricycle, but this is only a decorative item, not something you can actually use to get around town faster. A lot of usable items are there to help you do task and earn money, but honestly, once you learn about the bug trick, these items become pretty useless, and you will just find yourself grinding through catching bugs and selling it for large profit. You will rarely run out of money, because the stuff in this game doesn't unlock that quickly. You have to wait days, weeks, and even months for stuff to come available. That said, it does make the town livelier as time passes. You see stores getting shut down and rebuilt. But honestly, I got bored of this game really fast. Digging up fossils, hunting bugs, fishing, and all that stuff is really as uninteresting as it sounds. The little missions like hide-and-seek is nothing to be excited about either. This type of game I would expect on a smartphone, without the in-app purchases. Don't buy this game if you have no patience, or want a game that actually has some challenge to it. If you're into those more growup, fast action, excitement games, COD, BF4, SC2, etc. then this is not for you!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2014"}

There's some loading time of a few seconds when walking between scenes, but its not terrible.I like turn-based combat so I thought this would be a good game to buy.  Unfortunately the pacing of the combat is too slow to be enjoyable.  You cannot skip past the scene at the beginning of every battle and you cannot make the battle animations go faster (as one could with Enchanted Arms).  So be prepared to sit thru a whole bunch of combat animations again and again.  Overall, the combat is fun and it offers a decent challenge, but Lost Odyssey doesnt do anything new with the combat either.Annoying are the occasional stealth and \"puzzle\" missions which are just pointless.  They aren't fun and the game would be better off without them.The story is interesting enough with some nice plot twists (no spoilers will be made here) but the villain is utterly predicable too.  Its a shame the story couldnt come up with a better villain.It really is a 3 star-rating Japanese RPG.  You already know if you want this game or not, but I do urge you to wait until the price goes down to 25 bucks since that's what it is worth.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"Keith Doyle","summary":"Rich, Involving and Phenomenal!","reviewText":"How can anyone NOT give this game 5 stars?  Knights of the Old Republic is a near perfect role-playing experience!This is how role-playing games should be done; open-ended gameplay, deep customization options, superb cinematics, and extreme length!  I've spent 40 hours taking my time through the game and I'm not even halfway finished!  But I simply can't wait until then to review it.Other than Rogue Leader and the upcoming Rebel Strike for the Gamecube, Knights is the best Star Wars game ever made.  The attention to detail is astounding.  Star Wars fans will find every character, sound effect, and image faithful to the movies and literature.  The camera is never a problem since you have full control over it.  Animation is the weakest part of Knights.  The frames per second stay pretty much constant all the time so there's no transition to notice.  But you can tell the animation is subpar compared to most new games.  It never bothered me.I found Knights to be very non-linear.  Players are given a great deal of freedom to do as they wish in plot, action and interaction with the game's characters.  Once you get your spaceship you can select which planet you want to explore, and you can leave almost anytime you want in order to visit a different one.  Dialog in the game is handled by giving the player choices of what to say.  Some of the responses are truly hilarious.  But take what you say seriously, it can have a major effect on your main character's progress.  All of your characters can be customized greatly, from their statistics to their clothing.  When you slap a piece of armor on someone it shows them wearing it on the screen at all times.  There are endless numbers of tools and weapons at your disposal to further outfit your team, although certain people can't use certain items (Wookies can't wear armor).  Lightsabers and Force powers make themselves available eventually and boy, are they ever satisfying!  If you plan on using light side Force powers a lot be kind and helpful in your adventures.  If you want to use dark side powers easily just be mean to everyone you encounter.  The scope of choices in gameplay is impressive.To keep things fresh there are a few minigames strewn throughout your adventure.  I liked the Pazaak card game.  It was easy to understand and proved to be a fun way to build credits even if it's mostly a matter of luck to win.The music is what you would expect from a Star Wars experience.  You'll hear some familiar tunes but most is brand new stuff that fits on-screen events well.  Definitely no complaints there.No other game I know of does such an entertaining job of ingrossing you in what it's like to be a Jedi than this one.  Of course if you just want to be a Han Solo, blaster-toting scoundrel that's your choice, too.  That's what makes this game so fun: FREEDOM.  As far as I'm concerned this is an essential purchase for X-Box owners.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2003"}

Ultimately, disappointing.","reviewText":"This was the first game that I truly bought into the hype and purchased full price within the early goings of the release. It just made sense. Many of my friends were playing this game. This was the most hyped game in the history of PC gaming thus far. So, I gave it a try. The first time through the game was amazing. But, as you go along, there are far too many limitations and unpolished aspects of the game.The Good* The heroes. There are a wide variety classes - The Barbarian, Monk, Demon Hunter, Witch, and the Wizard. Lots of different characters to play with. Barbarian for the close range, physical prowess. Demon Hunter for the long range sniping and shooting ability. Witch and Wizard with spells and spiritual powers.* Beautiful settings. Dirt, night, day, villages, fire, hell, heaven, everything looks gorgeous* The first time through the game is epic, until the very last ACT. The ACT was just disappointing. I couldn't even believe when I killed Diablo. I figured it should have been a bit more difficult. Still, the first half and through the first part of the 2nd half is pulse pounding fun.* Looting. It's quite fun. And addictive.* Armor and weapons upgrading. Highly addictive to a certain extent. There are attributes that make certain armor and weapons more appealing, including vitality, regeneration, gold find, and so forth.The Bad, Bad, Bad* Required online log in. What? Are you kidding me? I have to log in and stay online just to play by myself. I should never have to lag when I am playing alone. A hiccup in internet connection is all it takes to die. If that happens in hardcore, oh that is no good at all.* No voice chat function. That makes no sense at all. Valve has succeeded and made it a standard. It makes absolute no sense to force players to use the in-game text chat or other external programs like skype and ventrilo. Shame on Blizzard.* The additional modes are not appealing. After you finish the game once, you enter Nightmare mode, and so forth. However, aside from higher difficulty, different items, and tougher monsters, there is really no difference. The same thing, again and again.* I expected the graphics to be much better and refined. Zoomed in, the game just looks horrible and blocky.I had a wonderful and enjoyable time finishing the game first time through. After that, I began to mope around and wander around trying to find some reason to keep playing the game. So I tried selling armor and weapon. I purchased armor and weapons from the auctions. I wanted to improve my hero's overall makeup. Then, that got old. I officially stopped playing after a month. Disappointing. There is little to no replay value.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"John. N","summary":"Surprisingly good...","reviewText":"After playing through Xenogears a few times on the PSX in the past, I must admit I was a bit sceptical when I first started to play Xeonsaga. Xenogears was a great game with one of the most interesting (and equally confusing) plots I felt ever had graced a video game. Unfortunately, the game was far what I would a truely \"fun\" experence, due to its sheer length and the level of player awareness it took to get the most out of it.After I started to play Xenosaga, all my worries dissapeared. The storyline was amazing and on par with Xenogears, and I was pleased to see that it was free of that \"cram this all this story in one game and/or disc\" feeling that Xenogears had. While half the game is easily cut scenes, and the other half basically consisting battles, this didn't seem to bother me as much as some people.The character development and the battle system seemed over-complicated to me at first, as having three kind of points to distrubute among your characters different abilities made me wonder if I could manage this, but it quickly became second nature. Battle itself is easy enough to learn, though the fact you only obtain money from certain enemies, while realistic, was somewhat annoying, as I had to build up my money every-so-often because I missed out on some of those investment e-mails.The only thing I though wasn't up to par in Xenosaga was the soundtrack. Now don't get me wrong, there are some wonderful pieces, such as KOS-MOS' fighting theme, the final battle theme (that violin is just soothing), and the appearence the song Greensleves. The rest of the music, even boasting the fact it was performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra on the back of the case, just didn't do it for me. Also consider the fact the musical score doesn't play continously during gameplay like in most RPG's, as the world of Xenosaga is sometimes so quiet you can hear a pin drop. The music is ok, but one will quickly realize that Yasunori Mitsuda did more with less on Xenogears' wonderful soundtrack.Before I wrap this up, I would really love to know how this game got a Teen rating from the ESRB. Not that I'm an advocate of the ESRB or anything, but honestly, there are some scenes (one in particular involving a non-player character strangling a little girl) that just makes me wonder how much money did Namco bribe the ESRB with.All that aside, I would recommend Xenosaga to anyone that likes RPG's and has the time to kill. Don't let the complex character development system and complex story put you off.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00113JSCG","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Could have been spectacular, but marred by technical issues","reviewText":"The Alone in the Dark series goes back a long way (even pre-dating the Resident Evil franchise) in terms of pioneering the survival horror genre, with this new installment kind of being a re-boot for the series.  Once again filling the shoes of paranormal investigator Edward Carnby, Alone in the Dark finds Carnby caught in the middle of an apocalyptic event while investigating strange happenings in Central Park.  The first thing you'll notice is that Alone in the Dark boasts some wonderfully creepy and spooky environments that drip with eerie atmosphere.  In fact, the areas are so well designed that you'll often find yourself admiring your surroundings while dodging demons and beasts.  The game looks good in general as well, despite a few graphical glitches that occur, while the game's solid score adds to the overall survival horror atmosphere.  What's really sad about Alone in the Dark is that the game's potential to be something special is marred by technical issues.  Namely, just moving around can be a chore.  The control issues that present themselves during combat and puzzle solving only add layers of frustration to the game, which is a crying shame.  Despite it's flaws, Alone in the Dark does present some innovation in terms of it's item inventory use and some dramatic moments that will jolt you out of your chair.  The game's story is intriguing, and there are some great lighting effects too.  All in all, Alone in the Dark is a worthwhile trip that could have been something truly great, but in the end is brought down thanks to it's technical issues.  Still, for survival horror fans, Alone in the Dark is definitely worth a look.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2008"}

It's not ideal that it needs to take up a USB slot on the PS3 and doesn't have the motion sensing features that the official controllers do. It looks nice and feels pretty good in my hands, but it's not something that immediately struck me as &#34;Oh, you need this!&#34;What bumped it up to 5 stars is how much my nephew has been loving using it when he comes to visit and plays with me. He pretty much dives for it immediately because he likes it much MUCH better than the standard controller. We don't play sports games and I'm really not sure why it would be a &#34;sports&#34; controller. He plays shooting games with me a lot, though, and gets a lot of amusement out of turning on the turbo feature for the trigger button when he has a pistol and listening to it fire like it was a fully automatic.Neither of us have noticed any problems at all with responsiveness. Switching back and forth between this (which has a more xbox-style format) and the standard dualshock can be a little disorienting for a moment, but I've never noticed any delays in the game responding and my nephew's never complained about it not responding the way he wanted either. Other people have complained about that, so I don't know if it's a matter of the interference level in different rooms, or that maybe the PS3 Super Slim that I have just might handle the USB controller input better than their model of Playstation or something.I'm really not a fan of puzzles/challenges in games that lean heavily on mashing a button as fast as possible, because my fingers end up aching, so having the turbo to cover that for me is VERY nice.For anyone who finds the xbox style of controller more comfortable, or who wants a controller a little larger than the standard Sony went with, this thing really is very nice. Giving up that USB port isn't a big deal for me because I wasn't using it anyway, and I know I can plug in a powered USB hub if it ever does become a problem.I'm half-expecting my nephew to try to slip it in his coat pocket one day when it's time for him to head home after a visit. I'll probably actually be adding this to the list of things that family members could consider getting him for Christmas, since it's definitely something he'd be thrilled to get.

While this isnt a bad game its really nothing stellar, the normal point aim shoot kill throw grenade blow up tank shoot down helicopter game is all this is. Codemasters has always had nice \"looking\" games but not really the best gameplay out there. The only title that has really done them well is the Dirt series. Clive Barkers jericho was an incredible \"looking game\" but also failed in the gameplay department as well as the game Fuel. Its nice to see another first person Call Of Duty type of game, but this one is really a dud, it actually came in under the radar because a lot of people had never even heard of it, myself included. A lot of game sites now say the game is pretty good, but others just say its pretty much the same ole run of the mill war game, i agree with the later. There are no real psychics here, no real story, the graphics are impressive but sloppy when it comes to some of the characters who move and look rigid, and some with jagged edges. So basically as i said to little to late, modern warfare 2 is on the horizon and will definitely be the best selling game this year, if not in the last 2 years. I give 3 stars for effort because it does have some action and decent gameplay moments and looks pretty, and even if not comparing it to COD, its still pretty cliche'. Nothing new her, but a decent rental.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2009"}

The new style of graphics will get some getting used to as well as the higher elevated visuals. Besides the temple area, the rest of the game focus on jumping, running, climbing, flying, swinging and falling on the side of tall buildings and structures or on the top of these buildings. Everything is high up, you are never on the ground at bottom level like other games that I've played. So it is great, very great, to have Elika at your side constantly. Elika actually makes this game from potentially very hard to really easy. The Prince cannot die because Elika will save him from death everytime whether it is against enemies or extremely hard jumps. You can actually take stupid risk in this game because you know that Elika will be there to save you. This also makes getting light seeds more enjoyable and safe. One of the best parts of the game are the power plate adventures. With these plates you actually feel like you are flying like Superman or crawling on the wall like Spiderman. There are challenging moments in the game though. The power plate challenges can be pretty challenging and even though Elika will save you she will not do the challenge for you, this also includes puzzles. She will tell you how to solve a puzzle though. If you are looking for a game that is easy and still exciting, this is the perfect game to play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2009"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Great Single Player and Multiplayer","reviewText":"This series continues to improve. Your still Ezio. It takes place right after the first second title. You go on to stop the Borgia family by recruiting Assassin's and recapturing the piece of Eden. If you play either of the last two titles, the near end gets pretty crazy as well. The game is pretty decent link since a big part of the game is the added multiplayer they put into the game.Before I get to that, the single player game isn't as long but it offers a lot of stuff to do. This time around you don't improve your own place, you improve all of Rome by opening up weapon, medicine, and other shops to use and to add funds that you will receive by opening up banks as well. You do this by taking over the influence of a stronghold held by the Borgia Family. To accomplish this you kill a leader of that area and burn its tower. This starts off as a main objective and becomes somewhat of a side thing to in order to make their influence less threatening to your presence. As you further progress you will gain the ability to recruit Assassins. You can you use them as you fight to call in as a new gameplay element but beforehand you can send them on smaller easier missions to gain experience to be better equipped to fight.The online portion is pretty creative and unique. There are various modes to play in. There is one where you have to be sneaky to attack your target. While your on the prowl someone else is also hunting you. You don't want to give yourself away too easy so gain experience by assassinating quietly and you keep yourself getting noticed. There is also another were you are in groups. You will be the hunted one round and the next round you will be the predator. Its pretty clever. You have perks and abilities you can use throughout as you get more experienced. You start of with a disguise but work your way up to smoke bombs, firecrackers, a gun, and such that aid you as your trying to attack or evade.I highly recommend this game. It is one of the best games I played the does a great job balancing a incredible single-player experience with great multiplayer. Its no way tacted on. The game looks just a gorgeous as the others in the series. It sounds just as great and the controls are still spot on. This isn't a game you will put down.

{"product_name":"B0007PIEB0","reviewerName":"Madisen","summary":"Great platformer!","reviewText":"In a world where even games that claim to be \"platformers\" (like the sequels to the Jak and Ratchet franchises) are really just gun-toting action games, Psychonauts is a welcome return to the classic platforming formula. There are plenty of items to collect (with great rewards for doing so), lots of environmental puzzles, and, thankfully, little focus of combat and weaponry.The main game has 10 levels, each taking place inside someone's mind. Each one is very creative, sometimes confusingly so. Although figuring out what all the mental world stuff means is sometimes hard, I found nine out of ten of them to be pretty satisfying. Also, all of them have plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, from jokes about main character Raz's goggles to tiny, screaming charicature of Napoleon who struts around on stilts.However, it's the parts outside of the main storyline that really sold me. There are tons of things to do when you don't feel like advancing the plot. You can crack memory vaults to get the characters' backstories, dust \"mental cobwebs\" to exchange for rank upgrades, and sort \"emotional baggage\" to unlock concept art--and that's just in the mental world. In the physical realm, you can explore a fully-featured summer camp, collecting PSI cards, having funny conversations with fellow children, and discovering an assortment of humorous scavenger-hunt items.Although I wish the game would have given me more opportunities to use my psychic abilities, they were still very fun. Levitation was the most useful, but I couldn't get enough of telekinesis. And things just got more interesting when I leveled up, making my powers even stronger and cooler. These powers, as well as all the normal moves such as jumping, fighting, and swinging on things, are relatively easy and intuitive to use, thanks to a simple control scheme. Also, it's almost impossible to get stuck, thanks to a well-crafted in-game hint system.Overall, I would highly reccomend this game to gamers who enjoyed real, true platformers like Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie, and the first Jak game. Although I'm forced to bring it down to 4 stars for a sometimes-confusing plot and the PS2's noticeable technical disadvantage to the Xbox, it is all in all a fun, enjoyable ride.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2005"}

McKenzie","summary":"A Unique Gaming Experience Spread Across 2 Games","reviewText":"\"The Chronicles of Riddick\" is such a bizarre franchise.  The Riddick character was a colorful supporting role in a sci-fi horror flick, and eventually got bumped up to the lead role of a movie that critics bashed but made a lot of money anyway.\"The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault On Dark Athena\" is essentially a 2-game combo.  You get the 2004 \"Escape From Butcher Bay\" game with remastered graphics and sound, with a couple of small changes compared to the original X-Box release.  \"Assault On Dark Athena\" is the 2009 sequel, picking up almost right where \"Butcher Bay\" left off.Describing these two \"Riddick\" games is tricky, because even in 2011, there's still nothing like either of them.  They're not action games.  They're not RPGs.  They're not first-person shooters.  They're not stealth games.  The \"Riddick\" games are all of those qualities.  One moment you'll be sneaking in the shadows, desperately trying to avoid the enemy.  The next, you'll be getting up close and personal with your fists, taking their weapons, and shooting your way out of trouble.  Then shortly after that, you'll be talking to other characters, trying to complete some quests so that you can proceed.Both games boast good graphics & even better sound effects.  The character models and lip-synching aren't the best in the business, but they get the job done.  The reason the \"Riddick\" games draw you ine the environments.  \"Butcher Bay\" is a disgusting grimy prison world, while \"Dark Athena\" is a dark mysterious spaceship, both with effective presentation (\"Athena\" the better of the two) and both games with some neat surprises in terms of locations.  Neither of these games has a terrific story by any means, but the top-notch voice-acting and strong music score sell it well.  Say what you will about Vin Diesel, but in the world of videogames, he fits like a glove.The stories of both games are solid, although in very different ways.  I believe \"Dark Athena\" is the more coherent of the two, with character arcs playing out more naturally and surprisingly.  \"Butcher Bay\" might please Riddick fans more, because even though it might be a more disjointed story, it feels like it belongs more with the feature films, especially since Johns from the \"Pitch Black\" movie has a prominent role.  Still, I found the atmosphere and pacing of \"Dark Athena\" more compelling.  Although it's very odd that (MINOR SPOILER) Johns basically disappears from the whole \"Dark Athena\" story from the getgo.The uniqueness of both \"Butcher Bay\" and \"Dark Athena\" is very alluring, but unfortunately, they're not perfect games.  Both games involve a lot of backtracking (especially \"Butcher Bay\") and don't do a great job of telling you where to go next.  I'm all for immersive experiences like \"Half-Life\" or \"Portal\" where you're forced to investiage your surroundings, but \"Chronicles of Riddick\" might frustrate gamers that are used to having things spelled out for them.  At least \"Butcher Bay\" includes a map feature; \"Dark Athena\" trusts that you'll read signs and computer screens within the spaceship.  It's also a shame that \"Dark Athena\" didn't fix a lot of the problems with \"Butcher Bay\".  The AI is a little spotty; I was mostly annoyed with tough-as-hell mechs and deadly security turrets.In the end, I strongly suggest looking up some videos to see if these games interest you, because their unusual style and gameplay mechanics might be a dealbreaker for some.  \"Assault On Dark Athena\" isn't a very expensive disc anyway, so I encourage skeptics to take the leap of faith.  You won't lost a lot of money on the deal, and you can jump into either \"Escape From Butcher Bay\" or \"Assault On Dark Athena\" at any time.  This is a no-brainer for Riddick fans, but I think gamers looking for something more off the beaten path may have found a nice package.Escape From Butcher Bay - 8 / 10Assault On Dark Athena - 8.5 / 10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2011"}

Greatly evolves as you progress in the game.+ Some very cool new twists in the story as well as the game play. Things like gravity and the Veil which is further explained in review.Cons- Slightly dated graphics, level design, and game play- Online multiplayer can be a little dull.

This game is fun. It reminds me so much of the classic games from years ago. For what else is out right now and how far games have come, to me, this game takes a step back. It is an old game, with better graphics and some slightly new ideas. Don't get me wrong, there are new little surprises and cool additions to the game play and storyline, but all in all, this is a basic game with a simple style and classic game play/menus/control.After playing Killzone 2, Infamous, Dead Space, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and Resident Evil 5, Wolfenstein seems like a game which may have come out a few years ago, and been pretty good. With what else is out right now, and how far developers have pushed the limits of what can be done in a video game, this game does seem very dated.The pros of this game are a pretty solid story and the little new twists in the atmosphere of the game. One new idea with the game play is the Veil. The Veil is a green blanket which covers the gaming world which you are in and transforms everything around you. It basically is a doorway between two worlds or detentions. You activate the Veil with a medallion you found. Let's say you are in the regular world walking around and come to a dead end. You activate the Veil and where there once was a wall, there now is a doorway. There is more to it as the game progresses and you can use it anytime and in more creative ways. You can collect four crystals to add to the medallion which give you different powers. Powers like the Veil, slowing down time, a shield, and intensifying your weapons. These powers drain your medallion which will then need to be recharged by standing over one of the little recharging portal peppered throughout the game. They are everywhere.One simple yet really fun thing in the game is the anti-gravity tanks that are tossed in levels from time to time. If an enemy is near them, shot the tank and they'll go floating off. Much more fun to shoot.This games mission design is set up a little differently. You can speak with people about mission and choose to do them in the order you wish. At times you may only have one mission. At others you may have 3 or so missions which you need to complete. And you can do them in any order you like. I wouldn't say it is a free roam game, but I think that is what they were going for.You can upgrade all your weapons in the black market. Your medallion and Veil powers can also be upgraded. There are a lot of neat little supernatural weapons. The Particle Cannon for example is a weapon you collect from a big guy you must defeat. The Particle Cannon shoots this lightning like beam and completely disintegrates enemies.Over-all, this is a decent game, but it is very basic game play and has been done hundreds of times before. The Veil is very interesting and carries this otherwise dull game. Yes you can shoot bad guys heads off. Yes there are these Nazi zombie skeleton dudes. But the AI kinda sux. Very basic.I didn't hear too much about this games release and I took a chance and went out and bought it. Am I disappointed? Not to the extent where I would totally regret buying it. But I was expecting a little more. Better graphics and tighter game play. I find that the further I get into this game, the more I like it. It should keep me busy until Batman Arkham Asylum comes out next week.I hope this review helped those of you out there wanting a basic idea of how good Wolfenstein is.

Yes, it's not hi-res graphics and I did notice a couple of slowdowns and hiccups when there were what seemed to be 'hundreds' of enemies on the screen but everything else works well:- zero crashes so far and I took one of my toons to level 50 which translates in MANY hours of play- very quick matching when doing 'multiplayer', I couldn't believe how fast it was after being used with the long summoning waits on the Souls games- pretty smooth graphics once you get used to the 'over the shoulder' view and the inability to control the camera- easy to use menu system- responsive controls that include the R3 'rolling' capabilityAnd then it's the game itself. My understanding is that the console ports incorporate all the PC patches up to the release date and include some welcome changes such as the elimination of the auction houses and the much hated 'always online' requirement for the PC version.As a Diablo noob, I was impressed by the never-ending battles and enormous loot you are getting and the lore is not that bad either, especially if you take a couple of hours and go through the beautiful most informativeDiablo III: Book of Cain.So, if a 'good game' involves lots of dungeons, monsters (I killed almost 30,000 so far), interesting lore, big loot and the ability to constantly grow your character so it can face ever more powerful opponents with the option of co-op play, try this one out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2013"}

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"chadwick","summary":"Good Wii accessory","reviewText":"This review is for the White Wii Nunchuk Controller.

So, I can't really comment on the ultimate progression of the plot, or \"lame ending\" as others have written, but I can speak of Radiata's other qualities.-Plot. So far, mildly interesting, but nothing that keeps me dangling on the edge of my sofa or makes me miss two nights of sleep. The concept of following a young knight as he progresses through life is engaging, but again it's not the best plot idea out there.-Dialogue. Probably what makes this game shine. Or at least what kept me from giving it 3 stars overall. The humor in this game is refreshing, to say the least, with each character constantly teasing and chiding the others around him/her throughout the game. The main character, Jack, is pretty funny, especially at times when he gets \"really excited\" or really peeved at his squadmates. You're reminded that Jack is an immature and sometimes annoying brat just about every time he opens his mouth. Probably sounds like it can a little old, but it's more funny than obnoxious. At least, I tend to think so.-150 characters. Ho hum. Collecting characters fell out of favor with me after Suikoden. If this kinda thing is your bag, baby, then go for it. Stalking these fruitcakes throughout the city at all hours of the day and night trying to get a hold of them so they can ultimately tell you \"Hey buddy, F you I'm busy\" got REALLY OLD. I spoke with this one guy on the street, in the tavern, in the bar, and in the church and he kept saying the same stupid thing over and over. Why didn't he join my party, then? Oh, it's because I have to talk to him at the NIGHTCLUB to get him to join, and not the other places. Yeah, let me spend hours tracking this twig down to get him to join my party. He's probably armed with a banana and a half-spent roll of toilet paper, and dies in two hits anyway, so who cares? I also regret the developers' decision to make some characters agree to join you only after you spoken with them every day for a certain number of days. Nothing quite like artificially running up the length of the game by making players carpetbomb the city every day with hellos. The city is enormous, by the way. Just....  never mind, I'm going to change the subject.-Music. Sorry, this is one of the aspects of Radiata that I really really really didn't like. While there might be a song or two that's cool, most are of the irritating twangy jazz/almost bluegrass kinda crap that just plain grate. The battle music is ok, but the boss music is plain unforgivable. I was never sure if a fight was about to break out, or if a circus troupe was about to perform. How about at least a little serious battle music?-Battles. Pretty enjoyable. You basically control your main character while the CPU controls your teammates. However, you can \"influence\" your other characters through battle commands like \"attack that enemy\" or \"be my meat shield\", but these are kinda stupid anyway, seeing as how the best way to be successful in battles is to simply forego the commands and just bring along teammates who have high Strength levels. These Attack Machines will often mow down most of the enemy number before you can lift your weapon.-Kicking. That's right, kicking. You can kick just about everything in the game. It's how you \"find things\". You can kick stones, pebbles, trees, insects, crates, lightposts, old ladies, treasure chests, whatever. It's the only way you can really obtain items aside from winning them in battle or wasting money on them. The kicking thing is funny at first (when it's novel), but I soon became tired of the sport, mainly after seeing how large some of these areas are. Oh, and especially after I kicked that one flower-planting lady in the tush twice, only to have her sic guards on me, who kept regenerating endlessly throughout the battle, forcing me to run using one of my items. That was frustrating. And that did it.-Saving. More irritating than it needs to be. Rather than give you the option of saving ad libitum in the \"overworld\" or, hell, wherever you want, you can only save at certain locations, AT certain times. Yes, that's right, a save point in one spot will often DISAPPEAR once you advance the story. You can also only recover health by sleeping in your own bed, which coincidentally is usually found at the CENTER of the game's map. So you get to save your game, travel out on a quest fighting enemies, kicking nature, and collecting items for a few hours, fight a particularly nasty group of enemies which happen to kick your arse, and guess what? RESTART from the last save point. That happened to me twice early on in the game. Nothing like having to redo a few hours of work. Granted, this hasn't happened since the beginning of the game (actually, save points sometimes occur TOO often where I am in the game!) but at least I can say, you've been warned.-Story Progression/Time. Almost didn't mention this point. The game runs on a day/night time system. Whether you're traipsing across the meadowlands, chasing down townspeople, or standing completely still getting a sunburn, time is moving. Every time the clock hits 12 a new day begins. Often after the main plot takes a break, you're allowed to run around and do whatever you want. The thing is you only have a few days to talk to people, buy junk to equip yourself with, or work through some sidequests. If you spend too much time and those days all pass, the main story automatically moves on. This can get a little annoying sometimes. On the other hand if you're the kind of person to says \"screw it\" to sidequests and spending money, you can just sleep in your bed 2-4 times until the main story progresses. Remember, the whole game seems to be on a day system, like a calendar.That's about all I can say at this point in the game. I was interested in collecting characters at first, but then I found out that there were ~150 of them, and that it took way too much trial and error \"talk to everyone you meet everyday with different people in your party\" crud in order to convince many of them to join. So now I'm just moving myself through the main game, only stopping to complete the occasional sidequest, and I figure I'll finish the game in another 10 hours or so. The game is nothing truly outstanding, but it's enjoyable for what it is. (And don't buy this game if it's priced over $40)Will I play through it again after that? Nope, no reason to-- even if there's an alternate storyline/ending. This game has enough charm for a good single play-thru and then it's exchangin' time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00432O50W","description":"","reviewerName":"Scratchy","summary":"RE4 Meets Splatterhouse Meets Dantes inferno","reviewText":"First of all i had my reservations about picking this game up but i quickly got engrossed into it and ended up loving every bit of it, except for a few parts here and there.  Only complaint about this game is the forced 2d platforming they make you do.  Yeah, it changes up the pace of the game so it isnt the same ole, same ole all the way through, but why the hell not when the game is so much fun to play.  Bad move by the designers but it doesn't ruin the game for me.Story:  Girl gets kidnapped by the king of demons Flemming, who happens to be the girlfriend of the famous demon hunter Garcia Hotspur.  Flemming then tells the Garcia, that he is pretty much going to have his way with his girlfriend and theres nothing he can do about it.  As Flemming escapes into hell with Garcia's girlfriend garcia follows him into hell to get his girlfriend back.  Not so much an original story but was an entertaining one.  9/10Gameplay:  If you have ever played Resident Evil 4 then you will be right at home with the movements and aiming mechanics involved in this game.  Thankfully you do not get stuck to the ground when you aim, like in RE4.  You have many ways of dispatching enemies in this game i forget to use em all.Few things to know about hell.  Dead babies are gate keepers, you have to feed them: brains, eyeballs or strawberries.  Yup apparently strawberries are demon fruit and hells joke to the real world.  The darkness in hell is dangerous to anyone that is not dead so you must find light wherever you can.  Sometimes you have to make light on your own, either lighting up a lamp on the wall or shooting a goat in the face.  The light shot is a move you use to light up lamps/goats in hell as well as freeze enemies in place so you can either finish them off with a melee finisher, just aim for the head or switch to another gun and blast em to peices.  9/10Weapons:First weapon is your torch which is actually your shape-shifting brittish demon friend Johnson (the first of many penis jokes).  The torch pretty much helps you to keep demons back if they get too close but if you charge it up you can actually do some damage to em with it, killing em if you time it right.Second is your gun the Boner(yup another penis joke)that shoots demon bones, which can get upgraded into the Hot boner, and lastly the Big boner.  Its the most reliable gun in the game basically for accuracy seeing how the enemies move around alot it is hard to aim for their vitals without freezing them with your light shot.Third is the shotgun that shoots demon skulls and lastly the sub machine gun that shoots demon teeth.  The game lets you upgrade every weapon up to 3 times giving you cool alternate fires and ways to kill endless demons.Nothing beats freezing an enemy with the light shot then blasting them with the shotgun.  10/10Length.  Not too long but the humor involved in the story is funny enough to make you want to play the game again.  8/10Content.  There is alot of cursing, penis jokes, dirty fairy tales, sexual innuendo, and of course a giant women in the background with their boobs hanging out which with whom you can use as a human bridge and walk through her cleavage to get to the next area.  I think if any game would match the humor, foul language and possible gore it would have to beSplatterhouse,Dante's Inferno Divine Editionwould be on the raunchier side mostly for the pure nakedness.  9/10The things i disliked about this game.  As i said before the forced platforming levels.  I wish games like these would be the same game i bought all the way through instead of changing things around mid-game or near the end once i already got used to the controls.  Like i said its not a deal breaker its just a bit of an annoyance that hurts replay value seeing how it slows the game up and takes you away from the best part of the game, the demon hunting/slaying.  The penis jokes got old after awhile but the rest of the humor did make me laugh. Having to re-watch every cut-scene in the game when you died with no option to skip them and the inability to go back and pick up things you missed kind of annoyed the completion-ist in me, even if it helps the replay value somewhat.Overall i give it 9/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Ram","summary":"Half REcharted, but it gets better as you progress...","reviewText":"For the first few hours, Uncharted 3 felt like a rehash of Uncharted 2. Several portions of the game are nearly identical to the last one: the same platforming, combat, and story elements reappear. That's not to say it's bad by any means...it just takes a while to set itself apart. It wasn't until halfway in (about 5 hours) that things started to get interesting; there are some great set pieces and surprising turns that develop which help break up the monotony.Graphically, the game looks amazing, especially in the later areas. There is some texture tearing, and anti-aliasing problems (jaggies) in places that take away from otherwise beautiful renderings. The game looks very dark and gritty in places, and sometimes I wondered if the resolution was TOO high. The majority of it is great though, with varied environments, solid character designs and well-choreographed cut scenes. In terms of music and sound, they did the usual outstanding job. Voice acting is top notch, though the actors telegraph things a bit often (\"Grab that door, will you?\" \"Okay\" \"Got it?\" Yeah\"). The music builds on the themes from the previous games while adding things to the mix depending on the region you're in.There's not much to say about the gameplay; if you played the last game, this one offers more of the same. Some of the same issues reappear - I popped out of cover when I didn't want to, and aiming is often annoying, as where the reticle pops in rarely syncs up perfectly with where you're looking. There are upgrades to combat that make Drake seem like Batman (taking out a room full of mercenaries bare-knuckled) or Superman (surviving in the desert for days and then battling hundreds of bad guys with no water, food or rest), but like the improvement in grenade tossing from UC to UC2, these are a nice addition. Drake seems to live a charmed life, as every time things come crashing down around him there's always a net to catch or ledge to hang onto...not to say these weren't present in UC2, but here they happen so often it sort of takes away the sense of danger. The puzzles are interesting and usually enjoyable, though not as challenging as the last game (the clues are either right around you or in Drake's notebook). Thankfully, there were only a couple times when I got lost or stuck in a room...a definite improvement over UC2. Treasure hunting is a mixed bag - I searched most areas thoroughly and only got 41 out of 100, so the others must require a lot of effort to find. I wish there was a way to play through the game again with a reduction in enemies, as they are mainly an annoyance when you just want to explore and enjoy the scenery.The story in the game is fine in a general sense, but there are times when it felt like things were overlooked or missing altogether. Once again we have a lengthy flashback sequence, though this time it helps to flesh out the relationships between Drake, Sully and Marlowe (the villainess). In my review of UC2, I mentioned that there were only two female characters in the game, so having a female adversary here is a welcome addition. Her motivations are interesting, and it's great how all the little discoveries Drake makes add up to a big revelation in the end. It makes it all the more worthwhile when you take her down. There are parts of the game that could have been better thought out though. For instance, there is a point where the four heroes split into two groups to find two halves of a clue. You control Drake and Sully and head through a French chateau (until you're attacked by Marlowe's men), then head to Syria to check on the progress of Chloe and Cutter (a new character)...only to find them perfectly well. It felt like there was a missing section where we could play as the second duo for a while, but nope, apparently they've just been wandering around inside a castle for a few days. I do have to give the game points for keeping Sully involved (he was sorely missed when he left in UC2) and bringing Elena back. There are logic gaps here and there (the way a drug affects its target; how Marlowe's men ALWAYS come after Drake no matter where in the world he is), but the reaches back into the series' past help to make up for them.All in all, I would say UC3 gradually becomes an enjoyable game, with some memorable scenes (including evacuations from a sinking cruise ship and exploding cargo plane) and wonderful areas (the chateau, a massive desert, underground caverns that will amaze you) in addition to the gameplay and characters you remember. The producers have mentioned that they only want to continue the series if they can top themselves again, and it would be hard to beat the exciting sequences that come into play here. I'm not sure how they could improve upon things - climbing hundreds of walls and facing waves of enemies again is a given (but not all that appealing), and Drake's already survived train, plane and boat crashes as well as ancient cities crumbling around him...not to mention multiple brushes with the supernatural. What else can he overcome?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2012"}

This is not a world of goblins and barbarians, or any other such fantasy fare. Within the dark realms ofPrimal&#146;s alternate universe, gamers find themselves involved in an intricate and realistic story--enhanced by several subplots and twists--that makes them question the fine line between fantasy and reality.Primalis a story-driven game of exploration, combat, and puzzles, presented through the experiences of Jen and Lewis, a present-day human couple drawn into discord by eternal forces. While gameplay revolves around the events of the story, there are many personal revelations and surprises for the characters along the way. Essential to the game&#146;s core is the unusual and evolving relationship betweenPrimal&#146;s two main playable characters, Jen and her companion Scree, a gargoyle. Players can switch between Jen and Scree at any time and will be required to assess and utilize each character&#146;s strengths to succeed in various areas of the game.Primalis set within a huge environment featuring four expansive realms surrounding a central hub. A dynamic loading system allows for uninterrupted gameplay between levels, and magical portals act as links and windows into other worlds.

You can't help but be enchanted by all the realms you visit. They are absolutely, undeniably gorgeous. Really giving the architecture and graphics of some Xbox titles a run for their money. You play as Jen who travels to four different demon realms with her friend, Scree, in search of her boyfriend: Lewis. The more you play as Jen, the more you find out about her and the sooner you find out that there is more to her than meets the eye. I have to admit, I'm intrigued by her character and want to know even more about her.This game is slow-paced, which will prove taxing to those with lil or no patience, but if you can manage to see things through til the end- You'll get a rich and rewarding experience. There's unlockable DVD extras to be had and more.Primal sports greatness and is sure to be a sleeper hit. Even more, it's sure to be to be a classic game in your PS2 library.

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"FicktionPhotography","summary":"Drifting From Typical FFs","reviewText":"So, we have Lightning, Snow, and other irritably named characters like Hope and Vanilla...ohh, I mean...Vanille, dealing with the hand of fate which interweaves their lives with one another.  They go up against an omnipotent force called the fal'Cie and attempt to change their lives for the better without causing ultimate destruction and death.  As is with most Final Fantasy games, they need to depend on each other to get through these dark times and to, ultimately, succeed.With that established we can move on to more pressing concerns.  FF and their creators seem to be drifting ever further from the unique, fun, interesting ways of FFs of the past.  I can't blame anyone for wanting to try something new, but when you give the players a world that seems infinitesimally small it gets annoying.  It takes about 20+ hours to get to an area that's larger than a theme park and even then you can cross the giant land mass in about five minutes...without a chocobo.  At that point you can do side quests and the like that are similar to the old FF games, but are about as fun as licking envelopes.  The fact is it seems to be that the non-linear structure of FFs have become completely linear.  It's just a bunch of corridors and tunnels with an occasional monster that you can run around or actually fight.Speaking of fighting.  The ability to fool around during battles is a moot point.  You get this thing called Paradigms which allows you to select what 'role' you want your characters to play.  So, for example, there's a Sentinel which, go figure, guards and there's a Medic which heals and a Ravager that blasts magic all around.  Well, god forbid you want to do that all at once in just ONE character.  No, sir.  You have your three characters, each are given a role and if you want to change their roles you Paradigm switch which takes up time and destroys their original queue of attacks or defenses.  To continue on my tirade, apparently the creators of this game want you to do NOTHING but hit the \"Auto-battle\" button and sit around twiddling your thumbs hoping that it works rather than actively kill the thing that's opposing you.  To top it off you can only control the party leader and the other characters just do whatever the computer says they should do.  How is this a video game?  When did the game console get to have an input as to what happens and how during battles with characters that YOU are leveling up?  This is, if you can't tell by my bitter tone, the worst part of the game for me.  It hurts to watch the FF structure fall to the wayside in the most fundamental part of the FF games: the battles!! You spend a good 80 hours out of the 90 you inevitably pour into these games battling and it's become little more than surface film.It seems like the game is more focused on blowing your mind away with aesthetic pleasures such as the sheer CGI quality of the game itself.  Okay, I'll give it that.  The graphics in and out of CGI cut scenes are glorious.  Because of this it seems the storyline and the characters suffered miserable existences because the game had to look good. The storyline is hard to follow and boring at times.  Plus you don't understand much unless you go into the menu screen and read all the information the game provides for you after certain cut scenes.  Ever since when, yet again, did games provide information as an optional exploratory glossary as opposed to weaving the meanings and intricacies and information into the story itself.  The characters, also, are just as flat as the story.  They change little and how they change is obviously predictable.The only reason this game has three stars to all these words is because, as mentioned, the graphics are superb and the game isn't completely a wash.  The story is borderline interesting if you take the time to read all of that glossary-like material in the menu and if you pay attention since your span of attentiveness will probably drop more than once during the game.  It also does have some fairly formidable opponents that, at the very least, propose a challenge and an urge to beat SOMETHING even if the urge to finish the game is negligible.  Though, I could argue that if I had the option to combine roles the opponents would be little more than irritable dogs that need a good talking to.  It's difficult as a seasoned FF player to watch the games become less and less like their predecessors, but I guess I have to swallow my pride.  It's not that much different from watching phones become computers and computers become humans.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000035Y4P","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"Beware when downloading on Wii's Virtual Console service","reviewText":"Considering the high price of the game (and having never played a Final Fantasy game), I decided to download this on Wii. Up until the issue started, I loved the beautiful game. The storyline was plain beautiful. It was all about magic and technology colliding, rebels trying to squash the evil empire, and a helpless girl who was enslaved. The graphics, while appearing to be basic, became quite advanced after a while. The music was triumphant and bold, fitting the game perfectly. However, Nintendo or Square altered the VC port. The save feature was completely removed, and I could not save at all. What was their excuse? It was \"You can now use the software suspension feature\", which basically means you can exit the game and it will pause until you come back. However, if for some reason the game is cut off without suspending (either by upset brothers or power surges) you get to start the RPG all over. On the final boss when the power goes out? Back to being enslaved in the beginning. Also, the game is difficult. I don't mind the difficulty level at all, but if I get a single Game Over it goes right back to the opening credits. How does Nintendo expect me to beat a long, challenging, and very complicated RPG without dying? Now I have three options:1. I will have to buy the original copy for $40 to $1000 dollars (most likely)2. I will have to play the updated \"3D\" port on DS (somewhat likely)3. I will have to download the same \"3D\" remake now overpriced and on a touchscreen tablet.

The story this time around is vastly improved. Rather than \"There's a tower, lets explore.\" \"Why?\" \"I dunno. That guy asked us to.\" \"Whys he want us to?\" \"Dunno. Never asked.\" You're more a Scooby Doo gang, following on the heels of a murder mystery, in which people appear in a bizarre television broadcast before turning up dead, with nary a deus ex machina corporation or chairman in sight. You're dropped in the middle when a girl from your school whom you met the day after arriving is the latest victim.Any fan of the game will recognize and instantly fall in line with just about everything. THe Velet Room setup is similar, Margaret replaces the annoying robot from P3, and now speaks with inflection in her voice. Dungeon crawls are more annoying, in that you have to buy return potions rather than having those warp points that I found useful. Various settings now replace the tower, and you're pursuing a person through them, rather than just seeing whats above the next staircase. The bonus system now only features Personas and penalties, which I find stupid. The bonus cards made the game a lot swifter, and made it worthwhile to grind that you might get a boatload of gold or some nifty gear, or bonus XP. Now its just turned a grind-a-thon into a grind-a-nom-a-thon-a-con. This is to be expected, but I still frowned after learning that feature had been cut.Characters have improved in this incarnation, and feel more like people, rather than archetypes. Junpei from P3 was supposed to embody the \"real person\" to help stave off the feeling that you are playing a game, and that quality has been extended to every main character this time around. You have the shy introvert sick of being dumped on by her parents, the quirky energetic girl you tries to overcome her personal fears with boundless energy, and the smart and also dumb slacker who manages to be friends with anyone. If that doesn't remind you of 3 people YOU knew in high school, it must've had less than 50 people. Social Links are a bit better put together, and advance under circumstances other than date after date after date.Overall, the game has improved. A couple aspects did not move in the direction of good, but those are more personal nits than anything. The setting is more realistic, with a better flow and feel. Personalities are better fleshed out. And the story has enough elements that're weird ore creepy you don't get a feeling of drudging along. And the best part is, you no longer wince every time you use your powers becuase it looks like you're blowing your brains out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2008"}

I'm not finished with Jill's story yet, but so far I'm very impressed with how well they converted this game for DS play. The cool thing about it is that it is not just a straight port--they adjusted all kinds of little things to make the game enjoyable on the DS. For instance, Jill's in-game model got a makeover. She doesn't look as blocky and cheesy as she did in the original game. They also added the quick-turn move (something which the original RE did not have) and they made the knife immediately accessible by using the left shoulder button. Other goodies include the addition of puzzle chests which you use the touch-screen to open, and knifing challenges in which you must stop a horde of advancing zombies with only your knife and the touch-screen. Some of the game's puzzles have been replaced or expanded by way of the touch-screen functionality. The shotgun has become an ultra-accurate long-range weapon, probably to make the game easier to play on such a small screen. Your map is always visible now on the upper screen, and even your health is prominently displayed at all times as the background color for the map. The game even comes with a full-color booklet, with artwork of the characters that I've never seen anywhere else.The only negative comment I have to make about Deadly Silence concerns the quality of the audio. Even with the volume on the 3DSXL turned all the way up the game is very difficult to hear, which makes using headphones a must. Also, the quality of the audio is poor. It sounds like the audio files were recorded on somebody's old 1970s tape recorder and then transfered into the game.I would definitely recommend Deadly Silence, even to people who have already played the original game to death. It preserves the original enough so that it still feels like the same game, and at the same time adds just enough new content and functionality to make it a new experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2013"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world.

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXEW","description":"","reviewerName":"Decker","summary":"Where will Ubisoft go from here I wonder,","reviewText":"I've been a fan of Assassin's Creed since the release of the first game. So it's been pretty interesting to see how far the series has come. In the end it's become one of those games that I can only judge on game play alone, and with that it has pretty much delivered. At this point, to be honest, I think only the most diehard fans of the series still care about the overall story. I pretty much lost interest with the third one. Still as disappointing as that game was it hasn't made me toss the series aside as a whole since it had it's moments. Since I got this on the Wii U I can say its not that different from the other versions. Visually its superior to the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions. Game-play wise the only difference I noticed is that the tablet is given map duty which does clear up the UI a bit. You can even play on the tablet which doesn't take away much since it looks really good on it.So from the 13 Colonies we now end up the Golden Age of Pirates. Taking on the role of Connor's grandfather, a Welsh privateer named Edward Kenway. Something I appreciated about this game in particular was Kenway who seems to be a much better character than Connor was. Since this one is based in a time period not to far behind from the third game there are many game-play aspects that are pretty similar. You've got your signature daggers, your pistols, smoke bombs, etc etc what only seems different inventory wise is that he duel wields his swords and a dart gun you get later on. Though despite that the combat feels a lot smoother than it did in the third game. Another thing that is different is architecture. This Golden Age of Pirates has a lot more to offer in regards to climbing and jumping off from than Colonial America did. Everything on land is pretty much a debugged version of the third with a few goodies added in like side missions.Probably the strongest part of the game play though is sea faring. The best part of the third game was brought back and beefed up.  I can't really recall how many hours I spent sailing the Jackdaw (name of Edward's ship) around. All I can say is that it was a lot. As soon as I was given the ability to free roam over the whole map, I completely dropped out of the story all together. Instead I went on to raid British convoys at sea, destroying Spanish forts, obsessively tracking down every bit of treasure I could find, even going out into a rowboat and hunting sharks. Finally I had sunken every legendary ship, destroyed every fort, treasury was overflowing, and had nearly driven the large sea fauna to extinction that I begrudgingly went back to the main story.Then thats where it kind of fell off. If there is one thing that really bugged me about the main story game-play it was the &#34;tailing missions&#34;. These bits of game-play have been in the series since the first game but it seems as though Ubisoft has done little to improve them. In fact it feels as though they have gotten worse. Step out of the circle you lose, get seen by a single guard you lose. Also as stated earlier the main storyline (aside from Edward's) is just not very interesting. Especially when we see Edward slowly turn into another dogmatic assassin. It got the point where I only did main missions to unlock new toys to play with and as soon as I got them I'd disappear into the ocean again. Though like in the third you are interrupted by the world outside the animus though it's no where near as annoying as the Desmond missions.Overall the game was very fun. You can sink a lot of hours into the side missions and mini games alone without having to go back to the main story which while better than the thirds still leaves a lot to be desired. If you want to play a nice open world game that you can invest quite a bit of time into, this is one you can sink your teeth into. The naval game-play is awesome and I was happy to see this brought back. In the end I'd recommend it.The Good-Game-play, there is a lot you can do and battles at sea are very fun and entertaining-A lot of room for customization regard weapons, your ship, and other things-Visuals, graphics are great from the very lifelike port cities to the open sea-Runs great on the Wii U, and the tablet goes pretty well with itThe Bad-While Edward's story is pretty fun, the main story overall is kind of bland and (personally) I lost interest in it a long time ago","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2014"}

This whole steam cloud nonsense is driving me nuts.  I have started leveling up a new toon and find now if I play longer than a few hours the game will crash.  The reason is that it has to upload your game data to the steam 'cloud'.  The other problem is steam loves to send advertisements and other pop ups to my machine so I buy more of their stuff.  I have an older machine and this totally freezes up my system.  I have gotten used to the steam DRM, however when it negatively impacts an otherwise outstanding game, it should affect the overall rating.  Still very solid, but steam is getting to become more and more of a detractor as the months go by.I wrote a three star for this and was having problems with steam and crashes, then more problems with steam and detracted it to one star.  I have been playing SWTOR and decided I didn't really care for that very much and ended up giving this game another shot.  After playing it now for a week or so, I decided I hadn't really given it a fare shake.Steam:  The game requires it.  If you are like I was (first game I have had that used this system) and have never used it, then it boils down to you needing an internet connection to play the game.  Its not an MMO, but to keep piracy in check you have to log in through steam to access your game.  There is an offline version, that I played a few days when my internet was down, however I don't know if you can do this for extended periods.  At first, I didn't mind the system but there was a major flaw in that it seemed to take upwards of 30 minutes on some days to 'log in' and actually play the game.  Then they added a patch and I couldn't log in at all for about 3 days until I found a solution online and was able to get steam to launch so I could play.  Needless to say I was kinda pissed and stopped playing after that (about the time SWTOR came out) but have now been playing it through Xmas and the issues seem to have gone away.  I haven't had one log in that took longer than a minute since I started back up.Stability:  The game would crash about every hour or so when I first tried it, but after a few patches seems much more stable.  I think I have had only one or maybe two in the last 30-40 hours of playtime which is a substantial improvement.Now, on to the GAME:For those who have never played an Elder Scrolls - what is so great about this series?  Its one of the first to make a fully 'open' world.  You can go where you want, pretty much do whatever you want, and become whatever character you want.  Pretty much the same concept as Fallout 3 and the same general principles in the Elderscrolls since back in the Daggerfall days.  And, as the graphical and computing capabilities have improved, Bethesda has not only made the game world look better, but have improved the gameplay as well.Each of these games takes a country to focus on in the vast imperial empire - morrowind was the dark elf homeland, Oblivion used the imperial homeland, and skyrim is the homeland of the nords.  (I think Daggerfall used a couple of countries - its map seemed to encompass more than one if I remember right)  Each of these races (dark elves, imperials, nords) are among a long list of other races that you can choose to play in the game.  Each race has a bonus to picking it (a trait and some skill bonuses) and a special ability.  Some races, like high elves, are naturally more adept at magic so get extra mana to start with and their special ability lets them regen mana faster for a short time.  Others are more melee centric (orcs and redguards for example) while others are more roguish (wild elves and khajit - a cat like race).So you pick a race and start the game.  You get a rather short quest at the beginning of the game (thankfully) where you escape from a village after a dragon attack.  After that - well its pretty much up to you.  You can follow a nord character that you escaped with to a local village and start the main questline or you can just head out over the hill and see what you run into.  The really cool thing I found about Skyrim is that you don't start out deciding if you want to be a mage, or a warrior, or whatever (like you had to do in Oblivion and its predecessors).  All your skills start at the same general level.  Now lets say you picked a high elf because you thought they looked cool and you thought you wanted to be a mage.  Great - many of your casting skills will get a slight bonus to start and you get the aforementioned abilities.  But as you play, you decided swinging that two handed hammer is one heck of a good time and you would rather focus on that.  The beauty of it the latest class system on skyrim is that you can.  There are no classes when you pick your race so you pretty much build your class as you go.  As you use your two handed weapon, you gain periodic skill increases to your two handed weapons skill (it goes from a start as low as 15 up to a max of 100).  If you gain enough of these, you gain a level.  With each level, you get a perk.  Each area you gain experience in has a perk tree that has perks you can access as you gain more skill in that area.  In your two handed skill, you may have gained enough experience for one of the entry perks - a simple increase in damage to your two handed weapons use, or less stamina use for power attacks.  Later on you can specialize in hammers, two handed swords or axes.  After that you can get sweeps that hit all targets in front of you or critical charges that allow you to sprint to an enemy and hit them with a devastating attack.  You will gain experience in whatever you use, so if you use that two handed hammer with heavy armor and restoration magic (to heal yourself), by level 15 or so you will be 30-40 skill points up in those areas and have access to the corresponding perks in those skill trees.  Another cool thing is that there are roughly 250 perks for all skill areas and you will only get a max of about 80 perk points to spend (after you get each skill to 100 - max level - you will be roughly level 81) so you really have to think about spending those perk points.  You spend alot of time plotting out your character as they level up.Another beauty of skyrim is, well, skyrim.  The place is gorgeous.  As many people have complained about its not gorgeous in the zoomed in detail.  Your character will look great from a bit of a distance, but up close the items are kind of bland.  The terrain is the same - zoomed in its nothing special - but in the wide angle expanse, its very cool.  You can go pretty much wherever you want.  Want to climb that big mountain over in the distance?  Great - you can, if you can find a way up it.  Once up top you can look around the surrounding valley and see all the rivers and lakes and woods there is to see.  Its the first game I have played that really puts what is on the map in your game box in the screen in front of you (oblivion tried, but you lost alot of detail in the distance).  Its also really cool to look out over a vista and see that cool looking castle down in the valley and decide you want to go check it out.  There is a compass on your screen that also shows icons for types of structures off in the distance.  On the way to the castle you will see numerous other areas to explore in every direction.  The place is huge, and all the castles/ruins/villages/caves/etc. are very well done.  One of the problems I had with Oblivion was that after awhile all the caves seemed to use similar models. (another cave of this model with trolls, etc.)  This game will have places that surprise you even after 100 hours of playing it.Well, what about the quests?  As with other installments, you can join factions that give you quests to accomplish tasks that will generally result in you running that faction at the end.  This is on top of the main questline and of the four I have played through have been overall very pleased.  You can opt to join the dark brotherhood and get assigned hits to take people out, join the thieves guild and rob people, join the mage college, etc.  Each faction has a series of quests that follow a story arc for that faction.  The factions also offer other perks, such as strongholds you can upgrade, armor, weapons, mounts, etc.  Again, overall very well done.  My main guy is a mage/assassin hybrid and have completed the theif/assassin/mage/and companion (the fighters guild in Skyrim) questlines.  The bottom line was I had a blast playing through them - they keep you focused (one more quest to find out what happens, ah crap its 2 am ack!)You can also do daedric quests to get artifacts (very nice weapons/armor and enhancement items), become a vampire or werewolf if thats your thing, and craft your own weapons and armor and put a large variety of enchantments on them.  One downside is you cannot make your own spells on this installment (the previous titles had a robust spellcrafting mechanism) but the longer I think about it I am kind of glad they got rid of it.  The reason is that in the previous game (oblivion) you could make spells and enchantments that could kill pretty much any monster/character in about 2 or 3 hits and make the later portion of the game rather easy and dull.  By not allowing that option they have kept a relative level of challenge in the game.  Another neat aspect of the game is the world is alive - people get up and go to work, they ramble on about this or that, the town drunk wants more booze, the layabout thinks hes accused of something, etc.  Kids are present and run around doing things.  The towns are well done and it feels like a living game world.  They also comment on your character - for instance you can get a mace from one of the deadric quests that is from the daedric lord of domination and people will cower away from you as you walk by and say \"That mace! Get it away! Get it away!\".  If you are good in sneaking or speechcraft or whatever people will comment on how sneaky you look, etc.  There are also some pretty cool things they added as you progress from your factions - for instance with the stronghold for the dark brotherhood you can get a torture chamber upgrade.  So, go check it out and there is this old lady chained to the wall in a pool of blood.  She looks up at me balefully \".. why are you people doing this to me??? ...\"  Eh... I don't really know old lady... but its kinda neat they added it.One last really neat thing is that you can complete the quests however you see fit.  If you have to get over a bridge, kill a few fighters on the far side, assault a tower, and kill the boss on the top, you can do it any number of ways.  The hammer wielding high elf would assault through quickly and try to take out the enemies quickly and efficiently.  My assassin will sneak around to the flank - trying to gain some height on the rocks off to the left - and while using his bow and invisibility spells pop arrows in the foreheads of the outside enemies and then sneak through the tower and slice the throats (there is a cool cutscene if you pull one of these off) of the guys in the tower up to the boss.  The game meets your playstyle, you are not restricted in some cooridorish pre-configured method to resolve how you accomplish things.What are the downsides?- AI of your companions (you can hire people or get some from quests, etc.) is pretty poor.  I got to the point where I pretty much go solo anymore.- Enemy AI is kind of shoddy at times.  One is (kind of funny really) the stealth related AI.  You plunk an arrow into an enemy's head and if it doesn't kill him he will stand up and ask \"What was that?  Is someone there???\"  Hmmm... I don't know mr. holycrapthisguyisstupid, maybe that arrow shaft that is protruding from your forehead would give you a clue??  Now hold still while I put this dagger in your ear...- There is clipping and the odd flying mammoth and bugs at times, but hey, so far they haven't really been gamebreakers.Overall I think this is the best installment yet.  Many people seem to like Oblivion better - personally I have not had the sustained 'oh wow look at that' with Oblivion that I have had with this title.  I have much left yet to explore on the map and bottom line - still having a ton of fun.  Now that they seem to have resolved some of the initial issues I had with the game, I will give it four (really 4.5) stars.  I can't see giving it a perfect - its not - but still very, very enjoyable and very highly recommended.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}

Then some diminished reviews came around and I was already feeling a let down.  Where could they go wrong?  Was my thoughts.  Well that didn't stop me from purchasing this game.  After 30 minutes I was blown away.  All skepticism was gone and I was in Gamer Heaven.Let me start off from the beginning.  Yes there is a plot twist and it's pretty bizarre.  Just think that your watching a Michael Crichton movie and it will make sense.  Playing in the Middle East several hundred years ago is a different idea.  It's hard to say what you could expect with this concept.So what makes this game amazing.  Lets start off with the landscape.  It's brilliant and beautiful...Really majestic.  You don't understand the scope of this game until you start playing.  The world is surrounded by several small villages and three large cities.  The only way to travese this open terrain with a horse.  Fortunately they are about as easy to find as a car in todays society.What also sets this game apart is the ability to do what you want when you want.  There is no clock on you and your not stuck going into a mission.  Everything is open based.  The character is amazingly fun to control you can scale tall buildings and make amazing leaps of faith.  Climbing up a building that is several stories and then leaping to certain doom is breathtaking excitement.  This is what games should be about.Beyond that is a mission based game.  Similiar to Grand Theft Auto in style.  You can accept simple missions like pickpocketing and protecting citizens to the more main based assasin missions.  You can battle soldiers if you want as you have many enemies but it's not really advised.  Following the assasin missions can be complex and involve several steps that make the story very intresting.  Obviously a lot of time was put into making this top notch.For anyone who likes open based games with large environments then Assassins Creed is for you.  From the majestic peaks to the clustered cities.  This is trully a next gen experience.  The storyline and incentive program will keep you playing for many hours.  Definately a worthwhile gameplay experience.  If you want something to keep you busy that doesn't involve guns go out and get Assasins Creed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2007"}

Theisen","summary":"Far from perfect, but still a fantastic experience","reviewText":"The game case makes a bold claim that GT5 is a \"revolution in racing\". Let's not go quite that far. The game does offer oodles of gameplay features and options, and despite some curious features and omissions you'll find in the game's home interface, this is a solid title that can offer nearly infinite replay value with all it brings to the table. Almost all disciplines of racing are covered in some way, giving a good \"something for everyone\" appeal.A lot has been confused about what GT5 is and isn't. It is what it says it is, \"the real driving simulator\". That is to say you get into real-world cars and drive them in a more sporty atmosphere. Some tracks are perfect recreations, some are fictitious, and some of them impressively created by the game on the fly via a slick course creator. The over 1000 cars range from the family minivan all the way up to Ferraris, LeMans cars, etc. The game does an outstanding job of making even the more mundane cars fun. For example, there's an early event featuring exclusively the Toyota Yaris. Not exactly a sports car, but they are quite nimble and a hoot to flog around.It is not, however, like a Need For Speed or Burnout game. Driving each track requires some (or a lot of) precision and vehicle control, and this isn't a game where you're meant to just get in a fast car and fly around doing fancy spins and slides. You'll need to pass some license tests and stack up enough money before going in that direction. Thankfully, the difficulty level starts quite low and does offer enough cushioning to a new player.There are some oddities and things that make the game feel somewhat incomplete. A point of contention is the system of \"premium\" versus \"standard\" cars (split about 200-800), where only those on the Premium list have detailed in-car views and more realistic visual damage. Strangely, the standard cars cannot be visually changed, such as with new wheels or aerodynamic kits. Despite this feeling incomplete and a bit disappointing, the 800 not-as-blessed cars are still drivable in the same enjoyable manner and few players will ever notice the gap.In fairness, there are some features I am unable to report on-- I have no ability to use its full 3D mode (requiring a 3D HDTV, etc), nor did I have data from Gran Turismo for the PSP to transfer in. I'm also not a big user of online features so I can't report much on the online community features, of which there are tons.Bottom line? It might seem empty in a few areas of customization and stripped of more gameplay in others, but its still worthy of very high praise on the whole.

Instead I believed I was reading a novel. And a pretty great one.Love to see how the whole action of the game is set inside the Hotel. For each chapter which concerns a certain time period, you have to deal with the residents of the hotel and uncover both their mysteries and secrets. To do that, you use clues and a great deal of interrogating, though the questions you ask them can have important consequences, meaning that a wrong question or answer can give you a game over.Fortunately, you have a notebook in which you can save your game. You can also write down, clues, details, and things that you need to do. The re is also a jukebox in the bar, with which you can listen to the game's soundtrack for free. SO if you are the kind of player who loves playing his music while working or studying, I suggest you make a separate save game wherever you are in this room. However there will be certain tracks that will only be available in your second playthrough as they will be in the final chapter.Speaking of final chapter, I also want to say that if you do the game and certain actions, then there will be a special character at the end, whose face will be entirely revealed. Though I will not say who it is to make sure that I do not spoil you the story with my review.I also heard there is a sequel coming out in Japan. Though it is only the main character who will be there and a story not involved with Hotel Dusk. Just like James Bond in his movies.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2010"}

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"A Gamer at Heart","summary":"A Breath of Fresh Air","reviewText":"First, a quick bit of background. I play primarily FPS games. I occasionally dabble in RPG's. I loved Oblivion. I loved Skyrim. But most of my gaming time is spent on FPS games. As anyone who plays FPS games can tell you, that genre is stale.  Every major FPS game is a sequel, and aside from some minor variations, you realize in about 30 minutes that most FPS games are almost exact clones of all FPS games that preceded it. So, I look to RPG's for some variety.Witcher 2 is indeed an RPG, but even within the world of RPG's, it is unique. The Witcher series are based on books written by a polish author. The games are steeped in the mythology of the books, and Witcher 2 simply thrusts you into this world with little explanation.  No baby steps here. You learn from context that your character is a Witcher, which is a supernatural being that folks hire to slay monsters.  The world of the Witcher 2 is vast, detailed, and filled with competing factions with a long history of distrust and racism. Humans detest non-humans (elves and dwarfs). Elves have been subjected to pogroms and massacres, and live in the woods as rebels. The Witcher's world is divided amongst competing kingdoms, and the kings wage wars based on petty differences.  This is a detailed, rich world filled with interesting characters.Witcher 2 was originally released in 2011 as a PC only game. It was released again in 2012 as the Witcher 2 Enhanced Edition on the Xbox 360. The Enhanced Edition added hours of new content, an improved tutorial system, and included some previously released downloadable content. The game starts with the most amazing CGI cutscene I have ever seen. It is so amazing you will wonder why they don't make whole movies with this technology.  The scene is important because it kick starts the story of Witcher 2 but isn't really placed into context for a while.  (Mild Spoiler alert: the cutscene shows the assassination of King Demavand, which starts the story. End of Spoiler.)The story of the Witcher 2 is complex. And violent.  Innocents are slaughtered by their enemies. There is CGI nudity. There are sexual acts that make Mass Effect look like a Disney movie.  This game plays like an R rated movie.  The voice acting is flawless.  The main character's voice is perfect and well done. You don't hear the same annoying lines from NPC's over and over again like you do some other games. (Hello, Skyrim!)  The combat has a learning curve. You fight with a sword, in conjunction with powers (which the game calls \"signs\"). The fighting is real time, and involves a combination of timing your attacks and parries with evasive movements. It looks weird if you watch gameplay movies, but makes perfect sense when you are the one executing the moves. I found the combat quite gratifying and enjoyable. But it has a learning curve. It starts hard but gets easier.The story places the combat in context and gives it meaning.  You level up and develop your character, investing skill points in swordsmanship, powers (signs), or alchemy.  There are different endings, and about 1/3rd of the way through the game, you must pick a path that plays out independently of the path you didn't choose.  The ending I reached explained every loose thread of the complex story. I was very impressed with how much effort and detail went into every facet of this game, from the gameplay and graphics to the story and the story's resolution. You can really tell this game was a labor of love for the developers.  I plan to go back now and play the other path. Two games in one?  Bargain!If you would like to play an original game that isn't a rehash of all games that came before it, consider Witcher 2. I did, and came away impressed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2012"}

Honestly the only racing game I've played and truly enjoyed as of late has been Mario Kart Wii, which is a blast by the way. I've purchased Split/Second after hearing the premise of the game, I thought it sounded really interesting and very unique. Looking back I'm very happy I took a chance on this title, I wasn't let down at all and have been really enjoying it.Once you play this game and understand what it's trying to do you will come to the conclusion as I have that the \"cons\" are what makes this game different than most other racing game out there. \"Rubber banding\" is necessary to play the game as it was intended to be played. Consider this, if you were able to break out in first place and never have to look back it takes away from some of the main points of this game which is to cause destruction and to trigger traps on your opponets. Besides, if you can't pass the car in front of you do the next best thing, which is to drop a plane on him! Also, a lot of people complain about \"drifting\", which I must agree there is a lot of, however there are many other ways to fill up your power meter like \"drafting\" which in my opinion is the easier way to play. My final point is in regard to the lack of customization as far as the cars are concerned, again this is not what this game is about so if that is what you're looking for invest in a different title. This game is not about the cars (as strange as that is to say) it's about the havoc you can cause and to what extent you can cause it.I hope my review has been helpful to you and thanks for reading, sorry for being long winded LOL.

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both? The choice is yours ininfamous.caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Everyman turned superhero Cole.View larger.Devastating electricity-based powers.View larger.Go anywhere open-world design.View larger.An organic urban environment.View larger.StoryEmpire City was a run of the mill metropolis, until one day a massive explosion rips through six square blocks of its bustling downtown real-estate, seemingly leveling everything and everyone in its path. Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

At the lower price there is no excuse not to. This game has a great story that never ceases to amaze. It does start out slow, but makes up for that slow start with an engrossing second half filled with more twists than a Saw movie. The campign really keeps you playing as you gain XP to unlock new powers. The side missions are boring and really aren't vital to beating the game so stay away. The game has some glitches in it though like falling through the ground. This is rare and doesn't affect the game too much. A great start to this \"shocking\" franchise.Presentation: This game uses comic book type cutscenes that really help aide to the feel of controlling a superhero. The great score also adds to the feel during those tense in-game battles and cutscenes. 4.5/5Graphics: The graphics have a gloomy feel that was intentional. The developers were trying to capture the feel of a comic strip, and did it quite well. Cole looks great throughout the game, and the lightning effects are very well done. 4/5Story/Campaign: The story does leave the line a little slowly, but that doesn't mean it keeps that pace as it pushes past the red line when you hit the midway point. It really hits a nice stride and you are left mouth open just shocked as the story unfolds. Zeke is the only soft spot in the cast of characters as he is annoying throughout. The campaign itself has alot of variety in it's goals and in it's structure. It's also a 10 hour campaign without doing the side missions. Please unless your playing for trophies, don't do the side missions. 4.5/5Gameplay: The game is a typical 3rd person shooter. The powers are easy to use and are very effective. The XP accumulates and you unlock and upgrade your powers. Your health is regenerated either by not getting hit or by absorbing electricity. The cover system should get an overhaul before the sequel is released. You can't really cover behind anything except for cars and small barriers. It should have a cover system more like Uncharted. Also Cole's sticky fingers are a problem. There are many times where I want to drop to street level, but he latches onto a ledge. There should be a button you hold to turn his sticky fingers off. 4/5Fun Factor: This game lasts for 10 hours and never stops being fun, aquiring powers is addictive. 5/5Replay Factor: The campaign is 10 hours in length, but you have to play it twice in order to see both endings and aquire both sets of powers. 5/5The Verdict: This game finally gave the superhero genre the love that it deserves. It has it's flaws in game play, but the flaws are overshadowed by it's story. With the reputation that Sony exclusives have at outdoing themselves in sequals, I can't wait for Infamous 2.

I really can't deem it as good as Link to the Past yet, but I will when I finally finish it. But just know, I think link to the past might be my favorite Zelda of all time. Right next to Ocarina and the original LOZ. If you like the top down games in the Zelda universe, this is what Zelda is all about. Spirit Tracks was a bit of a let down and this one is their &#34;sorry letter to you&#34;.  This game pays a homage to classic Zelda. Anyone who played Link to the Past will recognize the music, the combat techniques and the awesome story. The 3DS touch screen is perfect for navigation and working through our items in a jiffy. It makes Link to the Past seem second rate from that standpoint. The 3D works and looks pretty good. I'm not a big fan of 3D, but if you like it, you'll like the 3D effects this game has. I personally play it with the 3D off. The graphics are colorful, bright and spriteful! Is that a word? lol. I think it's much prettier than Link to the Past. Mind you, that game came out in 92. (I think). And the enemies are more plentiful and more creative too. But you'll see some classic enemies make their triumpahnt return. The soundtrack is fantastic. Lots of new music and lots of the original soundtrack has returned but remixed in 3DS glory. Im actually amazed how good music can sound on the 3DS when it's really pushed. Nintendo went all out on everything here.The gameplay is rock solid. The control stick works nearly perfect for the precision that you'll need walking around walking narrow platforms and deadly dungeons. The puzzles are tough, but nothing too tough for most Zelda guys out there. If you get stuck, you can hints along the way if you get into a jam. Kinda like letting you look into the near future on what you need to do next. The dungeons are plentiful and filled with life. I'm a bit disappointed that the maps automatically point you out to the maps automatically in the game instead of letting you find them yourself. One of the few flaws this game has. IF that could be turned on in a patch, I think that'd be better for people who like to search every nook and locale the game has to offer.Old school, new school, it's a grand game for all and IMO, it would be a good enough reason to get a new 3DS for someone.

Del Mastro","summary":"Fail !!!","reviewText":"This is a fail bigger than Hitler's march to Moscow during the winter. As i said for YEARS that the company that made Fallout series (pass 3 and New Vegas) should never be trusted to make a game that doesnt have major issues. As i warned before when this pile of garbage came out that it was going to fail because of the company's past record with it's games. And when it did i knew that the companies \"damage control\" teams was on the internet as fast as possible to keep the sales damage low and post false reviews that it was a great game. One day after i bought the game new , it wouldnt even play , after loading it in , i never got off the wagon to start , i even let it run for a hour and nothing happen. I returned the game that day and informed the sales guy that it didnt work, he loaded onto his system and it did the same to him. He said to save it for the patches, the patches failed and he wont return the game at it's price , so im stuck with a game that doesnt work and get's less than 5 dollar credit instore for a game i paided almost 50 for no more than a month later. How this company stayed afloated so long is amasing , unless there backed by Bill Gates bank account. How this game won all these awards can summon in one word \"money\". Even xbox and pc people have complained. You can believe me when i say , i will never buy another game from this company , not even it was in the bargan bin or giving to me. If i can give it a - 1,000 stars if possible.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}

Though there were segments of the first two discs that I found tedious, I have never played a JRPG that didn't have boring grind sessions in the first 2/3s. If you ignore the \"Final Fantasy\" branding, and hence stop comparing it to other titles in the series, this is an excellent game. When you hit the last disc, the game really blossoms into something incredible: amazing graphics, decent monster variety, a large world to explore, a deep item and weapon upgrading system, and 56 missions that will test your tactics and quick thinking. While it may not have been one of the best games I've ever played, it was certainly one of the most enjoyable. Easily the best Square/Enix RPG on the Xbox.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-11-2010"}

Rage was a great game and if you purchased all the downloadable content you could really have a great time playing Rage.  The weapons were awesome.  Best of all you could save your progress whenever you wanted so their was little of the being thrown way way back to the last distant autosave that is the case in games like Borderlands and Borderlands 2.Rage has you basically running errands for all sorts of folk.  The missions were mostly all fun if repetitive.  Ammo was plentiful on easy \\ casual gamer mode.  Other than the racing Rage was a video game you could come home to after a hard day at the office and just sit back and kill stuff.  Rage was not a bad game and had the Rage developers spent a little more time improving the drivability of game vehicles in relation to gaming areas it would have been perfect.  If Rage had Borderlands driving mechanics it would have been an awesome game.Also the Rage game space seemed too small.  The open world feel of Rage is hurt by strict compartmentalization of the game in certain chapters that can not eaily be revisited if at all.  The one thing Rage has going for it is a good story for the most part.  The Rage story and its characters was interesting.  the weapons management system was clunky but effective. Again had the developers not rushed Rage to market and spent time improving gun and resource management the game would have been first rate.The thing that most hurts Rage is that the end is not particularly satisfying.  I do not want to spoil the Rage ending what little their is of it for those who have never played Rage.  Rage is generally a fun game to play.  I paid near full price for my first copy of Rage and I still do not feel ill used.  I brought additional copies of Rage since the BIG price drops just so I always have copies.  Rage was not a bad game.  The Rage World looks a lot like an upscale if smaller and compartmentalized version of Borderlands which is not a bad thing at all.  Some of the dialogue is good but no where near as good as Borderlands or Borderlands 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I096AA","description":"","reviewerName":"DryvBy","summary":"Incredible device for people with good eyes","reviewText":"Let's face it: 3D isn't for everybody. There's people with the lazy eye this will not work for. There's people that are partially blind. This unit will not work for everyone as a portable 3D device. But regardless, this unit is pretty powerful, and seeing Super Street Fighter IV 3D in motion at 60fps is proof.Out of the box, I had probably a minute of eye adjustment, then I was fine. The tutorial at the beginning is quickly over, and you're in the menu. I spent more time messing around with the menu than I did in an actual game so far. There's a lot of junk to do! There's a music player with interactive retro game visualizers. There's the Mii creator, which now allows you to have a full beard (was this in the Wii?). The AR cards, camera, etc..The 3D camera is good for the small screen your on and doesn't look half bad, until you take the camera out of 3D mode. It's a horrible little 0.3mp camera, but still, it takes 3D pictures that work. I spent a while trying to trick the camera into thinking objects were in front of other items by using different angles and such. No such luck. It just works. Which just makes me shake my head and shrug, because I have no idea how technology works anymore. Even after looking up how it works, I'm just going to Homer Simpson this and go \"I dunno..\".Speaking of the camera and things I don't understand, there's a pack of cards that come with the 3DS that allow you to do goofy things in 3D or import Nintendo characters into you picture using \"Augmented Reality\". Whatever. It looks cool, it's fun as crap to do, but it just makes 0 sense to me how this stuff really works. Please, don't explain it. The fact that I don't know makes the tech even more magical.The friend's list is a lot more internet friendly than the Wii, but not by much. Instead of needing a friend code for each and every game like on the Wii, the 3DS has a single code that allows you to add a friend and then you can play with them. It manages to be a step behind still, but I'd rather deal with one forgetable code than several. Why I can't just tell my friends to add me with my usual gamer ID is... dumb.For those wondering, there's no Pictochat. I came from a DS phat, and that was one feature I actually kind of wanted. But I guess we can't have everything we want. There's also no alarm clock, which is weird. The rude bird in the tutorials would have been nice to wake up to. But with firmware updates and the game/app store coming in May, we might see some of this stuff return.I haven't used Street Pass. My out of work neighbors, or the guy upstairs who beats his girlfriend daily, hasn't bought or stolen one yet. I'll update the review when I find someone who has a 3DS to street share with.DS games, from what I've heard, look horrible on this thing. From personal experience, at least with Pokemon Black, it looks fine. There's nothing horrible on it, but I never experienced it on the DSi or anything else. If you're not truly picky, I'm sure it will look just fine. Or at least Pokemon does.Battery life is pretty crappy. The realistic battery life is around 3 hours with 3D on and wi-fi. Adjusting the brightness does help, along with turning off all of the other 3DS features, but right now, it's the worst part of the system. However, with all the options to keep it powered in, it won't be a big problem for me. I have a PSP that I actually play a lot (thanks to PixelJunk Monsters Deluxe), and by a lot, I mean while I'm on a road trip. But even then, I have it plugged in. I can't imagine me being any different with this thing. I get tired of using handhelds within a couple of hours, so I probably won't run into the battery issue too often.The biggest negative that I've seen right now (aside from battery life) is the game lists for early adopters. There's literally nothing that's going to blow you away. I mentioned SSFIV3D, which is probably going to be the only game that will be remembered out of the bunch. Nintendo probably should have thought about putting a Mario Kart or something out to keep us Nintendo freaks happy. I'm also hoping that the Virtual Console system isn't a rip off like I feel some of the Wii VC titles are. It's a shame when I can get a physical copy of Super Mario Bros. for around a buck, but I have to spend $5 on a VC copy. But when the VC comes out, everyone must buy Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening. It's the ultimate Zelda title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0056WJA6M","description":"","reviewerName":"Chance Briggs","summary":"Zelda by way of '90s Image comics","reviewText":"In Darksiders 2, you take the role of Death, who bears a striking resemblance to Skeletor. Here, Death tries to resurrect mankind after the events of the previous Darksiders. Instead of simply repeating the structure of the original Darksiders, it appears the creators of Darksiders 2 made an attempt to veer away from the Zelda format into a  slightly more RPG and dungeon-crawler-eque direction meaning that each enemy drops loot and random clothing items for your character to pick up and equip. However, the problem with this type of item gathering is that the game needs to have a system that clearly, and unambigously notifies the user whether the newly aquired armor/weapon/relic is objectively better than the one's already equipped. For example, each weapon and piece of armor has stats like strength, critical chance, critical damage, elemental damage, etc. But for the purposes of the game it is difficult to tell if high strength is as important as high damage, or whether critical damage is as important as arcane points or thorns.In terms of story structure, rather than just basically being Zelda, Darksiders 2 is basically just a bunch of Zelda dungeons broken up initially by horsing around the landscape and then fast-traveling. However, for all those who value for money this game is a very long game. I beat the game after about 25 hours, including several of the side-quests but it felt waaaay longer than that. Mostly because it has an incredibly tedious game plot where you have exactly one goal that never really changes, but instead puts a bunch barriers consisting of fetch quests every step along the way that requires you to gather three of something from the local dungeon. For some reason it's always three of something. In fact, often you'll be asked to gather three of something while already searching for three of something that you are already looking for. Talk about repetitive. I'm not going to get into the actual plot of the game, as it was seemingly taken from old issues of '90's era Image comics. (Spawn in particular).In terms of gameplay, I think the controller set-up requires you to hold down too many buttons, and the camera needs a lot of improvement. Additionally, the quick select system wasn't particularly quick nor did it help me select. Too often I would accidentally select reaper mode intending to select something else. Finally, for a game that requires a lot of platforming, the controls simply are not responsive enough, especially in certain sections where you are timed. Too often while holding left or right, the character will simply jump up.Overall, the game was fun and despite my complaints about the overly-padded nature of the game and less than stellar combat camera and controls, I would recommend this game for those who enjoy a lot of puzzle solving and platforming.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2014"}

It's not the number of times DRM requires to \"phone home.\" It's not whether or not less wary consumers can call up now and get new activations NOW. It's about buying a service not a product. Services end when a service provider ends, or chooses to stop offering the service. Products exist until they break or at least until they no-longer serve a function (we have no use for them). EA's breed of DRM is guaranteeing that their games will not live any longer than they do with a promise that is 100% not enforcable.Companies who are about to shut their doors, or are looking at their next big cash flow do not suddenly throw a bunch of resources into developing software to ensure existing consumers, who they already label as a bunch of no-good thieves, can continue to enjoy their games.DRM limitations are not listed in the EULA. They are not listed on the box. There is mice-type about requiring internet to play the game (that's the activation part).I can't tell you how many times I have picked up an old game, which I uninstalled, and reinstalled it because a new release of that game is being developed, hitting shelves soon, and I am excited about it again. Or reinstalled a game because a new expansion pack brought life into it. I build my own computers. I've seen harddrives fail. Motherboards fail. I know at least two people whose computers shorted out due to faulty parts. EA claims that only a small margin of people who installed a pay for play DEMO (and I don't pay for DEMOs either) didn't reinstall their games so therefore the entire gaming community is a bunch of ignorant consumers who won't realize that the pirates are going to get these games before release, DRM free, and have a much more enjoyable experience than the saps that paid for the game and now are being told where, when and how they can play their games.Every single game EA produces with online activations that are required to play (not referring to incentive activations like Stardock), and especially installation limits does not deserve more than a 1 star rating.DRM and gameplay are a packaged deal.

And, like so many people, I had high hopes that the sequel would continue on this legacy. Does it? Well...not really, because Deus Ex: Invisible War barely resembles the original in any form.While DE: IW may be touted as a sequel, it really is not. This time around, the game focuses on choices--the choice to kill or save, the choice to annihilate your enemies now, rather than later. Deus Ex incorporated these elements to an extent, but DE: IW allows the player much more freedom of choice. There are still specific objectives you must complete to herd the \"story\" (more on that later) along, but the numerous side missions are a big plus. And, just as in the original, there is always more than one way to beat a mission. Unfortunately, this still means that one of those options is crawling through the convenient ventilation shafts that lead right into the top secret facilities. Still, the freedom to play the game as you want to play it (stealth, kill everyone, etc.) is still there.So far so good, right? Well...all is not well in the land of DE: IW. First and foremost, what absolutely (almost) killed the game for me was the atmosphere. More precisely, the lack of atmosphere. You see, in the original DE, the game was dark, and gloomy, and you played as JC Denton, the ultimate secret agent. You were a badass. In DE: IW you play as Alex, an apparent boy-band reject and all around pansy. The game's objects are out of scale (the \"remake\" of the UNATCO building from DE is a prime example), and everything just looks too light and just doesn't have the grungy, devoid of hope feel of the original.To make matters worse, the much hyped physics system is a sham. If you bump into a bench, it moves about 3 or 4 feet, and bounces around as if it was hit by a truck. Everything in the game world is apparently \"mass-less,\" as you can throw a body a good 15 feet. (By the way the \"rag-doll physics\" are quite poor; the death animations and subsequent way the bodies lay on the ground is quite hilarious). There are few cool moments in that the physics engine provides, but overall, the physics in DE were more realistic.Another highly hyped part of DE: IW is the graphics engine. The game looks pretty good, and the lighting looks nice, albeit fake (and is the cause of the aforementioned atmosphere problem, so I can't really complain. The game runs fine on my machine, with all the specs cranked down. For the record, I have a Dell 4600 PC, w/ a 2.4 GHZ P4, NVIDIA Ti4600 Graphics card, and 512 MB ram. I also ran the game (played 3/4 of the way through) on a laptop, w/ a Pentium M processor (the game requires a P4) (1.3 GHZ I think), ATI Radeon Mobile 9000, and 256 MB Ram. For my PC, I had to download the latest graphics driver before the game would work, which is understandable. I also snagged the patch, which solves most of the compatibility issues. Without the patch, the game crashes much more frequently, and you can't quick save. I had the game crash about 3-4 times, but nothing too major. On the laptop, however, I was surprised that the game actually ran, as it did not meet specs. I didn't have the latest graphics card driver, or the patch. I had a few graphics problems, but the game ran well enough for me to play it. So to everyone who says the game lags like hell on their 3.4 GHZ P4, w/ 1024 MB ram and a Geforce 5950: stop lying. The game runs plenty fine, even on a PC THAT DOESNT'T MEET REQUIREMENTS and looks nice enough; however, I can't help but wonder that the time (and money) they spent on the graphics and physics could've been spent better elsewhere.Graphics/physics questions aside, the biggest problem with the game is by far the story. Remember the ultra-cool conspiracy laden plot of Deus Ex, with all of its twists and turns? Sorry, none of that stuff here. Oh sure, the Illuminati make an appearance in DE: IW, but there is no conspiracy this time around. There is no huge plot to rule the world, no thread of believability. The story in DE: IW is pure sci-fi trash. Sure, to the regular FPS gamer, who plays UT2004 (a good game in it's own right), DE: IW's story most likely will be amazing. To fans of DE (most of which have probably already played DE: IW), the story just doesn't satisfy. I could stomach all of the other problems in the game, if the story came through. But it doesn't, and that is the most disappointing aspect of DE: IW. The original was all about story--not RPG elements, not customization, not choices--it was about the conspiracy and realizing the world (and you) had been messed with. Sadly, in DE: IW, the closest thing there ever is to a conspiracy (warning: \"spoiler\" ahead) is the fact that the WTO and Order (two warring factions) are both branches of the Illuminati. Further compounding this problem is the fact that the Datacubes you find scattered about are decidedly \"lighter.\" They simply feel out of place, and the messages are neither as philosophically deep as some in DE, or as well written and engaging.As for the rest of the game's problems, the Universal Ammo is the biggest culprit. Who the f*** thought it was a good idea to have one ammo type. Maybe they thought gamers were too dumb to keep track of all the different ammo? Gee, this separate ammo thing is really taxing the brains of players; so let's just make one ammo! That both your stun prod and your rocket launcher uses! And we'll justify it by saying it's some sort of nano-tech stuff! Ugh. The UA causes many problems in terms of gameplay, as you're only allowed to carry 9 clips of it (wtf?!), and you can't tell how much of it is truly left (just a health bar type thing on the side of the screen that goes down every time you fire a shot). This, in turn, can screw you, if you run out. Well, since I ran out of ammo with my pistol, I'll switch over to my \"Bolt-caster\" (read: Tranquillizer Bow). What...they use the same kind of ammo? What the !$@!$? Now I can't get that sweet item over there, since all of the melee weapons in the game suck!The new inventory system is also a huge problem. The original DE had a Diablo style inventory system, where a rocket launcher took up 8 squares, an assault rifle took up 4 squares, a medkit took up 1 square, etc. In DE: IW, you have 12 (upgradeable to 14) slots where you can put anything. This is a big problem--12 rocket launchers take up the same space as 12 pistols do. But, since there is no real need to carry 12 rocket launchers, you're left with a serious space problem. My inventory (up until about the game's end) consisted of: a pistol, a sniper rifle, an SMG, various grenades, medkits, food, bio-cells and multitools. This took up my entire inventory. In the first DE, save for the SMG (called the assault rifle then) and sniper rifle, all those items took up one slot. It is perplexing to me why Ion Storm did this, as it makes little sense (gameplay and justification wise).Another aspect of DE: IW that has seen a serious downgrade from DE is the music. The music in DE was seriously awesome--it felt like a conspiracy was going on. It's hard to explain, but it fit the game perfectly, really getting the player into the game. It leads to some tense moments, and was quite amazing. Now, on to the music in DE: IW. Was there any music, 'cause I can't remember it. Very forgettable--and a downright shame compared to the awesome tunes in DE1. One highlight in DE: IW is the club songs, which are awesome--but, the rest of the music just can't hold a candle to DE.And now, I come to the upgrading your character critique. In the first game, you had skills, which you upgraded with skill points, RPG style. You also had augmentations (9 slots), which gave you powers such as Regeneration, etc. In DE: IW, they have decided to murder the skills system, while giving you only 6 Bio-Mod slots (augmentations) which give you powers such as Regeneration, etc. However, this time around, you don't really choose--only certain ones are useful, and all the others are useless. Also, the fact that skills system was killed leads to the fact that you have to take up a bio-mod slot just to hack computers (which was a skill in DE). It's inexplicable why they would do this, but since they pretty much dumbed down the entire game, I guess it's only fair that they dumb down this too. The weapons mod system this time 'round also sucks, given that the \"mods\" you can use are useless and hardly do anything at all.Judging from my review, it appears that I would think DE: IW is the worst game I've ever come across. Hardly--the game certainly has many highlights. The story, while a mere shadow of DE's, is certainly decent, and the game is engaging The gun-play this time around is pretty fun too, and some of the bio-moods are insanely cool (bot domination in particular). By far the coolest part of the game is the numerous side-quests you can partake in. For instance, while in Seattle, I was sent to kill a lawyer who was \"harassing\" one of Club Vox's customers. So, I went to his apartment, and told his guard (through the intercom) that I was the arms dealer coming to deliver a shipment. I then strolled into his house, and talked to him, choosing the option (when he saw that I wasn't the arms dealer) that the old arms dealer was dead, and that I was a dealer for the new one. I then chose the option, after some more talking, that the new (fabricated) dealer required a good will payment of 200 credits (the game's currency). The lawyer grudgingly obliged, and so our conversation ended. I then shot him and his guard, and went back to Club Vox to gather my reward. That was one of the only times I've said (out loud) \"That's so cool!\" when playing a game.Overall, if you have not played the original Deus Ex, you're in for a real treat, as you have not been spoiled by the first game's brilliance. Ion Storm had a damn near impossible job in crafting a sequel to the masterpiece that is Deus Ex, and they did a decent job. In no way is Deus Ex: Invisible War a terrible game; it just has little to do with its amazing prequel. Ion Storm has taken the series into a completely different direction, one which most fans did not agree with, including me. I loved Deus Ex for the story; DE: IW simply does not have that same allure, the same captivating nature. Although I came away from Invisible War with mixed feelings, I did enjoy myself. I can only hope that Ion Storm will listen to their fans and bring back what made Deus Ex so damn special: the incredible story.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2004"}

I'm not really prone to waxing eloquent over a board game Elder Scrolls: Oblivion and The Witcher, with a little bit of Final Fantasy thrown in, has a dash of originality that goes way beyond the typical RPG.  The basic plot is fairly straightforward.  A hero of your choice is drafted into the Wardens (a group dedicated to stopping the arch demon and it's minions) and, after a stunning battlefield defeat, must rally the warriors of a number of races and regions and on to a spectacular battlefield conrontation that will determine the future of the world.  And you have any number of complex, battle filled quests in the process.  Sounds pretty average so far, neh?Well, hold on.  You have a number of different starting characters to work with and a large band of fellow travelers to recruit and use as you see fit.  But there's nothing shallow about the characters.  Depending on how you behave and how you develop the characters, relationships and personalities can take any number of different variations.  And many parts of the story will change accordingly.  There's constant, often funny byplay among the character, romantic possibilities, and if some characters get really steamed they will simply walk out on you, so you have all the headaches of managing a diverse group, in astonishing detail.The battle system is complex, close to real-time, and includes programmable behavior.  Not all fights require the same tactics or players.  So eventually you have to move away from brute force and take a close look at what's actually happening, adjusting accordingly.  And don't expect to be able to find ultimate weapons either.  The selection is good, and you can actually modify a weapon's behavior, but don't expect miracles.  A good swipe of a monster's claws and you are still ogre meat.The graphics and movement control are good, but the intent isn't to overwhelm with incredible CGI sequences.  There is a good sense of realism. but EA has put it's money into the playability of the game rather than it's watchability.  Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of great graphic work,  but it's treated as a part of the big picture rather than the major selling point.I've played through the game twice, and it has surprised me with its richness both times.  A lot of thought went into making this game a success, and I think you will find it is well worth its cost.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2009"}

The story was good, if a little predictable, but the city of Dunwall is fascinating and I found the \"lore\" interesting enough to make up for it.Direct combat and stealth mechanics are both enjoyable, and it was very satisfying to sit back and think tactically about the best way to accomplish a mission.  The game really does give you a lot of options when it comes to infiltrating places and neutralizing targets, probably better than all but a handful of games this generation.My only real problem with the game, and the one reason I hesitate to call it my personal GOTY, is the morality system.  Since the developers went out of their way to give you so many ways to play (and they'll remind you of this often) it becomes increasingly annoying to be browbeaten into taking a certain path.  Yes, play your way, but then you'll be judged for it.This doesn't hurt the game too much in the long run (and I may be nitpicking), but it's something that I think needs to be addressed in any sequels.

Discover the true origins of Dracula and the Belmont family in this exciting first episode of the saga.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"&quot;Castlevania,&quot; Episode I","reviewText":"&quot;Castlevania&quot; first appeared on the Nintendo entertainment system in the late 1980s, and became successful enough to launch a series across several different platforms that continues to this very day. The latest addition to the beloved saga is &quot;Castlevania: Lament of Innocence,&quot; which marks another attempt to bring the series into the next generation of gaming. Unfortunately, that means the series' trademark side-scrolling action has been removed in favor of an over-the-shoulder third person perspective. If you have experience with \"Devil May Cry\" or \"Rygar,\" then you have some idea how \"Lament of Innocence\" plays. That's not necessarily a bad thing, of course, and in fact it will probably inspire new generations of gamers to take a look at the series, but I can't help but regret the fact that the game's origins as a side-scroller were not celebrated and openly embraced, as they were in Konami's own \"Contra: Shattered Soldier.\" That said, \"Lament of Innocence\" is a good game, even if it's a bit on the shallow side of things.The backstory for \"Lament of Innocence\" takes place before the original game, and casts you as Leon Belmont (ancestor of Simon and all those who came later), a knight who has forsaken his order to rescue his beloved from the clutches of an evil vampire named Walter. \"Lament\" is billed as a prequel, but that implies a deep, involving plot, and there is none of that. At its best, it is mildly diverting, and provides a decent excuse to go traipsing through gothic environments slaying undead beasts. If you've ever wondered just how the Belmont clan came by their signature weapon, the enchanted whip, \"Lament\" will fill you in. Just don't expect anything grand. It's as simple as an old man going \"Here, this might help you.\" In fact, the game contains the single most boring, drawn out opening cinematic I've ever seen. Fortunately, they do get better later (though there aren't many of them per se).Initially, \"Lament\" will probably grip you tightly and demand that you keep playing far into the wee hours. That's because controlling Leon and exploring Walter's castle provides an initial thrill. That thrill soon wanes, though, and is watered down by the game's repetitive, shallow nature. Though the graphics are impressive for a Playstation 2 title, the level design is lacking. You will find Leon passing through dull hallway after dull hallway, and here and there you'll enter a wide room full of enemies you need to kill in order to proceed. At the end of each level, you will face a boss. Repeat this process until you finish the game. It can become rather dull once the initial thrill wears away. It helps that you can tackle each of the game's levels in any order you choose (except for the last), but only so much. Varied gameplay is not this one's strong suit, and if you're expecting a game as deep as \"Symphony of the Night,\" you'll be very disappointed.Controlling Leon is a slick, intuitive process. Your avatar is highly acrobatic (of course) and can string together various attacks with his whip that will smite any deathless or demonic creatures unfortunate enough to be in range of him. As the game progresses, Leon becomes even more adroit, as he learns new moves and fighting techniques that ultimately keep combat from becoming TOO repetitive - but this is undermined by the enemies themselves. They are generally brainless and predictable, and those that pose a challenge usually do so merely because they can stun, paralyze, or otherwise immobilize you, and all you can do is curse in frustration while they beat you to a pulp. Cheap tricks like these are not appreciated. Bosses, in particular, employ these ridiculous methods. Speaking of which, if there's one thing Konami has always done extremely well, it's design interesting, scary, or just plain disturbing end level bosses. \"Lament\" does not represent the company in this area. Sure, some of the bosses are cool, but they are mere shadows in contrast to some of the bosses from earlier games in the series.Despite the rather shallow, repetitive gameplay, something about \"Lament of Innocence\" kept me coming back for more. It's almost unexplainable. In any case, addiction is a sure sign of enjoyment, even if it only comes in short, quick bursts. I also applaud some of the more obvious nods toward the game's forebears. Yes, you still have subweapons and magical abilities powered by large and small red hearts that must be collected by destroying flaming pillars with your whip. You will even recognize some of the game's enemies, who are returning in various guises from previous \"Castlevania\" games. The organ music evokes nostalgic memories of previous entries as well (though some tracks are as irritating as others are beautiful).Ultimately, I enjoyed \"Lament of Innocence,\" but not every moment of it. It's a solid adventure, but by no means a classic.Final Score: C+ (or 4 stars on a curve)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2003"}

You'll be mixing it up doing some platforming in the style of Prince of Persia, some up close and personal combat using your staff, and some shooting elements involving turrets and shooting plasma from your staff. There's also a little bit of strategy involved in keeping your female escort alive. As you can see, having all these different gameplay elements wrapped into one game is going to turn some people off but I personally enjoyed the change up. The problem is, while none of the gameplay was bad, none of it was particularly memorable either. There weren't really any jaw-dropping moments in this game. It puts more emphasis on story than most games do but unfortunately the story stayed pretty simple and predictable. The characters are likable but a bit stereotypical.Enslaved does a lot of things well but didn't do anything really great to set it apart from it's peers. I would say the best thing Enslaved gives you is atmosphere. The environments look great and it does a great job of immersing you into it's post-apocalyptic world of robots.PROS:- Decent story- Immersive Environments- Unusual Mixing of gameplay elements (for some)CONS:- Mediocre gameplay- Unusual Mixing of gameplay elements (for some)BOTTOM LINE: Enslaved is worth a rent but I wouldn't buy it. Was it worth playing? Yes. Will I ever play it again? No.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-20-2011"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, doubters say it would be suicide.

As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races; a more realistic damage system; a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage; a regenerative health system; a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard; and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard. In doing this, the decisions that were made in the first game will affect the events of the second game.

On the other hand, new players coming to the series for the first time inMass Effect 2will start a brand-new character, discover the events of the previous games as they progress and embark on a thrilling stand-alone adventure that does not require the previous game for play.Key FeaturesFuturistic Weapons- Choose from 19 different weapons, including devastating heavy weapons that can end a battle in seconds.Elite Specialists- Recruit up to a dozen of the galaxy's most dangerous operatives to help you in your mission.

And those were from the weak companiesMaps so hard intricate you had to graph them out? Quests that sent you off to find items in unknown parts of the land, taking hours to complete - if you completed it. Locations that needed coordinates to find  Sidequests that gave tide-turning rewards in battle? Missions or items so hard to complete or aquire that it would end your campaign altogether?  *sigh*/Looks to the starsYa, those days are LONG gone.BioWare has done it (again). The ME series differs from RPGs in alot of ways but at the same time also seems to be the way to industry is going: Less details more streamlining of the story and fun.Once you get into the game (esp if you played ME1) it takes off and, for me, didnt seem to stop. It was a downhill ride the whole time (almost: mining).While the game is very linear by BioWare terms, the story they present is steamlined, easy to understand and keeps on moving.I must say that even though my last ME playthough was 2 yrs ago, I could immediately pick up the same missions /scenarios being repainted, maybe repositioned at a different angle but it was definitely a familiar feel to the game witout the feeling of 'this atgain?\"By streamling the game I mean you dont *have* to scour the entire galazy looking for that last ore deposit before facing the last boss. The missions are presented during your travels and each time you board the ship.There's no real 'exploration' per se and missions have a flat reward - meaning whether you cover every square inch of a mission or just run to the end boss killing everything in your way, you'll get the same exp.In short, this isnt a sandboxer - at all. But, like Dragon Age, it has a story to tell and the story is fast, interesting and full of polish.They took out the rover (booo) and instead of driving around on strange planets, fighting their strange lifeforms, they've allowed us to wear the enamel of your desks for 5-10 minutes at a time while staring at a graph for ore deposits (BOOO). Granted my first sytem full of planets, I scanned like a master...OreScanner guy. 4 planets and 20 minutes later...eff that.So, in short: There's more than a hint of repainting in some of scenarios, some of the missions will give you a strong sense of deja vu and the overall campaign is probably 20-25hrs max. But it will be the most fun, most polished and most well put together story - and thats just the way I like it cause while the good ole days were indeed good - I just dont have that kinda time anymore =).edit: One other thing to mention is that with the inclusion of paragon QTE's, it makes the conversations much more dynamic. So much so that I forgot a couple of things that I totally missed: Inventory management and skills. They totally removed inventory altogether you cant even break stuff down anymore (which in itself was a simplified inventory). But because the game moves at such a nice pace, honestly, between looking forward to throwing people out windows or putting one between their eyes if they so much as use the wrong tone with me, I remember somewhere in the back of my brain something was asking about the inventory, then was immediately gone.The game is just plain fun. Well except for the mining.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

The DJ Hero Game is made by Activision, the same game developers who created the Guitar Hero franchise and the new Band Hero.DJ Hero plays very much like its musical brothers, with you having to hit the color coded keys on the turntable at the correct time. However with DJ Hero there's an added sense of difficulty as you will have to use both hands in unison to turn the turntable to simulate scratching and also use your other hand to add sound effects etc.The Multiplayer option is great fun. Connect up a guitar, and then you and a friend can remix and rock out to some of the funkiest songs from artists ranging from Rick James to Gwen Stefani.As far as build quality, the turntable looks toy like but it is pretty tough and would take a lot of break.  It is certainly very responsive and easy to use.Overall, I think DJ Hero is a breath of fresh air to the repetitive-looking music video game scene.

The new characters, the new graphics and a long awaited sequel of Marvel vs. Capcom 2. It was on my list of games to get and while I couldn't get it on initial release, I was foolish to sell my Okami game (that I won at a Smash Brothers tournament) to get enough money to buy this game...and what pissed me off was when I got the game, Crapcom decided to release an updated version 6 months after this game was released meaning when I bought the game THEY ANNOUNCED THEY WERE REMAKING IT. You don't know how angry I was with the announcement especially when Ultimate would have Phoenix Wright and Vergil (probably the only two new characters that I cared about because the Marvel side was crap addiction).But this was probably the game that made me realize that Crapcom has fallen from grace especially when they used the tsunami as an excuse to delay the game and as many people pointed out, Capcom of Japan wasn't even near the tsunami so there was no way they as a company would be affected (but the workers and their families are another thing but we're talking about the company).The worse part was when I got this game, I wouldn't be able to get my money back because this game won't sell for that much with Ultimate that came out and Crapcom basically said \"Unless you buy Ultimate, you're stuck with this junk we're not supporting.\"This is a real shame because I had fun playing this game...but got bored just as easily. The game feels like a beta version with Ultimate being the complete version. The game is not balanced and it feels like the endings at the end of each character chapter was just thrown in at the last minute foreshadowing who would show up in Ultimate. I feel for the Megaman fans who were teased with the poster of Megaman in one of the background stages and then denied access to have him in game to the point that his only \"appearance\" was a palette swap.The worse part was because of Ultimate, there wasn't much you could do with game once you got all the endings and achievements. There weren't that many characters to unlock and there were only two DLC characters (that Crapcom would charge later in Ultimate at the same price instead of putting them in given they were in this one). I really liked playing with Dante, Chun Li and a Morrigan team but when everyone plays broken characters like Magneto or easy to use Wolverine online, there was either no challenge because they were too easy or they would constantly spam online making online play worthless. This game didn't have spectator mode either.So the main reason I'm giving this a 1 is because I feel cheated out of my money and now this game is just sitting in my room never to be played again because it got boring after a month and there's no way to get all my money back. I'll probably try to sell it later for something but it still pisses me off greatly. I give the fun rating a three because I did enjoy playing this game with my friends, but again, this doesn't do much because once they're gone, its back to being bored with it again. If I just waited and bought Ultimate, I probably wouldn't be feeling as agitated as I am now but I won't get Ultimate given I boycotted Crapcom.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature.

Play through on \"Veteran\" for great challenge.","reviewText":"I picked up CoD2 recently at a reduced price and am glad to say that it was an excellent value and loads of fun. My comments are based mostly on the single player campaign. The graphics are very good with high levels of detail, convincing locations, and great character models. The control is solid (The movement of your character feels like it could be a bit faster at times) and the control scheme is well thought out. The environments are wide open, well laid out, and interesting. The enemy AI is good enough to keep things challenging as the difficulty is ramped up, although the fact that they only target you can be amusing and frustrating. The missions are fairly diverse and throw you into many different situations and environments with 3 of the allied forces (Russian, British, and American.) I played through the game on the highest difficulty setting and it was quite challenging. The enemy forces will target you exclusively and your guys don't back you up enough to make it seem like anything other than a one man mission. Some parts in particular were incredibly difficult to get past. If you're looking for an even better value, try finishing the game this way. At regular difficulty, I imagine it would all be over rather quickly.Most importantly, CoD2 immerses you in intense situations very effectively, making it lots of fun to play and worth spending your time with. Highly recommended!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2007"}

This is a definite must play for star wars fanatics though. Anyway, everyone is familiar with the Star Wars: Rogue Squadron series that started on the N64 and followed into the Game cube. Each game was known for its outstanding graphics, movie cut-scenes, and fast action game play in the different types of ships. Rogue Squadron III: Rebel Strike is the 3rd game of the series, and again it still delivers the same action quality gaming we were waiting for. Don't listen to the negative reviews, as this game is the strongest and most challenging of the bunch.The graphics of the game are spectacular and are every bit as good as the previous ones, if not better. From the ground missions on Hoth, to the bike missions in the forest, each level and character detail is well done. As an added bonus there are some great movie clips that come into play in different scenes of the level, usually before and after the mission is over. These videos are all good quality and really help put you into the game. Some people have complained about certain framerate issues, but they are not noticeable, especially in the fast paced sky missions.The audio portion of the game really shines as well...all the Star Wars sounds are here, including movie based voice acting. There really isn't any music to speak of while you are playing the missions, but in menus and selection screens, some Star Wars music and classic Rogue Squadron game music plays. Sound effects are all great here...Tie Fighters exploding, lasers firing, voices coming in on the com-link...everything sounds great, so no problems here.Now we get to the game play...now after the positive graphics and audio reviews, you would think there would be some game play problems as well. On the contrary, the game play is just as good as the others, but there are some problems...lets take a look inside. Levels are still mission based as always, and if you are defeated a number of times, or fail the mission, you lose. Now along with the classic sky based missions, there are now the addition of land based missions. If you have played the demo of Hoth, you probably know already. With that, there are 2 different campaigns...one following Luke, and the other following his buddy, Wedge Antilles.Now with all the positives there are a few negatives, now while they aren't a big problem, they are a tad noticeable. One such being the camera...now while the camera isn't a major issue in the air missions due to the constant moving gameplay, the land missions are a tad affected by this. Main point being you can't control the camera in these missions which is a tad annoying...however the camera issue isn't as bad as in games like Super Mario Sunshine. The other problem I had was the bike missions. They are extremely difficult because basically one wrong mistake and you fail. I really think this is one mission that could have been removed from the game. Beyond this though, there are really no major problems, so you can look forward to nice graphics, great sound, and great gameplay. With all these positives, there is no mistake if I should be recommending the game or not. This is a great game, and now with the new low price it's a must buy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S.

Sim city 4 has to be the best Simulation game in the Sim City franchise so far. The gameplay is very similar to its prior versions, however vastly improved.

You can actually see sims move around, talking to eachother, cars overtaking and having accidents, aircraft's taking off and landing in exactly the same way they do in reality and cruising over the clouds. Its amazing. There are also night and day effects which is a swell idea. Street lamps, house lights go on at night, giving a beautiful effect to your city. You can send Police Cruisers to make sure law and order is preserved. You have new God Like powers, such as manually changng night to day and vice versa, making storms and natural disasters. Beautifully renderd landscapes such as canyons, mountains and water effects add to realism.System requirments are pretty high. Im playing Sim City 4 on a 1.6 Ghz P4, 356MB ram and a GForce4 64MB.

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Grand Godslayer","summary":"Wii U","reviewText":"I've been looking forward to the Wii U for awhile now.  There's nothing quite like the feel of a new system.  I unboxed my Wii U and had no problems hooking it up.  Definitely glad I bought the Deluxe Set almost immediately because it comes with a cradle for the gamepad.  Unfortunately there is a estimated 5gb update as soon as you connect to the internet.  This will take awhile but you want to get it done.  It adds many features.  This is my first complaint.  Big first day update that took me an hour.  You can't do anything while it does this.  Afterward though I spent a good deal of time just playing around in the menus and testing out the features.  The Wii U has some wonderful potentials and it is quiet fun using the gamepad to navigate.  My second complaint is the load time for menus.  Occasionally this takes 30 seconds or more.  Not really that long, but it can feel like forever.  After I got done with the menus I figured it was time to try out an external hard drive.  It would not work with my usb powered external hard drive, but it did work wonderfully with a 2tb dedicated power source external hard drive.  Then it was time to go the the eshop and download some games.  I purchases a few games from the eshop and it took a good while to download them.  They were saved straight to the external hard drive which was nice.  While waiting I tried out the Wii Mode, which allows the Wii U to pretend it is a Wii.  No Joke.  The Wii U restarts and when it loads up it is exactly the same as a Wii.  This is quite a nice feature as I still have many Wii games I look forward to playing some more.  At the end of the day I feel I have spent my money well.  Many people have complained about the launch line-up but I think Nintendo did their homework well.  There is at least one game forever one.  Each game targets a different genre for the most part.  If you're like me and like many different genres then you're going to have a lot to play.To sum it all up the Wii U is like an upgrade for the Wii.  It does everything the Wii does and much more.  So if you enjoyed a Wii over the last few years, you'll enjoy a Wii you just as much if not more.  Though there are still a few quirks to complain about, the overall experience is rewarding.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

For vita use just connect the included 3.5mm cable to vita and headset, turn on (optional, it works without battery) and enjoy.Sound Quality  4.2/5.0Please dont expect this cans to sound like the astros A40 (A50 wireless version) or sennheiser PC360(wired).  What you can expect is equal or better sound than the PX5, better sound than lower priced headphones like PX21 and AX180.  Using on PS3 and Vita has been the better experiences for me.  The surround sound is good enough to get immersed into Battlefield 3.  The bass impact technology is hit and miss, but this is optional (it can be turned off).  Modes offer nice variety for different genres and media.  I leave it on GAME for all my games and find it pleasing, with bass impact halfway.Comfort  4.6/5.0In the hands they feel heavy, but once put on they fit great.  The fit is tight enough to move your head or walk with no worries of them falling off.  The fake leather does a great job of being comfortable for back to back matches in Battlefield 3 and 1-2 hour sessions on the vita.Built Quality 5.0/5.0The plastic is solid, it has metal on the headband and at the top of the ear cups.  It has the feel of a solid headset that can take a beating and be there working.  It feels as solid as the A40, lots better than the PX5.Battery 3.9/5.0It takes a little longer than i would like to charge.  It does last enough to hold through daily gaming sessions but not for more than one.  I just charge them after every gaming session with thePS Vita Portable Chargerwhich turns off once the headset is fully charged, this way is not a problem.Wireless signal 5.0/5.0This is some of the best wireless headphones i have tried.  As solid as the \"wireless\" A40, way better than the PX5.  In an average size room there is no way you will have problems, and routers and other wireless devices dont interfere at all.Who is this for?Any PS3 owner that wants a decent surround sound headset and does not want to spent $250-300 on the Astros A50 (or wired A40) or PC360.  Keyword here is decent.  Yes it is better than cheaper options, but it is not top notch hence why it does not cost top dollar.  The wireless factor here is a huge factor, and at this price this are no gimmick.  This cans are very versatile, one can power up the usb dongle and connect anything into the 3.5mm input and listen to it completely wireless.  I just hooked the dongle on the external battery i have (PS Vita Portable Charger)and listen to my ipod wireless from my backpack and it sounds really good.Who is this NOT for?Anyone who want to get the top notch surround sound headphones.

{"product_name":"B00008KTNW","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Helluva lot better than Shinobi","reviewText":"The mysterious, black-clothed assassins have been making a video-game comeback recently, but the results have been lackluster so far. Ninja Gaiden changes all of that with a kick-ass effort that redefines the classic franchise. When the original trilogy of Ninja Gaiden games was released on the NES, it set a standard for fast action and a high degree of challenge. This Xbox revival manages to achieve those lofty goals but isn't happy with merely recreating the past. Ryu Hayabusa, the hero from the previous games, is again the main protagonist, although there's no connection to the previous story line. Ryu's clan has been murdered, so bloody vengeance must be enacted and humanity saved along the way. While it's not the most original premise, the plot and voice acting add the required amount of motivation to keep you interested and move things along. Other audio elements like the sound effects and music are quite fantastic as every weapon features uniquely satisfying noises and the heart pounding main theme is an incredibly catchy. The only drawback is that the overall soundtrack is a bit unbalanced with a few tunes that don't quite cut it. Most modern action games add driving levels or mini-games to keep the gameplay fresh. Ryu is required to swim at times, but the meat and potatoes focuses on acquiring and upgrading weapons and techniques, and simply learning to make full use of the resulting moves. While this may sound dull on paper, it's immensely rewarding in action. You'll be driven insane with glee at how many different ways there are to develop Ryu's arsenal and dispatch foes with style. Be warned that there is plenty of tricky platform jumping that's a pain not because the timing is hard to master, but because the camera angle can be wonky. In fact, the frustrating camera is really the biggest mark against Ninja Gaiden. With action this fast and levels so different from one another, it's remarkable the viewpoint doesn't get in the way as much as it could. It's also worth noting that the camera is quite well behaved during boss battles. The rest of the visuals are just plain awesome-whether it's the shiny latches on Ryu's body armor or the detailed locations of each environment. For those wanting to strut their stuff, Master Ninja Tournament is the global-ranking system accessed via Xbox Live (a feature that could not be tested at press time). Other extra features include unlockables like an alternate outfit, the original Ninja Gaiden Trilogy, and Theater mode, so you can watch those neat CG cut-scenes. Highly skilled players may be able to finish the game quicker, but the majority of folks will clock in for a 20-plus-hour thrill ride. Few games are this good, for so long, and still keep you coming back for more. The game simply knocks you on your ass and keeps kicking it throughout. Ninja Gaiden is truly a modern masterpiece.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2004"}

They came back swinging for the fences on this one, I'm happy to say that this game is the best of the series, flat-out. I feel like the game deserves better than a 4 but its not a perfect 5 either for some small gripes. I'll have to give it a 5 but I REALLY mean 4.5. I like 10 point systems better, 5 doesn't give the range I need. In the spirit of full disclosure this is only based on the first 10 hours of play, I could not wait until the end before posting about the game. I'm just assuming the rest of the game will be as good as the first bunch of sequences. The controls are a bit more refined although the combat was never ultra smooth. Its much better here. Not the best combat mechanics on earth but they are much more solid feeling now and it seems like the response times are better. The long load times have also been slimmed down significantly. The storyline is just awesome, the characters are very cool and the game is engaging. I see much more opportunity for stealth in this game than I did in the last 2, this is a huge bonus for me, I like to slink around in the shadows. I love the parkour, it seems better than ever here and running through the wilderness is thrilling. Dealing with animals is a great new challenge too, I love it. All of that stuff you loved in the previous games are back. The map is still a bit confusing until you get used to it, I was hoping for some improvement there but its all good, its a minor gripe.

{"product_name":"B002I08UGQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"DSi King Size","reviewText":"There is no doubt about the success of the Nintendo DS handheld game systems. Since the original came out back in 2004, many gamers have been going all-out crazy for what Nintendo has deeply done to change the way we play video games on the go. The original one set the benchmark for so many great games to play like Super Mario 64 DS, Bejewled Twist, and new games like America's Test Kitchen: Let's Get Cooking, WairoWare: D.I.Y. and so many other games to have a unique light to new gamers of all ages. Since then, we've seen the DS develop steadily to other incarnations like the DS Lite in 2006, and last year with the Nintendo DSi, with a ability to take digital photos wherever you go, and send pictures and download video games online. Now, Nintendo is unveiling a bigger DSi for gaming on the go, and this is just a snapshot on the mind.The new Nintendo DSi XL brings in all that we've loved from the DSi last year, by making the DSi a much bigger size, by meaning bigger-sized fun for gamers of all kinds, as you play all your favorite DS games in a larger-sized screen, which makes it easier for you to play games that are hard to see, with a screen nearly twice the size as the original DS was. All the features are here including the ability to take photos, download video games through the Nintendo DSi shop with games that you can download like Mario Vs Donkey Kong 2, and Art Style: Base 10 which is a fun and challenging game to download, where you can try and beat the clock by getting number that add up to 10 and making them evaporate in thin air, befor the clock runs out. The new system also includes a few pre-loaded games Brain Age: Express Math & Arts & Letters that're fun, but there is more to play that you can download online through the Nintendo DSi shop.You also can take great photos that can be fun with the new bigger DSi camera, that makes it easier for you to take great snaphots, with great lens shots like the mirror image lens, the folding image, where you can fold and morph the shape of your photos, also by others by adding flowers or saying a nice message to greet all your friends. You also can send those photos through Facebook, as part of Nintendo's partnership with the website, which Nintendo announced last year. The camera is tough at first, but you can easily take the photos with ease once you get the hang of it. There are also other things that you can also do including recording messages, and storing music onto the DSi, and saving them onto a SD Card, so you can then send them to others online, and take your photos wherever you go, and print them up at you local photo shop.Yet, with all the new features the new Nintendo DSi XL have, there are still the few disadvantages that it has, that could've been improved where the original DSi left out. The first disadvantage is the ability to play some Ninetdno DS games. Like the original DSi, you don't have the ability to play certain DS games, without the original Game Boy Advance Slot. So if you own any of the music games Guitar Hero: On Tour, Guitar Hero: On Tour Decades or Band Hero, you unfortunately won't be able to play those games on the system. The second disadvantage is just like before, you also cannot play several music files that you download online, unless you convert them from MP3 Files to the lesser-known AAC format, and store them on you SD Card, that you can use to store your photos and music.All in all, despite the few flaws here, the Nintendo DSi XL brings in a lot of the fun-filled enjoyment that we've loved from the original Nintendo DSi, only in a bigger-size. I absolutely love it, from its bigger stylus pen, to a wider-angle to play your games and take your photos. While there are those who want to upgrade from their prior DS systems, others just are eager and waiting to see what develops with the upcoming Nintendo 3DS next year. Nevertheless, if you've never owned the Nintendo DSi before, I absolutely recommend this a whole lot for anyone who wants great gaming wherever they go.Graphics: A-Sound: AControl: AFun & Enjoyment: B+Online Compatability: B+DSi Camera: B+Price: BOverall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

An uneasy peace settled over the land while, for years, the drums of war were silent. Yet the kingdoms of men grew complacent in their victory--and slowly, the defeated orcish clans regrouped under the banner of a new visionary leader.Now a darker shadow has fallen over the world, threatening to extinguish all life--all hope. The drums of war play upon the winds once again--rising urgently toward the inevitable hour when the skies will rain fire--and the world will tremble before the coming of the Burning Legion.WarCraft IIIreturns players to the war-torn world of Azeroth. Developer Blizzard Entertainment combines the lessons learned from its bestselling StarCraft, the famous WarCraft lineage, and all-new 3-D technology to create an all-new, vibrant strategy game sure to become a classic.Wage war in a fully interactive 3-D world that incorporates nonplayer characters, wandering monsters, neutral towns, strongholds, temples, and environmental effects. Four mighty playable races--humans, orcs, night elves, and undead--compete in a finely balanced dance of conquest. Upgradable heroes gain experience and harness new powers as the game progresses.

Games voted by the players of the world. The WCG is the equivalent of the Olympic games for video games. Nations and countries from around the world play in this event. This year, It was held in San Francisco(where I attended). Some of the biggest crowd turnouts, Aside from the usual Gamer favorite StarCraft, was WarCraft 3. Loud chants and even national pride anthems were song during the mathches. This game stands up to the test of professionals, tested for it's speed and compatibility. It is among the best in a category dominated by the computer media: RTS. As a long time RTS player I would rank this only second to StarCraft. And for those gamers not really into RTS, the game provides outlets for the online experience. Custom games where gamers like you, make the maps and the rules. Games like Sheep tag, Where you and how ever many other players build obstacles (farms in this case) to surround themselves with, so that online players, playing as Wolves, don't attack and kill you. The point of the game for the Sheeps side is to survive for twenty minutes. On the other side, the wolves, it is to kill every online sheep. The games are endless and thus are the opportunities for fun. I'm currently addicted to custom games. I can't find myself to do anything else. Join the crave.. The community of WarCraft is welcoming to new players.The RTS is rather different than StarCraft, who requires blinding speed for not only Macro but also Micro. The average Pro gamer speed for StarCraft is around 200 apm. In WarCraft it's around 50. But that means that WC3 is only differrent. Giving gamers who couldn't compete with the engine of SC a wonderfully new outlet to compete. WC3 focuses more on Hero's. In the WCG those who lost their hero's lost the game. The maximum number of troops is low, around 100. But those numbers are deceiving to the critics out there. If you where given the opportunity of more troops, it would only lead to the emulation of SC. Blizzard wanted a new RTS. One with its own identity. They knew they couldn't cater to the needs of Pro SC gamers. The expectations were too high. So they worked for years, and in the end they gave us a graphicaly superb beast filled with Commanding hero's and spell casters who demand the game's victory or loss.-jeff","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2004"}
{"product_name":"B002BS47JE","reviewerName":"Jonathan Oyama \"Welcome to die!\"","summary":"Fun upgrade with a few kinks","reviewText":"\"Wii Fit Plus\" improves on the original Wii Fit, even though it suffers from a few setbacks in a slightly cumbersome menu system.Some gamers have grown tired of \"Wii Fit,\" because the basic balance and aerobics games didn't challenge players enough. Thankfully, the upgrade provides 15 new games and a nifty \"My Wii Fit Plus\" feature.This new menu gives players the opportunity to choose specific combinations of exercises to relax people or to tone their bodies. Probably the most useful ones are those in the \"Form\" section to tone your muscles and the \"Health\" section to shave off those extra calories.There's plenty of fun games too. \"Snowball Fight\" plays like a Time Crisis shooter, but with snowballs. With all this technology, you may wonder why Namco hasn't produced a Time Crisis game with the Wii balance board by now.Other fun games include \"Rhythm Parade,\" a tricky marching game which requires people to wave their nunchuck and remote in time to the Beatmania-style diagram on screen. Players also have to step in time to the rhythm, making this a challenging exercise.\"Perfect 10 Plus\" is the most difficult of the games, forcing players to bump their hips in the proper directions to add the numbers up to 10. The game considers this as a mental coordination exercise, but the concept might turn out too tricky for some players.All the games are welcome additions, except for the clunky flying chicken one.Last, but not least, are the new Yoga poses and strength-building workouts. These are actually some of the more useful, advanced programs which take advantage of the balance board to sense the proper balance of the person's body. For instance, the spine extension Yoga poses stretches out the backbone, while also sensing whether there is 60 percent weight on your front leg when you are bending forward.Plus isn't without snags though. The game interface doesn't record the player's high scores when they perform combination workouts in \"My Wii Fit Plus.\"Also, some of the new \"Training Plus\" games require very little use of a person's body. No one will get a full workout with \"Snowball Fight,\" which only requires people to aim their remotes and lean left and right on the board.However, these are only minor complains. \"Wii Fit Plus\" is a worthy purchase for anyone who wants to use the complete capabilities of the balance board. The $20 game adds enough features to please fans of the original \"Wii Fit\" and newcomers to the physical fitness genre of gaming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000JLIXIG","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Set your PS3 sights on Resistance","reviewText":"On November 17th the minority of those purchasing a PlayStation 3 for their own gaming experiences and not for profitable online auctioning had the chance to play one of the best first-person shooters in years. During my splendid time with this video game I couldn't help but draw comparisons to other games, as Resistance has a lot in common with great games like Halo, Half-Life, Call of Duty, and even Gears Of War. It takes some of the best aspects from each of these games and molds an experience that shouldn't be missed by PlayStation 3 owners or shooter fans. Insomniac's Resistance: Fall of Man might be the only worthy exclusive PlayStation 3 game for quite some time, and if you're sporting a PlayStation 3 in your home, Resistance should be spinning inside of it  Viva la ResistanceResistance's storyline is set in an alternate reality. It's the 1950's, but not the hip-thrusting Elvis Presley days that demonized generations to come. World War II never took place, and terrorizing the eastern world in place of Adolf Hitler and his fellow Nazis is a terrifying race of aliens known as the Chimera. The Chimera have all but seized Asia and most of Europe. The only hope for humankind seems to be in the trigger finger of the U.S. Army's Nathan Hale, a brutish but speechless soldier who instead lets his guns do the talking. Unfortunately, none of the game's characters are developed much more than what was just explained. With a few spoilers avoided, it should be said that you probably shouldn't be playing Resistance for a gripping storyline. No, you should instead be playing it for the thrilling ride that you haven't felt since Halo.Resistance's 30 levels are among the most intense and entertaining in a virtual form. As Hale you'll fight endless amounts of Chimera forces in war-torn cities, wet and twisty Chimera caves, and large, vegetated European fields. There are more than eight weapons to take out the multiple kinds of Chimera located in each level. Truth be told, those latter two factors are what make Resistance worth your holiday cash. Resistance: Fall of Man's armory isn't equipped with a single pea-shooting pistol; in fact, all eight of the weapons you'll find in your first play-through are extremely useful at several points through out the game, if not throughout. They all also feature a secondary fire mode. You'll start the game with the always-trusty M5A2 Carbine rifle, which has plenty of range to take out enemies from afar as well as a grenade launcher attached to take out small groups of pesky Chimera. You'll find the Bullseye, which allows you to shoot around corners and from behind cover at exposed enemies. Then there's the Rossmore 236, a shotgun with a double-power, double-shot blast that sends anything pesky to a bloody spot on the floor. The Auger lets you shoot shells through walls, and through each solid barrier the round becomes even more deadly. Even more interesting is the XR-003 Sapper that allows you to plop organic mines throughout a room that can be detonated on enemy contact or with the press of the alternate fire button. It would be unfair to forget mentioning Resistance's four types of grenades, from the standard but trusty fragmentation grenade to the gruesome, needle-spewing Hedgehog grenade.The enemies that you'll kill with Resistance's arms are almost as entertaining as your tools themselves. The game is benefitted strongly by having A.I. that will outright punish you if you decide to take a rest and wait around behind cover. They'll flank. They'll get into better positions. They'll run from your grenades. They'll simply pursue you until one party is on the ground, dead as dirt. The standard fodder, the Hybrid, is a common foe throughout the game. Up-close-and-personal pests called Menials will slowly stalk you through corridors, lurching at you and lashing at your helpless character while you shake the SIXAXIS maniacally to shrug off the leeching enemy. Grey Jacks will run at ridiculous speeds to slash at you with their claws. The Flood Parasites from Halo have met their match, Resistance's Crawlers and Rollers are an equally if not more annoying and pesky foe, as they explode out of nests or crawl seemingly out of nowhere to rush your position and overpower you. Every Chimera foe is fearsome and can take you out if you don't use good tactics, take advantage of each weapon, and learn to fight well in your environment.Distractions from the corridor-crawling and room-clearing include several highly-entertaining vehicular sequences. Not since Halo have these action-packed sequences been done so well. Driving jeeps, tanks, and even the Chimera's own spider-like Stalker robots is simple enough while pressing a single button allows you to jump out of the driver's seat to man a powerful turret or sit in the passenger's seat and fire away with your own weapons.All in all the single-player campaign is a lengthy one; even lengthier than Halo 2 and Gears of War. It's also made highly replayable by unlockable weapons and even secrets that can be earned by finding \"Skill Points.\" Skill Points are earned by doing some sort of action throughout the game, and in more cases than that, in a specific level. For example, shortly after finding the game's L23 Fareye sniper rifle you can earn Skill Points if you shoot the heads of a certain number of Hybrids. If you \"corpse hump\" 15 dead Hybrids or incinerate an entire group of enemies with the fiery Air-Fuel Grenade, you'll earn some more. On top of all of this, there's an entire online multiplayer setup that allows 40 players to play in six different game modes. A cool bonus is that each gamer can choose between human characters or Chimera characters, and each race yields different strengths. The Chimera can enter a short frenzy where they're more powerful than normal, while humans can sprint away from oncoming enemies and bullets.The PlayStation 3's visual capabilities are shown quite well with Resistance: Fall of Man, with its highly-detailed environments, fluid animations, impressive and intricate character models, and well-done cinematic sequences. The deadly Chimera models are alone worth praise, but the only problem is that there seems to be a slight artistic identity crisis; the 1950's environments and the science fiction Chimera set pieces conflict quite a lot. Still, fiery explosive effects and other particle effects round out a fantastic visual performance that looks nothing less than stunning on any high-definition set. The sound is also well worth mentioning; sound effects rip right out of the speakers while appropriate action- and emotion-based music will fill in as background ambience.All in all, flaws are few and far between. There were a few frustrating times throughout the campaign where checkpoints seemed too spread out and sometimes there were just a few too many super-annoying Crawlers to kill. Ammo seems to be a very, very rare commodity, while health items aren't.Resistance: Fall of Man is as good of a flagship launch title as Sony could ask for. Insomniac has proven itself for a few years with their Ratchet and Clank franchise, and Spyro the Dragon before that. Resistance: Fall of Man shows that the developer also has a talent for first-person shooters, and a keen ability to make a whopping next-generation video game. Resistance: Fall of Man is THE PlayStation 3 game to own.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2006"}

I bought this because it's early in PS3's life and there aren't a lot of highly rated games yet.Coming from many years of FPS on a PC, I was really surprised how little time it took me to get used to the controls. They are fluid and precise.Another thing I loved is the style of graphics, not just the detail, but the feel of the environment. I think this is what sets it apart from all other FPS games.Another thing I really like about this is that there's no single weapon that you can use to get through the whole game. You need to constantly change weapons based on the situation your in. Shotgun is a must in close combat, while your basic M Carbine is still most effective in outdoor battles. Also, (and this might just be a coincidence) it seems like the game PUSHES you to use different weapons. If I use the same rifle for too long, the ammunition for it becomes more difficult to find, but you come across plenty of ammo for your other weapons. Switch to one of them and suddenly you find ammo for the one you just ran out of. Maybe that's just me, but maybe it's a pretty clever design feature.This game finally sparked my interest in FPS on consoles, I can't wait for a sequel and the game hints there may be one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2007"}

This was my least favorite, and least played, of the R&C games, with the very first one being a close second in the least fav. category.  Personally, \"Going Commando\" and \"Up your Arsenal\" were far and away the two best games of the series.  There was so much more variety in those two games.  I just didn't like the fact that the platforming aspect was completely stripped out of \"Deadlocked\".  Also, the number and variety of the weapons, the true stars of the games, were lacking in \"Deadlocked\".  If you're a die-hard fan of the series, you'll enjoy \"Deadlocked\".

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on.

We could clear about 6 maps of the challenge quickly, one more kinda slowly and then another 2 or so quickly before running out of time. NOT fun.Time limits are the method non-skilled, lazy programmers use to make a game &#34;challenging&#34; if they can't figure out a fun way to do it. Absolutely ruined this game for us.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2014"}

I played this for a couple of hours with my friend and then I went home and played it for about 4 or 5 hours alone and this here is my verdict.  I'll start with the bad.Cons:- The way the game begins it sorta feels repetitive.  But when you start to unlock new moves it gets much better and more interesting.- Juliet's on liners can get annoying at first, but then later it didn't seem to bother me at all so I guess you gotta play for a while to get into the style of this game.- Loading screens are too many and too long.- auto aiming in this game is really off.  It will snap to a zombie on the opposite side of the area you are facing.  But the good thing is you can turn auto aim off.  But still, if they are gonna include it, they should have made it work right.- Juliet always pauses right before or after a chainsaw move.  It just breaks up combo flow.- Too short for $60Pros- Fun factor and the style of the game, for me, greatly out way the cons.  It's just a lot of fun.  I found it hard to stop playing.- The style of the game is very well done.  Love the graphics.- Arcade feel.  I love how it feels just like an arcade game but still has a simple story.- Unlockable combo moves are fun.- After the first hour, the game starts to switch it up enough to make it more engaging.- Music matches it perfect.- Original.  I honestly don't think I've ever played anything like this and I think everyone should at least rent it to check it out.  You might be surprised that you like it.- Just like Shadows of the Damned, this game has some fun Boss battles.  Very creative.- The conclusion was well done I thought.  I actually cared for the characters.Overall I'm glad I got this game at $45.  To pay $60 is a bit too much, but at the same time I like to support companies that are willing to take risks and just make a fun game.  I loved Shadows of the Damned and this game sorta reminds of all the reasons why I liked SoD, it's originality and the fun ride.  Hope this helps anyone who is sitting on the fence on this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2012"}

This isn't a pretty world that the mob inhabits.You are a newcomer in the world of the Corleones, and have to prove your worth. Probably ever gamer who plays this will have read the book, seen the movie or both - so you already know and appreciate the family situations going on around you.The acting here is phenomonal, and no surprise, because you're rubbing shoulders with James Caan, Robert Duvall, and even Marlon Brando did voice work for this before passing away. When they talk about games becoming real, dramatic interactive experiences, this is pretty much what they were getting at. It sucks you in and really makes you feel like part of an epic, intricate story.The world you explore is dynamic and vast. Do you want to go all-out Rambo and try to hit your enemies head on?

You can promise a store you'll protect them for a small fee - but then you go around back and break into their safe. Does that really count as protection?With all of the gangster style games out there, you would think that Godfather, coming as it were rather late on the scene, might have become a \"too late, too boring by now\" game.

I did play through the original Half Life, and its difficulty (especially in the later stages) was a bit of a turn-off. Personally, I think that when the game practically necessitates cheating to complete it, it's a bit too much. That said, seeing this bundle on the store shelf was a bit too good of a deal to pass up, so I picked it up.First impressions on the game design- the physics is more heavily involved in gameplay than in any other shooter before or since. In fact, in many cases the gameplay seems to FOCUS on the physics, not on killing enemies. To underscore this, you can actually finish most of the game with only the gravity gun, which (except in rare cases) can't kill anything directly but can pick up objects to throw at enemies. This is an interesting departure from the norm, but there are times when I think they took it a bit too far. Typically, you'll start off killing enemies and will have the normal frantic bursts of action, but you'll eventually run into a puzzle. These are usually something as simple as a locked door or elevator, and you simply (or not) have to open it or turn it on. Most of the puzzles can be figured out given a reasonable amount of effort on the player's part, but there are a few that will undoubtedly frustrate to the point where you simply look it up. I guess this is fine, so long as you aren't highly averse to cheating in such a fashion. I will say, when you do get where you're going, you do feel a sense of accomplishment at having figured it out.The game's graphics are pretty good even for now, and voice acting is well done. The environments are well made and look realistic in a sort of grim alien/post-apocalyptic style. It's nothing that will blow you away after seeing next-gen titles, but it's none too shabby either. Additionally, the episodes feature graphic improvements. If you have bought a machine anytime in the last 3-4 years, chances are it'll run smoothly at max settings. The game is quite stable as well, though it doesn't seem to like being minimized. One thing to note is that the game does take quite a while to start up and has occasional- and sometimes rather jarring- load pauses. These usually take place in a featureless corridor, and I found that after a while I could tell when it was about to stop to load.The original HL2 is generally a good story and great pace, save for one glaring thing. There are two sequences where you're driving a vehicle around, and it's my opinion (and most I've mentioned it to agree) that these are just WAY too long. It's almost as if the developers were justifying the time they spent making the vehicles work by stretching out these sequences to a ridiculous length. Some other interesting notes are that allies are somewhat useful now, and the variety of enemies is enough that they don't get overly repetitive. Particularly, there is a point where you get to command an endless horde of weak critters to overwhelm a horde of enemies (fortunately, not endless), which is one of the highlights of the game.The episodes (1 and 2) more or less follow the same style of the original. You lose all your weapons at the start of each one, which is rather irritating, and they aren't especially long installments. They largely serve to drive the plot along, which is actually getting interesting enough that I'm looking forward to the finale. You spend most of your time with Alyx backing you up, which is good if you hate being lonely, but somewhat of a shift in gears from the core game where you're largely solo. There are a few surprises and new enemies along the way, and enough new environments to make things fun.Additionally, this package comes with Team Fortress and Portal, which are a multiplay shooter and puzzle game respectively. I haven't looked into either extensively since I largely bought this pack to get the Half Life content, but it's a nice bonus.The only big gripe I have about the Orange Box is something that a lot of other people have complained about- specifically, Steam and the Valve DRM. If you don't have a live internet connection you CANNOT play any of the games since it needs to connect to Steam to authenticate you. Steam also performs updates whenever you launch, so patching is not optional and can eat into your game time when you don't particularly want it to. There were times when I was playing some online game, my internet died, and I figured to just play some HL2 instead... and after a few minutes sitting on the 'Now loading...' prompt I remembered it wasn't going to work either. This, like many other aspects of Half Life 2, is different from any other shooter out there- but not in a pleasant way. Personally, I don't see why it can't authenticate once in 3 launches, or even every other launch. Even that would be preferable to the way it is now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

I love this game cause it allows you to upgrade your moves, kinda like an RPG game. You can either increase the range or power of a move...sometimes both. Another nice tough is that you can connect all your moves together, even if it's with another weapon. There's not a lot of combos, but this little bit makes up for it. You can connect just about any moves & make up your own combos.The only thing I didn't like about this game is the puzzles. My friend LOVES puzzles, but I hate them, & this game has them in spades.

{"product_name":"B004FYKWZU","description":"","reviewerName":"God is a refuge for us (Psalms 62:8)","summary":"very well done","reviewText":"I purchased and downloaded Mass Effect 3 (N7 Digital Deluxe Edition) from Origin. Origin had a 50% off sale that ended on 1/3/13. So, I got it for 20 bucks. Great deal. The digital deluxe edition from Origin includes the From Ashes DLC and the Extended Cut DLC [and a few other extras like art book, comic book, photos, soundtrack, mechdog, N7 hoodie (not interested in that stuff); and N7 arsenal pack]. Other free DLC that you can download separately from Origin includes Resurgence, Rebellion, Earth, and Retaliation.You can see all the negative reviews, and most of them focus on the ending.I played Mass Effect 1 and 2, and I imported my Shepard from Mass Effect 2. I enjoyed ME1 a lot, and liked ME2 as well (but thought some of the human characters in ME2 used too much foul language).After playing the game for a few days, I still had a long way to go (and that's a good thing). I think it's a lot of fun. After each mission, I've learned to visit with each of the crew on the Normandy (or when we dock at the Citadel), because they always have something additional to talk about (and that really adds to the story; some of this additional dialogue is funny/humorous...by design). Doing this means it will take me longer to get through the game, but that's okay...it's part of the fun...I highly recommend doing this. And sometimes when a conversation sounds like it's done and you walk away from the people (by going into a different room) and then come back to the same people, the conversation continues (an example of this is James and Garrus on the Normandy in the mess hall).The graphics, game play, and controls are all very good. It's like playing in a movie...very cool. The battles are intense. You can really immerse yourself into this game/series.There appears to be less foul language in ME3 than there was in ME2 (and I think that's a plus).I encountered one bug when I was talking to Jeff/Joker and EDI on the bridge of the Normandy; after speaking with them, Shepard couldn't move (he was stuck); this happened a couple of times; so I had to restart from the last save. Not a big deal, since I save frequently (and the game autosaves frequently too).OFFLINE PLAYThe game needs to go online to authenticate the first time you run it, but after that you can play the game offline (if you want to). Open Origin, go to the Origin menu, and select \"go offline\". Then, to get it to recognize that you're really offline, disable your network connection (you might be able to accomplish the same thing by unplugging your modem...I didn't try that). I'm normally online, but I tried it \"offline\" by disabling my network connection to see if it would work offline, and it did.OMEGA DLCI purchased this DLC, and played it today. Depending on how you play, it may take 3-5 hours to get through it. You leave the Normandy and its crew behind (along with the Reaper storyline). Instead, you accompany Aria on her ship and fight Cerberus on Omega, so Aria can have Omega back. In my opinion, it wasn't as fun as the main game, because your crew was left behind (and there was no Reaper plot). If you don't like Aria, then you might not want this DLC, because you see a lot of her. In the game, Omega is next to the Citadel (you join Aria's ship from there and it takes you to Omega).FROM ASHES DLCThis DLC came with the ME3 digital deluxe version, and I recommend it (so if you get the standard version, I recommend you buy this DLC). The mission is fun, and the Prothean character really adds to the story... not just during that particular missions, but throughout the game (and he is available as a squadmate).Going inside a Geth server was cool; it reminded me of scenes fromTRON: Evolution.Some reviewers said they thought the game was rushed to market, but I don't feel that's true at all. After 35 hours of play, I still had lots of missions to complete. And BioWare took the time to get the details right, especially all of the dialogue. Here is another example: On the Normandy on the crew quarters level across from the elevator, there is a memorial on the wall that lists crew members (or those who helped crew members) who died in battle; throughout the game, this list is updated as people die.WHAT ABOUT THE ENDING?Most of the bad reviews seem to be about the ending.After over 60 hours of play, I finally reached the end.  The last mission was very intense and well done.I do have the Extended Cut DLC; it came with the ME3 digital deluxe version.  If you bought the standard version of the game, this DLC is available free from EA/BioWare until April 12, 2014.  Since I played the game with this DLC, I can't comment on what the game would be like without it.  As a matter of fact, I couldn't tell when this DLC kicked-in, so it obviously fits perfectly into the story.There are 4 possible endings; and even within those endings, there are variations depending on your paragon/renegade choices.I played 3 of the 4 endings, and I wasn't disappointed.  Actually, with all the bad reviews about the endings, I was prepared for the worst; but instead, I was pleasantly surprised with each.The types of endings that are available to you depend on how you play the game.  Specifically, your effective military strength (EMS), which you can gauge in the war room (on deck 2 of the Normandy).  As/If you gain allies during the game, this adds to your \"Total Military Strength\", which is multiplied by a percentage known as \"readiness rating\".  Your readiness rating is 50%, but can be increased by playing multiplayer online.  The total military strength multiplied by the readiness rating is the \"effective military strength\"...your actual strength.So, someone who plays the game really fast...just to get to the ending...may not have the same ending options as someone who plays all of the side missions (and multiplayer) and has lots of effective military strength.Prior to playing the last mission, my readiness rating was 100%, my total military strength was 7514 (and my effective military strength was 7514).  So, I had all ending options available to me.  Also, my reputation was off the charts, and this also contributes to dialogue/ending options.To learn more (with spoilers), search for \"Mass Effect Wiki\", go to Games, Mass Effect 3, Missions, Plot Missions, Priority: Earth, and scroll down the page.  Priority Earth is the last mission.  The wiki discusses all 4 endings (and how they can be achieved).MULTIPLAYEREven after you finish playing the single player game, go back and play the multiplayer again...and again. It's a lot of fun even after finishing the single player game.  Multiplayer is team based.  It's you and up to 3 other people against one of 4 enemies: Geth, Cerberus, Collectors, or Reapers...you choose (or the leader of the game chooses).  There are several maps to choose from as well (and more if you download the free multiplayer DLC maps).  You can choose your character class (adept, soldier, engineer, infiltrator, sentinel, vanguard). Within each class, you can select your character.  Within each character, you build-up powers, weapons, gear. It's very organized and follows the same logic as the main/single player game. For a given mission, there are 11 waves of enemies (each wave gets a bit harder). During some of the waves, you have a team event to complete (like... escort a drone from one part of the map to the landing zone; or, hack a computer for a given time; or, activate several beacons; or, find the lost object and return it to the landing zone). The map graphics are great...take a moment to look around the map during the game to enjoy them! The voice acting is very well done and realistic. The game play is fun, balanced, and fair (I haven't noticed cheating). There are several difficulty ratings that you can select from (bronze, silver, gold, platinum). You start with few weapons, but as you complete successful missions, you get points that you can use to buy/unlock things like gear, weapons, characters, etc. It's a lot of fun to try-out the variations of characters and classes.  Very well done.CONCLUSIONI can say without hesitation that this series of 3 games is my favorite of all games to-date.It would have been even better without the strong language/profanity (especially taking God's name in vain), and same-sex romances.  The profanity is not excessive or gratuitous, but the game would have been better without it.  The same-sex romances (or any romances) can be avoided in the game, which is great; but I would rather that they not be present at all (just develop close friendships instead).I look forward to playing the series again in the future.  In my opinion, the game has high replay value (even if I know how it ends).  The game play, the controls, the story, the graphics, the sounds, the characters, the voice acting, and all the movie scenes are fantastic (and I look forward to experiencing them again).To-date, I have not found another game that comes close to Mass Effect.  It is very unique and well done.Also check-out the N7 HQ webpage, where you can monitor your \"challenge\" progress and review all of your multiplayer game statistics; go to: social dot bioware dot com / n7hqMass EffectMass Effect 2Mass Effect 3Mass Effect 3 Digital Deluxe Version [Download] (it includes 2 DLCs)Mass Effect TrilogyVisit my Amazon Collections to see my 4-star and 5-star PC games:http://www.amazon.com/gp/customers/A12LH2100CKQO/collections","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2013"}

I picked up the Day One edition, but since that won't be sold anymore outright, seems pointless to review on that one since they're identical other than the words on the controller and the code for the achievement.  I'd rather the review is useful on the one people will be buying moving forward.Well packaged.  MS is finally picking up some from Apple in how well they design the packaging and how they fit things into smaller spaces, like they did with the Surface.There was a 500MB or so update to run as soon as it was hooked up, which I did at work before I got this home.The initial setup was easy.  Since I have a gold Live account, I just told it who I was and away it went.  The only thing that threw me off was I had been used to the extra layer of security on the 360 so I had my &#34;app password&#34; all set to set this up, but apparently they did the security on the Xbox One so that if you're like me and have two level security enabled on your Live account, this doesn't need the app password but can use the actual Live account password, it just needed me to put in the additional verification code it texted to my phone.I got it home, and since I'm keeping my other Xboxes, I found a spot for this in my cabinet.  I have ATT Uverse, so I ran the Uverse box to the input here, and this to the receiver I use as my HDMI switcher as well as sound.I had spent time the past week trying to find things in google searches about whether or not it would use the HDMI to command the cable box or if I'd need some IR blaster, but hadn't found anything.  Fortunately, it's all HDMI.You specify your TV type, and it tests to make sure it can control it if the TV supports that via HDMI.  Same with a receiver and the cable box - it will try different controls until it succeeds and you say &#34;Yep that worked.&#34;  Then it's set.The unit is nice and quiet.  I have five Xboxes in the house, although I'm giving the oldest one away since I don't need more than three 360's for what we use them for here.  The one I'm giving away is the original one from 2006, still running, never had a red ring of death, but sounds like an F-14 taking off from a carrier.  The Elite was quieter, the Slim quieter still, and last month I bought a new 360 E so I'd have a 360 still in warranty for a while since we need to keep one for all the games we have.  I thought that one was nice and quiet, but the XB One is even more silent.  It's so nice to NOT have all that fan noise even at idle.The Kinect is pretty amazing.  I've enjoyed the first generation one since its release with my now 10 year old son, and thought they did an amazing job with that, but this one just blows it away.  I like that I have Live accounts for both my son and I, and if I'm in the room when I turn on the xbox, it recognizes me and signs me in automatically (and you can enable/disable this feature BTW).  If he's the one it sees, it signs him in.  I tested with both of us there, and wanted to see if it would offer which one to sign in, but it simply signed us both in.  Impressive.Voice control - it's surprisingly effective for everything, my only irritation is with the guide.  That's where I dinged a star off of it.  Telling it who my provider was, my zip code, and it gave me a guide.  But I'm not a fan of the guide, it takes up way too much room, leaving you with a very narrow window of things to view as far as channel lineups.  I am looking to try to see if I can collapse it some, but so far I've had no luck.  But I'm expecting there will be several revamps over the next few months with updates and patches since this is all new release.My Harmony Touch remote works great with it, Logitech made sure they had the Xbox One as a device on launch day.Since I use multiple devices for my things, I don't just use the &#34;xbox on&#34; or &#34;xbox off&#34; to turn it on and off, but it's been spot on for my testing, it never fails to turn on or off via voice.  Navigating the menus with voice is just great, making things quick and easy to get to.  Watching TV could use a few more commands though, such as &#34;channel up&#34; and such.The controller is nice, feels great.  I always preferred the Xbox controller to the other consoles I have, and this one is a nice next version of it - comfortable, positive feeling on the buttons and triggers, not heavy.In the settings, there's a Kinect setting where you can click &#34;what does Kinect see&#34; and it changes through different view options.  The night vision is amazingly effective in a dark room.  I was impressed.The only game I have so far is Battlefield 4, and it's a thing of beauty.This does support surround sound for your cable box, but it's disabled by default, and turning it on under the settings it shows as &#34;beta&#34;, since apparently they had a couple bugs with a couple specific cable boxes, but it works well for me with Uverse so far.I like the interface, easy to navigate and while some people think it's more cluttered, I actually think it's the opposite.  There's less things there to get at on the top level, which makes it more pleasant to navigate.The Kinect doesn't move at all like the old version did, and the cable is MUCH thicker.  Keep that in mind when you're figuring out where to place it.  For now I have it in front of my TV, and I've preordered an &#34;above the TV mount&#34; for it so it'll be up there next to the 360's Kinect and out of the way.Other than my dissatisfaction with the TV Guide and navigation of the guide with voice, I can't find anything at all that I felt disappointed about with this new system.  Blu Ray playing software was a free download from the store, and there's apparently a service for XB Live members to stream videos for free, something along the lines of what I get from Amazon with my Prime membership (which also ties in well here).I'm so fed up listening to the fan boys of each side argue about the PS4 vs. the XB One.  I have a PS3 but I have it for only two games, Little Big Planet and Infamous.  Everything else, I've always preferred to play on the Xbox or Wii, or now the Wii U.  I'm not worried about which has higher specs, since if someone REALLY is concerned about that, they'd be building their own high end gaming PC anyway that would blow both of these out of the water.  PS4 has some things better, but the XB One has some things that are better for me as well.  Both have their place, and hopefully both keep forcing the other to innovate.  The complaint about the Xbox being $100 more is offset when you get the camera setup for the PS4 and puts it right back at the same price anyway, so I don't care that the PS 4 cost less, because you GET less.  I'd expect to pay more when I get more.All told, this is just an amazing piece of technology.  I don't know if I'm going to leave the Uverse running through it or not, since I don't know how important it is that I control that via voice.  I don't watch that much TV, and most of what I watch I record and timeshift to watch later anyway, either for me or for my 10 year old.But in every respect, this is a solid hit.  Worth the money to me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2013"}

There is a known issue with older 60-80gb models where it freezes right after the initial loading menu after the intro movie. So I had to use my brothers PS3 to play this. Be forewarned, this *is* a very real bug that will never be patched by Sega because they don't listen to anyones feedback. If you own any Slim model or most of the 40/120-160gb models, I'm almost 100% positive you'll be fine.Now for the review. This game has a severe learning curve. This is one of those rare games where the battle system is nearly as complicated as a chess match and sometimes as frustrating as playing a chess match with Deep Blue. You *need* to do the tutorials provided you in the Arena when you first start out or else follow an in-depth online battle guide or you will FAIL, and you will do so hard.Why am I making it sound like it's a game not even worth playing because it's so hard? Well, I'm actually trying to provide proof for why this specific JRPG deserves to be played more than most. Resonance of Fate has a very intrigueing world, some good characters, and a mediocre story. You most likely won't be talking about it after you beat it much though. The questing, adventuring, and rebuilding a dead world is what makes you want to play. You play the game in chapters(16 to be precise) and are given a story mission to complete for each before you're allowed to proceed to the next chapter. The game is linear in that way, but you can do a number of side-quests, a 500-battle deep Arena, and many dungeons to grind your level as much as your JRPG-loving(or hating) heart desires. In fact, most of this *needs* to be done. At the very least, you need to grind some levels to make the game easier. This isn't like Dragon Quest though. You can reasonably grind 10-20 levels for each character in less than an hour if you know what you're doing.Leveling in this game is quite novel actually. You don't gain levels by just winning battles, you do so by doing damage with certain weapon types(of which there are 3: Machineguns, Hand Guns, and Granades). The more damage you do to enemies around or higher than your level, the more experience you gain for that weapon type. As each type levels, you gain max health and the ability to carry heavier weapons and eventually even dual-wield guns making for some extreme damage potential later in the game. It's actually part of how you exploit the leveling system. Each of the three characters specializes in one of the three weapon types and by using their other, weaker types to level, you actually buff up your overall level. You effectively using the stunning weapon type, which is machine-guns, to make it so that the other two characters can just cause tons of damage on high level enemies and it buffs them up quite quickly.The combat system is much too vast for me to explain here, but I will say this. I played the game for nearly 20 hours before I finally got every aspect of it down pat. I can honestly say I'm as close to an expert on it as I'll ever likely want to be and it's made my life with this game so much the better for it. There are many ways to kills enemies, some you may never use at all. The farther you get in the game, however, the more choices begin to open up. Early on you are limited by how many Hero Actions you can do, but you get more things called Bezels in the game that effectively increase how many actions you can take without putting yourself at risk. This allows you to better make use of things like Tri-attacks. Without explaining any of those terms, just know that it's important to know what situation to use what abilities. You can't just go willy-nilly with this game and run straight at a monsters face with guns-a-blazin'. That's a sure fire way to get yourself dead. D-E-D dead. So dead you'll likelly wonder how much it would cost to ship this game back to Sega via Patriot Missle.I have to point out the importance of learning the system and the enjoyment/satisfaction you will attain from doing so though. It's a rare game that makes me want to learn its deepest and darkest secrets. It is amazing to me the balance though. You can(and will) become godlike by the end of the game, but most of the game is a fight for your life. By chapter 6 or so, I was doing fine and not having too much trouble, but later zones in the game always bring higher level foes that can do massive damage if you feel as though you can go back to slacking in your playstyle.It's just too bad the script and story plotting is done at such an average level. This world that the game resides in is fascinating and the characters are interesting. Sadly, the chapter structure that works so well for the gameplay design shoots the story in the foot because it's told in short and simple cutscenes sandwiching the beginning and end of each. It's not The Last Rebellion or Enchanted Arms bad mind you, but it isn't going to win you over like FFVII either.This game grew on me a great deal over the course of a couple of weeks. As I got better I began to realize how special the battle system is in a lot of ways. Very few jrpgs give you this level of depth(Demon Souls comes to mind and as much as people seem to want to hate it, FFXIII to a certain degree). For the asking price right now, it is more than worth purchasing and giving a chance if you're looking for a great next-gen jrpg. We have to take what we can get in that department right now anyhow.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-03-2011"}

Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"Almost to Unreal","reviewText":"The Unreal Tournament series has been around for years.  Generally having a welcome home on PC's the third incarnation works on changing that.  Unreal Tournament 3 is a beautiful and fast paced shooter that has been perfectly ported over to the Playstation 3 console.From the very get go this game gives you several different options.  I want to cover all of these so you can become more familiar with what you want out of the game.  Many look at the Unreal Tournament as an online only style shooter.  I will tell you that it is much more than that.The game actually has a story based mode.  This is little less on the story and generally a great way to get people into the game and familiar with the game modes.  So if you are expecting an involved story you should probably go elsewhere.  You get all the difficulty settings from casual to very hard.  For someone like me who has never played Unreal Tournament I played casual to get more familiar with the game.  One thing I can say after playing the story for several hours it is not simple on any level.  The A.I. is actually excellent giving me more of a challenge than I ever expected.Next the game has instant action where you can go from death match to team death match and the other true favorites like capture the flag.  There are other game types available also.  This instant action is played against the bots who provide plenty of competition.  This is also another great way to improve your skills before you take on the real competition.Now is the most interesting part and that is the online.  This game provides an almost seamless online experience as you can take on 15 others in some matches.  What keeps this game fresh is the incredible amount of maps that never get old.  The game modes also provide for frantic fun.  The game play is incredibly fast paced which is unlike any shooter I have ever played.If you are looking for a fun sci-fi shooter that is non-stop action then Unreal Tournament 3 should be up your ally.  This game has been done perfectly on the PS3.  From the incredible graphics to the amazingly quick game play.  It's hard not to get addicted to the fun in this game.

This part is actually made by Microsoft itself and comes in at quite a chunk of change on its own.,So if you remove that costing, these natty stereo cans are quite reasonably priced.At the time of writing I'm still not 100% sure if the xbox one is outputting true 5.1 surround yet and if it is, is it passing it through the controller? My gut says no, but then I still use my 360 more than the one so perhaps I haven't spent enough time with my shiny new toy.Set up is super easy and once you've updated everything you simply plug the adapter into your controller and the phones into the adapter. You're now ready to play and frankly this is a great, simple way to have wireless sound.Audio wise things are what you'd expect from a sub $100 set of headphones - more like sub fifty dollars if you subtract the standalone cost of the adapter. Will you be blown away? Possibly not. But for most of us the sound is perfectly fine and certainly preferable to in TV speakers.They fit snug as others have mentioned but nothing too terribly tight even in gaming marathons. The microphone isn't adjustable per se but can be removed. There's also no in ear chat monitoring which means you won't hear your voice as you speak. Again this is caused by Microsoft's decisions and not something Turtle Beach can fix.For the price this is a very inexpensive entry level set of great-sounding cans that are super easy to connect and do what's claimed on the box.

The biggest con is the automatic fighting, which 1st person shooter fans may not like, but as this is an rpg, I don't mind it at all.

Not to say that Black Ops II is a bad game, because it isn't its very decent. The single player experience was pretty stale, it was pretty much the same thing I saw in Black Ops 1 and Modern Warfare 3. The main story was pretty short, and despite all the hooplah about important choices effecting the outcome they really didn't. Other than a few dialogue changes. One thing that seemed better though was that it felt like they finally put a cap on the infinite re-spawning enemies. While the story and voice acting are definitely good there are still some very tongue in cheek kind of moments. (Spoilers!) Like charging a double barreled tank on horseback??? really? Another bit that left much to be desired were the side missions with the main story. While I could see that the developers really tried to mesh in a real time strategy feel to it in the end you'll find yourself running and gunning as you would usually do.The multiplayer was pretty much the same experience I've seen in past Call of Duty titles. With the most frustrating return being bad maps. All maps feel claustrophobic which really effects the overall game play. Instead of using teamwork and strategy to win the day, your reduced to camping or running around constantly only to hope that you come across someone while their backs are turned. The weapons load-out though has some nice new touches. Such as the ability to use more perks or add more attachments to your weapons. With that the leveling is pretty much the same as it was in Black Ops I. As you level higher you unlock more camo, weapons, care packages and so on. One thing that I really liked though was the ability to customize your own in-game gamertag. I've seen some very creative stuff while online. In the end is seems they did everything good, except the maps for multiplayer.In the end it reach the hype around it and left me unsatisfied. The Zombies bit of the game offered the most fun for me, but wasn't enough to make me like it more. Perhaps next time we'll see something better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"Surely, THE Game of this Console Generation.","reviewText":"What is there to be said that has not already been discussed about Rockstar Games newest addition to the library; Grand Theft Auto V? Everything you saw from the first game play teaser to the last TV spot are all true. What you see is what you get, and then some. The fifth installment to the notorious Grand Theft Auto series delivered so many goods on so many spots that it's almost unbelievable to say this game is almost near video game perfection. If nothing else, it's a technological achievement and already a worthy game of the year winner.The setting is the much loved revisited San Andreas area that has increased tenfold with beautiful HD visual flair. The player will notice immediately that the game is brighter, more attractive, and varied compared to GTA IV's Liberty City. Within the sprawling and busy streets of Los Santos to the more desert ridden towns surrounding the Alamo Sea, to the mountainous outskirts of Vinewood Hills, there is so much detail presented that sometimes I had to sit still and watch the interaction between the game's AI and the environment. It's as if Rockstar literally took pictures of Los Angeles and California and just focused on recreating what they saw in every possible way. There is even an underwater environment marking a first for the GTA series and I think Rockstar Games!New to the GTA franchise is the ability to play not only as one criminal protagonist, but three. A new character swap feature is introduced allowing the player to switch on the fly (sometimes respectfully situational) while playing the single player story mode. Not only did Rockstar create three different personalities, but settings for each one as well. Michael is a retired thief under witness protection who is trying to deal with his extremely dysfunctional family. Franklin is a common thug from the streets who befriends Michael in hopes of earning better scores instead of just being a gang hustler. Trevor is a past associate of Michael's where a heist went wrong...and he's a complete psychopath. All three are a treat to play as seeing and hearing their perspectives while running around in San Andreas. While you are playing as one character, the other two will be doing something completely different. For example, while doing a solo mission with Franklin, Michael might be dropping his wife off at a mall, while Trevor is throwing somebody off a bridge into oncoming traffic. Instead of the same rinse and repeat cut scenes, Rockstar actually took the time to make switching between characters entertaining. Trevor being the most notorious, you'll never know what they might be doing at that moment. This actually helped keep the single player from ever being dull. When playing through the game, I couldn't help but want to see the three different perspectives while on missions. Also new to the franchise are the heist mechanics. GTA V's mission structure will seem linear to many, but it's these  crime movie/tv inspired moments where the single player shines.  You are able to select from two missions paths and select who you want on your crew for various jobs. Go in on a jewel store robbery aggressively, or choose the subtle approach and subdue everybody inside with knockout gas. Adding to the experience are a vast amount of side missions and activities for these three to partake. Tennis, darts, races, biking, target practice, stock exchanging, property management, assassinations, bar hopping, in game TV/movie watching, car customization, to name a few.Animations and textures are vastly improved with Rockstar's Euphoria engine. Characters feel more realistic making each one you encounter unique from each other. For an open world game, the motion capture and immense variety of dialogue presented here is phenomenally detailed. Even during mission cut scenes I could not take my eyes and ears off the action and character interactions. A fair warning for those who are sensitive to vulgar dialogue, intense violence, and gratuitous nudity: there is a plentiful amount here that staples GTA V's M rating. This is no way a game to be played for the immature crowd. Do everybody a favor and be mindful when playing this game. Also, don't be that jerk who would buy this for kids. GRAND THEFT AUTO V IS A GAME FOR ADULTS.One of the strong suits GTA V utilizes for game play's sake is the conglomeration of the past Rockstar games. Driving vehicles is arguably improved upon and feels like you are playing Midnight Club rather than dealing with a \"realistic\" but aggravating approach much like how GTA IV intended. I'll admit it felt a bit \"arcadey\" at first, but I immediately welcomed this change as I was actually driving to my destinations without crashing into everything accidentally (Don't worry, traffic can be unpredictable as I still have random crashes. Some intentional). The shooting/aim, cover, and weapon wheel system, respectfully inspired from Max Payne 3 and Red Dead Redemption, allow you to control and select weapons faster and strategically during any fire fight. The auto-aim feature returns (you can turn it off) and is less stingey from GTA IV. Also surfacing from Red Dead Redemption is the Strangers and Freaks interactions. While touring around San Andreas, you can randomly meet people that have simple requests for your to perform which can actually effect the game for that character permanently. Help two store robbers with a getaway and you might be able to add them to your future heist crew. Get a rich guy to the airport on time, and he could give you insight on what is a good stock option.Of course, there are limitations keeping GTA V from being that perfect crime open world game. Heists are very few. You'll wish Rockstar packed a few more in so your characters could earn more money when needed. Some of the strangers and freaks situations can happen at the wrong time, let's say while you are already being chased by the cops. Speaking of the police, THEY ARE RELENTLESS in this game. A two star chase could turn into a 3 star one where simply getting away from police  helicopters can be aggravating instead of engaging. Although the radio stations do provide a good amount of variety, I found that not having the player custom made music station an opportunity missed. It worked well with GTA IV's PC port. Speaking of radio stations, sorry Heavy Metal fans, there is none here...for some reason. Some of the vast open world parts, although still detailed, can seem barren with nothing to do except drive and run around. I wished some of the mission paths lead to these parts so the every area in the game is utilized fully. Near the end, I thought one of the character's dialogue focuses became redundant, wishing he would just move on. Also, (SLIGHT SPOILER) I wasn't too keen that about having the decision when deciding the fate of my characters. Since the game was designed for these three to run rampant on San Andreas, why would you want to kill off one of them? Don't' worry, there is another choice which I think the majority of GTA V players went with. It's nice to have a choice for three possible endings, but I think it really wasn't needed here.Regardless of the nitpicky things I could point out while playing GTA V, I immediately forgot and forgave and found something else to attract my attention to while in game. There is so much to do for a single player game. I clocked my single player story play through at 44 hours with side activities and missions I have yet to finish and continue for my end game portion. For $59.99 and that amount of time I spent playing, I can't help but feel I got a better deal here than I ever did with any of the Mass Effect games and Saint's Row the Third. The best part, the multiplayer portion, Grand Theft Auto Online, is not even out yet (All owners of GTA 5 receive this free of charge, will be released October 1st, may come back and add to review). Grand Theft Auto V has become literally what I call the official example of what to expect from future open world games. Do yourself a favor, if you are of mature mind who loves crime dramas and a time consuming open world game to play in, pick this title up. Whatever price this game will be when you do, it will be worth every penny spent. You'll be wanting to come back for more.****UPDATED 10/1/2013 Online Review still in progress:Well, I still could not connect, but I was able to do a solo session just to see the intro and be able to run around. However, you can't do anything mission related. You can get money and XP, but you have to kill/steal and lose the cops.However, here is what is really hurting my liking of it so far:Character customization is an absolute joke. Now I know Rockstar's history of these for open world games haven't been the best, but you would think they would at least try to compete against Saint's Row on this front. I'm not talking about super detailed because the gameplay is what matters most, but here, I don't think you will get the character looks YOU want. IV's customization was limited, but here it's a strange story. I felt that to only really get somebody that looks different was to spam the random button till something looked okay. I have John Marsten as a father, but the grandma and grandpa selection to change how you look was stupid. The whole heritage thing, is finicky and restrictive. The lifestyle, I don't understand. Because if you put more in one category, it can change how you look. Like a random huge sun hat because you lounge or something. Overall, it's a strange system to me.I think they made in game options worse now. When in Game, the start button is completely disabled. which you think would be the way to press start to see the whole map, then to see if your friends are online regardless if they are playing GTA V or not, then invite them that way. At least when you used your phone in a multiplayer game, you saw your contacts via XBlive anyway.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2013"}

For one, just like all other games in the TW series, it uses real global maps (it always bugged me that the Civ games never did this) and this time instead of all of you rservice building being built within you cities, they are built nearby and some should be garrisoned.The diplomacy screen is a little more robust this time around but another and big addition to the TW series is the tech tree.What made or broke your nation in the Civ series was your technology and TW is taking this play right out of the playbook.As far as the diplomacy screens, you really have to know who is tied into who because going to war with one nation could trigger at least 2 or 3 other of their allies to come fight against you.  I experienced that the first night I decided to Fight france and in less than an hr, Sweden was annihilated, HAHA!If you have played any other games in this series, you already know what to expect and what to do but there are new nuances such as field promotions and the ability to get new soldiers right to you instead of having them rcreated at your site of creation. The sea battles are most fun because you have more control over ship to ship battles. One hint I will recommend is when fighting even if out numbered, it's best to get 2 or 3 ships to gang up on one and sometimes it will help even the odds, what's even more cool is you can now board a ship and take it over!So, is this game fun?But of course it is and it's not too resource hungry.My only biggest gripe is because it's a Steam product is that it takes forever and a day to install on your machine but at least once it is installed, you can run it without the disk.The buggest caveat however is, if you aren't logged in, you can't play it!!!!I highly recommend this game to those who have enjoyed the TW series and strategy games in particular The game is taking steps that Civ needs to take and pretty soon I can see the TW series possibly carving out it's own niche of strategy gamers who want more realistic play.This game makes me wonder how much longer will it be before we see a modern era (WWII or Viet nam anyone) startegy game of this vein? Or heaven forbid a TW game/Company of Heroes hybrid!  LOLHere is to wishful thinking!In the meantime, pick this up and play it and yes, there are a few annoying bugs like soldiers not always following commands or the such but you can't deny this is so far the best to come about since Rome TW.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2009"}

Most are plastic, of course, but little is done to give this one any texture, weight, or character.  I've had packaging material that was more noteworthy.The difficulty for me, I suppose, was that I was coming from aLogitech G9 Laser Mouse, which has a body you can switch out according to the hand feel you desire, and an adjustable weight system.  I don't mean to compare the two, as they're from completely different classes, but it is worth pointing out that the transition from one to the other made for a disappointing experience.The X5 may well be the entry level gaming mouse for Microsoft.  Right on the exterior of the box, you're greeted by a comparison chart between this model, and theMicrosoft SideWinder Gaming Mouse, a closely priced alternative that includes adjustable weights and an LCD display.  It shouldn't have to feel like an entry level option though, and it absolutely does.As a performer?  I have no complaints.  The side buttons (which feel a little like wobbly posts) are well placed and, well, functional.  It's a relatively large mouse, providing a more 'full' feel in the hand (not unlike theLogitech G5 Laser Mouse (931376-0403)) than the G9 I lost to use and abuse.  Over just under a month, I've given this mouse a lot of use, and to its credit, I stopped thinking about the fact that it was new and different a few days in.  Which is to say that it didn't stand out enough to bother me, it performed well enough that I was never distracted by it.Frankly, I'm not sure what else to ask of a mouse in this price range.  If you're more concerned about the price than the 'feel,' this may be a solid option for you.  After all, when this one dies, I'll feel like I got my money's worth, when the G9 bowed out after 6 months of use because of a problem with the connection between the cable and the mouse body itself, I didn't feel like I had received my money's worth.  So it's all relative.Will I buy another one of these when this one goes?  No, probably not.  I miss the weight, feel, and at least perception of quality craftsmanship I got with the Logitech mice.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0022TNO7S","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"I had a dream of my wife. She was dead, but it was alright.","reviewText":"You know that feeling you get when you hear another Twilight, Transformers, or Adam Sandler movie is coming out? That's how I felt when I saw the box art for Max Payne 3 a couple of years ago. Then I found out my beloved Remedy was having no hand in its creation, and I was even more...well, disgusted, to be honest. Why resurrect a franchise that doesn't need another iteration? The second Max Payne ended the story sufficiently enough, right? Well yeah, it did. But regardless of whether or not it was wanted or needed, the world now has Max Payne 3, and it is excellent. Of any studio that could have gotten their hold on Max Payne, I can't really imagine anyone besides Rockstar doing it justice.Max Payne is an aging, angry, drunk, pill-popping ex-cop with a dead family and a lot of bullets in his gun. I think the weakest overall part of Max Payne 3 is that like I said, this game really isn't necessary. And because of that, the game jumps back to various points in his past in order to establish how he went from being a fixture in every bar in New York City to working a security detail in Sao Paolo, Brazil. That part of the plot feels forced. Rockstar obviously needed to do something to explain the shift in setting, and they did it as well as they could have, but if I had a complaint, it would be that. Or to say it another way, if this game had never been released, I would be okay with that. It's very entertaining in multiple ways, but unnecessary. Kind of like Halo 4 coming out. Not really needed. However, I don't mind if games aren't needed and come out anyways, as long as they aren't lazy and obviously only to make a lot of money.So on to the game. The levels are varied, there are multiple involving vehicles, the graphics are excellent, and it even pays homage to the previous two games, which any Max Payne 1 and 2 fans will appreciate. Rockstar even did a sort of comic-book-cutscene hybrid that works well enough. Throughout all of the many cutscenes in the game though, when Max is narrating, some of the words he or others say will flash up on the screen, and most of the time it feels kind of useless. When I first started playing I thought for sure there was going to be some revelation at the end of the game, where it flashes back to all of the things that were written and it all sort of comes together and makes sense. But it becomes apparent pretty quickly that it's purely for the style the game was trying to capture, and that they don't really mean anything aside from adding atmosphere.As with the previous games, this one has a very dark sense of humor, and some of the lines in it were particularly good. If you aren't familiar or just don't like noir in general, you might not like or understand the game. All of Max Payne's narration is over the top, and the writing is pure gold. There are so many lines that made me laugh, but even comedy aside, the story is excellent. And while it's not realistic for one man to kill hundreds (if not thousands) of people trying to kill him right back, the story itself is realistic enough.The graphics, as mentioned, are also superb. There are many instances of overexposure or disjointed image quality, illustrating how messed up Max is because of all the painkillers and alcohol. It's really an atmosphere thing, and they aren't used so much it becomes irritating. Gunplay is also great fun. I haven't had this much fun targeting specific body parts since Grand Theft Auto IV (also Rockstar). This is going to seem really petty, given that the game is nearly flawless, but for all the blood and realistic way in which bullets interact with the people you're shooting, I was surprised and (very) slightly disappointed that it wasn't possible to actually shoot off specific body parts. I assume it must have something to do with how complex the bullet/body physics of the game already are, and it's really only a very mild point.The health system is the same as the previous two games, which I was actually surprised and quite happy about. Instead of entering a red state when taking too much damage and waiting for it to pass under cover, there is a small representation of Max's body in the lower right hand corner that fills up with red after each time you get shot. If you have painkillers and take enough damage to fill it up completely, you'll enter Man-Down State, in which you find yourself on your back and have to shoot the person who last shot you. It is quite well done, and feels very natural. The rest of the enemies will be much more grey and unassuming, while the one you are supposed to shoot will still be colored, so it's usually not too difficult. If you have no painkillers and take too much damage, you just die. When you play the game on Old School difficulty, however, Man Down State is disabled, and if you take too much damage, you die, just as the first two games. Very challenging.Just like the first two games, this one also has controls that can be frustrating at times, especially when you're trying to exit cover and run in a particular direction. For some reason, you'll run in the opposite direction you intended if you try to do things too quickly. But not doing it quickly enough of course, means more time you're spending absorbing enemy bullets. On harder difficulties, it is easily the biggest negative aspect of the game, but to be honest, I didn't mind so much, because the sluggish (at times) controls reminded me of the first two games.If this is your Max Payne game, you won't be lost. Pretty much all relevant backstory is explained in the opening cutscene, and the edges are more defined during flashbacks to his past. Overall this is one of the best games I've played so far this year, and if you're a fan of the series already, noir, shooting, pill-popping, excessive drinking, bad dance music, or making things blow up real good, you should probably at least give this game a rent. It's worth your time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVV8","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"The Sweet Incense of Childhood!","reviewText":"[UPDATE:  Exciting news for those who love this game!  \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" has been vindicated at LONG LAST!  Nintendo has officially revealed that \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" began life as a prototype sequel to the original \"Super Mario Bros.\", even before \"The Lost Levels\", and was the intended second game in the series from the start.  Apparently Nintendo were having issues with the prototype (as they were trying to implement co-op game play, a series mechanic that would not see fruition until \"New Super Mario Bros. Wii\" from 2009, and developed \"The Lost Levels\" and published that on the Famicom Disk System in the mean time.  Fuiji Television approached Nintendo to develop a product for their 1987 Dream Event, so Nintendo took the existing Mario 2 sequel and released it in conjunction with Fuiji's promo event.(Also be sure to check out the Nintendo Power two part guide given away for free back in the late 1980s for NP subscribersSuper Mario Brothers 2 Inside Out [Nintendo Power])However, the important part is that not only was \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" a Mario game right from the start, Miyamoto and his team began developing the game BEFORE \"The Lost Levels\" as the intended sequel to \"Super Mario Bros.\"!  So for all you out there who say \"Super Mario 2\" isn't even a real Mario game, you have been proven wrong.  Not only that, Miyamoto himsmelf said in E3 2012 that, along with \"Super Mario Bros.\", \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" is his favorite game in the entire Mario series.  Can't get much higher praise than that!  Mike London 10-1-2012]When \"Super Mario Brothers 2\" was released in the US in 1988, the game became an instant hit with gamers.  What makes SMB2 so strange is how utterly and drastically different the game really is from its predecessor,Super Mario Bros., which is one of the pivotal cornerstones of the gaming industry.  The game is expertly crafted (little surprise in that regard given it is a Miyamoto title), and just a great platformer with Mario quality, if not exactly Mario gameplay, written all over it..Like most Nintendo franchises that began in the 1980s, the second installment in the series was incredibly weird and very different from the original.  Case in point.Castlevania II: Simon's Quest.Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.  \"Super Mario Brothers 2\".Mega Man 2.  (Okay, I'm kidding about Mega Man 2.  Mega Man is the one series that DOES NOT CHANGE AT ALL.  Capcom remadeMega Manfive times, and then moved it to the X series and remade that a bunch more times).Instead of jumping on turtles and goombas, trying to reach high scores, timed levels, SUPER MARIO 2 had absolutely nothing to do with the original game.  It's like Mario is on a bad acid trip.  There's transgendered, sexually confused birds shooting eggs (Birdo), mice that throw bombs and sport sunglasses, a weird, occultic, socially inept brotherhood that wears masks and robes, demonic phantos guarding keys, and a giant lizard who styles himself as a king takes control of people's dreams (Freddy Krueger anyone?).  Given the previous game, \"Super Mario 2\" is easily the weirdest of the main Mario series, make no mistake.  The gameplay from SMB2, other than platforming, has absolutely nothing in common with the original SMB.  You throw enemies at one another, throw vegetables, fight weird enemies, blow up walls with bombs, etc.Although the Americans didn't know it at the time, Nintendo wasn't really releasing  SMB2.  By now this game's origins in well known, but back in the 1980s most gamers would have been shocked to realise that Nintendo took a preexisting game called DOKI DOKI PANIC, replaced the vaguely Arabian characters (one who was visibly pregnant) with Mario sprites, changed a few other sprites, rework the ending some, but otherwise leaving the game mechanics and the levels alone.Nintendo had already released a SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2 in Japan, but that game was much like the second quest of Zelda, a much harder version of what is ultimately the same game.  When it came time to release a SMB2 in America, the upper management bulked because of the Japanese title's extreme difficulty and remarkable similarity to the first SMB.  Howard Lincoln, at the time in charge of the North America division of Nintendo (and for you oldschool Nintendo Power readers, he's one half of the title characters comic strip \"Howard and Nestor\") also hated the Japanese SUPER MARIO 2.  So they opted to release another game in its stead.Enter YUME Kojo: DOKI DOKI PANIC (rough translation: \"Dream Factory: Heart Pounding Panic\").  Developed in cooperation with Fuji Television in promotion of Dream Factory '87, an event promoting Fuji's new television shows and other projects, DOKI DOKI PANIC, the game features a family of four characters who had to rescue these two lost children. In the game's intro, two children are reading from a book, when a giant hand grabs the children's faces and drags them into the book.  The children's pet monkey, Chim Chim, runs and grabs the Arabian family, who also just happened to be the mascots of the Dream Factory '87 promotional event. Convenient, that.  The family was Imagin (the son, replaced by Mario), Lina (Imajin's little sister, replaced by Princess Toadstool), Mama (who is clearly pregnant, with one of her hands clearly protecting her belly during gameplay; she was replaced by Luigi), and Papa (replaced by Toad).  The family enters into the world of Subcon to beat Wart (Mamu, as he is known in Japan, as well as the 1993 gameboy Zelda title LINK'S AWAKENING, his only other appearance in a Nintendo game).  Other than the family, all game characters were developed by Nintendo.Now, what are the differences?  I won't list them all here (google Doki Doki Panic and you'll find plenty of sites detailing the differences between SMB2 and Doki).  Actually, other than some graphical changes, none of the changes really effects gameplay with two major exception.  All four main characters are identical to their Doki counterparts.  The B-button super speed run was added to SMB2.  Nintendo replaced the storyline of having two kids kidnapped to Wart capturing Subcon people and Mario having to free them.  Still, the replacement storyline fits in with the original dreamworld association that was associated with Doki Doki (which, after all, means Dream Factory).The first of the two major differences between Doki Doki is that to see the end of the game, you must beat it with all four characters.  The four characters have savable progress, and when you clear the game with all four then the ending displays.  The second major difference is the replacement of Mouser in World 5-3 (his third appearance as the world end boss) with Clawgrip, a character exclusive too SMB2.What does this all have to do with our perception of SMB2 today?  As SMB2's origins have become common knowledge to video game enthusiasts and Nintendo fans (I found out in the late 1990s), a lot of people have put down this game due to it not being a Mario game to begin with.  But back in the 1980s and 1990s, before DOKI DOKI became well known, the general critical consensus was SMB2, though a vast departure from the original, was a very fun, well-executed game on its own right.  The game is among the highest selling Nintendo games of all time, with only SMB and SMB3 outselling the title on the original NES.  When they reissued SMB2 in 2001 as SUPER MARIO ADVANCE, the title sold very well also, and is the highest selling title in the ADVANCED series.There is another factor to consider.  Despite what the purists say, Shigeru Miyamoto was heavily involved in the development of this game, and actually had nothing to do with the Japanese SMB2.  As DOKI DOKI was to be a one-off promotional item for Fuji's Dream Factory, there has been some well-founded speculation Nintendo was planning this to be a Mario title the whole time and wanted to test the game by releasing it in Japan first.  The packaging on DOKI has a picture of Mario and Imagin together.While it is true SMB3, this game's sequel, reneged on most of SMB2 game mechanics, opting to return to the original SMB for its primary inspiration, most of SMB2's enemy characters became permanent cast members in the Mario echelon.Overall, though not originally released as a Mario title, for all gamers outside of Japan, this is what we think of as SMB2.  Playing thru the LOST LEVELS, which we finally got on the Virtual Console on October 1, 2007 (21 years after the fact), I'm glad Nintendo did what it did.  And since Nintendo did release a separate SMB2, we know have four NES Mario titles.  Mea culpa.  Fortunate accident.For my money, SMB2 is one of my all time favorite games.  I have distinct memories of trying to get SMB2 for the NES but couldn't because it was selling out so fast.  This was the big game of Christmas 1988, and you were a lucky kid indeed that had this game under their Christmas treeFor me, it is the one game, even more than SMB, that brings back the sweet incense of childhood and long bygone days I often times wish I could return too.  I have played and beaten the game countless times, but every time I go thru it I just feel transported back to my childhood.And for that mere fact, SUPER MARIO BROTHERS 2 is a truly priceless game.--------------Bonus Content: I have decided to include bonus content for this review.  The first section  is additional information I have assembled for the game that is separate from the review proper.  The second is an unreleased article about \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" and its relation with \"The Lost Levels\" written back in the late 1990s.Section 1:  It has become well known that \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" was not originally a Mario game. According to many sources, what Nintendo employee blocked the release of Japanese version of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" (known outside Japan as \"The Lost Levels\") due to the high challenge and gimmick-filled gameplay. This decision led to Nintendo adapting \"Doki Doki Panic\" into a Mario game.  Howard Lincoln, president of the North American Branch of Nintendo, made that decision.\"Super Mario Bros. 2\" has long been one of my favorite NES titles from childhood. It is well known now (though not back in the 1980s and early 1990s) that \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" began life originally as a game called \"Doki Doki Panic\" for the Famicom Disk System. The Japanese FDS version of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" is pretty much a clone of the original, only with slightly modified graphics and a much more difficult game.Nintendo would not publish the original Famicom Disk System outside of Japan for over twenty one years. The game first appeared in 1986 in Japan, and America and the PAL region did not get the original 8-Bit version until 2007 for the Virtual Console.Another famous Howard in Nintendo lore is Howard Phillips who appears in the early issues of \"Nintendo Power\" in the comic strip \"Howard and Nestor\". There is also a photograph of Phillips next to a TV that has the main title screen of the (American-European) \"Super Mario Bros. 2\".Published in 1987 for the Famicom Disk System, Nintendo published \"Doki Doki Panic\" for Fuji Television. The game was to promote Yume Kj '87 (translates Dream Factory '87), and included Fuji's mascots. Overall, the levels from Doki Doki Panic were left alone. The majority of the changes were swapping out sprites and cosmetic changes.When Nintendo released \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" in Japan as a Mario game rather than the non Mario \"Yume K'j': Doki Doki Panic\", they marketed the game as the American \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" and released the game as \"Super Mario Bros. USA\". The only difference between the American version and this version is a different title screen.There is a slight level change in one level. In 7-2, in the cloud section there is a portion of the stage where you must go back and forth on stationary cloud platforms that are stacked on top of one another in order to get to a ladder that has a column blocking access. In \"Doki Doki Panic\", there is an additional cloud platform, with a small column with a Snifit sitting on top. The most probable reason Nintendo removed this platform was even with the Mario and Toad character a super jump could completely bypass the cloud section and the player could simply jump over the column to get to the blocked off ladder.The original characters are a family, with two parents with one son and one daughter. Mario replaced Imajin, the average skilled brother. Luigi replaced Mama. The Princess replaced Lina, the sister. Toad replaced Papa. There is speculation that Mama appears to be pregnant.When Nintendo adapted \"Yume Kojo: Doki Doki Panic\" into \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", they replaced the third Mouser with a new boss character, Clawgrip. Mouser appears the same as World 1-3, though his chamber is shaped differently and there are two sections with spikes on the floor.I remember my parents buying this game for me and being puzzled why Phanto looked different in the manual than he actually appears in the game. The reason is Nintendo published the \"Doki Doki Panic\" sprite in the manual, rather than the sprite that actually appears in the game. Phanto in \"Doki Doki Panic\" has small eyes and he is frowning. He does not look nearly as menacing as he does in \"Super Mario Bros. 2\". The game manual also includes pictures of the Magic Jar and the Heart sprite from \"Doki Doki Panic\".According to the manual, Clawgrip \"grows suddenly and is surprisingly skilled at throwing rocks\". It is possible this refers to some gameplay concept of Clawgrip that never got into the final game, as Clawgrip does not change sizes in the actual game.There were numerous errors in the Cast of Characters section of \"Super Mario Bros. 2\". Ostro, an ostrich that Shyguys ride, are given the name Birdo, and Birdo is labeled Ostro. Personally I believe this was a localization error, as the error was repeated in the game manual itself. Strangely enough, when Nintendo released \"Super Mario Allstars\" for the Super Nintendo, they did not correct this error, though they did correct it in the \"Super Mario Advance\" release. I remember back in the late 1980s all us gamers thought Birdo had two names, Birdo and Ostro, as Nintendo Power referred to Birdo as Birdo, not Ostro.The Albatros, the only flying bird in \"Super Mario Bros. 2\", appears to be Subcon's natural resident before the Wart invaded.Here is the game manual entry related to the Albatros. \"He used to be the only resident in the world of dreams. Now, by order of Wart, he works as a carrier of Bob-Ombs.\"In \"Doki Doki Panic\" he only has two frames of animation, making him appear to fly much faster. For the \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" conversion Nintendo added three more frames of animation, bring the total to five.-----Section 2: Super Mario Brothers 2: The Next Adventure (written in the later part of 1999).SMB2 is held as a classic in most video gaming circles.  And yet, it depends on what you are talking about, and, precisely, where you are doing the talking.  If you are in Japan, you are talking about a game that plays almost identical to the original, but much, much, more difficult.  If you are in the States, you are talking about a Japaness game that originally had nothing to do with the SMB saga.If I had to pick, I'd pick the States version any day.  In this game, you get to choose from four different characters, and make your way thru 7 worlds.  Very fun, although not incredibly challenging.  I grew up playing this game (Lugi is still the best).  We bought it when it first came out, and boy did it take forever to get it.  That game literally sold like hot cakes.  It was one of the most anticipated games that year, along side the ranks of Zelda II: The Adventure of Link.  However, public reaction to this game was very favourable, whereas to Zelda II it was not.  It was totally different from its prequel, and, honestly, that's what made that game so great.  Because of its differences from the rest of the Mario cannon, it stands alone.  I remember my brother, his best friend Nick, and I (and another boy Rammy) took turns playing it, and we watched as he tried to get past that wiley Wart.  In the end, of course, Mario triumphed, and it turned into nothing save a dream ....  (Is that the story line of some Zelda game?)  Anyway, it is still a classic game.In Japan, however, SMB 2 is totally different.  Imagine this: Super Mario Brothers, after beating the original game, a Second Quest, much like one of the more popular titles also had.  And this Second Quest, just like Nintendo's corresponding cash cow, was increased in difficulty.  Now we have SMB 2.  Basically, SMB 2 plays just like SMB 1.  Actually, I tend to think of these worlds as worlds 9-18.  Basically, they correspond in that difficulty.  If you think level 7 or 8 was hard on the original, just imagine what world 17 or 18 is!!  It truly is that difficult.Indeed, it was so difficult that it was damned to stay unreleased forever in the States on the original NES.  Also, they didn't htink the market could support it.  However, I have beat this game, and I can easily say that is the most difficult game I've ever beaten.  The whole thing is a total nightmare.  The difficulty level is totally absurd.  Its like Miyamoto and his team got together, and said \"Let's make a sequel to SMB, and its make it so frustratingly hard that the players will destroy their Famicoms in sheer rage.\"  It is truly that difficult.  Yet, if you do actually beat the game, you can stand in pride.  On Super Mario Allstars, five new worlds were added. If you went thru the first eight without warping, Level Nine opened up (which is totally an anomoly.  All water stages, save for the third).  Then, after that, worlds A-D can be transversed.  As I understand it (I didn't know this until just last night), these worlds were added to the Super NES version.  I beat them too.We have finally got as close to the original version as we'll ever see.  They released it with Super Mario Brothers Deluxe, and called it Super Mario Brothers for Super Players (you just have to get over 300,000 points.  I thought you had to get that and beat the game, so I was trying to do that, and didn't realize it was already opened).  I'd be really interested in buying a Japaness cart and play it on the Famicom.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2007"}

Those who side with good will get to follow Frodo's journey through Middle-Earth, playing in battles inspired by both the books and the movies. Or join evil to find out what may have happened if Frodo had failed to destroy the One Ring, as you fight your way with Sauron back across the map in an attempt to destroy Rivendell, the Shire, and all that is good in the world.You can play as a warrior, scout, mage or archer.View larger.The online multiplayer mode allows for massive battles with up to 16 of your friends.View larger.Building off the model Pandemic used with Star Wars: Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest provides you with a first and/or third person shooter style of game that not only lets you command strategy, but also lets you control the players in the center of the action. Participate in the Battle of Isengard as an Ent or fight Saruman at Orthanc as Gandalf himself. Take on the Nazgul as Aragorn while still protecting Frodo, or battle at Pelennor as a Rohirrim cavalry soldier. And that is just for the good guys!In Conquest you will have to play many different characters in order to win. And it isn't always such a balanced match, as you will find yourself destroying towering siege engines and taking on hulking oliphaunts with your companions. You can choose to play all the heroes you love, or fight as a Nazgul tasked with killing Frodo and stretch your powerful wings as the Balrog himself in your battle for Moria.Pick Your Own Style of PlayIn the game, you'll be able to play as one of four different character classes. Choose the melee-based Warrior or Scout for up-close action, or pick the Archer or Mage to perform devastating ranged attacks. There is also talk of a 'special' class called the Guardian to give gamers a third choice. But don't worry about getting locked in, as you can actually change which character class you're playing on the fly, in the middle of the game's various objective-based missions.Each class of characters has its own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique special abilities. Playable units range from grunt soldiers, which are the weakest, to captains, which are the strongest AI units in the game other than the heroes. You also get to order in air strikes using either eagles or fellbeasts. Even better, players will be able to mount the occasional horse, unless they've chosen evil, in which case they will have to master the skill of riding a fearsome warg.Multiple Modes for Endless FunAs in Battlefront, Lord of the Rings: Conquest has enormous competitive multiplayer modes, including Conquest, Capture the Flag, and Hero Deathmatch. In addition to these classics, Conquest adds a Ring Bearer mode, in which one player tries to stay alive as Frodo against a host of ringwraiths, and Stronghold in which you fight on various maps in a Risk-style battle for territories. Fortunately, you won't be limited to roaming around with only your teammates, however, as battles occur in large scale with non-player combatants joining in the fray.Conquest allows online play with up to 16 players for massive battles with all your friends, or in two-player cooperative mode. Players can also play locally with up to four players competitively, or two-player co-op on a split screen. When in the game itself, fans will get the thrill of hearing Howard Shore's score for the films accompanying the action, and both good and evil campaigns are narrated by Hugo Weaving, who played Elrond in the movies.You can choose to play either good or evil, each with different endings.","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"Lord of the Rings: The Frustration","reviewText":"LotR Conquest is a Battlefront copy using Tolkien skins and settings. It sounds like a good idea initially, but the delivery falls short of expectations in several areas.The game follows the plot of the novels, and also contains a second storyline detailing what would've happened if Frodo and Sam were killed just before reaching Mount Doom. The game follows a battery of 4 classes: scout, warrior, archer, and mage. All have there appropriate places, but you'll find yourself gravitating to warrior and archer 75-80 percent of the time. You also have the option of playing as a named character, such as Aragorn and Gandalf, for specific combats that take liberties with plot, but try to follow the spirit of the books. The missions are well narrated and many settings look like they were peeled off the movie screen.The problems begin in mission. Apparently the good people at Pandemic felt that the average intelligence and attention span of the average gamer has abysmally plummeted, and so repeats the current objective in a loud, obnoxious voice every 15-20 seconds. The missions consist of capture the flag, king of the hill, and assassination. The difficulty will skyrocket at various times when your army forgets where they are and what they're supposed to be doing, and you'll suddenly find yourself alone surrounded by 30 Uruk-Hai. The characters have a fair amount of power, and you can extricate yourself from these setups fairly easily, and one death won't end the mission.Combat is infuriating at times, as when you're struck in the back, its apparently with a battering ram, as you'll find yourself flying through the air and bouncing off the walls like a armored, pointy pinball. Its extremely easy to be knocked down repeatedly before managing to roll to a location where you can regain your feet.The multiplayer is where the game improves, but I'm reviewing this from a single player game, as this was portrayed more as a dynasty warriors or bladestorm incarnation in LotR settings. While Battlefront was okay, it doesn't work in this setup. I was also hoping that there'd be more named characters, that you'd be playing Arhcer #5 maybe 30% of the time and 70% of it as Theoden or Arathorn, rather than the reverse. Basically, get this if you like Battlefront and LotR, and avoid it otherwise. If there were more cutscenes or a better ingame story, it'd be worth it for the single player campaign, but aside from narrarated interludes, it almost devoid of story.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYILE","description":"","reviewerName":"Michael","summary":"For the older, more dedicated fans..","reviewText":"I played this game day and night upon release. Preordered it from Amazon, waited years for the day it would arrive. After promising titles from Rockstar that I will forever remember among my all-time favorites such as Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne 3, some of the earlier Grand Theft Autos.. I was expecting a lot out of this title- it promised character, wit, charm, amazing gameplay and story.. And for the most part, it succeeds. I can safely say I explored this game more than most, because Rockstar Social Club says I have around seventy hours in story mode alone, which this review will mainly be focused on.In short, it has a grand-- spectacular, rather open world, but a story and characters that lag behind.Let me begin by putting this out of the way: This game looks and runs fantastic. Not surprising, considering a rumored $300 million budget, but the graphics and lighting effects just compliment the 'modern day era' feel they were going for well- it's no longer the murky, moody and rather depressing one that Grand Theft Auto IV left in my mouth after I finished the storyline. The game looks downright gorgeous, with far drawing distance and lots of small detail. Just driving in the mountain side, looking and watching the weather, everything blends. This game is very detailed, both large and in small ways- look up some videos showcasing the world's small detail that just let you immerse yourself in it.Such great detail and care compliments the open-world environment quite well. This is more than likely because I'm assuming this was the main focus when developing the game.  I'll tell you why later in my review. For now, let me say that my seventy hours went into mainly the open world. Exploring it. Finding all it has to offer. Which, let me say: Is quite a lot. I downright LOVED the open world experience. There are a HUGE amount of easter eggs/secrets to find, as well as references to other television shows and movies. However, my favorite part of this game would have to be the way it so insanely pinpoints the modern era. Never before have I seen the game with such courage to tackle so many modern subjects.Let me emphasize this: the open world was the main focus.And it shows. There's around seventy strangers to meet, each accompanied by great cut scenes and favors to ask. And the thing is, contrary to most other open world side activites/stranger tasks.. GTA V presents it both highly cinematically and each character somehow portrays the attitude/general style of people in the United State's culture. With extreme accuracy. While some are just downright creepy, others are hilariously funny. The game rips into liberals, news reporters, fame and what it will do to you.. even people who believe immigration is wrong and assume all Hispanics are illegal. And again remember, there's a lot of these to find, each with their own fleshed out cutscenes, voice actors, and missions. Highly interesting to do and I enjoyed these very much!Apart from that, the open world is rich. There's everything here. Apart from your standard side activities, there's smaller things that are more unique and many STILL incorporate some form of satire of our modern culture. Just from exploring the world you'll see random strangers (well programmed and feel human) do stupid American things like texting too much, posting updates on the hilarious parody of twitter every five minutes, so forth. The open world is booming with character and charm, which I'll say-- it does have. There's plenty of side activities apart from the ones I've already mentioned: bounty hunting, firing range, delivering drugs, robbing, so forth; each for the most part, quite fun and well-made. There's much to do just exploring, but there's also several side activites that you'd expect. This is where most of my seventy hours went into. Don't rush through this game-- you'll be disappointed if you stick to the main storyline. Here's why.The story, coming from Rockstar, is highly disappointing. DON'T misunderstand me; it's by no means terrible or the worst I've seen. It's just hard to imagine that this is coming from some of the people that brought me amazing storylines such as Red Dead Redemption's. While the missions are fun and vary, in the end I felt like something was missing. No spoilers here. The characters had little to no character development, the story was rather bland and never took a great leap in any direction like I expected it to. The bank heists and the way you influence how you carry them out was a really neat and cool idea, and I enjoyed them.. But I felt like they were too easy and uninspired at times. While the game does go over the top with action, it just felt like something was missing, that grand finale I've come to expect from Rockstar. It's like they listed a bunch of cool ideas they wanted you to do in the story then worried about sewing them together later. While the singleplayer is good, it's by no means excellent or amazing. It's times like these I can't help but remember the dozens or even hundreds of people who sat in Rockstar's writing department and still couldn't make something as downright amazing as most expected for a story in this title.I was also slightly disappointed by the toned-down mechanics. While average players won't notice the difference nor mind if so, I dumped hundreds of hours into Red Dead Redemption, and the game's shooting mechanics felt free. No limitations, headshots left and right if you're good at the game (which such time I'd imagine made me so). While Grand Theft Auto V certainly still does this, your character feels restricted compared to what you could do in Red Dead.If you feel I don't like this game, I do. I'm just judging it harshly because I've come to expect so much out of Rockstar. Which they deliver, but not as well as I thought. People that call this the best game in the world or give it a solid five stars don't explore games much because otherwise they'd see this game, while quite good indeed, lets down in a few ways for the older fans.The game incorporates lots of cool ideas I'm sure you already know, such as switching through characters and whatnot, and these are neat-- but the open world is the best reason to give this game a try in my book. Still a must-buy, though!___A quick summary of the online portion: Nothing highly special here. It has some cool features, but it feels like they're executed average or below what they could have been. While there's certainly no denying the game's a blast with friends when doing stupid non-scripted events, the online can get a little dull at times.I just completely disliked the toned down mechanics the most here. I am used to Red Dead Redemption's freedom and how you can get instant headshots and so forth, how the most skilled player wins. That's all gone here. While the game does let you get headshots easily, your character feels sluggish, and it doesn't make much of a difference at times because sadly.. The one with the most money and most powerful weapon usually wins. This is the exact opposite of what Red Dead did, and I can't help but feel disappointed. If you're newer or average you won't mind but this was a slight letdown for me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2013"}

Read on for the entire review.The kit includes: Drums, Cymbals, Foot Pad, Wireless Receiver, wooden drumsticks, and PS3 Controller.  It comes double boxed and is quite large/heavy...which generally denotes that it is packaged well and is a solid product.The building of the kit is 75% completed in the box and thus your only job is to connect the cymbals, plug things in, connect the receiver, and adjust the height of the drum kit.  The PS3 controller requires 2 x AA batteries which are not included.  Simply put the unit together, plug the individual drums/cymbals/foot pad into the back of the ps3 controller using color coded plugs (both male and female are color coded), plug the receiver in to your PS3, and you are ready to rock.NOTE: This unit only works with Guitar Hero games and does not work with Rock Band.The play-ability of the drum set is perfect for any size individual since the height of the full unit and individual drumpads/cymbals can be adjusted.  That makes for easy sitting on a couch or a stool.  The quality of the pads makes for less of a plastic click sound as they are constructed of some rubber type material which keeps the noise down when you are drumming and playing the game.  Older drum sets made a lot of noise from plastic sticks hitting hard plastic pads.....thank you Logitech for fixing this.  The surface size of the pads is large enough that you wont be hitting the sides too often and thus your sticks and drums will last you for a long time to come.Pros:  Great quality, stylish look, excellent looking foot pedal, color coded wiring, and wooden drumsticks.Two Cons:One, it seems that the clips used to hold the legs/height into position are not tight enough and thus the unit tends to get lower after constant pounding while playing the game.  Its not a deal breaker as it is easily adjusted.Two, I am a bit disappointed that this drum set will not work with other games....I dont know why manufacturers/game developers have to tie hardware to their games.  If I own Rock Band and Guitar Hero I need a separate set of drums for both (that makes for a lot of extra space required).My overall rating is 4.5 on this, because it is a truly WONDERFUL piece of hardware.  My disappointment comes from the lack of being able to use it as just hardware because it is tied in with a game.

Now, for the first time, players can see true depth of their environment without the need for special glasses. Super Mario is a 3D evolution of classic Mario platforming featuring new level designs and challenges.","reviewerName":"M. Richardson","summary":"The First Real Must-Play 3DS Exclusive is Finally Here","reviewText":"Almost all of the excellent 3DS titles so far have been graphically upgraded ports of older games. They are fine as far as they go, but this system has been lacking a true stellar first-party title for a while now. Nintendo has finally remedied this with their latest Super Mario Bros. release, Super Mario 3D Land. Having obtained a copy of this game and played through it fully, I can say, in all honesty, that this is by far the highest quality Mario hand-held game ever released. As others have noted, this game is a kind of celebration of all things Mario, and it takes its inspiration from earlier titles in the series, most notably Super Mario 64 and Super Mario Bros. 3. I honestly can't find anything wrong with this game, aside from perhaps the strange Tanooki obsession that seems to have gripped the developers of this game, as EVERYTHING has a Tanooki tail in this game.While there is a relative lack of difficulty to be had in the game's first eight worlds, it is in the game's subsequent eight worlds of bonus content, which can be unlocked after completing the main campaign, that truly tests the more seasoned Mario veterans. With this said, however, the first eight worlds are still a wonder to play through, and there is a moderate level of difficulty to be had in locating all three of the stars in each level. This game seeks to please people of all skill levels, and if you are truly looking for a challenge, the game will deliver one.The power-ups here are far more inventive than I've seen in most Mario games of the past. Mario can, of course, still change into Fire Mario, who shoots enormous fireballs at his enemies. The Tanooki suit has, of course, returned, and I dare say you will probably play through most of the game with this power-up, as Tanooki leaves tend to be handed out like candy in the levels. The suit doesn't fly, unfortunately, but Mario can glide, tail whip, and, in the bonus worlds, briefly turn into a statue. A new one I've not seen before is the propeller power-up, which allows you to engage precision aerial tasks. Finally, there is the fantastic boomerang upgrade, which allows Mario to access previously unreachable items and to take out almost all enemies.One can also play as Luigi in this game after participating in the second set of eight worlds, which helps to spice up replays of this game nicely.The 3D effect is vital to fully enjoy the game here. It is utilized in such a way that it actually enhances gameplay! This intelligent usage of 3D is a good initial argument for the 3DS' 3D not being a mere beautiful gimmick.There is even an interesting use of the streetpass feature in this game. When your 3DS is in streetpass mode and you pass someone else with a 3DS, it has a chance of sending you a small bonus level that'll help you rack up more stars.Finally, but not lastly, there are three save slots here, something I appreciate immensely when giving the game to other people when they want to take it for a spin!The large amount of levels, steadily increasing difficulty, beautiful graphics, intelligent use of 3D, and compelling gameplay all make this game an absolute must-buy. Get this game! If you don't own a 3DS, then get one and get this game! Between this and the new Mario Kart, the 3DS should have a very strong holiday season.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2011"}

Colonna","summary":"For Only The Youngest Of Players","reviewText":"My overall perception is that this is a decent game.  A couple of things I want to mention at the outset of this review:1.  This game is has a rating of E (for Everyone) which is appropriate based on the rating index, but please note, this game will most likely be boring for most kids above the age of 8 or so.2. The game is for Wii U.  Like most game platforms, Wii U games CANNOT be played on a standard Wii console.  Most people know this, but just in case.The game itself is fun, again, for a younger player.  It is a bit pricey for the amount of game play.  A 10 or 12 year old who is familiar with video games will probably navigate the entire game in a few hours of play.  The theme of the game is that Smurfette has been kidnapped.  You can play as one of four Smurfs, in a co-operative mode if you like.  You start with a few Smurfs and can unlock others as you play.  You collect Smurfberries to aid in your quest.  Game play is on a scrolling background, from side to side.Although the Wii U platform has enhanced graphics compared to Wii, this game doesn't really take advantage of that.  Graphics are decent, but the backgrounds, \"worlds\", etc are lackluster.  A couple of the backgrounds are nicely done, but overall.....eh.That said, for a very young child, maybe 4 to 6, they probably will like to play, especially since the concept is simple, their motor skills would be appropriate, and if they've seen the Smurf movie, they'll likely relate to seeing their favorite character on a video game they can play.  For an older child, beyond say 8 or 9 - it probably will not hold their interest very long, unless they are new to video games.Wii U does have the nicety of allowing for a 5th player, something which could matter if you have 5 young siblings/friends who all want to play.An OK game, probably better valued at about $20 for the amount of playing time your child will get out of it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","summary":"Another step forward for this great franchise!","reviewText":"What do you get when you take a series that is virtually flawless and endlessly addicting and combine it with a developer who is known for ruining a virtually flawless and endlessly addicting series? You get a recipe for disaster. Fortunately, Neversoft, the studio responsible for the rise and fall of the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series, has decided to take that recipe and throw it out the window. Since acquiring the rights to the Guitar Hero name, Activision has seen to it that Neversoft be in charge of creating all future games in the franchise. And for a built-from-scratch first effort, they succeeded beyond my wildest expectations! Guitar Hero III not only continues the tradition of great music rhythm games, but it adds in some much needed features and game modes that really make it a must-own for any Xbox 360 owner!First off, let's discuss the changes that Neversoft made to the game. The art direction in general takes a much more \"hardcore\" approach, as characters like Judy Nails go from being sweet little rocker chick to big-breasted, pierced alt rocker. Most of the other characters have undergone similar changes, most of which are for the worse. The original games had a very cartoony type of image to it, and Neversoft tries to recreate that with more edge, but they end up looking like they're trying too hard to make the game hardcore. Fortunately, this is a music game so graphics will ultimately take a back seat to the gameplay and music.Gameplay-wise, Guitar Hero III picks up where II left off. New game modes have been introduced into the series, including Co-Op Career (a long-needed mode that features songs you can only unlock through it) and Battle Mode, which allows you to gain attacks (rather than star power) which you can then launch at your opponent to make them fail a song. The last person standing wins! The first time through this mode can be daunting, but after a while it quickly becomes a welcomed addition to the franchise! Also included this time around is full Xbox Live support for Face Off, Pro Face Off, Co-Op, and Battle Mode (unfortunately Co-Op career is not available for online play at this time). The system works great too, and in my dozens of matches online, I've only experienced brief lag once. There's something thrilling about going to battle with someone you've never met and throroughly embarassing them! This feature was well worth the wait, and will undoubtedly add hours upon hours of play to an already addicting game.Of course, the real strength of a music rhythm game will always rest in its soundtrack. Fortunately for us, Guitar Hero III rocks one of the most comprehensive and diverse soundtracks ever put in a video game. Neversoft has finally figured out what Harmonix never could; you can have difficult songs on the game that aren't metal (i.e. Muse's \"Knights of Cydonia\" or QotSA's \"3s and 7s\")! Add in the fact that a large portion of these songs are master recordings, and the game's music just sky-rockets to a whole new level! And while Gutar Hero III's soundtrack is clearly the best in the series, it is not without it's missteps either. For example, \"Sabotage\" by the Beastie Boys is a great song, but it really doesn't belong here as there's very little guitaring going on in the song. Overall though, the diverse collection of songs in the game almost assures it's acceptance by those who may have been hesitant in the past, as there's definitely something for everyone!My complaints with the game are few. My largest gripe is the new Red Octane wireless controller which is very pretty, but has given myself and other gamers some problems. For me specifically, some of the fret buttons will occasionally stop working during a song and you'll need to stop playing, disconnect the controller, and reconnect it for it to work again. This is a huge drawback, but hopefully they can get the bugs worked out in later models. Another small complaint is the lack of a matchmaking system for online play. I play on expert, but I'm more of a low-mid range expert who doesn't stand a chance versus someone who's been playing the game for a few years now. In the end, however, these complaints really overshadow what is a phenomenal game and a great first effort for Neversoft. I highly recommend it to anyone who may be on the fence about it. $99 for a video game is steep, but the hours and hours of enjoyment you'll undoubtedly get out of Guitar Hero III are well worth the price. Buy it now!8 out of 10 Stars","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2007"}

Included with the battery add-on is a mini-screwdriver and a note warning you to carefully turn the screws on the 3DS or risk stripping them. 3 of the 4 screws on my 3DS easily turned, the fourth however refused to budge and no amount of force or babying (per Nyko's instructions) could move the final screw. Fortunately my tool box had a good sized screwdriver (the handle) that fit and easily cracked the seal on that last screw. The mini-screwdriver they give you is nice but is useless if you have a screw that's extremely tight. Be wary of that. Other than that it fit nicely into the 3DS and adds some nice weight to the device and also makes holding the 3DS much more comfortable.

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"Poo Poo Pooey","summary":"The greatest driving game ever made, until gt4","reviewText":"Possibly once every year you are presented a game that simply sets a standard for the genre. You are offered a piece of history that will not be forgotten, and perhaps may be the indefinite leader in the future of gaming. In no way, at this time, will any racing simulation ever even compete with what has been formally titled Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec. The title has easily topped the list of what the Playstation 2 can offer, and will live in infamy as the racing game that begat all others on the PS2. I have honestly never been so submerged in a game that breaks all limits for what was once thought to be inconceivable. All time is lost when you experience GT3, and 24 hours may accidentally be lost as you suddenly notice the rising sun to your disbelief. Only when you have felt the sheer presence of what GT3 can bring to your home will you ever truly understand the audacity that this title has furnished. We may need to go back and remember the first two Gran Turismo series, and remind ourselves of what has inspired one of the greatest titles of the year.Back in March of 1998, Gran Turismo saw it's first release and defined what the PSX could present, and began a franchise that is hailed as the best racing series of all time. Gran Turismo 2 was the next addition in the set, and proved to add certain elements that characterized what racing titles needed to replicate. By far the best racer of its time, GT2 was even put in the imperial list of all-time best games, an accomplishment that is rarely seen with racing simulators, as the gameplay at times can become repetitive. However, the Gran Turismo franchise has somehow been able to break out of the mold as just an ordinary racer. They have consistently added gameplay that is both exceedingly in-depth and addictive. No longer is a car just an instrument for winning races, it has been transported into an implausible goal, one that when accomplished fuels the desire for perfection. Every level of enjoyment that real racing can deliver is almost flawlessly enlisted in this series, and for those of you who have missed out on the adventure have literally missed out on video gaming history. Luckily, however, you can still relive any of these journeys through exploration of an aged product, but even better, Sony has given us the opportunity to begin a new venture, one that gives incredible detail to almost every facet, and accomplishes a feat rarely attainable.By now you may know that the Playstation 2 is an incredible machine. Words are barely enough to describe the endless potential it is capable of achieving. Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec has taken full advantage of the PS2, and has given us a glimpse of what is justly obtained by Sony's next-generation console. The pure innovation that has gone into this game is phenomenal. It is easily the best looking game out right now on the PS2, and backs up these visuals with killer gameplay that makes the graphics just that much more enjoyable. Car and track designs have been created perfectly with their real life counterparts, and present the gamer and in-depth look at something that he may never get a chance to experience. Sony has truly put themselves at the top of the 1st Party leaders, and should be very proud of what they have accomplished with GT3. As soon as I started the opening video, my jaw literally dropped as I was preparing for the best racing game ever made. I quickly chose my car and began a journey that would continue many months down the line. As I revved my engine for the start of an exhilarating race, I could hardly concentrate on the road. This was actually how in awe I was of this game. The pure eye to brain stimulation that is created here is outrageous, and you will tell yourself how long you've been waiting for a game like this to knock you off your seat. I simply cannot rant and rave about Gran Turismo 3's visuals anymore, just to tell you that each car can get a maximum of 20,000 polygons and that it is an injustice for you to not expose yourself to the best eye-candy you will see on the PS2 right now.The environments of Gran Turismo 3 are crazy. The detail is so outstanding it's seriously as if you're watching a video of the course every time. A CG video could hardly show a difference between the amazing track design that has been developed here, and I, for one, feel no need for the presence of one. Every aspect in the background is perfectly sculpted, creating a racing environment that is not only exceptional, but in all honesty, overwhelming. As you race through what seem to be perfectly replicated tracks, you may almost want to stop and stare at the scenery. This, however, will cause you to lose every race, and is not advised. However, what you can do is marvel at the sheer beauty that is represented by Gran Turismo 3, and appreciate it for the level it has brought to gaming.When dealing with gameplay for Gran Turismo 3, you might as well say you're dealing with gold. GT3 has basically taken this glamorous racer to a height that few games can reach. It incorporates wants and desires that other titles strive for. Overall, gameplay is near perfect, but it's so much more than that. There are so many elements that need to be examined for you to acceptably understand what type of game we're dealing with here. In that sense, I should almost stop referring to GT3 as a game, for it is far more than that. Gran Turismo 3 is the pinnacle of all racing games, and it's stellar scheme and game modes are what set it apart from even the most unique racing titles. Simply put, GT3 centers around 5 different simulation game modes: Beginner, Amateur, Pro, Rally, and Endurance League.There are 6 licenses that need to eventually be obtained and they include License B, A, IB, IA, Rally, and Super. Depending on what tracks and what level you choose will depend on the license you will need to get. A standard of Gold, Silver, and Bronze will be set, and will need to be broken for the numerous tests presented at the License Center. Receiving your licenses and taking the tests is a great way to get a feel of how the control setup and mechanics work for different cars. It is an excellent preparation course, and readies a player for elevated merit when entering their first mode. Also placed in the game is an Arcade mode, which allows players to advance through selected courses and cars, and also distributes a brilliant 2-player feature that initiates competitive racing. For me, the Arcade mode was also a pronounced source to prepare for Simulation mode, and offered time trials that can be utilized perfectly when getting associated with Gran Turismo 3. As you venture through Simulation mode, the object is to obtain as many high-quality cars as possible, while excelling in numerous race series and circuits for necessary funding. I found this to be incredibly addicting, and the portion of the game that will challenge hours upon hours of your time.The considerable number of cars presented is far less than GT2, but are of higher quality. Each car is separated into their noted company and assorted countries. While you are only allocated $18,000 to purchase your first car, the process has already begun. What will follow next is the endless desire to own top-notch cars and soup them up to speeds of exceedingly high proportions. While easily posting some of the best cars to grace any street at this time, GT3 lacks the company of old-time cars, excluding the lone Shelby Cobra. This is the only element that caused me to remove a tenth of a point from my score, and is something I hope will be remarkably looked into by Sony. Granted, a small amount of development time was given to Sony and their developers of GT3, but the presence of older style cars is an aspect that cannot be simply overlooked. However, as I've stated, the gameplay of this title is incomparable, and the very small problems associated with GT3 are so vastly overshadowed that one may forget any minor flaws. I can easily say this the all-time most addicting games I have ever played. A bold statement, yes, but undoubtedly backed up with amazing game physics and a setup that may need a patent for assurance.The sound executed in GT3 is overall a gem. Combining both incredible sound affects and a fantastic soundtrack, Sony has once again come through with an element of a game that can truly either make or break a game. When considering the sound effects, car engines and squealing tires are portrayed at such a high standard you may actually have to check in front of your house to see that no one has just sped by in a drag race fashion. The soundtrack is one of the best I've heard in a racing title, and besides a few setbacks in song tracks, an absolute enjoyment to listen to while racing. Your adrenaline will soar and your breathing will become rapid as you combine every element I have listed so far.If it's real car driving you want, the control of Gran Turismo 3 is flawless. You will never witness the gross misinterpretation that a car traveling 180 mph can turn on a dime. Each turn must be well executed, utilizing the break and correct design path that will drive you into s","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2001"}

It is simply like nothing else you've ever played.  And while these words may sound trite, I find myself agreeing whole-heartedly with them.Though it looks like a fantasy role-playing game, it doesn't follow that same formula at all. There is no opportunity to 'level up,' no upgrades to new and better weapons and equipment, no magic spells, no mini-bosses or side-quests. Just a young man, armed with a sword and a bow, wandering a barren land with his horse Agro in search of 16 colossi to destroy. Some of these creatures are massive ground-dwellers standing hundreds of feet high, others are smaller and faster and heavily-armored, others swim under the water, others fly through the air. All of them are, in their way, majestic and starkly beautiful.Visually, 'Shadow' is a stunning game, perhaps the most cinematic game I have ever played, with camera angles tailored to highlight the drama and sweep of your progress. The graphics of the colossi are particularly detailed, with cracked stone armor and glowing eyes and patches of fur where every hair is visible. You can be holding onto a scaled wing as the creature rolls through the air with you on its back, or hanging on for dear life to a massive finger as its owner raises a hand to gaze at you, or leaping down to the top of a ridged head to deliver a final stab -- the images never fail to convey the scope and the scale of what you are doing. If anything, they accentuate the experience in a dramatic style that works throughout the game.Similarly, the music builds in a layer of drama and tension perfectly, responding to player actions. It may start out as something quiet and understated, then building as the creature reveals itself and attacks, then a crescendo of a triumphant theme as you find its weak points and attack. The music is worthy of its own attention, and is one of the best game scores I have heard since 'Homeworld.'To put it simply, 'Shadow of the Colossus' is a hauntingly beautiful game. It will draw you into its strange, beautiful world again and again, and the ending will take your breath away. 'Shadow' impressed me with its originality, its graphics, its music, its attention to detail, its surprises, and most of all, with how well it took a familiar story and made it brand-new. There really is nothing like this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2007"}

This game prved itself showing off the power that the Nintendo 64 had and showed it off to the loyal people who bought one instead of a PS-X and even those who (like me) bought both a Nintendo 64 and a PS-X. But, not to mince words I'll explain the game. You are Mario one of the most well known characters in video game history. You play through this adventure all in 3D. This was one of the true selling factors of this game as it was Mario's first true step into the Third Dimension (Hushed Gasp).

{"product_name":"B000HCQK0A","reviewerName":"Marvin Powell","summary":"This wouldn't be a bad game ten years ago","reviewText":"Okay. This was just a nightmare of a gaming experience. Just, unbeliavably terrible. Just downright horrible. To be completely honest, this wouldn't be a bad game for ten years ago. Or maybe for 2001 or 2002, as a late N64 or PS1 title. But considering this game is pretty recent,it's downright inexcusable. So why is this game so bad. Well, to sum it up, it's EXTREMELY hard, to the point of frustrating. Not to mention randomly spawning enemies. That's right. Randomly Spawning Enemies, like the kind you'd find in a Nintendo Mega Man game where as soon as you take your camera view off the screen, more enemies show up. And what reward do you get for killing off all the enemies in the vincinity? Why, even MORE enemies! \"A hit squad has been dispatched to take you out.\" Add this on top of a game that has really no direction, no storyline, or even point to it, and there's not even any reason to play it. It ain't fun, by any definition of the word.Basically, you're a genetically made SuperSoldier who is created by \"The Agency,\" all of the nation's law enforcement combined into one agency, and you're told by some annoying old disembodied Commander voice -who also serves as the game's narrator and the only actual \"character\" in the entire game- to wipe out three criminal empires. And off you go shooting, to kill literally hundreds of thousands of enemies by the time you finish the game, if you can even bare it that long. ALL you do in this game is basically kill bad guys and jump from rooftops, and while the latter may sound fun in a Spider-Man sort of way, it really isn't. At least Spider-Man has webbing to control where he wants to go. You know, flying would be a whole lot simplier. And easier. Oh yeah. The game also has some very poorly conceived races. Either a rooftop race, which are usually extremely hard to beat in time, or some insanely stupid driving race, which if trying to drive isn't hard enough for you, trying to complete a Time Trials race in the wrong lane will surely push you over the edge.When you start, all of your skills - Agility for leaping, Driving for absolutely nothing, Explosives for bombing, Strength mostly just for health, and Firearms for shooting- are all poor and barely usable. And after you've leveled up all of them as you go along in the game, well... they're still extremely poor. The only thing that increases is the leaping ability, in which you can go from 10 to 30 feet in leaping height. The sprinting speed sure don't increase like they say it does, that's for sure.Driving, is more or less, utterly pointless in this game. 95% of the time, you'll never be in a car! Which is good for two reasons because, for one, Driving controls are really really retarded. Both in setup and manuevering. That's how bad it is. Bad in the \"it's almost impossible to not run into civilians\" sort of way, even when your driving skill is near maxed out. Why they would even bother with a Driving skill, when the only time you'll ever even drive is to either do the stupid races, or mainly, to travel really far distances on the islands, is beyond me. But the other reason you won't be in a car much, is not to hear the insansely bad soundtrack for the game. According to the in-game \"Jukebox,\" there are over 100 songs in this game, and all of them are really bad, third party techno tracks. Like the soundtrack came out of the skeeziest clubs in Europe. The game IS partially European, at least, which is why things are referred to in the game as a \"centre\" or a \"lift.\" It's odd considering that the game takes place in the near-future West Coast America and that other things like measurements (pounds, height in feet and inches, miles per hour) are North American standard, and not Metric. Anyway, the soundtrack is really European, really Techno, and really, really bad. Maybe they figured Techno music is \"futuristic?\" It doesn't matter anyway, because they could've saved some money by not getting all of these crap songs (which you can't cut off, by the way) for the car that you'll rarely be using, anyway. At least it's nice that the car tells you how many miles per hour you're driving, though, as you accidently plow into an idiot civilian.Strength is another almost utterly useless attribute. It's only effectiveness is raising your health. But to level it up, you'll have to beat down on enemies using melee attacks, which is even more rarely used than a vehicle. 99.9% of the game is shooting, and you can only really raise your strength (health) by whacking an enemy with a gun, or kicking them, which does very little damage to them, anyway. You see, some of your skills are raised per usage. Meaning, the more you shoot, the more you blow stuff up, and the more you win races, the higher your stats will go, with 400 points being the maximum effectiveness level (even though the bar will continue to go up to 500.) But you'll almost never kick or hit an enemy, so raising this stat is pretty annoying.The other way you raise stats is by collecting a bunch of stupid orbs. Literally hundreds of orbs, scattered across literally every rooftop in the game, is how you increase your Agility. You don't have to collect all 500 of them to max out your Agility though, because of the rooftop races (although you really won't win those much) and the blue, \"Hidden orbs\" which increase a little of every stat. In fact, those were the only way I was able to get Driving and Strength skills up. The driving is bad, no matter what, though, and the Strength, although lets you lift and carry objects weighing tons, is only useful for health. I had about 300/500 Agility orbs and 100/300 Hidden orbs, by the time I finished the game, and only Driving was lower than Level 2 (300 to 399 points).The shooting in this game, though, is severely flawed. And not because of the weak Firearms skills and weak firearms in the game. But by the Auto-Aim targeting being severely broken. I swear, this auto-aiming NEVER EVER EVER works the way you want it to. It sems to target only the most furthest enemies, or moving non-enemies first, and ONLY focuses on the guy right in your face when there's absolutely nothing left to kill. While the game does give you manual shooting as well, it's pretty hard to kill anything that's not close up to you with it. But the broken aiming and an invisible enemy grenade that you'll never even see until you're already dead are the two biggest things that'll kill you the most with this game. And unless you really get into this crapfest of a game, you will die hundreds upon hundreds of times. I only had it on normal difficulity, and I died like 30 times within any given hour.All the guns are pretty weak, and when I found it, about late into the first gang and location, I wound up using the Harrington HMG 90 rifle throughout the remainder of the game. You only get two weapons to hold at a time throughout the entire game, by the way. The problem with all of the serious firearms is that they're power is compensated by an extremely low clip or insanely slow reload times, with the Harrington being the slowest. I counted the reload time of this thing. Six seconds. Now picture that. In the heat of warfare, having to spend SIX whole seconds just to reload the low clip on this stupid gun! Count to six and that's how much time you're waiting inbetween fire. In six seconds, you could lose all your armor and health and straight die while waiting for this thing to reload. And yes, being you only have two guns and some grenades throughout this whole game, I tried the Call of Duty style \"switch to your other gun as you run out of ammo instead of reloading\" tactic, only for that to not work as the stupid generic character you're using automatically reloads the gun when you run low or run out, so in order for the Call of Duty trick to work, I'd have to watch and make sure I don't go below ten bullets left and THEN, switch to the other gun in order for it to work, as the character's auto-reloading is completely and totally un-interruptable. SO annoying! WHY should a player have to endure crap like this? Throughout the whole game, I either used the Harrington despite it's insanely slow reload and some kind of rocket or grenade launcher, as anything else would be ineffective, have too small of a clip, hold too little of maximum ammo, or simply be just too weak. Sounds fun, doesn't it?The \"characters\" in this game aren't even characters. There's you, the generic, namelss \"agent.\" (Maybe \"Agent\" is your actual name. I don't know.) There's the disembodied commander narrator/boss guy, who'll remark such sayings as, \"Go like the wind, agent!\" and \"Simply pathetic.\" when you die. Having the game insult you every time you die, and dying because of some stupid glitch or flaw, is enough to make you want to break the game disc into tiny, little pieces. The \"bad guys\" are perhaps the most generic looking criminal bosses ever. It's like they looked in an LA phone book to get names for the Spanish lieutenants. There are three \"gangs\" that rule the city, but they're more like criminal empires because street gangs don't have that many soldiers and they don't actually run entire sectors of a city and it's inhabitants. They are  \"Los Muertos\" or \"The Dead\" (pretty clever, eh?), The Volk, and Shai Gen. Or... \"Generic Spanish gang,\" \"Generic Russian gang,\" and \"Generic Chinese Corporation gang.\"The key members of the gang, like I said, are about as generic-looking as generic can get and when you actually find out where they're located and kill the hundreds of bad guys guarding them before you realize that they keep randomally spawning and that you should ignore them and just run towards the main gang lieutenant and kill them, you'll be rewarded with nothing, in the guise of a slightly higher ratio for success. You see, the game developers thought that it'd be clever to make fighting the main gang leader virtually impossible and that you would have more \"fun\" by taking out key lieutenants, who each enhance the criminal empire, be it by firearms, number of soldiers available, vehicles, etc., so that it becomes slightly easier to take out the main gang leader. But even WHEN you kill everyone else and save him for last, it's STILL virtually impossible, between the miles long approach to their headquarters, the endless spawning soldiers, and the enemy's eight life bars. Like most strongholds in the game, you're best to just run past everyone, trying to survive, and just go all out on the major gang leader before all the minions kill you. Screw \"weaking their health\" or \"minimizing their recruits\" with killing the lieutenants, because they won't do much help for you, regardless. But then, I guess, the game would be too short. In this case though, that'd be a good thing.I should also bring up that the map is even messed up. Yes, that's right! Even the MAP is a pain in the donkey. Not only is the map horribly out-of-scale with everything else, and not only does the map not provide you with any GPS or waypoint marking, but you CAN'T EVEN ZOOM IT IN! The map on the menu screen is just a tiny little map on the menu screen. You can't zoom it in to see closer, or anything. And the arrow representing you on the map takes up an entire city block in reality, meaning things that you may think are close by may be two blocks away from you! How often is it that you can say that the map in a video game is one of it's many, many flaws? Okay, so you can't zoom in, use a GPS, or even accurately know where you're at. Surely, the HUD \"radar\" map must be better, right? Nope. The biggest problem is, unlike ANY other game that uses an on-screen map, there's no \"N\" for \"North.\" Just four arrows, any one of them could possibly be north. There's a reason why they don't put the \"S\"outh, \"E\"ast, and \"W\"est on these, and this is why. YOU NEVER KNOW WHERE YOU'RE GOING! I can't tell you how many times I had to pause the game just to figure out which way was North. I often had to look one direction, pause to see the full map to see where I'm facing on it, and then, turn again until I got to facing North or where ever it is I had to go. How could they not have even gotten this right? It also would've been helpful if, being you spend most the game on the roof, to know which enemies were eye-to-eye level with me, above me, or below me. Usually, they make all things above you an arrow facing up on these game maps, and all things below facing down. But, oh no, not in this game! I died so many times because I couldn't tell if any enemy gang were shooting from above, from below, or from so far away, they wouldn't even show up in the compass map screen. Every single enemy is just a dot. Even if they're above me or below me. It's things like this that make you appreciate the little things in any given Grand Theft Auto title, where you don't have to try to figure out where North is, and that the arrows or triangles let you know right away which altitude an enemy is at. But not in this game! In fact, I've seen an effective map system in about EVERY Xbox 360 game that uses one, EXCEPT this game! Oh, and you can't even zoom the map in. Ins't that just something else?When you die, you have to restart from a \"supply station,\" most of which are few are isolated between locations, and all of them have to be found and unlocked. Oh, and they're ALL on roofs, meaning you have to spend ten minutes climbing up top to them, and you could die just trying to get down from them! An elevator that you can use once you get up to the top the first time would've been nice. I mean, they actually HAVE them in the game and all, so it's not like they would've had to make one from scratch or anything. Any good gun you collect from an enemy HAS to be taken to this supply center/save point in order for you to keep it, or else, you'll lose everything you collected once you die. Sometimes, because of the random enemy pop ups, you'll, ironically, die trying to get back to your save point in order to save the guns you just got in case you die. You could be at any given rooftop, look one way, then look back and have a hoarde of random enemies pop up at you. Sometimes, you can even see them materialize in front of you. Sometimes, you'll restart at a save point and by chance, there'll be a ton of enemies right in front of your face as you just come back from the dead. I don't know. Maybe killing so many enemies as if they were an ant colony and jumping from rooftops sounds fun, but it's really not. Neither is dying a thousand times due to a broken aiming system or enemy grenade. You can still die by gravity, by the way, so with each roof, you still have to be very careful.The only good thing I can say about the game is that there's no glitches. Oh, wait. There are! Like, constantly getting stuck in a wall, or a rampway, or even the ground! Stuck as in, \"this solid object isn't all that solid\" stuck. And the random enemies. That counts, too. It's bad enough that once you kill every enemy in the near area, the game will have a \"hit squad\" of about ten cars come up and bring MORE enemies to you, but to have the ones you JUST KILLED re-materialize right in front of you is just insulting. Like, why even bother to kill them if it just makes more come to kill you, and the dead ones simply return back like it's nothing? Your character is a genetic clone and \"The Agency\" can make an endless supply of you in case you die. What's their excuse, though?Overall, this kind of pointless 3D \"shoot and jump\" kind of simplistic game wouldn't have been so bad on the N64, the original Playstation, or even as an early Gamecube title. I mean, the comic-book like art style isn't anything impressive or new or advanced. 1999 to 2002, this game might've been acceptable. An \"average\" game, at best. But this kind of simple, pointless, storyline-less, linear \"shoot and kill just for the sake of it\" game is far below what today's standards are in gaming. To imagine that this is an Xbox 360 title makes me think that this game probably spent so many years in development, that it's heavily outdated by today's standards. When you can't even tell which way is North on your compass map, you can't even zoom in your menu-guide map, and every single character is as generic as a white and black-text can of government corn, it really isn't a game ready to be released. At least not in any year past 2003, on any system greater than maybe Gamecube. This game is bad for simply being simple and outdated and just, really frustrating and lame and incomplete. I can't give this game a One because other than the \"getting stuck\" and \"targeting,\" there really aren't any glitches or bugs in it. The game is somewhat playable.However, when a game makes you want to break something in it's incompleteness, or lose your mind and curse after getting killed by some stupid game flaw for the 219th time, something ain't right. I can't imagine anyone over twelve enjoying this game, not to insult anyone under thirteen, but only a simple minded person could enjoy a game this simple and generic. By the cover and art style, the game looks kind of cool. You sort of think \"Gears Of War\" combined with \"Saint's Row.\" You get to use some high tech equipment to take down three ethnic gangs crippling the city. Sounds fun. And I'm sure, most people who bought this game bought it for the Halo 3 beta, but also because it looked or sounded like fun, right? However, I haven't played a game THIS bad since \"Sonic Heroes.\" (and I would include every other Sonic game since then, had I actually played those also-poorly-rated titles) This is a game you simply want to break with your bare hands, or sell to any gaming store, even if you can only get $2.95 for it. Shoot, ANY amount of money the guy offers you at a game store, you'll take just to not have this horrible curse of a game in your life anymore. I can't say it's a Legend in the \"Worst Games Of All Time\" ranking, but it's definitely one of those games you'll get rid of, by any means possible, just to not have in your collection. It's like the DVD of \"Gigli\" or \"I Know Who Killed Me\" in your DVD collection that makes everything else you own, as well as yourself, look bad just by it's mere prescence, so you get rid of it, possibly erase all save files of it from your memory card or hard drive too, and pretend like it never happened. Yes, this game is a \"pretend like it never happened\" kind of game.AVOID this disaster at all costs! It's not fun, it's frustrating, and it's not even in-depth.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2008"}

Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well.

Far cry has bad save point placements that will annoy the hell out of you. Half-life, you can save where ever you please and you may not need to because the computer auto saves at really well thought out points in the game. Finally this game is anything but linear. You can drive vehicals, vehicals with guns, take on big ships for a boss battle, kill zombies, kill combines(police/gaurd/army people), control these mosters to kill you enemys, fight along side ai controlled team mates, and take out snipers.

After glancing at the box they were not very impressed. I was almost losing hope that they would even give the game a try, but suddenly my little brother broke the silence and asked to play. Everyone joined in (even mom), and we had a blast!The game is easy to set up. Just press a button and choose your monkey (red, yellow, blue, or orange). Then you compete (with up to four players at once) in a series of mini games. The games are incredibly simple, but fun (and perfect for settling sibling rivalries). The other good thing about the simplicity of the games is that just about anyone can pick up the controller and play without much practice.Don't hesitate buying this for the kids. My little brother and sister are pretty tough to please (one is a TV-aholic, the other has a playstation 3), but they both love Buzz Jr. Infact, mom reports that they play it every day.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00004SVS3","description":"Mega man 2 nes cartridge","reviewerName":"M. B. Link \"wildfirelink\"","summary":"The Mega Man entry which stands the test of time","reviewText":"Mega Man 2(1988). Part two in a series of nine games.The Mega Man series was created in 1987 as a result of an experiment where Capcom wanted to try adding the feature of stealing boss weapons in a platform game, instead of simply having the main character be always the same throughout the entire game. The first game actually fared decently when it was released, but it was no hit by any means. However, Capcom saw it to be successful enough to warrant a sequel, so they gathered all their best programmers and put together what could be considered the series's defining moment. Afterall, MM2 was responsible for Mega Man becoming a household name and spawning TONS of sequels over the years. It's my second favorite MM game(after 4 that is). Read on for the synopsis of this legendary title:PROS:-THERE ARE NOW 8 DIFFERENT BOSSES TO FIGHT. This is simply awesome because not only does the player get more options of what to do, but also THE BOSSES IN THIS GAME ARE SOME OF THE COOLEST MM BOSSES EVER CONCEIVED. Quickman, Crashman, and Metalman are personal favorites of mine. Plus, at least half of the game's bosses present a reasonable challenge.-THE ADDITION OF THE ITEM ADAPTORS. There are three different items to be acquired throughout the game, each having its own unique transportation usefulness. For instance, Item #3 is good for climing walls with, while Item #2 is useful for flying across large pits. These are all much better than the previous game's Magnet Beam Generator.-Now and forever on, YOU CAN SAVE YOUR PROGRESS WITH PASSWORDS. IMHO, I find that passwords in a MM game are pointless because the games don't take very long to play through. However, if you do lack patience and can't sit still for an hour or two, using passwords will help you.-THE LEVELS ARE ALL VARIED AND FUN TO GO THROUGH. Example: Crashman's level is mostly vertical climbing, while Bubbleman's stage forces you to wade through water avoiding spikes, and Quickman's level involves racing to the bottom avoiding the advancing beams. No stage before the Wily levels ever gets repetitive in this game.-THE MUSIC IN THIS GAME IS ABSOLUTELY GENIOUS. All the tunes, with the exception of one, are catchy and fit the Mega Man games PERFECTLY. Several tunes really stand out, such as Airman, Bubbleman, Flashman, the boss theme, and the first Wily Stage. Of all the MM games, MM2 arguably has the most consistently good soundtrack.-INTRODUCTION OF THE E-TANKS. These are a must in MM games. When you grab one, you can fill up your health to the max, but the greatest benefit is that you can save 4 tanks up for when you really need them, such as boss battles. Even with the E-tanks, the game's challenge factor doesn't suffer one bit.-TWO LEVELS OF DIFFICULTY: EASY AND NORMAL. For the most part, playing the game on normal is the best option because it keeps the game hard enough to offer enough challenge for seasoned MM veterans. However, if you're new to the series, playing it on easy mode is a great way to get equainted with the controls.CONS:-Beating the game on easy mode gives you exactly the same result as playing it on normal, so the replay value is diminished slightly.-One thing that isn't a real big deal but has always bothered me is the realistic sense of Woodman's weapon. A leaf shield? Come on. I must congradulate Dr. Light on a job well done for creating a super metal blue robot that can be destroyed by fluttering leaves.-Although most all of the music in this game is very good, the tune in the 2nd half of Wily's castle gets repetitive, and grating.-Believe it or not, MM2 ACTUALLY HAS THE WEAKEST STORY OF ALL OF THE MM GAMES; NES, SNES, and PSX MM games included. Here's all the plot really is: Dr. Wily is back for revenge with 8 more robots to take over the world. That's it. How unoriginal and contrived is that? Good thing this &quot;story&quot; happened to be in an early MM game as opposed to one of its numerous sequels.Despite a few slight shortcomings, this is THE mandatory MM game to have on the NES, and should be the first game for those of you getting into the series. 5 stars overall. Even though the MM series couldn't exist without the first game, it certainly wouldn't have taken off and become a huge franchise if not for MM2. If you have a softspot for good oldschool gaming, then you've come to the right place. This game coined my favorite dialog phrase used in a MM game. I've used it in other reviews, but I'll say it again: GET EQUIPPED WITH BUBBLE LEAD. If you see this game, do not under any circumstance hesitate to pick it up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2003"}

I know the trailers make it seem like a real-time RPG. It's NOT. I know everyone is billing it as a strategy/rpg.....It's NOT! In fact, aside from the Japenese presentation, story and cutscenes there's nothing remotly RPG-ish about this game. If you're looking for an RPG, this is NOT it.Now that that's out of the way I'd just like to say that this is one of the best, most unique game experiences to be released this year. If I were to describe this game, I'd call it a story-driven, real-time/turn-based strategy game. I know that sounds like alot of elements working against each other but suprisingly they all come together very well.The gameplay starts with you positioning your units on a map. When this is done you are able to take control of each unit individualy in a Eternal Sonata-ish realtime way. As you move around any enemy unit can fire at you (you do the same when it's their turn)and each unit is allowed to attack once during their turn. This seems simple, but believe me it works.The graphics are wonderfully (and suprisingly) cell-shaded. This being a PS3 only title also means there is no graphical bugging or system crashing moments (though optional install helps). You can actually ENJOY the game while playing it.This game is very story-driven. Don't worry, most of the game is gameplay but there are an aweful lot of cutscenes (some of which are optional). This isn't MGS4 or anything (thank god!), but strategy fans might be a bit taken aback by the more cinematic presentaion of this game. Personally I think this worked well in establishing a more personal relationship with your units on the field (every unit has a name and personality in over 50 characters!).This game probably isn't for everyone. In fact I'm sure it'll be criticized for it's overly simple take on the strategy genre. But if you're like me (or like a great story with great gameplay) and are looking for something different, this is a MUST BUY (especially at Amazon's low price!)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2008"}

Graphics take a leap backwards compared to C&C; 3, unit design is severely hampered by the clunky, more-cartoony graphics similar to what we have come to know in the Red Alert games, harvesting is consipcuously absent, it takes far too long to get the units you want to be building, and worst of all: game play is just not very fun.

{"product_name":"B003TIVSM4","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Great execution but sheer repetition drags the game down a lot","reviewText":"The Good: Gory and satisfying combat, lots of fun weapons to use, great characters, story, and voice acting, multiplayer is fun for awhileThe Bad: Same enemies and combat forever, no intense scripted events, can't use the Titan, multiplayer gets boring after awhile, only two modes, gets extremely difficult towards the endThe Warhammer series, being an extremely expensive table top game, has grown to be more popular as an RTS game than anything else. Space Marine is the first outing out of the genre, and with lots of speculation, was deemed to be a complete failure. Relic proved everyone wrong by delivering a good game that has tons of action, gore, and a good story that the RTS games pack in. You plays as Captain Titus of the Ultramarines. You are the leader of the elite force who are part machine and can take out whole battalions of troops that regular marines couldn't. The Space Marines believe in a religion of the Machine God and anything else that isn't machine related is heresy. You, and your three squadmates, are fighting back the Ork invasion and are trying to reach the Titan Manufactorum that holds the most powerful war machine ever built. On the way some weird twists happen and you end up fighting the Order of Chaos and Daemons towards the end. How that happens I'll let you find out for yourself.The story is decent, not very deep, but its entertaining and the voice acting is superb. Relic got the art style and feeling of the Warhammer universe across, so the game looks good, but technically its nothing special (using the Unreal Engine 3). The fighting system goes two ways with melee weapons and guns. There are a lot of cool guns to shoot and they are unlocked slowly throughout the campaign. They each feel different and powerful and you have to mix up your strategy of how you're going to use what weapons for what situation. You can't just use the same ones through the whole game. The melee weapons are less in numbers but just as cool to use. The chainsword allows you to tear enemies to shreds and executing awesome kill moves is fun. This is actually how you get health, but its flawed in a way. When no ground enemies are around you can't heal and have to rely on your shield charging, so it's a unique idea, but we need a way to heal up when fighting aerial units. You also get to use the Thunder Hammer, and the Axe which are all great weapons to use, but the hammer only lets you use the pistol and bolter, so no heavy weapons can be used (I'm assuming a balancing issue).While you chopping down Orks by the dozens you will get to use the jet pack a few times. Launching into the air and pounding the ground while enemies fly around is great, but you don't get to use it enough. What is enough (actually too much) is everything else. The same Orks come at you through 2/3 of the game and the same execution moves are repeated over and over again. By the time you get 1/4 of the way through the game you wonder if there is anything but Orks that exist. A few different types show up throughout, but not many and the game just gets harder and harder as you go along instead of throwing in variety. Towards the end you can't really do much melee and you start relying solely on guns because charging in will just get you killed. I didn't like this form of balancing because melee is much more satisfying and fun then shooting everything.Overall, the game would have been even more amazing if there were some scripted events instead of just the same run and kill scenario over and over until you puked. The muliplayer is ok, but just has two modes and gets boring after a while because it's the campaign, but with human players. I loved the characters, story, and world of Warhammer, but let's add some more depth to the action, some more enemies, and make the game feel more intense besides ramping up difficulty. We didn't even get to use the Titan! Sure you get to be on top of it for a few minutes, but these are the events we need to make Warhammer an amazing action experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I've become much more comfortable moving my hands up and down the fret bar and also on to other notes. I can strum the top three notes with regularity through the first 7 frets. I feel more confident and after a couple months of this I can totally see me playing along with some of the easier songs.Now, if you thought my first paragraph was terribly weak in the actual jargon of guitar or music playing then you have discovered why I'm rating this four instead of five stars. Sure, you play a game and learn guitar - which is awesome - but the game is very light on actually teaching you music. I don't know the note names, the theory behind the fret sections or notes, the names of combos, etc. I don't know about finger stretches or practice elements either (things my actual guitar rocking friends told me exist.) I'm concerned that I'll get to the point where I can rock along with the game but if someone asks me to play guitar based on sheet music - even very easy songs - I won't know what to do or how to play. To be fair, maybe this comes later in the game but it seems to me that a mini game at the start of the game (in a tutorial or something) would have been better.This isa great game and learning tool.

Let's get the obvious out of the way first, the graphics are outstanding and unbelievably detailed. A LOT of work was done on those environments and character models and it shows. We've definitely reached a point where in-game graphics look like pre-rendered cut scenes, which seemed impossible only a few short years ago. The storyline is engaging but merely average. The voice acting is very well done and you'll love to hate your enemies in this as they're pretty scummy.The gameplay is somewhat repetitive but I think the draw of it is in trying to master it. It plays very similar to the fighting mechanics of games like Assassin's Creed and most definitely the Batman Arkham games. It's pretty simple but every battle leaves you thinking, &#34;Hmm, I could've done that better.&#34; And that's what keeps you coming back to it.

I've been waiting for this game since it was announced back in 2011, I pre ordered it in 2012, the wait was long, but it's finally here. (prologue/intro), The game starts with Joel's daughter waking up to uncle tommy's phone call, you walk down the hall to Joel's room to find out what is happening, you see on the TV that something bad is happening when explosion happens and then you turn to the window and realize that it was really close to the house, you walk down stairs to find your dad, you find him and he tells you that something is very wrong, a neighbor gets in the house, Joel Shots him and he walks with his daughter and tells her that something is not right, soon later, you get in the truck of Uncle Tommy and drive off, as you sit in the back you see that everything is starting to go to hell, people houses are burning, police cars everywhere, people running left to right. The 3 characters (Joel, daughter, and tommy) had to leave the car after it was crashed, they go down a hall to find out there we're more infected there, they run into a bar and tommy tells joel and his daughter to run and he will catch up, you run down a hill and then up to meet up with a military personal. he tells them to stop and then shoots them, they both roll down the hill and Joel stands up to find out that his daughter was shot, shortly after she was dead. This seen was the most emotional/heart breaking part of the game, for me, even though I didn't know the character very well, I felt very sad to see the little girl die in Joel's arms. The game is very emotional and compelling, it's no Uncharted, this game is a lot more darker than the previous work of Naughty Dog. It's a much slower pace compared to Uncharted and the characters seem to be more alive, you could feel their emotions a lot more. The voice acting was amazing, the soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard in a Video Game, the graphics had it's ups and downs, sometimes it looked better than Uncharted 3 and sometimes is looks a tiny bit worse, but lets not forget that this game is a lot bigger than the previous franchises and has a lot more stuff going on, it's also running on the PS3, which is an old piece of hardware. There is some texture pop ins and their was some glitches, but nothing that would ruin the experience. The AI is very smart, you can not run and gun in this game, if you do, you will find yourself very frustrated, because this is more of a stealth kind of game, the bullets and items you find (to craft stuff) are limited, sometimes you will think; 'hey, I have plenty of bullets, I could probably just blast everything up', well... You can't, trust me when I say that you will run out of bullets fast, specially if you're playing the game in Hard or Survivor. The AI (infected and people) cannot see the AI (Ellie and other partners), unless they spot you, then they will attack Ellie and or the other people you are with. Naughty Dog did this on purpose, because they didn't want your partner/s to get in the way. The Controls feel smother than Uncharted 3's, you cannot, jump to things and climb stuff like Drake can, when you see Joel run, climb etc... you could feel like a heavy feeling, you could tell that he can't do all that stuff that Drake can do, you could tell that he's just another person trying to survive. The atmosphere is perfect, I had Dead Space (the franchise) in first place when it came to that, but The Last Of Us is just so much better. This is an amazing game that everybody should experience, great story, great character development, good graphics, really good mechanics and amazing atmosphere. I recommend 10/10 or 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001NJ6AWO","reviewerName":"Turtle502","summary":"Fun, well-produced, but a bit too short","reviewText":"This game is fun -- it's satisfying taking down the machines, especially the T-600s. The cover system is nearly perfect, and the gameplay forces you to use cover effectively or get killed. You have to plan your attack within an area so that your attacks are efficient.Gameplay offers quite a few weapons, and certain weapons are more effective against certain enemies. Unfortunately, you can't carry more than two weapons at a time, in addition to grenades. Although ammo on the battlefield is somewhat scarce, whenever you need ammo, your squad-mates will offer you some, so you're never completely out of ammo for certain weapons. You will, however, need to make your way to the squad member offering the ammo. Enemy variety is limited, so you'll be able to take out most enemies without difficulty by the time you're half-way through the game.The save system is automatic but forgiving, so you won't have to replay large sections over and over again if you die (and you will). The health system is different than anything I've seen before. Your health will deplete until the end of the current battle, then replenish completely. There's no way to manually replenish your health. It takes a while to get used to this, because you never really know when your health is going to regenerate.The soundtrack is excellent. The voice-acting is superb, with the exception of a couple annoying voice-actors. Dialog is not stellar but it serves the story well. The CGI animations and cutscenes are really well-done -- pure CGI animations are nearly life-like in quality. The camera bobs appropriately and there's a decent amount of motion blur and film grain. From a technical standpoint, the game is really well-done.The bad? It's short. For most experienced gamers, this will take about 4-6 hours to complete. It's a game on rails, which means it's entirely scripted and you're just along for the ride, shooting at enemies and doing nothing else. I had one instance in Chapter 4 where the scripting failed and a door never opened, forcing me to quit and reload my game to get past the problem. Earlier chapters are much longer than later chapters, and the last two chapters are so short that it suggests the game was rushed. Some of the last battles, for example, take place in CGI, instead of in in-game combat, leaving you to do very little.It's very predictable. You'll go down a hall or a road and come to an open area with cover objects (crates, barricades, etc.) which is a sure sign that a battle will take place. There are no ambushes, no surprise enemies, and no bosses. At one point, you'll encounter a harvester -- but it's just an encounter and not a battle.The achievements are uninspired. There are achievements for completing each chapter, with an additional achievement awarded for completing the game on \"hard\" mode. There are no achievements for numbers of enemies killed, or for collecting/using all weapons, etc.There is a local co-op mode, but no online game modes. There are also no achievements associated with co-op. Therefore, the uninspired achievements and lack of decent multi-player provides very little replay value for this title.If you're a fan of Terminator and have been looking forward to a Terminator game on the current generation of consoles, this is recommended. Just keep in mind that there's virtually no replay value and it is very repetitve. It could have been better, but that doesn't mean it's a bad game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002GPPPS4","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Posey","summary":"First Impressions - Castlevania: Lords of Shadow","reviewText":"Castlevania: Lords of Shadows (from here on out, Castlevania) is not the most original of games.  It's combat is heavily borrowed from God of War, but don't take that as a bad sign.  There's been a lot done in gaming over the years that make original forms of combat or item management hard to innovate.  So, borrowing ideas or methods from other games becomes the norms.  As long as you borrow and add your own twist, things are ok in my book.  And that is what Castlevania does, it borrows the combat (namely the whip like attack vs. Kratos' chains) and builds upon it.The combat in Castlevania is one of the biggest draws and something you'll be doing a lot, so thankfully it works well.  You hit one button to do normal attacks, while another does a weaker area attack.  After slaying enemies, you'll earn experience and can unlock additional moves.  Health is earned by finding gems to put in an amulet.  When you have 5, you get an upgrade.  You also get two forms of magic that you can switch on during battle.  This gets a little confusing but bare with me.  As you attack people, you build up concentration.  When your concentration is at max, enemies begin to drop orbs.  If you are hit, you lose concentration and have to start over (usually 5 hits or so build up concentration to max.)  You collect orbs by pressing R3 or L3.  R3 builds up your shadow magic which makes your weapons do more damage.  L3 builds up Light magic which gives you health for every hit you perform (invaluable in my opinion).  You switch on the magics by hitting the bumper buttons when you have the bars filled.  You can turn them off when you want so the game gives you incentive for not getting hit, you are your own health pack.  I really like this feature and it works well.  This goes hand in hand with the \"building your own upon an existing idea.\"  The combat is very God of War-esque, but this adds a little flavor on top to make it their own.The game is not entirely about combat though.  You will have other obstacles you will need to overcome on your way to the end of the game.  Puzzles are placed throughout the game which have you turning levers and moving things.  I'm not a big puzzle gamer, but I did enjoy the ones so far.  They aren't too tough (at least not yet) and the option to forgo experience in lieu of getting the answer is a nice feature.  I've only had to use that once on a crank puzzle that had me at wits end.  If you have the internet handy though, the puzzles are all online somewhere.Besides puzzles, the other game mechanic you will run into are Titan battles.  Titan's are basically humongous enemies that require you to memorize a path up their body to destroy weakpoints before tumbling the beasts to the ground.  They are graphically impressive, but that's about all.  I found myself loathing the second one I hit because it's not all that fun.  You just memorize a path up the body and then hit X repeatedly as you bash the weak spot.  When they try to whack you off, you move out of the way.  If hit, you have the repeat everything (except the smashing since you already did it) and continue up the body to the head where the final weak spot is.  It's not bad, it's just not that great.  I've done two and I'm not sure if there are any more coming since the previous one I bested was considered \"the last Titan.\"  Hopefully that's true.The story in Castlevania is actually quite good so far.  You play as Gabriel Belmont, a warrior of Light who is tasked with bringing down the Lords of Shadow.  Recently, Gabriel's wife was killed by the forces of evil so he is fueled by not only righteous fury but cold hearted revenge.  You'll begin the journey in a small village being attacked by Lycans (werewolves) and make your way through a forest to meet the old god Pan.  Pan will set you on your journey to destroy the Lords of Shadows and your tasks begins.  I'm almost finished the first disc (Xbox 360 version comes on two discs, PS3 has one blu-ray) and the story is very good.  Some big plot events are taking place and the pace of the game is great.  Story buffs, you won't be disappointed.Something that adds to the story and makes it more believable is the excellent voice work.  Konami has spared no expense in getting amazing voice talent.  Gabriel, the main character, is voiced by Robert Carlyle, whom you may know from Trainspotting and the Full Monty.  Another character in the story, Zobek, is voiced by Patrick Steward of Star Trek fame.  The rest of the cast may not be as familiar by Hollywood's standards, but they are all fantastic in their own right.  From the gruff voices of the Lycan lords to the seductive vampires, it just works.  You'll be thoroughly engrossed in the story thanks to their roles.Another high point of the game is the graphics.  You will see some truly breathtaking vista's and painstakingly detailed rooms on your journeys to defeat the Lords of Shadow.  I played both the PS3 and the 360 version of the game and didn't notice anything that would separate the two.  I didn't investigate down to the pixel, only through playing.So, suffice to say the game is a blast based on all the positive's I've listed above.  It is, but don't get me wrong, it has it's hangups too.  As any action game, the combat can get repetitive.  You'll be killing enemies in one area only to move to another and have to kill another horde before moving on.  This is just the nature of these types of games and if you aren't into the constant battles in action games, this game isn't going to sway you with any new features.  Sure, it has the magic that I spoke of earlier but that's not a game selling point, just a nice bonus.Another downside to the game is that it's a Castlevania game in name only.  This game could have been called Vampire Hunter and been fine.  The Castlevania name only depicts that the franchise is going in a different direction.  So far, I think it's succeeding and with the announcement of the sequel in the works, we'll be seeing more.Well, there you have it.  My first impressions of Castlevania: Lords of Shadow.  I'm impressed by the game so far and I'm having a blast playing it.  It's a very long game too, coming in just short of 20 hours with most people that complete it.  Your enjoyment of it will be directly linked to how much you like action games and the supernatural (vampires and werewolves, not so much aliens).  So, if have already played the game or are thinking of picking it up, let me know.  Also, ask away if you have any questions.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B007UM59L6","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"An Overreaching Reboot that Tries Too Hard","reviewText":"In October of 2001 the original Devil May Cry hit store shelves.  At the time the game changed the way action games were designed and played.  It was stylish and filled to the brim with a lot of intense set pieces and graphical effects.  It was a truly groundbreaking game.  Since then Devil May Cry has been on a roller coaster.  The second game was not well received, while the third one hit just as high.  The fourth game was met with some mixed reception.  Ever since then Devil May Cry has been on a hiatus.  When the new DmC was announced fans were in for a shock.  The first was that it was going to be a reboot.  The second was that it was going to be an entirely different game all together.  If you're a hardcore fan of the original Devil May Cry games this is going to take a moment to get adjusted to.  The thing is, however, from a gameplay standpoint DmC is quite fun.  From a narrative standpoint, not so much.Devil May Cry has never been much for story.  Even the previous games aren't much for story.  They were action games filled with cheesy one-liners and a protagonist with a cocky attitude.  The original Dante was a cool guy, but more of a caricature than an actual character.  Still a fun character, but not a well fleshed out or developed one.  Which is partially why people seemed to be drawn to him.  He was just good fun.  The new Dante isn't exactly like that.  It will take a moment to really get used to him.  Where as the old Dante was a cocky guy that was half human and half demon, this Dante is a foul mouthed, sex crazed, booze drinking... kid.  He also happens to be half demon and half angel.  This makes him and his brother Vergil a Nephilim.  Which means they'll be able to take down corporate Kingpin Mundus.  It's not nearly as absurd as it sounds.  The story actually goes somewhere for a bit, although it's hard to ignore that the game seems to try way too hard to be gritty and \"mature.\"  The themes it tackles are a lot bigger than the previous games, for sure.  Aside from some sexual themes and alcohol, the game isn't afraid to talk about corporate greed or economic issues.  Even going so far as to provide a pretty big structure for the world it takes place in.The game tries to provide some depth to the characters.  Dante and Vergil are built with tragic backstories.  The game actually tries to flesh them out quite a bit.  They certainly come off as interesting characters.  Vergil more so than Dante, however.  Dante comes off as that guy you probably knew in high school who was trying to be cool and rebellious.  He begins to grow from that, but upon first meeting him he comes across more like a brooding jerk than as someone you want to spend the next ten or so hours with.  Vergil by comparison, is actually more interesting and easier to deal with.There are times when the story tries so hard for the mature stuff that it sort of comes off as a lot more childish than it should.  When Dante swears it almost comes across like a middle school kid that just learned what curse words are for the first time.  The villains are somewhat similar in this regard.  It's as though the developers seem to think that if you drop enough f-bombs, flash enough exotic skin and show enough gross and disgusting fluids that this will make the game instantly mature.  Those \"mature\" themes and moments often get ruined by some of the badly written dialog (from the villains, especially) and some of the over-the-top cutscenes.  It adds some shock value and great eye candy but it more often than not undermines the characters it's trying to build and the story it's trying to tell.  A story, mind you, that the developers clearly want you to take more seriously than the 2001 release just based on the themes and economic turmoil it's trying to present.It isn't that this stuff is there, it's actually that DmC tries too hard with it.  Simply put the story isn't well written, but unlike the 2001 game it is still begging you to take it seriously.  Meaning it's not intentionally poorly written for the sake of cheesiness.  It can be given credit for trying to reach a little higher, but it's hard not to notice that it comes across like a teenager trying to show the world he's a not a kid anymore.  DmC wants to be seen as a \"grown up.\"  And it goes just a little too hard in the gritty direction to do it by trying to stuff in as much \"adult\" content as it can muster to drive the point home that this is supposed to be gritty and serious fare.  It's more about the context that this stuff is put in than anything.  I'm sure several won't mind this sort of thing, but by now I don't think gaming needs to try so hard to prove it's grown up and mature.  At least not like this.The biggest strength of DmC is that the combat and gameplay is really fluid.  The missions themselves are pretty straightforward.  The gameplay takes place in a parallel world called Limbo.  Each level is pretty linear.  You'll always know where to go no matter what.  You can explore quite a bit, though.  There are usually hidden items and secret missions off the beaten path and lost souls to find.  You'll find yourself having to replay levels to find it all.  After each mission you're ranked in style points, completion, time, items used and deaths.  It's tempting to play through some levels to get the SSS rating.The combat is pretty fluid, though.  It's actually a lot of hack and slash fun because of how fluid it can be.  It does take a moment to get used to.  Dante can go between his demon and angel halves when fighting.  The angel weapons tend to be more agile while the demon weapons have more brute strength.  What works about the system is that you can switch weapons in midstream.  This makes for some fascinating combos and juggles.  And Dante still has his guns and his sword that he can utilize as well.  There's a lot of variety in the combat.  Dante also has a grapple to him.  He can use it to pull platforms or enemies to him.  This all goes into making a pretty cool and complex system.The only big problem with it is that there is no way for Dante to lock on.  And sometimes in the throws of combat Dante targets and shoots or grapples the wrong enemy.  It can disrupt the flow of combat at times.  Likewise, the other problem isn't as big.  While fighting normal enemies is fun, the boss fights are strangely no where near as fun.  Some are creative in design but at some point they just fall into predictable patterns.  For as much fun as the combat can be it's pretty stale when a boss battle starts.The combat system is, for the most part, pretty easy to learn.  You'll also slowly ease into much of it.  You'll be able to purchase and upgrade new abilities as you progress and you'll always be able to train with them with a test dummy that never actually dies.  It's a great way to practice.DmC isn't an easy game, though.  It's got quite a few difficulty levels to choose from and they actually play differently from one another.  Mastering the game on one difficulty won't prepare you for the next.  We're talking more than just enemies hitting harder or you taking more damage.  Stronger enemies will appear in place of the standard enemies.  Some of this stuff amounts to some decent replay value.  The levels are well designed enough that it's alright to play through them.  It's a lot of fun to try to master various combos and you can always try tweaking the difficulty for a bigger challenge.  All this will easily make the story more passable.On the other hand, the game is hit or miss with its presentation.  It crunches a lot of pixels but the art style in and of itself takes time to get used to.  In one regard the game pushes for this gritty, serious look that so many games have been gunning for lately.  This is especially true in the cutscenes.  The missions, however, where you're in Limbo are actually quite vibrant and colorful, yet they also have a madhouse and insanity like feel to them.  You'll run down corridors that close in on you and you'll see writing on the walls or floor like \"Found You\" or \"Kill Dante\" etc..  It's elaborate and certainly helps separate the two parallel worlds.  Once you get used to the style of the game it's easy to settle in.  It's overall a good looking game.It's hard not to compare it to the 2001 game.  Back then the original Devil May Cry was groundbreaking.  This one... not so much.  There are still shades of the original Devil May Cry here.  You can still do plenty of juggling and stylish moves.  Even some of the over-the-top nature of the cutscenes show that the developers were inspired by the original in some way.In the end, however, DmC needs to be able to stand on its own.  As such the game is pretty fun to play but beyond that there isn't much to it.  It seems to be reaching higher than the 2001 release, but it's undermined by how hard it tries to be taken seriously.  It's not a terrible game, but it's certainly not as rewarding as it could be either.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2013"}

Finally, for as much slack as it has received,  Ghost's Squads totally saved my butt in online participation as I do OK and don't get slaughtered the minute I enter the field.

{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"Christopher M. Shatto","summary":"A good game hampered by bad business decisions","reviewText":"Dragon Age is a fun game, overall. The basic gist is that you gather a party of adventurers and set off on a quest to defeat the evil \"darkspawn\" that are threatening your homeland of Ferelden. Combat is a mix of real-time and turn-based action in which you move around and trigger skills, use items, and cast spells. As you defeat enemies and complete quests you level up to increase your basic stats and gain new skill and spells.Overall, it's the standard RPG package with a relatively slick design. The story is somewhat overbearing at times, but it is engaging and serves to move you from place to place.You can have up to four people in your party at one time, and you can switch between them at will to give commands (you can also pause combat in order to do this), but it's unwieldy, and the default behavior of the three characters you're not controlling is less than optimal. As your characters advance, however, they gain \"tactics slots\" that can be used to set up behaviors such as what to do when an ally is below x% health. This system takes a little getting used to, but, once you have some better tactics set (especially tactics related to healing), the games steep difficulty goes way down.The main problem I have with this game, and the problem that earned it 3 instead of 4 stars, is the way Bioware went about handling the Downloadable Content (DLC). The game comes with two codes you can enter to gain access to a new character and a piece of armor which otherwise have to be bought (and are very expensive considering what they are). On the surface this sounds pretty innocuous, but when you think about it, it serves little purpose but to devalue the game to anybody who buys it second hand. The codes eventually expire and are consumed on use, and the characters and armor are non-transferable. Bioware claims that the intent isn't to artificially damage the game's resale value, but it's hard to imagine any legitimate reason for not simply including these two things in the game which were ready at launch.Worse, the game's inventory system is atrocious. You start out with 70 backpack slots, and each item (or, in the case of stackable items, each stack) consumes 1 slot. In a game like this, where you often have to carry multiple gear sets for each character you're using, plus hang on to crafting materials, upgrades, and quest items, you run out of space quickly. You can expand your slots to 120 by buying backpacks from merchants for a steep price, but even this is not adequate as the game progresses, and you'll often find yourself having to trash items, leave them behind, or make constant trips to a merchant to get rid of un-needed junk. And this is where the worst fears of DLC are realized: the Warden's Keep expansion is currently the only way to remedy this problem. When you buy the extra DLC for $7, you get a short side quest, a few new pieces of gear, and, the only really worthwhile addition, a chest that allows you to store 90 items without having to keep them on your character.I'm all for DLC that adds value. I would gladly pay a few bucks to extend my experience with a fun game. However, creating a game that requires you to store a large number of items, then providing no workable way to do that without buying additional content is just malicious. Bioware claims there was a chest in the party camp, but it had to be removed before release due to bugs. However, the Warden's Keep DLC was available at launch, and, apparently, the storage there works just fine, so that's a dubious claim at best.Overall, the game is fun, but the inventory system is a major distraction, and the fact that the only way to \"fix\" this basic game feature is to buy add-ons is a slap in the face. It's a good game, but because of the vicious way in which the DLC is used, I'm going to look long and hard at future Bioware purchases.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"El Loro del Fuego","summary":"Not the quality I was expecting from Bioware","reviewText":"I have always been a huge fan of Bioware.  Ever since I played Kotor I was always excited for what bioware was coming out with next.I was pretty excited to play dragon age because from what I could see the combat looked a lot like the combat in kotor.As the game started out I was having quite a bit of fun figuring everything out.  The combat was a lot like kotor.As I got deeper and deeper into the game, however, I started finding a lot of things about dragon age that frustrated me.  It got to the point where I was getting more frustration than enjoyment out of the game.I guess what began it all was when the game crashed on me not once but 2 times.  Yes, you can save whenever in the game but the game takes so long to load up.  A game just shouldn't do that.  There are a bunch of bugs and glitches in the game as well that don't break the game but certainly are noticable.  The game doesn't run at a steady framerate ever and the load times can get pretty lengthy at times.I could have forgiven those problems but I got pretty frustrated with some gameplay elements as well.  One of the biggest ones for me was the friendly AI.  At first its not so bad because the fights are pretty managable but when things get really heavy later on it gets hard and frustrating trying to keep track of what your teamates are doing.  I fiddled around with their behavior commands a lot but I found that it didnt help all that much.  They continued to keep being overwhelmed and sometimes even ignoring their commands completely.  After losing fight after fight after fight I finally gave up.That kind of ties into the other problem I have with the game.  It is one of those games where you kind of have to learn as you go.  the learning curve is kind of steep.  A lot of details about the game don't get explained so you are just left to figure it out for yourself.  I constantly got myself into quests that were out of my league due to my lower level but I wouldn't be aware of that until I got into the middle of it.  In those cases I had to load my game or backtrack to the beginning.  I also felt like my equipment was always inferior to what I should have had.  I kept the same dang sword for my whole playtime because none other sword i found was an improvement but my sword hardly did any damage to the enemies.Im not saying that this game is terrible but it just wasn't what I was expecting from bioware.  I think i got frustrated because I saw a lot of potential that wasnt tapped into.  I can definitely see how others can end up loving this game and having a lot of fun with it.In my case, however, I didn't have the patience required to micromanage everything and constantly be preparing for the next game crash.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2012"}

Needless to say, I was thrilled when I opened the gift and found this controller.My excitement was short-lived, as the controller didn't work properly.  I installed the batteries and plugged the receiver into the machine, but the right analog stick wouldn't work.  Some games it registered only downward motion, others it didn't register any motion at all.  Needless to say, I was crushed.I phoned Logitech's customer support, and after hearing my tale, they sent me out a free replacement within 3 weeks.  The new controller works perfectly, and set up only took about 5 minutes.This controller feels the same as the regular DualShock PS2 controller, only lighter.  The receiver is very small, fitting into a single controller slot and only protruding a little more than a memory card.The batteries are included, and they are supposed to last over 100 hours (with the rumble feature turned off).

This summer I've played alot of them to pass time while I enjoy my summer break and used to play them alot when I was little. I found this game in Gamestop for about $12. I read the back of the box to see how much there is to do which looked to be alot and it sounded like fun. At first it was fun. It was original. I've never played a puzzle game like Zak and Wiki before.The graphics are really neat. I love the cartoony feel of the game. It made me even more excited to get to the adventure stuff as I played the tutorial level at the start. It made me more and more anxious when I got my first item. On the first 3 levels I died a few times, but figured out what I had to do after awhile. It irritated me abit, but I figured its all in the challenge. Then comes the first boss level. OMG! It took me so long to figure it out. Theres actually more then one way to finish it, but I couldn't figure either out. The second way which involves turning him into an item is hidden! I had to consult a walkthrough after beating the level to figure it out. Its completely by luck that you'll find it on your first tryXD Then came levels after this. It was then I realized that this game is completely depended on trial and error. I learned that you can actually mess up so bad that the levels impossible unless you start over. In one of the ice levels theres this guy you have to turn into a totem. I didn't know this and ended up destroying the icicle that was to be used to trap him. I spent minutes on end trying to figure out what to do before giving up and eventually finding out whats to be done. Don't even get me started on the ice boss.Platinun Tickets and dolls will only get you so far in this game. For one thier extremely expensive so you might as well go on the internet and find out what to do. I really see no purpose in the level rewind option with the dolls. From my experience you still end up losing all your money, so you might as well die and start over. Plus hints only get you so far. Sometimes they just state stuff you've already figured out which renders them useless more often than once. It shows no mercy! In missions it doesn't give you much room to mess up. If I was given maybe more than one consecutive chance I might figure out how to beat the level without dying so much, but I'm so busy replaying the level over and over that I have to think fast expecially on timed challenges on what I'm supposed to do while the chance is still open. It gets irksome fast. For later levels I actually had to consult walkthroughs to get pass them which I never had to do before with puzzle games. Alot of the deaths just happen unexpectently. You just won't see them coming unless you're PCP or have the 6th sense.Zak and Wiki is a hard game to recommend. On one hand I did get some fun out of the game early on and the story seems interesting, but its intense difficulty and punishments for messing up will turn many peaple off (this is why I give it 3 stars). This wouldn't be bad if it was intended for an older audience, but this is ment for kids. I don't see too many kids having the patients to go through the trial and errors this game inflicts. I, an 18 year old, could barely handle the frustrating points without turning the game off in frustration and coming back only to finally beat it than get stuck again(I'm on the lava levels BTW. I can't imagine what later ones are like). Now I'm stuck again and despite this I still keep playing and don't know why. I guess I'm just tenacious.If you're a fan of puzzle games I recommend renting it first. If you like it enough then give it a buy.Extra Note: Today I'm editing this review because theres one more important point I must add that I forgot yesterday. Throughout certain levels theres this minigame. You must find this very small sparkling white thing sticking out the ground and ring your bell near it. Its a rythm minigame involving using the wii mote as a bell. This thing is IMPOSIBLE! I only managed to pass two of them out of shear luck, but only after repeating it over and over. I tried moving and holding the wii mote in different ways and ringing with different speeds and timing and still it seems like it reads movement at random. Forget about the longer notes. I try ringing it the way the game says but its still luck. If anyone knows how to properly beat this minigame please tell me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2010"}

If you bought the 3G bundle,  stick to the included memory. Each game save ranges from 2,500 to 3600 KB, so you should have plenty for now, even the FEB 4GB card should be enough for that.

Open-ended like a new science-fiction world and played as a seat-of-your-pants RTS game, this is a very intelligent hybrid that I greatly enjoyed.In effect, SINS is a successful blend of the wonderful GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS and HOMEWORLD series, with a sprinkling of TOTAL WAR for good measure. This is NOT a turn-based civilization game, so expect a much faster pace. What this means is that while it maintains the characteristics of classic turn-based civilization games (exploration, expansion, exploitation and extermination), by relieving from the micromanagement tedium, it allows for an intense RealTime Strategy experience. Now, this probably may not appeal to turn-based purists, but I would advise an open mind: this is a good game.This concept-blending is new, so expect a slow learning curve - it took me a number of ...false-starts to get the hang of it: after all, it plays like an RTS and (although simplified) it still has enough of turn-based features that need to be taken care of. The interface is simplified and informative at the same time, with info trees sliding out only when needed.There are three different factions to choose from (financiers, technologists and psitecs) - yet, their differences focus mainly on research tree-branching and ship designs. What I did not like was that the ships of all three factions are effectively the same and their differences are only skin-deep. What I would have liked to find (and was disappointed to the point of withholding the 5th star for fun) was ship design and building! Remember how much fun was to design our own spaceships (from freighters to battleships) in GALACTIC CIVILIZATIONS II? Well, no such luck here. Let's hope they keep it in mind when the patch gets prepared.Quick and constant exploration is not only encouraged by a necessity if one wants to survive - let alone win. Spaceships built within a solar system cannot travel beyond it, unless using \"wormhole\"-like singularities. This adds to realism but can stretch your finances to their breaking point - since only locally built ships can be used. Moreover, it makes really hard to locate the strategic points to either built defenses or focus an attack. The AI will constantly be bypassing your planning like the Maginot line - and leave you with such a French feeling...The graphics (of all of backgrounds, planets and units) are very nicely done. I really liked the multiple afterburners tracing through space as a spaceship squadron was dopplering past my screen...And less-than-cutting-edge PC owners rejoice: even 4-5 years old systems can handle this game like a breeze!What I truly appreciated was the realistic scale of things. Galaxies are much larger than star systems, which in turn are much larger than planets, which in turn are much larger than space stations...than spaceships and so on. How is this achieved? Excellent zooming!SUPREME COMMANDER was the first game to introduce strategic zoom; however, SINS implements it much better and shows how it should had been done: from a galaxy to a single planet and to a single spaceship, zooming in or out firmly maintains the effectiveness of battle controls by grouping and simplifying the info-tiles as one zooms out. In SupCom, we had to chose between either discerning the units or moving ...info-tiles around the battlefield - not a bad first attempt, mind you. In SINS, one almost never looses perspective: ongoing battles, critical hotspots, or colony revolts are all easily identifiable in real-time.On another note, SINS OF A SOLAR EMPIRE is a STARDOCK release which, yes, means their specialized installation utility. Nevertheless, this game hides no DRM or other intrusive security idiocy. Since trust and respect between a game publisher and its customers is a two-way street (and STARDOCK was willing to prove its friendship first), SINS deserves our support.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2008"}

Although the most popular one is Mario, there are ones who continued to be as surprising. The Legend Of Zelda is no acception. The epic game series featuring Link has redefined what epic games should be. Although that also could be said with new video game systems as well. For Nintendo, they wanted to break it wide open with their new console, the Wii. But, with a new system, can Link and his new quest deliver on the Wii, the same way Zelda games have thrived before like Ocarina Of Time delivered? Here is the review.The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess for the Nintendo Wii, is a wild and outrageous epic that shines brighter than any Nintendo game released in a long time. The objective of the game is simple, Link is back and he is learning his way through another quest, when during one split second, he is transformed into a wild wolf. Along the way, he has to battle shadow demons and reclaim the light that once thrived in Hyrule which was stolen by the vile Ganondorf. The graphics for the game are breathtaking, just like the edition for the Gamecube, and the feeling of the music thives with each portion of the game from the Forest Temple to the Baron Woods. The control is a bit tricky for new Wii gamers, but it is very simple to pick up, after a bit of practice, especially with the shooting with the slingshot, and the way you move the Wii controller.All in all, I was very impressed with The Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess. It is definitely one of the most outrageous games ever released in a long while, but for anybody who is a die hard fan of the series, it is definitely worth it. I definitely recommened this for anyone who has the Wii, or wants the new Nintendo system.
