It's different than most games because instead of defeating enimies, you most solve puzzles. The graphics are beautiful and the sound effects are eerie.The story in this game(off the back cover):Within a world of enchantment and wonder, evil resides in an ancient castle. Ico, a young boy born with horns, has been expelled from his village and left within this isolated fortress. Embarking on a perilous quest to save himself as well as a beautiful princess, Ico must find a way to escape. However, escaping will be no easy task. Every towering staircase and stone block is a piece of a puzzle. Every open window, dangling chain and razor thin escape illuminates another mystery.The wierd thing about this game is that you don't have any health. The only way you can die is if you fall of a cliff and you get a game over if you allow the princess to be captured by the dark spirits. Instead of fighting off the dark spirits, you must cast spells on them which will stop them temporarally but they will still come after you.The only real downside to this game is that it is incredibly short. I was able to beat it in less than 6 hours, but the game is fun while it lasts.I would recommend this game to any platformer who is ready for a new type of challenge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2004"}

It is, in my opinion as a gamer, one of THE best games to ever grace a console.  If you own a Playstation 2, you must play this game.  Whether you are into adventure or action, you must play this game.  If you have never played this game, consider yourself deprived.  In all of my years as a gamer and that is many, many years, I have never come across a game such as this.  This is just totally awesome.  Once you play it, you will never come out the same.  You cannot stop playing this game.  I was totally addicted.The puzzles in this game are just pure genius.  The action, although it takes a back seat to the puzzle elements, are sufficient.  If I were to compare this with any other game, it would be Zelda.  But this game is in a league of its own.  It simply OWNS the genre called adventure.  I would wonder if the guy that calls this game a rehash of Tomb Raider actually played this game through.  I have played Tomb Raider and I don't think that it is anything at all close to ICO.  It's like comparing a Mercedes with a Hyundai.I was totally engrossed by this game.  I was up until the wee hours during the ending.  This game will grab you by the shirt and never let go.  It has one of the greatest cinematic effects in any video game.  It plays like a movie.  All the elements of a great game are in it.  Along with the great graphics (even by today's standards), awesome sound and absolute perfection in gameplay execution.If you own a Playstation 2, you owe yourself a play through with this masterpiece.  I am now a believer.  All those \"effusive\" rave reviews are all warranted.  If I knew how great this game was before I had purchased it, I would have easily spent the fifty dollars that other games are going for (most of which are not worth the list price).  People say that this game is short but I say that it is perfect.  Believe me it is not short unless you go to sites for game cheats.  It will suck out time from your life but it will be all worthwhile.  Besides, its not the length of the game, it's the quality of the time.  And this game has it all in spades!So to conclude this review I have to say that this game is one of THE greatest games of all time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2007"}

There are a very few negatives to be found here and a long list of positives. These 3 games have aged very well and look fantastic. Each set in the series controls slightly different and brings something unique to the table, while keeping the charm of its story line in tact. The mini games are actually a lot of fun; not just cheap, last minute add-ins. Even if you have played all of these games before, you'll find that this is still worth replaying, if for no other reason than the fact that they've turned this collection into a trophy-fest. There are 3 platinum trophies to be collected here. And they are among the easiest to be had on the system. You pick up loads of trophies between the platinums; many of which are silver and gold. Apart from a camera that doesn't always love you (mostly in the first game) and a few places where the controls aren't as responsive as they otherwise prove to be, this is the gold standard of platformers. The challenge will prove solid enough for adult gamers to get wrapped up in, while younger gamers will stick with it and become better gamers thanks to its look and its characters. This is a must own for any fan of solid gaming, designed to keep the player having fun; as opposed to suffering endless frustration.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2011"}

You must escape the doomed city or become part of a ghastly new food chain: one with you at the bottom.You play as either Leon Kennedy, a rookie cop who's having areallybad first day on the job, or Claire Redfield, sister of one of the stars of the originalResident Evil. Leon and Claire's meeting is depicted in a visually stunning, B-movie cutscene. They're quickly separated, but occasionally meet up throughout the game.Right after the gruesome intro, you're dumped into the thick of things and have to dash through the devastated city streets, fleeing from one horde of zombies after another. As you make your way to a supposed refuge--the city police station--you find evidence that the citizenry fought bravely against the undead menace--and lost. Smashed barricades, abandoned police cars, boarded-up stores, dismembered bodies, and hundreds of expended bullet shell casings are all-too-common sights. Once you reach the station, you discover the remains of a siege. The defenders' desperate final hours are recorded in a fragmented journal. Its pages detail a possible escape route through an underground passage. Did the cops make it out?

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"So, so close to gaming perfection","reviewText":"Dragon Age, or as I've referred to it the last 6 months, fantasy Mass Effect, is about as close as one can come to a perfect fantasy RPG. That being said, there are several glaring and not so glaring nits that make this game needlessly frustrating and difficult.You play a Grey Warden, recruited from one of 6 backgrounds, making this a game you at least have to play 6 times to even see every opening. What follows is a somewhat linear war story before reaching the main game, becoming like a game of Neverwinter Nights writ large.Graphics suck. Plain and simple. Compared to Mass Effect, one wonders if they didn't fire the entire staff. Backgrounds are seemingly interchangable, long distance vistas, which some games make the biggest bang on, appear to be made of legos. The blood splatter effect, while nifty, loses its appeal after you realize it has two settings: blood and no-blood. The bloom on the target identifiers obscures lots of fine detail. Lighting is weird and poorly placed, making ruins and night seem like a photo shoot and certain stretches of the woods in the day seem like lightless caves. However, the graphics are not anywhere close to bad enough to really detract from the game overall.Audio makes up for the large part of the graphics, except for one glaring, infuriating, unforgivable sin: you're a mute. After Mass Effect, I was expecting long diatribe arguments with wizards and kings, riddling with dragons, and wooing tavern wenches. Alas, I get to push myself closer to glasses by trying to read minuscule text that spells out my conversation. If ME2 goes this way as well, I may send Bioware a thank-you bomb.Gameplay is basically Neverwinter Nights. A swirling melee, including you and several party members, against knots of level scaled opponents. Special attacks and leveled skills compliment your character class, but the laurels go to the warriors as usual. The controls make it a sight better, as your characters excel at their classes. Rogues circle to opponents backs and then begin to stab like they're driving nails. Archers hold fighting retreats. Tactics and behaviors are extremely customizable, with if-then commands and general postures, making strategy fairly useful apart from charge and hack everything until it all stops moving.Now the nits. Text is impossible to read at times, even on my wide-screen, and can not be resized. After this has driven up blood pressure from Prototype, Dead Rising, and numerous others, EA and every other publisher should realize they need a way for these games to play subtitles on less than 1000 dollar TV's. And certain text is glossed over. One next feature of Morrowing has been to open a letter immediately when its picked up. DA treats them like any other item, and buries the text in the Codex, rather than list it in the items, making it seem like its a quest item with no text, meaning you're easily glossing over fluff and potential side quests.Overall, the game is great. Some points missed polish, and graphics suffered badly, but hopefully we're feeling the pain now as opposed to only getting mediocre results with later releases.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}

Maybe it just wasn't my type of game.  The graphics were pretty good, though it isn't top notch where everything looks realistic.  The gameplay was a little tough, one thing that was discouraging was how fast your life bar dies out battling some enemies.  Sometimes, if you die you have to restart from where you last saved or auto saved.  The bad thing is that if you save at a bad time or with low life, then you're in trouble.The good thing is that you're able to explore the vast lands and find interesting things, it just sucks that enemies keep popping up, and worst of all if you steal anything and you meet a guard, you have to pay gold coins, go to jail, or get killed by the guards so you better have a horse to run away fast!  That was the most annoying part, meeting those guards and having to reload.  Another bad thing is the loading, though it doesn't take too long  it gets annoying at the loading screen.Overall, this is an okay game, I wasn't that impressed with it like most people were.  This game seems just like Fable and I did enjoy Fable, so hopefully when Fable 2 arrives it'll be a great game to play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-25-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"RPG Fan","summary":"Turn-Based is Not Dead!!!","reviewText":"I guess I'm one of the few who love turn-based RPGs, and it's quite obvious that they are becoming a rarity.  FFX on PS2 was the last one I've really enjoyed (at least the last big title most people would know about), then they started going for active battle.  And of course we have our mega-hit western RPG of Mass Effect, which was a great game.  But where's the love for turn-based?  Are people forgetting their RPG roots?  Did you not love Chrono-Trigger, any of the earlier FFs, or any other(s) that you may have grown up with?  After FFX I've been itching for a good turn-based with a good battle mechanic and story.  Lost Odyssey delivers.  Thank \"God,\" turn-based is not dead.I'm only on the second disc (some people have to go to work, you know) so people may say my opinion of this being a five-star game is premature.  However, I've played enough so far to know that this is a great game.  When I first popped in the disc and watched that awesome, amazing cinematic at the beginning I knew I was in for something great.  Speaking of that cinematic, I couldn't wait to get to a save-point so I could watch it again.  Then I watched it again so I could show another person just how incredible this game is.  Awesome, awesome stuff.The battle system is great.  The use of rings keeps it so that you're not just pressing \"attack,\" \"attack,\" \"attack...\"  What I really love is the difficulty and I guess you could say the AI.  Every battle is an effort, you can't just use a caster or your top tank and knock out enemies in one blow, you actually have to use healing spells and items during normal, random battles-- every character gets into every fight.  This is definitely a welcome change.  In previous games that I've played you almost always had 99 healing herbs, they were rarely used.  Your top two characters could finish off a fight in a matter of seconds and battles almost became annoying.  When you visited stores you generally ignored the item store and went straight to armor and weapons.  In LO I've found myself out of healing herbs and resurrection items from normal, random battles and you constantly have to restock.  One thing, though, is I wish there was armor.  You only equip weapons (which you can actually see during battles, you don't have the same sword appearance throughout the game, which is good), rings, and \"charms.\"  Hopefully in the next episode of LO (from what I understand this is an ongoing saga that will span a few more games) armor will be equip-able and hopefully it will show up during battles.  I'm going to use FFX again as an example, but when you equipped a player with a different shield or bracelet, it showed up in battles.  The designs of such items is always cool.My main gripe with the battle system is you have to set-up each characters moves to be carried out together all at once.  The reason I don't like this set-up is if you knock out one enemy the next character in line that you've set up commands for will just attack the next enemy.  Example, one of your tanks knocks out a fire elemental but you already set up a caster to cast water on it.  Because it's been knocked out the caster casts water on the next enemy, maybe a water elemental, screwing things up.  If you have individual attacks you can knock it out with the tank, then properly cast earth on the water elemental for your next turn instead of your move being pre-set.  I prefer having characters attack one at a time, that way I can change up which enemy I'm attacking next, which spell, etc...The story so far is amazing.  The dreams are great stories, really well written stuff that should probably be published as a compilation of short stories, they work well enough alone that they don't even necessarily have to be linked to the game.  They're \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" kind of stuff.  My one complaint with the dreams is sometimes I'm pressed for time and can't sit and read a story for 5+ minutes, I need to get to the next save point.  Sometimes I just feel like whooping some monster butt and don't want to sit and read.  Thankfully you can skip them if you want and come back later to read them.  The one thing though, is having them as readable stories was a good choice.  A cinematic for each would have been cool, but the manner in which the author describes feelings, smells, colors, etc... is far more involving.  You will definitely have some emotions stirred up by some of them, without a doubt.I really think that Lost Odyssey should be a game of the year contender.  The graphics are amazing, there aren't any frame rate issues (Mass Effect, I'm looking at you), the story is great, the game play is awesome, and the music is perfect.  A lot of reviewers said load times were an issue but they're about the same as Elder Scrolls.  It's just really a shame turn-based JRPGs don't get the love they deserve.  LO is a great game, don't miss out on it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2008"}

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"Other superhero games should aspire to be like this one","reviewText":"Batman: Arkham Asylum is not only an incredible superhero video game, it's better than most games I've played. The combat, the controls, the graphics, the atmosphere, the voice acting, it's all fantastic. That being said, I didn't buy this game, I only rented it. I apologize to any Batman or DC comics fanboys/whining babies in advance, but this must be said... I'm not a really big fan of DC comics. It's not that I don't like Batman or DC, I just prefer Marvel comics much more than DC comics. If I were more into DC, Batman would definitely be one of my favorites. But since I already have a lot of games and don't like to buy every one that catches my interest, I chose to only buy Marvel games over DC games; the good ones only, not the lousy ones like Iron Man. Still, I have to admit, Batman: Arkham Asylum is better than pretty much any of the Spider-Man games I have, even Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man: Web of Shadows. This game follows everyone's favorite Caped Crusader as he delivers the Joker to the titular loony bin once again and places him into the custody of the guards, only for the wily wacko to escape from his guards and then wrest control of the entire island by taking the asylum's employees hostage and threatening to detonate several bombs in Gotham City should anyone try to come into the asylum. Joker and his foolish follower Harley Quinn are able to watch Batman through the many cameras and viewscreens throughout the asylum and mock him with their rather amusing jokes and one-liners that they're known for.It's going to be a long night for the Dark Knight (yes, it rhymes). However, he will have some help from Oracle (the alias Batgirl used when confined to a wheelchair) who can communicate with Batman and use her helpful researching skills to assist Batman in his battle against the Joker. Batman will have to explore pretty much the entire asylum and the surrounding area of the island to track down the Joker and stop his crazy plot (which I won't spoil). To do this, Batman will have to make great use of his wits and many gadgets to locate clues that will help him figure out how to stop the Joker, as well as track down certain hostages and allies so Joker doesn't have them killed. Bats will of course also have to beat up many thugs and psychos that Joker has released from their cells to use them as his own army of henchmen. Some of the gadgets the Dark Knight will use include: batarangs that can stun enemies and give Batman an opening to attack, the grappling gun that allows Batman to reach higher ledges or save himself from a deadly fall, explosive foam that can be used to blast down certain walls and barriers, and other gadgets that you acquire later in the game.Batman's detective mode, which is built into his mask, gives him x-ray vision which highlights important items and substances that can be followed as clues. It also lets him see where hostages and enemies are, as well as their state of mind (calm, scared, panicking) and if enemies are armed. Speaking of enemies, you'll normally encounter them in one of two types of instances: stealth (predator) sessions or straight-up combat sessions. During the stealth sessions, Batman will be required to take out a number of thugs armed with guns in order to save hostages or simply to advance to the next area. The guys who built Arkham Asylum had a strange preference for gargoyle statues and placed several of them near the ceilings of most areas in the asylum; this is good for Batman, since he can use them to stay above his prey and then take them out before being spotted by other enemies. He can either use his cape to glide down to his enemies and kick them in the face as he lands or wait for them to pass underneath him as he's perched on a gargoyle, lowering himself over them and plucking them up in his cape to knock them out, leaving them hanging from the gargoyle by their feet. Taking out one enemy and letting his friends find him unconscious puts them on edge and it can be rather satisfying hearing the thugs panic and breathe heavily in fear of the one who hunts them (sometimes they'll even shoot wildly around themselves in the hopes of landing a hit on Batman). Beware, because you won't always be able to rely on the gargoyle statues in some of the later stealth sessions. Fortunately, Batman can use other methods to sneak up on his enemies, such as crawling through air vents or crawl spaces underneath the floors and pounce on them when they get close. If spotted, Batman should either shoot up to the nearest gargoyle statue and out of sight, or run away to the nearest vent or crawl space since the enemies with guns can kill Batman in seconds.In combat sessions, Batman can make use of his superb fighting skills, batarangs, and some later weaponry to take out many enemies with style and flair. He'll mostly fight regular thugs, psychos armed with knives, thugs with shock batons, and animalistic psychos who simply jump on the hero and tear at him like feral cats (you'll even see these guys eating rats on certain occasions... yummy). Using a similar control layout to Spider-Man 2, the four face buttons let Batman use several different fighting moves. One lets him attack, one lets him stun enemies with a swing of his cape, one lets him block/counter his enemies, and one lets him run/dodge roll. Because of this simple and accessible layout of controls, the combat ends up being one of the best things about this game, if not the best thing. Picking up a good rhythm when fighting enemies is key to keeping Batman's health up (kind of like Devil May Cry), since large numbers of tougher thugs can be a challenge for Bats if he gets cornered, especially if they use makeshift weapons like nearby cinderblocks or pipes that they pull off the walls. Plus, the longer you keep up an uninterrupted combo using either of the four main forms of attack, as well as batarangs and so on, the more damage Batman's attacks will do after each successful hit, and you'll earn more experience points. These points can be used to upgrade Batman's gear: throwing several batarangs at once, tougher body armor to increase durability, learn special grappling and throwing moves, etc. The graphics to this game are among the best I've seen in a video game. The characters and environments all look fantastic and detailed. One thing the game could have used a bit more of was more challenging and varied boss fights. More than once, Batman will fight these thugs who have been beefed up like Bane; sometimes there will be two of them and they'll be backed up by regular thugs.Batman will also fight Bane, Poison Ivy in a large mutated plant, and an endboss who doesn't really bring anything new to the table. The boss fights were fun, but could have had more to them. However, Batman does face off against other villains in different ways. He encounters Scarecrow in a few nightmare-like scenarios when he gets affected by his annoying fear toxin, which are fun and interesting (one tries to trick you into believing you've got a game over, like a couple of the Metal Gear Solid games have done). He also has a rather pulse pounding encounter with Killer Croc, but you don't directly fight him; it would have been cool if you could fight him afterwards, but sadly you don't. There are also many hidden Riddler clues, entertaining recordings of therapy sessions involving Batman's rogues gallery, and other secrets for avid collectible hunters to find, even after you've completed the game. Technically, this game is a free-roaming sandbox game, but not as large scaled or in the same style as the Spider-Man games or Infamous; aside from collecting the hidden secrets I just mentioned, there are actually few moments where you'll have to revisit an area for a mission. What will keep most players busy after the game are the challenge maps, where you play as Batman (or Joker after downloading him) in increasingly difficult stealth and combat sessions... those are fun. Finally, I'll end with a quick praise of the voice acting, specifically Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy, who voiced Joker and Batman respectively in the game as well as the DC animated series and movies. They will always be the true voices of those characters. You all know the silly reason why I didn't buy this game, but that shouldn't stop the rest of you from buying it. Go for it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B003O6CBIG","description":"","reviewerName":"steve","summary":"Call of Duty: Generic","reviewText":"SPOILERS FOLLOWSPOILERS FOLLOWOk, now that I got that out of the way (because I always have one or two people who will complain if I don't mark it appropriately), let me continue.Though I am not a Call of Duty Groupie, I am a fan of the series for what it is - a knock-down, drag-out military shooter that has left its World War II roots (as seen in Call of Duty 3 and Call of Duty: World at War) behind and instead adopted a more modern approach.  Just as the Modern Warfare trilogy and the pair of Black Ops games before it, Call of Duty: Ghosts puts you in the boots of a skilled, special operations solider that will encounter waves of enemies through a variety of missions while fighting to stop the bad guys from taking over the world (or at least from starting World War III).  This review is only for the single player campaign portion of the game, not Multiplayer - just so you know from the start.  I will break this review down into five sections: Graphics, Sound, Controls, Story, and Replay Value.Graphics: While the graphics are great in their own right, they are not noticeably better by any means than Black Ops II - in fact, they're probably the same.  So, if you're expecting a leap in graphics, go next-gen with this title.  Other than that, all the graphical effects are on par with Activision's last entry into the Call of Duty franchise, BO2.Sound: Again, while no leap forward, the gunfights and explosions are well-orchestrated, sound-wise, and the ambient sounds are pretty good, but not better than the last iteration.  The voice quality and acting is really good, so you won't be disappointed with that by any means.Controls:  Like the old adage goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Pretty much is the same story here.  The controls and responsiveness are virtually the same as all the other Call of Duty games so, if you love their control system you'll love COD: Ghost's controls as well.Story:  Here's where the game heavily suffers.  While the story is creative, it does not draw you in the same way Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare that released in 2007 did.  With that game, you were enthralled by the Marines and Commandoes you played as.  In this game, you can sympathize with them to a point but, at the end of the day, you just don't really care a lot about their struggles.  Also, the plot is slightly interesting but predictable, and this takes away from the experience heavily.  It seems that Infinity Ward's creative streak is about out, and the ideas being put into their games are mediocre, at best.Replay: I haven't played multiplayer or extinction yet, but both modes look to be capable of breathing more life back into the game.  I don't think I'll ever play the campaign again, but I am rather excited about trying out MP and extinction.  Replay for the campaign? Non-existent.So, there you have it.  Activision pumped out a lack-luster FPS that is dead-last out of all of the recent Call of Duty games taking place in non-WWII settings.  Buy this if you want, or wait until next year and pick it up for less.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2013"}

Sound unrelated? It really isn't. In fact, I was surprised by how much the two games have in common in their gameplay. This is a multiplayer hack n'slash much like Diablo 2. The fun of it is that you get to play as one of the X-men and can have up to 3 tag-along teammates, live or computer controlled, to help you complete your missions.I enjoyed the way you could control the way in which your characters level, allowing you to focus on specific abilities.For example, do you want to level up Iceman to master his powers of freezing opponents as an assist power, or would you rather beef up his ability to throw ice powered punches in hand-to-hand combat? Would you prefer to focus on Jean Grey's abilities to confuse groups of enemies or increase her use of telekinesis to slam them againt the walls? Should wolverine increase his ability to strike with monstrous slashes or should he focus on his healing ability and speed? Decisions like this add to the games replay value.Game-play worked well. Special moves were easy to execute and basic melee combos were not too difficult to integrate into each battle. Switching between characters is a breeze and can really enhance the solo player's ability to coordinate attacks of all his characters. Also, the level construction varies a lot from sinking battleships crawling with sentinels, to underground sewers full of morlocks. A lot of the environment is destructible including walls which really enhances the gameplay. There's nothing like watching Jean Grey hurl a pool table at a cluster of baddies.The graphics in-play are cell shaded which I liked just fine. I was less impressed with the cinematic cut-scenes. Some of the models were so poorly textured that they almost looked like stop motion figurines. Voice over work was well done. Notably, Patrick Stewart lends his voice to Xavier. Meanwhile, I'm pretty sure some of the talent who voice the cartoon versions of the characters were also used here, particularly Wolverine's.My only other complaint is that though battles with groups of baddies get hot, they are over fast. A lot of time is spent trashing rooms and destroying object to see if bonus items were inside them. I would have rather gotten bonus items by actually using my X-men to fight more bad guys, not to throw piles of crates against the wall.If you like the X-men, or if you just like hack n' slash, this is definitly a worthy choice for you","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2006"}

But I must also admit that it can be very hard at times and is not recommended for RPG newcomers. Seriously, this is only for experienced RPG gamers! As every Final Fantasy buff knows, the main character of this game is Cecil, dark knight of Baron and ex-Red Wing airship captain (or 'Lord Captain'). Throughout the opening of the game, Cecil's loyalty to his king starts to whither, and after you beat the first boss, it totally just flattens to the ground. Later on, it is revealed why the King of Baron is so crazy, but I won't go in to the details so I could be courteous to those who don't want spoilers. Other party members include Kain, leader of the Baron Dragoons, Rydia, a young girl and summoner, and Tellah, a kooky-looking old man and a very experienced sage. Rydia has this summon known as 'Whyt' (you can also change its name) that you can draw a face on. I named mine Issun (you know, the bug guy from Okami!) and drew the appropriate Issun face on Whyt. That right there just skyrocketed the character customization score, I tells ya! Length wise, Final Fantasy IV delivers. You will have to level up several times in another area just to defeat certain enemies in the game, and even if you didn't, the game is still pretty long. The controls are excellent. Basically you have to rapidly tap 'A' during battles in order to make a move before other opponents, which gives a good twist to the regular RPG formula. Also, you hold 'R' to run; don't try looking for it in the menu or you will be sitting there in a battle with an over-leveled Sand Worm until the Game Over screen pops up! The music, especially the theme in the opening cinematic, is fantastic (hey, its Nobuo Uematsu we're talking about)! The sound effects are pretty good, though a lot of the sounds are the same as in the original Final Fantasy IV for the SNES and sound a little dated. I didn't let that affect the score though.

The only reason I gave this game a shot is because I'm a huge Deadpool fan (like many of you reading this). If you expect this game to be the next God of War, you'll be very disappointed. However, if you have an open mind and just go with the flow, you'll be just fine.Combat - The combat isn't as polished as one might hope, but it's still entertaining. Deadpool is kind of a hybrid because I can't really classify it as a hack and slash, nor can I call it a third person shooter - it's a mixture of both. If you wanted to, you could get through much of the game by relying on your guns, or your primary choice of combat could be melee attacks (I predominantly used melee attacks). The biggest gripe with combat (regardless of your style of play) was the horrible camera. I've played several games that had questionable camera play, but Deadpool is by far the worst. When using a melee attack, the enemies tend to move around a lot, and before you know it, the enemy is out of view, and you end up dead. Very similar issues with gun-play. The auto-aim is weird and doesn't work all the time, resulting in enemies ending up out of view, and you can guess what happens next. With most games, I usually prefer to dodge attacks as opposed to blocking them. However, the terrible camera causes the evading of attacks to work against you. After evading an enemy, you'll lose where you are on the screen, and consequently end up dying (This is one game that would greatly benefit from blocking attacks, as opposed to evading). Once you get the hang of the camera, you'll just have to adjust your combat style accordingly.Weaponry - Lots of weapons; but I only tried half of them. At the beginning of the game, you'll start off with the katana swords (all weapons are upgradable). They're good for some quick hack and slash, but not very powerful. You'll also start off with two pistols. If you're interested, you can do cool combos such as thrusts an enemy in the air with your sword, then shoot holes in him while he's suspended in the air (very similar to DmC, but nowhere near as polished). I later on purchased a machine gun that's very useful for picking off bad guys from a distance. I saved my favorite weapon for last - The 20 pound hammers! Man, I'll tell you what... It was love at first sight with those things; they're slow, but powerful as hell!  I really wish I could import those hammers into other games because they're extremely fun to use. As I mentioned earlier, there are other weapons available for purchase, but once I discovered the hammers, I wasn't interested in anything else.Enemies - I was pleasantly surprised by the variety. During the first few hours, I was a little scared because I kept seeing the same enemy type(s) over and over. Luckily, variety picked up as I moved along. Unlike many other games in this genre, there were quite a few one on one battles with non-boss enemies. Sadly, this experienced was slightly diluted because of the terrible camera. Overall, the bad guys were not exceptionally difficult to defeat, until you reached the bosses. Sighs... The Deadpool boss battles were the most difficult battles I've ever been a part of. They were hard because of the camera, cheap attacks, and unfair advantages. Hell, one battle featured three bosses at once, while another had as many as 10 or 11! Sounds crazy, huh?Miscellaneous - Deadpool is a linear game that offers very little to do, outside of combat. In other words, there are no puzzles, very few collectables, and no exploration. This can be good or bad, depending on what you're into. Although there's no exploration, I still believe a map would have been beneficial. There were several occasions where I was inside a building and I had no idea where to go or what to do. This would be extremely frustrating if Deadpool wasn't such a funny guy with hilarious commentary.There are two reasons I deducted a star. The camera was unforgiving, and either a map or something pointing you in the right direction was sorely needed. Despite those shortcomings, it's still a fun game and I'm glad I played it. If you're a Deadpool fan, definitely get it! If you're not a Deadpool fan, and you're looking for something short and pretty straightforward, you should give this a chance.

I have a G500 mouse and noticed almost no difference between it and the G500s.

The 500s has blue lighting instead of red. Whatever lag issues others referred to at the release, I did not experience.Now don't get me wrong. This is still a great mouse with a lot of options. The coarse texture on the side makes it easy to grip. On the fly sensitivity changes are nice, especially since you can customize the levels. You can easily use profiles for specific games. There are just a lot of choices. The weights are fun to tweak with until you know which combination you prefer.  Now every once in a while, I do think about my old Razer mouse which did not have nearly as many options as these newer Logitech mice, but the form factor was quite different. I don't exactly have small hands but at times this mouse feels a little on the large side, but hours of use don't bother my hand and there is plenty of real estate to rest my palm. If I had any wants... I kind of hoped the grill was not just a sticker like it is. I kind of wanted to try how that might feel, but you know, I could have just as easily hated that.If you are looking to replace your G500 because you don't like it, stay away from this. It is not different enough. If your G500 is getting old and beaten up and you need a new one, no reason to avoid this one. If you are still using a basic mouse and a ready for a step up to something that can really be customized for each gaming experience... here's your chance. Like the Logitech Keyboards, the profiles are really nice, and if you like to tinker with settings to the minute details, then this mouse could be just right for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2013"}

Footprints will be left in mud, for example, but only until it rains and then they will wash away. Lara's shirt will also get wet, and she's more likely to lose her grip if she is standing on a slippery, rain-soaked ledge. When the sun comes out, her shirt will dry and the slippery surfaces regain their friction.In Underworld, Lara also has a lot more flexibility in how she makes her way through a level, as there is often more than one way to get from here to there. She can now climb walls with texture and rocky outcroppings to reach areas she previously wouldn't have been able to access.All of these additions have been made to give the game a non-linear, open feel. Players can interactive with the environment by doing things they find to be intuitive, and the game will respond in an appropriate way. When Lara interacts with trees, for example, she will push aside leaves using either one or two hands depending on whether or not she's holding something. These details give a lifelike, immersive sensation to the game.New Melee Combat SystemUnderworld introduces a new melee combat system that requires players to strategically strike with offensive, defensive, and evasive maneuvers. Lara can now attack enemies with different punches, kicks, knees, and other acrobatic onslaughts. Items lying on the ground, such as poles that were previously walked on, can be picked up and swung at enemies. Players can also perform a greater variety of actions with weapons; for example, Lara can now hold onto a ledge with one hand and fire a gun with the other.Realistic Enemy and Animal AIThe AI in Tomb Raider: Underworld has also taken a big step forward--both enemies and animals now make independent decisions based on their surroundings, employ ambush and squad tactics when fighting, and will retreat if deemed necessary.With updated graphics and a more immersive and realistic gameplay, Tomb Raider: Underworld will have both fans and newcomers excited about the newest installment in this popular video game-pinup franchise.Tomb Raider: Underworld is loaded with a new melee combat system, various weapons, and smarter AI for both enemies and animals.","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Sturgeon","summary":"Three and a half stars rounded up.","reviewText":"I had been anticipating Tomb Raider Underworld for a long time. Ever since the cliffhanger ending in Legend, I don't think there was a Tomb Raider fan alive who wasn't eagerly waiting for the resolve.A few notes:If you haven't played Legend, you really need to. This is a direct continuation of its story line. If you don't know what happened in Legend, you'll be lost with the story contained in Underworld. A passing knowledge of what happened in Anniversary would also be advised.The good:There was a conscious effort on the programmer's part that if it seems like Lara should be able to do something, she can do it. For the first time the technology was available to let Lara do virtually anything the programmers could imagine. Poles Lara could only swing from before, she can now swing, perch, balance and fire a gun from. By far, this version of Lara can do more than she could in any previous game.The areas are huge and, for the most part, non-linear. There are a couple sections near the end where you're basically being herded down a single corridor. But for the most part, this is the epitome of what a \"go anywhere, do anything\" exploration game should be. If you know exactly what you're supposed to do, you can probably breeze through certain puzzles. But if you want to take time to explore and see what the game has to offer, you'll find it has a lot.The story is also very involving. Like I said, it's a continuation from Legend. So if you've played that, you already have a vested interest in what happens to these characters. Underworld really delivers on finally resolving the story between Lara and Amanda, Lara and Natla...and even Natla and Amanda.The bad:As much as I hate to find fault with this game, I have to be honest, there are some faults to be found.As stated in other reviews, the camera is really buggy. This more than any of the other bugs had me frustrated at times. It never became a game spoiler for me. But many times, you not only can't move the camera to where it would be of utmost advantage, many times it's a challenge just to move it to where it's not utterly useless. This more than anything keeps me from giving this game that fifth star.While not nearly as irritating as the camera, I also have noticed frame rate issues. But those tend to come and go. There's a brief moment on the part of the player of \"what's going on?\" But it passes and you're back on your way exploring.Cinematics are not unlockable like they were in Legend and Anniversary. Once you've gone past them, that's it. Only chance you'll have to see them again is if you either start a new game or go on Youtube.That brings me to my final point. Since cinematics are no longer unlockable, there's really not much else worth unlocking. There's character concept art, weapon concept art, level concept art and equipment concept art. It's hardly worth going into the \"treasure hunter\" mode to unlock it all in my opinion. It's a good thing that the levels are so huge and that it should take the average player a good while to finish the game. Because given the lack of anything worthwhile to unlock, that leaves little to nothing in the way of replay value.Final notes:This is a fun game. I hate that I had to list so many faults, because really this is a fun game. But you should know before spending the money that this does lack that certain amount of polish. As far as I'm concerned, though the good does outweigh the bad. If you're a Tomb Raider fan, you should get this game. If you're dying to find out how the Legend cliffhanger finally resolves, get this game. Just realize you may need to forgive the game for having a few little quirks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2008"}

Or maybe you're thinking: Point and click?...Check please! Or maybe you're not too excited about the month to month episode thing? Or maybe you didn't like some of Telltale's past titles?And you know what, some of your concerns may even be valid; it really depends on your expectations for this awesome release, so let me try to set some of those expectations. First of all, The Walking Dead game is for and will be loved by--and loved by is a guarantee, graphic novel readers--any true fan ofRobert Kirkman's source material.Anyone looking to run and gun down zombies will not get that out of this game. You certainly don't have to have read the book or seen the show to enjoy this game; just be sure that you are planning to get into and be part of a story-rich experience.The Walking Dead game is no Burn Zombie Burn or some other bash as many zombies' brains in as possible game. This game is a lot more of an RPG than a shooter.You start the game the day the zombie apocalypse begins concurrently from the start of the comic book series. You play as Lee, and just as in the book (and in the TV show)  where the main character Rick was initially thrown into a chaotic journey by himself to find other survivors...that's you as Lee in The Walking Dead game.There are plenty of action sequences, but your time in this game is mostly spent literally being a part of the story making some tough (and some not so tough) decisions. It's the tough decisions that will affect how the rest of the game unfolds for you, and you'll have to live with the consequences of every option you choose.The game does give you the option of \"rewinding\" back to a specific checkpoint, and you can go forward from there and choose a different option that overwrites your original decision if that's your style. But I won't do that until I complete the entire series. I tried to make the main character call \"the right move\" when presented with choice; but there is a time limit when decision time comes, and sometimes you may regret a hasty decision. For example, you'll have to choose one life over another twice during just the first episode, and I'm not sure that I made the \"right\" choice in one of those moments. But I will live with my decision until after playing through the entire series just to \"keep it real.\" The game sure does get an A for replay value.Just as in the graphic novel (and the TV show), the story is much less about zombies and more about what happens to society, its morals, laws and standards when government is lost and the planet becomes mostly uninhabitable. But this time you don't just watch it unfold on paper or on your TV screen; in this game you're part of the story...you control your integrity, your morality and ultimately your destiny. And there's real, heartfelt emotion in The Walking Dead game combined with very believable scenarios. Color me a sissy, but I actually got a little misty over one of the decisions that \"I had to\" make.The Walking Dead game is excellent...especially for just a point and click. It's as gritty and graphic as the comic book, and it's very story-rich. If you read the comic as I do...you'll love it. The graphics are appropriately very comic-bookesque. I really do feel like I'm part of a different story arc in the freakin' book! Best 20 bucks I've spent all year...so far. Plus anyone clamoring for a Platinum Trophy (or whatever the top achievement for getting all in-game achievements is on your platform) could get an easy one here; all the trophies are unmissable simply by finishing all the chapters in every episode.The Walking Dead game is a deep, personal and emotional adventure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-28-2012"}

The PS1 version (and the other versions on older systems) have good reply value, especially w/ friends & siblings. The graphics are good for a older fighting game. Similar to the arcade's. The controller configuration is good. This game has a pretty decent size roster of characters to play as. Including bosses, like Shao Kahn,Goro,Kintaro. If you have a PS2 you can play this PS1 game on it. I have a PS2 w/ HD cables. And have went into my PS3's settings, & configured it to play PS1 games. My PS3 has HDMI hooked up to a 1080LCD. When playing this game on my LCD in the PS3, it's sharp, yet smudgy. Just exposing the pixels a bit more. I still get down on it. If you have a older TV and play it on there it'll look it's best.

They could have made this more complex in that the features at least on the high-end required more input response and accuracy. Could have made this 60FPS. IDK but Tennis here just isn't what I expected. There is less control than Table Tennis from 1. Moving is no longer totally independent. It should have gone the other way imo. We should be seeing more control in games like Tennis. Frisbee is gone. WEAK. Utterly disappointing. The removal of Bocce is ridiculous. On a Bluray disc there was surely space. Removing these other games is lame.Their graphic engine is also pretty mediocre if you ask me. We should be seeing 60FPS in these games. I'm really just glad the PS4 supports the Move and with a better camera and tons of power; those games will be much more fluid and accurate if all goes well. It also kind of seems they went to a different audience with this one. I guess I am still happy with the first one I was just hoping this one would have more improvements across the board. Archery is great but not one of my favorite games and sadly the other ones are kind of like Volleyball from the first. Okay but.... I guess golf is fun its own way. Nothing great or fundamentally new though. Tiger Woods could add fantasy courses and be a much better product. Same with boxing. As soon as someone like EA makes a game for it than it is kind of redundant here. I am just waiting for the PS4 Tiger Woods to add disc golf and then these compilation games will be almost totally redundant. Nobody had completed a table tennis game though. They should have stuck with their strengths from the first one and made them better.Frisbee, Table Tennis, and Bocce were stunning for their time. Could have been glorious in 60fps. I certainly hope we see them again on the PS4 and looking a tad prettier.The cover art for this game is also truly laughable.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2013"}

I brought this thinking that it was a RPG and was shock at the graphic quality of the game and how it palyed. There are other reviews about it this title and explain a little bit more. So what I'm going to say is if you are looking for something different and just plain fun to play this is it. The story is like reading a book and plays in chapters, the action is enough to keep you going and not to complex and the one thing that I found truly amazing is that it makes the best use of the motion action of the PS3. And like a wrote earlier this could really be a Jim Henson film cause of the characters that are in the game. The only drawback of the game is that I wished that you could do more when you are exploring the mystery of the island. But other then that this is a solid title. One more thing I mentioned is RPG and that part makes up for the characters that you use throughout the game. And one tip for anybody that have trouble with the game and that is find the right folk(which they are called in the game) to beat the folklore with and you will get the game instantly.

I am more of an action and RPG fan, if anything. Please keep that in mind before sending me any nasty-gram replies.I fail to understand the overstated hype that COD4 has generated from video game critics and players alike. From either single player or multiplayer perspectives, Half Life 2, Halo 3 and Bioshock are far superior.Here are the pros and cons:Pros:Graphics - No doubt this game looks great, though not as good as BioshockSound - Great sound effects and voice-acting, again though, not as good as any of the shooters I have already mentionedCons and there are many:Gameplay - tight shooting controls, but what is up with the enemies that re-spawn in perpetuity until you cross some invisible line on the map? For a game that sells itself on realism, that is quite hokey. The fact that you have to hold down one of the joysticks to run faster is quite clumsy. I liked the \"semi-snap\" to enemy function, but it just doesn't beat the mega-tight controls in Half-Life 2 (as well as the other games in the Orange Box).Weapons - Though the guns look and sound great, the aforementioned shooters' weapons are better. Yes, those games have the creative advantage of fictional weapons, but this reviewer appreciates playing a video game more for the fantastical elements as opposed to realism. Even if we just compare the more \"realistic\" weapons, the main machine gun in Half Life 2, especially in Episode 2, trumps any of COD4's machine guns. It just feels incredible to weild that puppy from a video game perspective.Multiplayer - Maybe it's just me and the fact that I am old, but I really do appreciate the wonderful simplicity that Halo 3 offers in the ease of understanding that I have to shoot the guy on the screen who's color is opposite of my team's. I could never figure out who the heck the enemy was in COD4 until I was \"pwned\" as the kids like to say. The enemy's uniform was the same color as my teams'. Yes, that's more realistic, but who the heck wants that in a video game (apparently everyone but me)?There you have it. I just can not recommend this game. If you are looking for great shooters on XBOX 360, there are three of them out there that are top notch: Orange Box (The Half Life 2 series), Halo 3 (durrr), and Bioshock.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Craig B. \"Craig B.\"","summary":"Not as good as the first","reviewText":"I loved Halo. From the moment I picked it up it \"spoke\" to me like no other game ever has. And, I've been playing video games since pong. For 2+ years me and my friends would spend EVERY weekend playing online using XBC. Even with all that game play, it never got boring for us. Normaly, when I play a game and beat it, it then goes to the shelf to sit next to the rest of the games to collect dust. Even games that are fun to play online have never kept my attention for more than a couple of months.So, when I tried out Halo 2, I was vastly dissapointed. I felt like I was playing another sega of the Unreal franchise. Master Chief has new low gravity jumps. Multiplayer now has gravity pads. You no longer take damage when falling from up high. Part of the strategy of Halo multiplayer was using objects to break your fall. The new weapons that I will talk about shortly make for a much faster game with a \"spray and pray\" feel to it. I thought I was buying Halo. Had I wanted Unreal, I would have just bought Unreal. Part of Halo's charm for me and many others was the fact that it wasn't Unreal or Quake. It was a skill based shooter that stood on it's own.I had a few problems with the campaign mode. It was very dark compared to Halo. I don't mean sinister, just dark. Not very many bright sunny days in Halo 2. It was rather short. And they did things with the plot that I could have done without. But, even with this said it was alright.The major problem for me is the multiplayer. The multiplayer is where replayability is a huge factor. When my friends and I played Halo for 2+ years, we didn't sit around playing the campaign over and over. The main problem are the new weapons. They have removed or changed EVERY single weapon in the game. The weapon that made Halo what it was, the pistol, is no longer. This wouldn't have been all that bad, but no good substitute is offered. They said that they did this for \"balance\". But, when everyone has a pistol, there isn't a balance or overpowered issue. After all, you need some weapons more powerfull, or you might as well just only have one weapon for the whole game. Now they have a sub machine gun as the mainstay. It's a very weak weapon with a very short range. So instead of playing and shooting and having fun, I now have to chase people down to get into range. That, or wait around for a couple of minutes for a decent weapon to spawn. The plasma rifle no longer \"freezes\" an enemy. The physics of the rocket have changed and the splash damage has been reduced. The grenades have been toned down to being almost worthless. Even the sniper rifle is a little different. There are a couple of new mid ranged weapons, but at mid range you'll be lucky kill your target in a full clip. The new weapons worked fine in multiplayer, but don't translate for multiplayer. By making such a severe change in the weapons, they also made a fundemental change in the game play. It is no longer a mid ranged shooter, it is now a short ranged shooter. This is another reason it gives Halo 2 that Unreal and Quake feel. Halo 2 offers duel wielding where you can use a single hand weapon in both hands. This was a novel idea, and tried with other games before. The problem I have with it is that most of the weapons seemed toned down to force you to use duel wielding. You can't swing a dead cat around without hitting some ammo for a duel wieldable weapon. But any medium range weapons you'll be scrambling to find ammo.And there are a couple of new vehicles. They are fun, but my problems are in the changes to the vehicles we already had. Now you can board vehicles and they take damage. No more shooting a person out of a warthog as it drives by with your flag with your spawn weapon. Now you pretty much have to blow the whole thing up. GOOD LUCK! And well timed grenades no longer flip them over or stop them. Now you'll just do some damage to it instead as they drive by. And a persons shields are directly involved in when the vehicle is destroyed. You could shoot a rocket launcher at a Wraith tank and wait for the persons shield to recharge. Well, after 40 rocket launcher shots you would think it would be ready to explode, but no. Running someone over in a vehicle is much hard. I have hit people head on and simply bounce them off my vehicle about 100 feet without killing them. Boarding a vehicle is a novel idea, but a good player won't get into range of you.I could go on, and on, and on. All I have to say to end this is, try it before you buy it. They had 1.5 million pre-order sales on the first day. Not because Halo 2 was good, but because Halo was good. Those 1.5 million people hadn't even tried the game. I too was one of the unlucky. I fell for the hype and thought Bungie would make a quality game worthy of the name Halo. I was wrong.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2004"}

You can choose to play as either Ray or Thomas at the start of each chapter. To me, this presented a great opportunity for a cooperative storyline similar to Army of Two (but in the wild west) however, the developers choose not to include such a feature.The game attempts to give a backstory to Ray and Thomas but I still felt a disconnect from the characters.The in-game graphics are stellar and the environments and scenery are realistic. The graphics break down with the  facial animations and cutscenes.In general the gameplay is good. However my biggest issue with the game was also one of the most important elements of the gameplay. The quickdraw feature, which is used during duels, is flawed. Even after several duels I still did not have the feel for this and was fortunate when I finally cleared leather before my opponent. Every boss must be defeated in this manner and it takes all the fun and enjoyment out of the game. Cool idea, poor execution.The environments, lighting and sound are excellent but the story, voice-acting and game controls make this a disappointing game.I do not recommend this game.

I started playing and immediately got a real feel for the adventure that begins right from the start.The game looks amazing graphically, in fact, the PS3 shines thoroughly here in the way it creates exact shadows, and matches the characters mouths to the voices so you can almost read their lips.  When Nathan takes a swim, his clothes darken and get wet and change appearance to show it.  When Nathan gets out of the water, the clothes remain visibly wet.  Not important at all, but an incredible bit of attention to detail.  The old ruins explored in the beginning are gorgeously crafted and you can really feel the deep, dank, musty feel that they have.  In the lavish jungle, the trees, plants and everything on screen keep an amazing frame rate and the visual pleasure that this game creates is utterly everything the PS3 is all about.I haven't played through the game yet, so I'm a bit unfamiliar with all of the levels.  The ones I have seen are not terribly long, so I don't think the game will take terribly long to finish.  I hope that I am wrong, as I'd love to get further lost in the game play and story line that gets established right from the jump off.  So far there have been traps to avoid, puzzles to solve and pirates to shoot at.  I get a real Indiana Jones feel to the story.  The game play has had me climb levels, swim distances, find treasures, swing on vines and all out become an adventurer, which makes the game feel a bit like Pitfall if it had been made twenty five years later.Overall, I can only recommend this game so far.  It's been an amazing journey and I've only just begun it.  I'm usually much more biased towards my 360, but in this case the PS3 has been used perfectly to compliment what I consider one of this year's great games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2007"}

But at least it fares better as an interactive movie than as an actual game, although the beginning and ending of the \"movie\" are confusing and the ending is not very satisfying because, for one thing, you take NO PART IN IT. You just sit and watch the grand finale. And I didn't understand most of it.If the game is supposed to be a horror game, it is a failure. How scary can it be when before almost every attack, the camera turns and zooms in slow motion on the foe. There is almost NO element of surprise in the game. I had just finished replayingDead Spaceand it is 100x scarier than this (plus has a great variety of foes and weapons) and only costs $20.If the game is supposed to be a shooter, it is a total failure. If there is any difference in the killing power or capabilities between the revolver, hunting rifle, and shotgun, I couldn't detect it. The flare gun is powerful, but you rarely get it and then only a few rounds for it. You get a grand total of 3 different types of foes, and you spend 90% of your fighting time against just 1 of the 3 and 90% of the time, with the same type of weapon. I've seen reviews where people have complained about the lack of variety of opponents in other games which have 6-10 different types of opponents. Yet, here you get ONE (essentially).One really odd design feature is that your foes are basically melee fighters, yet you have no melee capabilities other than one little ducking move which doesn't work well, especially when you are being attacked on all sides. Of course, you have your guns, but it usually takes a lot of shots to kill one opponent, if you CAN kill him before having to reload; meanwhile, you get swamped by other foes. Your flashlight (while the battery lasts) and flares (when you have them) provide a little defensive capability up close. At best, they can give you a very small headstart in running away, but as others have said, the run-away strategy is just a tease which does not work.People have talked about the \"beautiful scenery\", but a lot of it is shades of gray (being in the dark), and while it has an impressive panorama of scenery, you are not free to explore it.

I appreciated it's unique free-running mechanic and the graphics were stunning, but the missions were repetitive and I didn't feel particularly engaged with the story. Despite fearing that the second installment would be more of the same, I was apprehensive about picking this up, but I gave it a chance and, man, I am glad I did. The sequel is superior to the first game in almost every way, and it became an addiction for me until I beat it.Going back through the Animus, we are thrown into Renaissance -era Italy where you play as Enzio, the son of an Italian banker who is driven on a mission of revenge when he is betrayed and his family is killed. You don the robes of an assassin and go through Florence, Venice and Rome performing a variety of missions and assassinating key people who are a threat to yourself and your assassin brethren. The leading man story of the first game, to me, felt tacked on, but Enzio is a much more compelling protagonist. His personality, back-story, and his progression from young misfit to skilled assassin is very gripping. The supporting characters, including family and friends your meet along the way, provide some interesting plot points that will have you wanting to keep playing to see what happens.The gameplay is similar to the first game, in that you are free-running through urban areas and leaping over buildings to get to your objectives. The map system is much better this time around, so the backtracking and getting lost that sometimes happened in the first game is not a problem here. Your notoriety level is also more clearly defined here; guards will chase you within a yellow area on the map, but if you get out of sight and leave the radius, you will be free and clear. It works very much like the wanted level in GTAIV. The missions are also more varied this time around. Some of the \"Find a person and kill him\" missions get tedious, but there are other missions to break it up nicely. My favorite areas are the six tombs that you need to explore to retrieve essential artifacts. These levels provide some strategic platforming that will remind you of \"Uncharted\" and \"Prince of Persia\".The graphics in this game are also stunning. Italy is a much better setting, with the architecture and scenery being highly detailed, and the character animation is also quite good. The people in the street also have more personality this time around, with funny dialogue and even minstrels that will follow you around until you throw money at them. Overall, the world presented here is more immersive and interesting than the first game, and you could easily spend hours simply free-running through the scenery.Clocking in at roughly 18 hours, \"Assassin's Creed II\" offers a meaty campaign that left me wanting more once I beat the game. The replay value comes in with building up the town that surrounds your villa and finding items on rooftops and collecting the remaining achievements/trophies. If you didn't like the first game, this second installment improves upon both the story and mission variety, so you will likely enjoy this game more and should give it a chance. If you loved the first one, there is no reason not to get it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2009"}

I've just single-handedly wiped out a horde of monsters in a dungeon and walked off with a shiny pile of loot when I see an ugly giant sauntering along up ahead. Like any brave and noble adventurer I decide to behead him and loot his corpse. Big mistake! This guy is way more than I can handle. I've used most of my potions in the dungeon and this guy hits hard. My health is almost gone and my thoughts start to drift towards my last save when out of nowhere a dragon swoops in and scoops him up! My savior! I make a mad dash out of there and start healing with the shred of magicka I have left, hoping to make good my escape. Not so lucky I'm afraid, the dragon finishes off the giant and drops me like a sack of potatoes. Oh well, next time I'll know better, or will I?This is the kind of random activity you'll see all over the world of Skyrim. Exciting, unscripted events unfold everywhere you turn. You can run to the same spot from the same save and it will be different every time. The world is vast and it is very much alive.This is an Elder Scrolls game through and through. All our favorite activities are back, from brewing potions to smithing armor. Some of the familiar aspects have been streamlined however. Gone are attributes (STR, AGL etc.) and to be honest I didn't miss them. Agonizing over character creation is a thing of the past, you pick your race (each has their own bonus) and off you go. You develop your character by playing the way you want, not by conforming to a specific class. Want to be a sneaky thief who happens to wield a two-handed battle axe? Do it! Want to be a heavy armor wearing, club wielding brute who can also chuck fireballs with the finest mages in the land? Yup, that's doable too! You get good at what you like doing the most and you'll never have to worry much about an incorrect spec. It all works! The new two-hand system is great as well. You can cast spells with one hand while swinging a weapon with the other! Or you can combine spells with both hands, the level of customization in terms of gameplay is staggering.One of the biggest departures of past titles is the overall feel of the game. Where Morrowind and Oblivion, while being serious, had a somewhat whimsical feel to them, Skyrim is dark and gritty. Random dragon attacks, poverty and the strife of civil war grip the land with an iron fist and misery and paranoia infest it's citizens. Skyrim is not a happy place. After you witness the opening scene you will realize: this is a game for grown ups.The graphics are great, not cutting edge (can you console companies please upgrade so developers can make games geared towards equipment that's younger than six years old please?!) but the world, animations and spell effects all look really good. I can max the game out on my mid-range system so you won't need a supercomputer to enjoy it to it's fullest. The audio on the other hand is absolutely stunning.My complaints are minor but I do have a few. The menus suffer from a bad case of consolitis, they are obviously designed to be used with a controller. Mouse and keyboard users will find they have to scroll through long lists of spells and items unnecessarily, it's really quite cumbersome. Not a big deal really, just a minor annoyance when you know how much easier it could be. There's a bug here and there, collision detection issues and things like that but you kinda have to expect those things in a game as massive as this. I've yet to encounter anything game breaking though. The game requires Steam activation which I don't care for at all. I'm not down on those who do, I understand it's appeal, it's just not for me (yet I'm required to use it! -1 star).This game will suck you in and keep you there! If you have some vacation or sick time you'll start to entertain the idea of cashing them in for more playing time. Your family will miss you and your caffeine tolerance will get a big boost after a few days in the world of Skyrim. You don't just play in that world, you live in it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8JS","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Taking a trip through time and music","reviewText":"This is going to be a slightly strange review since the obvious idea with this game is to either introduce you to the Beatles or it's a full-blown tribute to what you can't argue is one of the most influential bands ever. And yet, I'm only a small fan, not this massive worshipper that can sing all their songs and there's some songs that to be honest, I don't care for. But while there's still a couple of those, I find the more I was playing through the story, the more a lot of the music opened up but for those of you wondering, this is strictly a Beatles release, unlike the band-centered Guitar Hero games, Beatle and only Beatle music are on this so nothing as far as solo careers and the like (too bad, no \"Imagine\" or anything from Wings) with further album DLC's on the way but if you are a massive Beatle fan, this will instantly attract you to it.Story: Well there is a \"story mode\" but essentially it starts with the band playing at the Cavern Club and from there they move onto the Ed Sullivan Show, Shea Stadium and finally end at their rooftop appearance on the Apple Corp. building. In the middle of these is their psychedelic period where they were messing around in studio, only the song has been given the visual treat of a \"Dreamscape\" which is unique to each song, some are pure 60's LSD kaleidoscope-influenced whereas others you get some very simple-yet-beautiful hilltops and flower gardens.Graphics: What makes Beatles Rock Band work is its extraordinary attention to detail and I'm not just talking about band members looking like their real-life counterparts but also their specific appearances at certain times such as Paul's beard and John's hair on the Apple Corp building (though the beard looks odd and John's hair looks more like dreadlocks than long hair). The dreamscapes in all their variety look stunning and there can be some really trippy stuff but also there's some fashion on the crowds and fans that match up and the intro to the Ed Sullivan show appearances have passerbys watching the show on store window televisions. It's certainly better than the realistic meeting the cartoonish avatars in Guitar Hero 5 anyway.Sound/Music: Now obviously this is going to be the biggest portion of the game and to real let the sound spectrum go nuts, listen to the psychedelic stuff since some of that stuff can get...bizarre. But the music is the star here and everything from the straightforward \"Ticket to Ride\" (my favorite) to the indescribable \"I Am the Walrus\", a lot has been included here. Also added are some audio clips of the band either in the studio or just clips of them in concert (even the closing credits of the story is one long take of the band chatting in studio). What made disappoint and it certainly does for me is not what was in but rather what's not in as far as song choices. I love \"We Can Work it Out\", it's not here. \"Across the Universe\", \"Blackbird\", \"Penny Lane\", \"Strawberry Fields Forever\", \"I've Just Seen a Face\", \"Hey Jude\", \"Happiness is a Warm Gun\" and I'm sure several others are missing in action and while I hope they're DLC eventually, with the announced album DLC's of Sgt Peppers, Rubber Soul and Abbey Road, those songs might still be a long way off.Gameplay: Pretty much the same as any Rock Band or Guitar Hero release. Notes will appear on a highway and you're to strum and hold the correct colored fret to advance, and if your a drummer, this includes using the foot pedal and the 4-pad drum kit. Songs range in difficulty from easy to expert and I'll admit, some songs on expert can be kind of surprising. Riff's perfectly fine, easy enough to handle than it's like whoosh! big solo with tons of hammer-on's. It's not like playing say Metallica songs where you know your fingers are going to get a workout soon, there's songs here that I didn't even know were to go crazy. Also, some songs barely feature the guitar so you might even find yourself strumming the parts from a Rhodes piano or the string section. People might lament the fact that barring a few tricky sections, the game is relatively easy, especially if you're a Guitar Hero nut (or even a Dragonforce fan...for some reason) but that also makes the game really easy to get into. And with the no-fail option from Rock Band 2 available, it's very easy to get a party going and not berating your aunt cause she can't get the riff to \"Day Tripper\" on easy right.For the collector in you, we have photos of the band that are unlocked when you meet certain requirements (those being 3-star a song, 5-star a song, complete a venue in story mode or collect a certain amount of photos which nets you a cool little prize). What's nice about these is that they're not tied to a specific instrument or difficulty so you might go through the story mode changing from guitar to bass like I did but you'll still get your photos rather than \"sorry, you started as guitar, you finish guitar if you want these photos\"). A benefit to these for Beatle fans is that checking them out gets you some info about the photo with factchecker Paul McCartney himself verifying it. And like I said, there's some studio chatter and live recordings of the band during the song loading and when the song's finished so you're practically surrounded by all sides of Beatle stuff.One thing I have to mention though: this game's tracks can NOT be transferred to Rock Band 1 or 2 thanks to the dreamscapes of the songs but also the new 3-part harmony tracks for the vocals so they're pulling an Activision here and not allowing cross-combatibility but whereas Activision just did it for the cash (I'm sure GH Metallica and Aerosmith and even Smash Hits could be DLC), it makes sense for the Beatles Rock Band game but be warned that for those you want a massive setlist on one game that combines all DLC from RB1/2 and this are out of luck. Obviously the benefit is that the instruments from the games will work on this so whereas you can't take new DLC track \"All You Need is Love\" into Rock Band 2, at least the instruments for it will work.Like I said, I'm not this massive fan of the band but there's a lot of songs that I do like so I don't know how this game will work on new people (if there is any left anyway) but for Beatle fans, this is obviously a purchase and you've probably already bought it already along with the remastered CD's (available in both remastered and original box sets too) and while the story mode is short with the achievement for beating the story mode in 24 hours is a joke....4 hours maybe, if that and there's only 45 songs with of course the omissions I mentioned but at least the music that is here is timeless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2009"}

Johnson","summary":"Great game, but storyline could have been better","reviewText":"After playing the God of War series for the first time with God of War Collection, I couldn't wait until God of War 3 came out.  I really enjoyed the story and the overall game play, and I had no reason to think that GOW 3 would be any different.  For the most part the latest (and last?) installment to the series delivers but I was left with some sort of an empty feeling after completing the game.God of War 3 starts of immediately where God of War 2 left off, but of course something occurs that causes Kratos to return to Hades yet again where he loses his powers after falling in the river Styx forcing him to start all over again.  This should come as no surprise as no one should expect to play through an entire game with all upgraded powers.  After things settle down Kratos continues his quest for revenge against Zeus and the other gods.  Without ruining the story, I won't go into any more of the story line, but for those who have played the previous two games should be quite familiar with the theme by now.Game play in God of War 3 is virtually unchanged from the previous two games, you should be able to pick up and start playing the game with little to no learning curve and only the more advanced moves require some thought and memorization.  While the advanced moves are cool and can makes things slightly easier, they are not required to advance in the game, just a good combination of attacking and blocking should allow you to advance, and the bigger stronger enemies are usually defeated with quick time events.As expected the graphics are greatly updated from the previous two games.  If you only played the PS2 versions of the God of War series, then you will see a big improvement.  I have played the PS3 versions of these games, and I still see graphical improvements.  The graphics are much more crisp and seem to capture more detail in both the environments as well as Kratos and enemies.Sound is pretty good, but for some reason I had a hard time hearing some characters' speech such as Gaia.  The sound of her voice is muffled and very hard to hear over the music and other sound effects.  In addition Kratos' attacks are not as loud as clear as I would have liked them to be and did not sound as good as GOW I and GOW II.  When comparing the sound to my other PS3 games it just didn't sound as good (except for the BGM).  I will NOT fault the game itself for this though, since it very well could be my 10 year old A/V receiver that has been giving me some issues for a while now.  When I upgrade my receiver I will play through this game again to see if the sound improves.Difficulty wise, this game is considerably easier than GOW I and II, if you beat those games, then you should not have much problem beating this one on the same difficulty you played in the first two.  In all three games, I played on Normal difficulty and had more trouble beating GOW I and GOW 2 than GOW 3.  This is not to say this game doesn't have its moments that will leave you wanting to throw your controller out the window due to some extremely cheesy and unnecessarily difficult parts, but if you persist you will get by it.  THANKFULLY, the perfect save/checkpoint system from the previous games have been carried over.  This was my biggest concern because I feared the developers would mess this up forcing gamers to do frustrating parts over and over again, but luckily they didn't mess it up so once again you are constantly reaching checkpoints as well as being able to manually save at designated areas.  What's even better is that your automatic checkpoints are also saved automatically so when you turn the game off you are guaranteed to at least start at your last check point.  This is very helpful during difficult parts and bosses and you don't have to worry about losing your checkpoint if you turn the game off.  The puzzles were also very fun and were among some of my favorites parts of the game.My main complaint about the game is the storyline.  While it was enough to keep me playing till the end, it never seemed to be able to pull me in like the previous God of War games did.  It was almost like I was waiting for something to blow the story wide open that would get me hooked, but that \"something\" never happened.  The events of the story just seemed to just happen haphazardly right on top of one another and never really tied in to other parts.  The boss battles against the remaining gods of Olympus seemed to occur too close to one another and there was no build up to them like the boss battle against Ares was in the original God of War.  It's basically one moment you're walking and the very next moment you're fighting Poseidon.  In addition I didn't find the actual fights against the various gods as enjoyable as the past games and on top of this, their death scenes were lack luster and seemed a bit rushed.  One exception to this was the boss fight against Hercules which was my favorite boss battle of the game; I just wish the other fights were just as enjoyable.  I was also quite disappointed with the ending and it just left me with an empty feeling after all Kratos went through to get to this very point.Overall I think the game is worth playing and even buying.  I don't regret my purchase as I have with other games that have had so much hype prior to being released.  However, in comparing the first two games to this one, the story could have been much better.  In any case I'm going to play through it again which is very rare for me.  In fact I'm probably going to play 1, 2, and 3 again.  Maybe it's unfair to compare this game to the first two masterpieces, but it very difficult for me not to do so.  It's still a very good game, just not as good as the first two and for that reason I'll have to give it four stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2010"}

So when you see such great reviews and have a PS3 you think this is a MUST BUY title regardless of the genre. Well, I beg to differ. This is certainly a 5 star game in the HACK AND SLASH genre and no lover of that genre should stop from playing it. But the problem is that I find the Hack and Slash genre lacks a universal appeal to all video gamers. I'm a long time video gamer (way back to the 80's) and love video games but ever since its beginning the video game industry have provided a broad kind of genres as not all people will like all genres. I bought GOW3 without prior playing and let me tell you that even tough I play almost 2 hours daily (mainly FPS, TPS and racing games) when I played GOW3 for the first minutes I got a sensation that haven't felt long time ago: I got boring and frustrated. Memories come to mind when back in the 80's I played joystick-destructive games like Decathlon or some arcade games where you just have to push a lot of the same buttons many times, very fast and in the same position until the enemy died. My hands got hurt. And as I told you before: I'm a gamer and play all nights but I never recall feeling exhausted and with hurt fingers since the early days of video gaming. I had NO FUN and thought many times how could someone say that this is a MUST HAVE game? The battles with the enemies are pointless and not rewarding at all. I don't know if I am accustomed to FPS/TPS games because in those games you can feel the INTENSE ACTION at all times but when fighting with the GOW3 enemies I got bored pretty quickly because of the succession of just pressing certain buttons at the time and then other button and there other button and then the other buttons in a MECHANICAL not fun at all way. So in few words: learn about the Hack and slash genre and see if that is a genre you could handle. I can PROUDLY say that I love my PS3 but I didn't like GOW3. That certainly don't makes me a bad video gamer or a PS3 hate boy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001UW9ZW6","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"Two big stars docked for some utterly unforgivable problems.","reviewText":"The Ultimate Alliance games are basically extensions of X-Men Legends, with a four-character team going through an action-RPG hybrid.I had been ambivalent about the first X-Men Legends, but I also thought that X-Men Legends II all but perfected the formula.  So it was with high hopes that I put the Ultimate Alliance 2 game disc into my PS3.At first, I was quite disappointed.  The learning curve seemed unusually steep for me, even though I had played through X-Men Legends II about a hundred times.  Gradually, over two days, the game started to feel more fun and I completed the Advanced (normal) difficulty.And then the stink bomb dropped.The worst part is, just like X-Men Legends II, this game actually has ample charms.  Too bad it takes away most of the enjoyment with the major problems it lobs at you.Pros:- Terrific character diversity.  Characters' attacks are varied and have great personality.- The Navigation button, which you can use at most points in the game to point you to the right direction on where you're supposed to go next, and what the next objective is.  Every game should have one.- The story is actually pretty interesting, though the overlong and unskippable movie files are irritating.- The two alternate storylines are a good idea.- Some innovative touches -- such as \"Attitude\" in conversations, the \"Audio\" files that you can activate in a map -- add to the vibe.- Having different \"Fusion\" attacks (co-operative super moves among characters) is great.  If only they weren't so underpowered.  See below.Cons:- Extraordinarily dumb game interfaces.  For example, the X-Men Legends games wisely arranged your characters in a cross pattern, because it matches your D-pad shape.  Now, they arrange your characters in a straight row, and in a bizarre order (Up, Right, Left, Down) so that every time you switch characters, you're confused to no end.  Or, take the Team Selection menu.  It's not alphabetical, it's not by category (eg. X-Men together, Avengers together), it's not by anything, so that you have to look extra hard to find the character you actually want.  Who the hell decided on this?  The screen for choosing your boosts is also nonsensical; you could spend five full minutes looking for the boost you just picked up, and you won't find it.- Many unskippable \"cut scenes\".  More and more games do this, and it's annoying as all out, especially when replaying harder missions.  You have to wait a full minute for endless dialogue yapping just to get to your actual game.  Video games aren't to be *watched*.  They're to be *played*.- Horrible save system.  When you hit \"Save\", it doesn't actually save your game -- it saves up until your last checkpoint, which could have been 15 minutes ago.  Don't tell me it's saving when it's not!  Also, before extremely hard boss fights like Tinkerer in the Repeater Tower, it doesn't give you the option to save.  So if you lose that fight, you have to go through the 25 minutes of arduous plowing through endless enemies.  A great way to make the player give up the game rather than play on...off I go to the second-hand bin.- The \"Legendary\" (hard) difficulty level is inhuman.  Consider this:  Even mid-bosses (of which there can be 40 in one map) can take 45 per cent of your life bar with one hit.  X-Men Legends II also had very high-damaged enemies, but X-Men Legends II had a healing system with Scarlet Witch's party-healing boost, plus 40 healing tokens you can store.  Guess how many healing items you can store in Ultimate Alliance 2?  TWO.  That's right, you could use a healing icon, get hit by a mid-boss, and it'd be like you never used it at all.  This game's alternate healing method is retch-inducingly useless.  You're supposed to be able to collect \"red orbs\" which heal you, but the problem is, you get them by breaking environment objects -- and in boss battles, there usually are none.  This means in a boss battle, you can only afford to get hit only about eight times with your four characters.  Two hits will kill a character, and there's no way to heal them back up.  The \"superheroes\" in your team should be renamed \"superwimps\".  Hell, three hits from an ordinary soldier enemy will kill you, yet you have to spend your superpowers a few thousand times in every map.- The enemies' AI is supra-genius, while your teammates act like kindergarten children.  Another reviewer said it well, \"Your teammates just sit and watch you die.\"  Even worse, more often they crowd around a super-powered boss, gleefully eating all of the boss' most powerful attacks.  While computer-controlled teammates don't take as much damage, this means that if your character is dying and you have to switch,  you'll find yourself immediately next to the boss and it's most likely you'll lose 85 per cent of your life bar before you can even get away.  And this game fills the screen with so much garbage that you can't tell where you are most of the time.  Once again, Ultimate Alliance 2 breaks a feature that had been nearly perfect in X-Men Legends II -- the ability to assign AI combat tactics (such as aggressive vs. conservative, close combat vs. long-range combat, using beam weapons rather than fists) to computer-controlled allies, which had prevented Cyclops from trying to feebly kick his enemies rather than use his optic blasts.  In this game, a computer-controlled Jean Grey will just go toe-to-toe in melee combat against a boss character, when she should be throwing firestorms that do 12 times the damage.  This is just an insult to the player.  Shame on you, Activision.- The camera sweeps from angle to angle, ignoring your frantic efforts to control it with the right stick.  And when an enemy is to the bottom of the screen, your visibility is about one step ahead of you.  I can't tell you how many times I'm fighting a boss, playing the run-and-gun game, only to have the camera zoom into a useless extreme close-up of my character, so that when I do the evade move, I roll right on top of the boss who is waiting offscreen.  Two hits, boom, you're dead!  Just why Ultimate Alliance 2 decided to break this feature so badly is incomprehensible to me, because X-Men Legends II had a fluid camera that you can control, so that you never lose track of where you are.  Killing a player by mucking with the camera is utterly unacceptable, in any circumstance.  What's next, making all enemies invisible?  Making the entire game screen black for the entire game?  Think how challenging that would be!- This one infuriates me the most, because X-Men Legends II did it so right, but Ultimate Alliance 2 completely ruins it.  After completing the normal difficulty, and training up your characters, the game informs you that you have to play the Legendary difficulty from the beginning -- otherwise all your unlocked features, character building and abilities, boosts etc. are all flushed down the toilet.  And I've already mentioned, the Legendary difficulty turns all your \"superheroes\" into \"superinsects\", with enemies that can kill you with three hits, ignore your attacks while rushing at you *and* firing projectiles, and can take about 100 hits of your powers before they die.  And don't forget, you have to fight the camera -- if you evade a lot, you could end up in a camera angle where you have maybe an inch of visibility all around you, so you can't aim at the boss, but s/he can rush right in your face and mash you to a pulp in two seconds flat.  In Legendary difficulty, my Level 60 character actually feels worse than my Level 1 characters when playing in the Advanced (normal) difficulty.  Which obliterates the enjoyment of levelling up your characters -- if the only way to level up your characters is by fighting enemies 100 times more powerful than you, then what's the point of levelling them up?- And the ghost of X-Men Legends past continues to haunt the player.  Players of the X-Men Legends games will remember that those two games had this bad bug where if you advance in the games far enough, sooner or later you hit upon these irrecoverable game freezes that nothing short of a hard reset will cure.  Half a decade after the first X-Men Legends, it absolutely boggles the mind to see that Activision *still* hasn't fixed this issue.  And it's not caused by the same thing as X-Men Legends 2, since Ultimate Alliance 2 doesn't have random item drops.  I've spent over 30 hours building up the \"Heroic Deeds\" and unlockables of Ultimate Alliance 2, and now the game freezes at least once per play.  It is further evidence that Activision is more concerned about appearances than quality control.I can't imagine what had possessed Activision to break this game so horribly.  Even more saddening is that, given the number of good points that *do* exist in the game, this could have been an enjoyable game.  Instead, chuck another game into the \"too hard to play, blood-pressure-increasing\" pile.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2009"}

{"product_name":"B006W41W4Q","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Fig.","summary":"Dual Frequency. A Big Plus For Players In Wifi Home Networks.","reviewText":"I've had and been playing with this headset for about 2 weeks now and I must admit, TurtleBeach finally got it right. Last year I bought the PX5 which I had to return due to background noise and crackling sounds, plus interference with my 2.4GHz router. So this time around, I was a bit hesitant, I've been looking for a decent headset to use during late night hours, so I don't keep my wife up. I looked into Razer, but heard complaints from many gamers about the overall comfort of the headset, so I kept on looking. Finally, I stumbled upon these cans and the first thing I noticed was that it now works at a 2.4/5GHZ Dual-Band WiFi frequency, which is a big plus, specially for those who have a standard 2.4GHz router. I will go into more details..Package contains the following:1 XP400 of course, 1 receiver, 1 VERY cheap optical cable, 1 bluetooth chat receiver for the 360 controller 1 set of instructions. What I wish we had gotten: replaceable batteries instead of built-in, a better quality optical cable and a stand for the headsetNow the features and performance....Frequency:As I already stated, these cans have a dual band frequency, which so far has done its job. I have not experienced any of the issues I had with the PX5, the sound is clear, crisp and there's no background hiss or noise. The headset will chose the frequency that best suits the environment; if you have a wireless network with a standard 2.4 router, then you will benefit by getting the XP400 instead of XP500 which uses a single signal frequency at 2.4GHZ, which is the same as last year's PX5 that had the same crackling and interference issues. Anyway, back to the XP400... these use a dual bluetooth signals for voice, meaning, you can place/receive calls while gaming; one of the chanels opens up and the other closes while the call is ongoing, once you hang up, the chat chanel re-opens, making the entire phone call private. Nicely done.Design:The design is exactly the same as the the PX5 and now the newer XP500. Padded head strap & ear cups, plastic construction. The receiver is about the size of a dish washing sponge. The mic. as with the other models, can be removed. Also, the cups can be swung side ways, so if you must rest in between sessions, no need to take these cans off, simply put the cups on their sides and let them rest on you. It includes a wireless chat adpater, which uses Blue-Tooth signals, both the chat and headset come already paired; if this is not the case, pairing is explained and simple to do. The receiver also comes paired. Chat quality is clear and I did not notice any signal drops. There's an option to have wired chat, in case you use the Xbox chat pad, which can't be used (won't fit) with the wireless option. You will need an OPTICAL output from your Xbox, PS3 or whatever you are using these for. An optical cable is included, but its quaility is questionable. Get a regular quality 6 footer instead.Sound Quality:Much much better than previous models, you have 3 pre-setttings, bass, treb and bass+treb tweaks. So you can chose to have more bass, treb or both. I like the latter one personally. I tested games such as Max Payne 3, 50 Cent (for bass purposes) and BF3. I was quite pleased with the results, directional sound wasn't 100% accurate, but I'd say 90%, but then again, it also depends on the game you are playing. I did however, noticed that the max volume wasn't as loud as other models, I guess after years of blasting my surround sound system, I was expecting higher levels. Still, the sound from these cans, is superb. The receiver has options to turn the surround on/off and it also comes with surround paramaters, 6 in total; the instructions booklet explains them more in detail, they're basically positional parameters (side, rear, etc). By the way, the sound tweaks can only be done from the headset itself and the surround from the receiver only. All in all, the sound is great, however, consider this: this cans have only ONE driver in each cup, wich is used for all aspects (bass, treb, etc), so don't expect surround sound system quality.Pairing with the PS3.The XP400 does not come pre-paired for chatting with the PS3, you must do this from the PS3 menu, pairing is easy, but the signal output was a bit tricky to get. I have a home theater system, so if you do, make sure that in the PS3 audio options you chose \"Dual Chanel Output\", or you won't hear anything on your XP400. Once that's done, they work flawlessly.The headset however, has its flaws and here they are:First, built-in battery, so if the case that yours die after numerous charges, you can't replace it without sending the whole unit in to Turtle Beach.Second, NO STAND. nothing. I would've settled for a stick with a hook on it. You must leave this cans wherever you can think would be a safe place, so your kid, your cat or mother nature won't knock it off and smash it on the ground. A simple stand with no connections would've been fine. But instead, we get nothing.Third, as with the PX5, the signal on these puppies dropped at a range of only 20 feet, there's a half wall where I was standing, so I wasn't at the other side of my house. The signal starting to crackle and finally dropped. This time around however, once I got back in range, the signal came back on its own without any issues. Unlike the PX5 that would suffer from signal hiss and popping.In conclusion, you may be tempted to get the XP500, because honestly, its base does look great, but it doesn't have the dual band that the 400s have, which can be a major performance factor in a wireless network. And, just as I said on my previous review of the PX5s, the XP500's reciever has only 2 digital plugs. One in, one out and at that price, more should've been included.So that's my experience so far with the XP400s, so far they have exceeded my expectations. With it's dual band frequency, improved sound and comfortable design, this headset delivers where others lack.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2012"}

To be honest, there isn't much to say. This memory card holds 8 megabytes (a far cry from today's consoles, where 120 GIGABYTE hard-drives is quite common, and they're always growing), and it fulfills its purpose well. It's so strange to be using a system with an external, tiny memory card like this after becoming accustomed (and spoiled) by today's technological standards, but for what it's worth, it works well. The loading speed when loading files from this card is surprisingly quick, I like it quite a lot. The thing is, if you own a PS2, then you need this little piece of hardware in order to save any file, and that along makes it worth the purchase.

In comparison, it was roughly 2.5 times more expensive than the original, a sum that I wasn't too thrilled about. Still, I knew I would have to pay if I wanted to save because not saving, as we all know, is a wonderful way to invoke self-wrought hostility. So, I bought it, took it home, and quickly learned that the memory card itself, besides being of great quality, held oceans of information that were, before, only possible with a handful of memory cards.Yes, in saving/game terms, 8MB will hold just about anything you want and provides that little push toward the top that you need to virtually succeed. I've now gotten into the habit of keeping multiple files to thwart the unexpected deletion of something I've been working on for sleepless days, something I rarely accomplished with the old 1MB cards. Also, it does away with the need to keep cards that like disappear when cornered down to a minimal number. To me, that's a plus because I hate trying to locate something in the \"heat of the moment.\" Besides that, you don't have to worry about forgetting to pick up a card and then suddenly not being able to save at that crucial moment when you need it.Also, to note, when I say these things are high quality, I mean that they are (or at least one of mine is) indeed tough. I had an unfortunate incident where a chair was sat on top of my memory card and, strangely enough, it walked away needing on psychiatric help. Perhaps this isn't the best test to perform and wouldn't work all the time, mind you, but it does give and example of just how much punishment they can take.So, buy it because you need it, and because you know better than to buy generic.

I absolutely love this game and how it stays true to the old classic Crash Bandicoot games.As explained in my Warped review Crash Bandicoot is a platformer game series dating back to the PS1 days (definately a 90's mascot). Its also got a place in my heart as one of the first PS1 games I ever played as well as one of the hardest game franchises I ever played. I think it might have been one of the first games to come out on the PS1 period. The first game involved you playing a mutated Bandicoot that escaped the lab of the evil genious Dr. Neo Cortex. Saddly his girlfriend Tawnya wasn't so lucky so you have to travel through many hard as hell levels to rescue her. I never actually finished the first game, because theres one castle level near the end I just got stuck on (them damn bats!!XD). I want to play it again some day though and finally beat that level! One thing I remember fondly is the game had great level designs and actually looked pretty good for its time. It was fun, challenging, funny, and it never got old.In Wrath of Cortex Uka Uka, the evil brother of the witch doctor mask Aku Aku, releases five elemental mask that set out to destroy the world with the help of Cortex's new super weapon Crunch Bandicoot who is powered by the mask during boss battles. Crash has to find crystals and put the elementals as well as Crunch in thier place.All Crash games up to Warped were developed by Naughty Dog, the first to be exact. Wrath of Cortex has the same publishers, but is developed by Travellers Tales (pretty decent games) who I think did a really good job in making this game. It really catches the fun of the early games. For one the gameplay is spot on! Everything works the way thier supposed to. A matter of fact, I can't recall ever having problems with control in Crash games. When jumping you always have to build up momentum, expecially when platforms are far away, plus you sometimes had to calculate how far something is to survive jumps which added to the challenge expecially on side-scrolling levels. The music is wonderful! Its not my favorite video game soundtrack but its decent and nice to listen to.When it comes to choosing levels Wrath of Cortex can be compared to Warped in this regard. You go through 5 levels than face a boss. Every level is unique and in some you actually play as Crashes sister Cocoa. I don't mean riding that tiger, you actually platform as her. I found these levels very fun, but its much easier to get hit by enemies and die as her. Luckily these levels are very few. Theres also flying levels which I confess I don't really like that much. Im happy they didn't put many racing levels in this one like WarpedXD The race levels are a big improovement over the ones in Warped. Out of all the games I think this one has the most unique Boss battles. While in the other games you often took on the boss head on by avoiding attacks than getting close to attack, in this one you actually have to avoid touching most bosses period. For instance in one boss battle you have to run from the boss and jump in a suit that you use to spray water on him, while avoiding deadly lava rocks that he throws at you. You definately need Aku Aku for this battleXD The secret Gems, crystals, and Relics from Warped are also back as well. Collect all the relics and you unlock the secret levels. Harder than it sounds for those who never played Crash at all.I have to admit though. None of the Crash games I've played so far can match the difficulty of the first game. I can't say anything about the second game (never owned it), but I can say that what makes Wrath of Cortex as well as Warped easier is how convenient extra lives are. Trust me. I can guarantee you that by world 2 you'll have almost over 50 lives. That doesn't keep the game from being hair pulling later on though. I was kind of disappointed with the death animations in this one. In Warped the death animations when hit by different obstacles and traps range from \"wtf\" to just plain hillarious. In this one thier pretty much \"meh\". That doesn't stop the game from having funny moments though, like how our enemies will talk to us in the level select area and before load screens. Speaking of Load screens this one has the longest I've ever experienced in the series. Still its nothing compared to loading screens I've faced in games outside the series (coughEnter TheDragonFlycough).Crash Wrath of Cortex is a must have for fans of the series and of platformers. I know reviewers were mixed on this game due to how similar it is to its predesescors, but that doesn't stop WOC from being what the first 3 games are famous for. Just being plain old fashioned fun and entertaining, like video games are supposed to be. Don't hesitate to buy this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2011"}

Lead by Orion, the voice of the people, the tyrannized citizens will do everything they can to claim back the City from the Baron's grasp. The revolution is inevitable. If Garrett doesn't get involved, the streets will run red with blood and the City will tear itself apart.","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"Fell Short, 2.5 out of 5","reviewText":"I had highly anticipated the release of this game and I really wanted to like it, but in the end I found it to just be rather mediocre.  I played about 4 chapters into this game before deciding to trade it in on something else.  I didn't hate the game necessarily, but it left a bit to be desired.Breaking into places and picking locks & sneaking around & thieving valuables etc was fun at first, but eventually just got rather monotonous and lost it's luster.  Traveling around the city & squeezing through crevices etc got to the point where it seemed like a chore...became repetitive and/or tedious, and was sometimes confusing.  I personally had a hard time deciphering the map as well and was hard to distinguish where to go when I was trying to find certain places again or the merchant to buy materials etc.  I even got rather confused trying to find my way to the area in the 4th chapter.  Some people might have had no trouble there, but I am among many people whose navigational skills aren't always that keen, and having a confusing map to look at did not help matters.Graphically Thief was not all that impressive, it seemed more like mid era PS3 graphics to me than eye popping PS4 graphics...and the frame rate was certainly not PS4 quality, compared to what I'd seen with games like Assasssin's Creed Black Flag or Tomb Raider Definitive Edition etc.  Graphically it was often somewhat choppy as well and character movements were sometimes choppy as well.  There were parts where character mouth movements didn't exactly match words being spoken, or was just a monotonous up & down motion.Some of the environments in the game seemed fairly interesting and gothic, which I thought was neat, but much of the area left a bit to be desired, especially when gazing off across the city or a large expanse of space...much of the distant horizon seemed somewhat broken up & choppy.The story seemed fairly interesting, but with all the many faults if this game I just simply could not bring myself to continue on with the game.  Just another attempt to profit off of an otherwise classic game.  I've never played the original PC game before so I can't attest to what it was like, but I have read reviews by others who have said it does not do the classic game any justice, and I believe it, judging from what I experienced myself on this PS4 version.There are some who I have read enjoyed this game, and there may be others of you who do too...to each their own.  However, I felt it was a feeble attempt on PS4 and I would recommend renting it before buying and see for yourself whether or not you are going to like it.  Even though I gave it a 2.5, I did give click the upper end of the spectrum at 3 because it's not exactly a terrible game, but it's definitely not a very good game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2014"}

{"product_name":"B000GA8UAQ","description":"Set in the peaceful kingdom of Slimenia, Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime is suddenly invaded by a mysterious cartel called the Plob, who then proceed to kidnap all the slimes in the capital city of Boingburg. The only slime left behind, Rocket, must embark on a journey to save his friends and uncover the Plob's nefarious plot.","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Rocks","reviewText":"Those slimes from the Dragon Quest series get themselves a game, but unlike usual entries in the franchise, it's not a RPG. Instead, Dragon Quest Heroes: Rocket Slime plays like a cross between Zelda and Advanced Wars, especially with its puzzle-heavy over-world exploration, and epic tank battles. It's easy to dismiss this as a kid's game due to its cartoony presentations, but upon contact, you'll find Rocket Slime a surprisingly deep adventure that will require at least 30 hours of your time to engage - that is, if you intend to fully explore all the secrets and side missions beyond the main storyline.Rocket Slime is set in the kingdom of Slimenia (geddit?), where the hosts of slimy characters reside. The once peaceful land was soon invaded by a group of monsters known as the Plobs, and its inhabitants were \"slime-napped\" from the city of Boingburg. Rocket, the son of a warrior in the kingdom, escaped the ordeal, and soon embarked on an adventure to rescue all the 100 captured slimes. The journey sees the little warrior exploring seven locations in Slimenia, each filled with a designated numbers of slimes to rescue. Some of these slimes are easy to get to, but many others will require Rocket to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, down bosses, and even engage in tank battles before they show themselves.Tank battles are refreshing inclusions into an otherwise generic adventure game. While the \"adventure\" element of Rocket Slime is interesting enough (solving puzzles like unlocking doors and such), it's the tank battles that will keep you going on and on in Rocket's bid to rescue his family and friends. Each of the seven locations consists of a certain number of tank fights, and Rocket will have to use whatever ammunition at his disposal to reduce the HP of these opponent tanks to zero. That's not the end to a fight though, because reducing a tank to zero HP only serves to open up its engine room, where the \"heart\" of the tank rests. Rocket will then have to infiltrate the tank, break whatever last line of defence it has, before landing a final blow at its \"heart\" to finish the fight.I mentioned earlier that these tank battles remind me of Advanced Wars, but of course, the affairs in Rocket Slime happen very much faster due to their real-time nature. Some time into the game, Rocket can add members to his tank crew. This is where the strategy part of these battles comes in. Rocket can choose from a total of 32 members, but for each battle, he can only use three of them. Some of these members will offer their help upon being rescued, but others will take more convincing (meaning side quests, duh!). Rocket can also add monsters to his helpers list, but he has to collect enough numbers of these enemies before they're willing to help. Each of these members has unique abilities. Some are experts in loading cannons. Some are good at keeping enemies out of Rocket's premises. Some can even infiltrate enemy tanks, sabotage their engine, steal their ammos, and even take out their commander. Depending on the situation, Rocket may have to switch between crew members to fully exploit enemies' weaknesses.Beyond the rescue of the 100 slimes, Rocket will encounter several side quests. They are optional, and don't impact the flow of the story. However, some of these missions do reward the slime with some powerful ammunition, which will definitely come in useful in a tank battle. The Tank Masters Tournament, for example, pits Rocket and his crew against 13 powerful tank opponents in four different categories. Winning this tournament will unlock the Hero Sword, which is one of the most powerful ammos in the game. The game also has a handful of collection-based side quests, which will take up a large amount of time (often more than playing through the main quest once) to complete. One of these includes collecting all gold trophies of all enemies, which requires you to send 100 each of the game's 20 monsters back to the museum at Boingburg. Another is the collection of all 40 of the game's Alchemy Recipes, which allow Rocket to fully master the trick of combining items to make new ones. All these quests add much value to the game as the player will inadvertently find many things to do after fulfilling the mandatory rescue of 100 slimes. It's easy to enjoy doing them too, because the game's quirky presentations blend in perfectly with its quirky nature - kiddish but surprisingly detailed graphics, catchy and lively music, and dialogue that continuously offers puns so bad that they're actually funny simply speak volumes of the game's production values.So, here we've it, a kids' game that actually rocks. The marriage between adventure and war game elements make Rocket Slime more than just a run of the mill money-milker bearing the Dragon Quest label. Action-adventure lovers will find this an endearing title that will keep them glued to their DS screens for weeks to come.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2006"}

ME2 was great, and it was long b/c of long loading time when restarting after getting killed, as well as mining all planets for minerals. All in all took my 70 hours (with all DLCs).ME3 streamlined planet scanning and saved tons of wasted time. The (re)loading is much faster as well compared to ME2.As far as the story, it's a nice follow-up to ME2. If you haven't played any Mass Effect games, I would suggest starting from ME2 for greater appreciation. ME3 has option to play in either the famed role-playing, dialog-choosing mode where the words you choose to speak will affect behavior with different characters, including romantic interest like ME2. But it also has a straight campaign mode which the dialogs are chosen and become movies (more linear mode). That'll speed up the game if you are really short on time. I played to end with the dialog-choosing mode, a took me about 30 hours with normal difficulty.Because you can be a female Shepard, it allows interesting scenarios. Also, this game is gay-friendly with the character choices and romantic interests. You can checkout various people's recorded scenes at the consumer video site.The (extended) ending can be dramatic, with send-offs/well wishes to the main character Shepard. There are also choices for different endings, which is cool.All in all, I really enjoyed ME2/ME3 (Will wait for ME1 to be on PS3 at end of 2012). After experiencing these none-linear modes of playing, going back to linear mode action games (such as COD and Halo series) just not quite the same anymore.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

Goldeneye was realistically bloody and still pulled of a T rating. Although I could also complain about the graphics I must also acknowledge the beautiful lip synching.The GameCube port adresses at least one of the major complaints, and while it still seems cheesy to shoot someone in the head and not draw blood it also makes the game somewhat more shild friendly, I guesse... it's still not Goldeneye.The voice acting in this game is superb as the voice actors sound very much like their movie counterparts, and the storyline itself is typical bond fan fair. This game is not without it's flaws, colission detection can be a bit off sometimes, and the control set up takes some getting used to, but over all it's still a lot of fun.Nintendo GameCube also addressed the loading issue, as it is lightniong quick now and barely noticable. This game is fun, short, but fun, and a worthwhile purchase, but be warned that this was a PS 2 game first and it shows. Little was done to improve the graphics, this game is far from the pinacle of GCN graphics.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2002"}

{"product_name":"B005THAX6K","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Paul \"John doe\"","summary":"Aliens Coloneial Marines review","reviewText":"I haven't done a review for a video game in a long time. I started doing reviews for video games back 2008 or 2009 for many games on many console's. I feel I need to review this game mainly due to the negitive reviews so many critics out there have ripped apart. I have to say that Aliens Colonial Marines may very well become 1 of my favorite Playstation 3 1st person shooters. I don't know if love it but I can say I like it. I will admit that I was excited for this game cause The Alien franchise is 1 of my favorite movie series really I only liked Alien Aliens & Alien 3. Resurrection was ok. The AVP movies are interchangeable for me they were both terrible. I didn't jump at the chance to pre order it or buy it although I wish I had now playing the campigan twice & playing the last 2 levels a lot. Cause I did pre order that Aliens vs Predator game back in 2010 I enjoyed it. That game also got mixed reviews although it didn't get the hate that Colonial Marines got. I don't know if I like this Aliens game or The Alien vs Predator game I'm leaning twords this game for whatever reason. 1st off 1 of the biggest complaints is the graphics they say it looks like PS2 graphics I read a comment saying that the graphics look like N64 graphics. I'm sorry I don't see that the graphics aren't the best on The PS3 they could've made them sharper the character could've looked better but this is far from the worst graphics on The PS3.BTW graphics don't make the game the gameplay does. The game play for the most part is good I watched video's where the critics complained about the gameplay they went & compared it to their pride & joy Call Of Duty they also compalined how it didn't reinvent the genre. Those type of games that reinvent the genre or any game are once in a blue moon. Most 1st person shooters are the same thing only different characters different types of guns & different storylines. I wasn't expecting a big reinventing game changer I just wanted a fun game that's what I got. The game play is straight forward there were only a couple of things that I didn't like when you want to pick up an item you got to look straight at it & press square that is hassle when you have Weyland Yutani Troops shooting at you when you have an Aliens attacking you especially when your on low health & you need a Med Pack. It is hard to pick a weapon at 1st like if you want switch to let's say  an Assault Rifle you have to hold triangle highlight the weapon you want with L3 let go of the triangle button. Your weapon selection is really good you have The Pulse Rifle which is a staple in The Alien franchise you get an Assault Rifle which fire a 3 round burst you also can equip a scope which is cool. You have a sub machine gun which that weapon is ok as well as a sniper rifle. You have 2 shotguns 1 which is a basic pump action shotgun & another which is a semi automatic. 2 types of hand guns which have a different rate of fire. You can modify your weapons like putting a scope on an Assault Rifle puttin laser sighter on The Pulse Rifle which comes in handy when you're in a shoot out with Weyland Yutani Troops. You can also modify secondary features on your guns like The Pulse Rifle you can fire gernades have a shotgun or a fire bomb. Which the fire bombs are great. Also you throw gernades you have 3 types Frag, Claymore Mine & fire bomb. A problem I had is there are times when you are being attackted & you don't know from what direction. Another thing that is odd is fellow soldiers can teleport I was like wtf. Now I heard the critics b  it  c  h about the plot & I don't know what their major malfunction is cause it is obvious that this is an alternate timeline after Aliens where Colonial Marines respond to a destress call. They go to what's left of LV 426 from there you shoot your way through Aliens trying to find this Soldier named Bella. You have shoot outs with Weyland Yutani Troops. You go through these tunnels shooting up Aliens with a Smart Gun. There is a level where you are unarmed you have no weapon at all no & no tracking device you have to make your way out of the sewers there are Aliens lurking about you can't make a lot of noise or you will alert them if 1 comes near you you'll have to be completely still. A lot of people make fun of this cause The Aliens walk past you  but I think it adds some suspense. There are boss battles including of course The Queen. You even get to go through the nest & wipe out the eggs with a flamethrower as burn some Aliens to death. A character from Aliens plays a part in the story not saying who cause this isn't going to be a retrospective like I do with my movie reviews. Play the game to find out who it is. Th ending leaves it open for a sequel. I guarantee you there won't be a sequel cause the game was torn apart by the critics & I'll tell them just like I tell the movie critics to stick with their high brow movies the video game critics can stick with their high brow games cause you'll get more COD sequels not saying I hate COD it's just not my favorite game franchise. But due to the poor sales & critics hating Colonial Marines I'll not get a seuel you want to know what this is this is Terminator Dawn Of Fate all over again if you want to know what I mean by that that was a game I enjoyed & that had negitive reviews & the sales weren't good. Rent this game like I did to see if you like it cause I really want this game but don't go in expecting this big reinventing 1st person shooter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2013"}

Sadly something happened when they brought it over because, yes it does have all new awesome content, but it also has a huge glaring flaw, if you do anymore besides a standard attack there is massive slowdown that is only followed up by the sound of the spell finishing before the actual spell.I'm not saying it make the game unplayable though, this is a must play who are new to this game, but I do have the option between playing this and on my PSOne, and if you have the same option I recommend that. The translation isn't as solid but it runs better.To sum it up, I'm very annoyed at S-E, I'm not sure how they (or whoever published it) was able to release it with such a glaring problem, they added lots of new features which I would have given much of them up for if they had the game properly ported with none of this new slow down. BUT I love Final Fantasy Tactics, it's a fantastic game with a great story and was and still is one of the best games of it's kind, I will just treasure my original Playstation version that much more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2007"}

I have to go with 5 stars. This is one of the most diverse games I have played, not to mention HILARIOUS!!!! If you like nasty, sexual humor, plus killing demons, then this is definitely the game for you. There are even stages of the game which have the feel of atari and other beginning systems games. The rest of the game has modern graphics. It has fairly easy game play, as far as progressing through the game, with only a few spots that need practice for achievement. The plot line is a little eh, which is one reason I debated with 4 stars. However, the diversity and humor just completely wash out the mediocre plot.

{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"PandA","summary":"Better than MW2, Still Great Fun!","reviewText":"EDIT: I wanted to update the lag issue... Lag/Hit Detection is non-existent for me after countless patches. Great work from the developers.The haters of this game are hysterical. If you only read user \"reviews\" on game sites, Amazon or Metacritic, you would think this is the worst game available on this generation of consoles. Many of these people either bought the game and play it nonstop or never bought it in the first place (but if you have seen the sales numbers then you know MOST gamers bought this).Let me digress from the review even before I start it. For example, if you look at the all-time PS3 review scores on Metacritic, the 88 rating from the CRITICS makes MW3 tied for 51st (with such games as the original Uncharted, NHL 9, 10, & 11, Dead Space, Battlefield Bad Company 2, COD: Black Ops and BioShock 2).If you look at every game on Metacritic's site with a CRITICS review of 80 or higher for PS3 only (100's of games) you find three games that have USER review scores in the red (less than 5 out of 10): MW2 (2.9), Madden 09 (4.6), Dragon Age 2 (3.9). I want you to see this listing of games I am talking about. There has never been as big of a disconnect between 100s of user reviews and 100s of critical (professional) reviews.DA2 got ripped because it took a fan favorite and \"dumbed it down\" by taking what made the original great and making it a mass market product. Madden and COD fall into the same trap - games that video game reject fanboys all over pounce on as \"they just slapped a new year on it and released the same game.\"A.K.A. Modern Warfare 2.5 as you have most likely seen before, during and after the release of this game.Ask yourself this. Is MW3 really a 2.9? No chance.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; REVIEW STARTS HERE >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is a fantastically fun game. If you have enjoyed any of the previous MW titles (and in particular MW and MW2) then you will enjoy this game. Hands down. Whether or not you think it is MW2.5, if you liked MW2 then you should like this game as well or better. That doesn't mean it is the same game. Far from it.I sold back my MW2 copy when I bought this game. Why? I loved MW2, but even though there are people who are still playing it, I have been playing it for two years. I want fresh maps, fresh modes, and yes, fresh graphics.The uber nerds that say it looks \"just like MW2\" are not very good at the hater game. The game IS going to look/feel similar to MW2. Why?1) It is a direct sequel. Name one sequel that didn't retain the artistic stylings of the first.2) It is running on the BASE core engine.3) Don't make massive changes to a formula that worked for millions of people (see Dragon Age 2).So what has been improved/tweaked to make this a fantastic game and improve on the great MW2 in the process?&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; PROS >>>>a) The multiplayer maps on MW3 have so much MORE detail, runs so smooth, and looks sharper that I can tell it is certainly an improvement on the online graphics from MW2.b) The classic gameplay is still there and it still feels fantastic. Yes it could be the SAME... \"if it ain't broke\" applies here ten fold.c) 16 NEW maps are included on the disc.. I am Level 30 on multiplayer and I still haven't played every map.d) Kill Confirmed is a blast. Having to run to the body to \"pick up\" dog tags after a kill adds a fast and furious approach to Team Deathmatch and adds a whole new level of strategy. If you are a \"rusher\" then this mode is made for you. It is a great way to get a good amount of XP, because even if you don't get kills, picking up opponents tags (Kill Confirmed) or your own fallen comrades (Kill Denied) earns you XP).e) MW3 now has the great Theater system that Black Ops brought in the fold so that you can go and watch/edit/upload all of your best (or worst) clips to YouTube straight from the game. This is intuitive and works like a charm.f) COD Elite (the free version - once it is fully working) is very addicting for stats nerds. You can access it from computers and mobile devices and can Create-A-Class and view weapon stats and \"heat zones\" on the maps to see where the action tends to be.g) New guns with old favorites returning.h) Gun sounds are amazing.i) New and very balanced perks.j) Some new cool killstreaks and old favorites returning.k) etc, etc, etc.AND THAT IS ONLY THE MULTIPLAYER.I played the first level of single player and it was action packed and enjoyable - just what I expect from the MW series.I love spec ops, and I LOVED playing Survival mode for the first time. Wave after wave of increasingly aggressive enemies swarm you (and a friend if you wish and have any friends) in Survival mode and it is fun to play. Huge fan (I never played Zombies or Horde mode but I am told by the haters that it is the \"same.\"&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; CONS >>>>Lag and hit detection are bad. Just Google/Twitter/YouTube \"Lag MW3\" and you will see many, many hits. The companies that made the game have already made many tweaks and are working on a fix for lag issues as I type this.No other cons for me at this time. Again, others might not want to pay $60 bucks for what they feel is basically the fantastic game from 2009, but it was worth every penny to me. It is, at worst, just as fun as MW2, and in many ways I already prefer it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; CONCLUSION >>>>The bottom line is that there is a TON of content in this game. If you like COD-style online multiplayer, the COD-style single player adventure, and hours of co-op fun in Spec Ops and Survival Mode - then the is the best - and newest - game out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2011"}

Play as Crypto, an alien warrior sent to Earth to clear the way for the Furon invasion force","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Unleash your destructive desires","reviewText":"Not since Grand Theft Auto as a player been able to unleash Hell on a town's citizens(here's hoping they're not sociopaths). For once, in Destroy All Humans, you play the usually-villain-role of martians, attacking Earth for once instead of some far off fictional world. There's moments where you think the game could've gone farther but does it ever get fun.Story: The Furon race is starting to dwindle down thanks to the lack of genetalia. Not to mention the nuclear war they fought with the Martians. You play Crypto 137, the 137th clone of the original Crypto. Your goal is to go to Earth and extract human brains which happen to have Furon DNA in them. He also finds out what happened to Crypto 136 and a branch of the military called the Majestic.Graphics: It's pretty funny that a lot of games lately always look \"GTA-esque\" but with this game, it's pretty hard not to think of it. The graphics have a more polished look than GTA and destroying buildings actually looks like destroying buildings.Sound/Music: As that 1950's B-movie feel with saucer sounds having that weird whistling sound, your zap sounds for your guns and some great voice acting, including a Jack Nicholson-like main hero Crypto. The music understandably has that 50's soundtrack feel to it as well.Gameplay: Your character's actions are separated into 2 camps: Psychokineses and your weapons. Your PK as it's called has 4 options: grab people, cows, and later on tanks and either send them into the air, crash them into the ground or give it a \"push\" and send them flying, even into other cars. Scan is where you replenish your PK and read their minds. Extract is where you use your mental powers to \"explode\" the people's head scanner's style(not as gory though) and collect their DNA. And Hypno is when you want to create a Distraction, send them to Sleep or other special actions for certain people like opening gates or starting a truck.Your weapons for your on-foot missions are your Zap-o-Matic, an electricity shooting gun, your fan favorite Anal Probe where a powered up one will instantly kill a civilian, more for others and collect their DNA your Disintegration Ray which completely burns your victim but lose DNA and your  which acts like a grenade. Your spaceship also has 4: a Death Ray, working like a heat laser, an Abduction Ray where you can grab people and vehicles and swing them around, a Sonic Boom acting like a bomb and your Disruptor which makes a very bigger boom.The missions are basic \"follow that guy/destroy those/get here in time\" fare although there's some mini-games like destroying the town in a certain time, burning cows or going through checkpoints. Your weapons can be upgraded so you can shoot more people, more damage or more ammo.For once we're allowed to destroy anything(besides trees oddly) and then go back to our normal lives and hopefully not be deviants. Politicians might go after the game but go ahead and get it and start annihilating some human ass.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00009ZVHR","description":"As action-reporter Jade, use your camera and Dai-Jo staff to capture truth from a deceptive government, and restore freedom from an alien invasion.","reviewerName":"Richard Veysey","summary":"One of those hard to find games","reviewText":"I don't mean by my title that this game is hard to find. More that a game as well done as this only comes around once and a while. I spent about 20 hours exploring the world of Hylis. 20 hours which seemed to be only 10-15 hours. Time passes much faster outside the little bubble of blissful ignorance that will form around you while playing this game because, frankly, the outside world will seem to fade as you almost become Jade, becoming increasingly immersed in the beautiful yet dark world of Beyond Good and Evil.The game opens with an alien attack by creatures known as the Domz. After a simple battle, you recieve your camera and can begin exploring your small island home, which also happens to be a lighthouse. When you first get the camera, you'll recieve one of the game's main side quests: photographing all the world's animals. This quest continues throught the game and takes a bit of work to complete, although you won't regret it. It is one of the most entertaining mini-games I have ever seen, keeping you entertained durring and between misions. After you've finished photographing the animals and exploring the environment, you begin you're adventure by recieving a speedboat from your best friend and companion, Pay'j.Before I go on to mention anything else, I should probably go into detail about the environment. Although the game's graphics are often very cartoony, the cartoon world of Hylis comes alive in the form of the teeming life you see everywhere around you. There are the small things, such as the detailed rock walls of caverns, to the way the water moves, to all the people walking out on the streets. Everything just seems so alive that it will seem almost magical. The game also has a wonderful distance engine, which allows the player to see things from a very large distance, such as a whale leaping from the water, or other boats, or even the larger details of the game's several islands.While running around taking pictures and fighting evil is fun, it is just as much fun to cruise around on the speed boat and the rocket ship, once you get it. While there is some fighting and picture taking to be had aboard the ship, it was not quite frequent enough for me, and I had to just make due with the 3 boat race courses and the four smugglers caverns, with the occasional Domz attack.The main collectible in this game is the pearl, and pearls are required to progress through the game, with some additional pearls added in to give you more choice as to what quests to perform to progress in the game. The games quests vary. While you will get pearls automatically for progression in the game's rich plot, you will also have to take pictures of animals, fight some hidden Domz, win boat races, defeat smugglers, infiltrate government buildings in which pearls are held, and other little quests, many involving the perchase of pearls. Also, to avoid all the annoying serching that most games have to get the last collectibles, you can buy an item that will label pearl and animal locations on your map so that you have an idea of where to look, although it won't tell you how to get them.The puzzles in the game are very well done, and, for the most part, simple. There is one puzzle later on that is quite well done because it is hard without being contrived or ridiculously pointless or anything else that can be complained about. Other puzzles involve finding clever ways of sneaking past guards or getting over a wall. It's one of those games where solving puzzles isn't extremely difficult as long as you look for the game's hints, yet still give a very rewarding feeling after their completion.Almost done... This game isn't exactly an action game. Like in most RPGs, you can't fall of edges into bottomless pits, although enemies can kill you. Jade will do most jumping and action oriented moves by herself, leaving you to fight monsters and solve puzzles. The controls are very responsive and should never frustrate the player, especially with the fantastic camera, which places itself in basically the best position almost automatically, although there are sometimes when it would be nice to be able to move it. This makes doing battle simple, although it's not to hard to begin with. Most enemies are slow to attack and give you plenty of time to prepare a good strategy to dealing with them.To wrap up, I need to mention the two most surprising things about this game. First off, it had almost no bugs that I could find. I found one spot where I fell through a floor, but I can only blame myself for that one, and it was easy to avoid the spot once I knew what I did to get into it. Did I mention that there are save points EVERYWHERE, so you never have to worry about getting really far and then getting stuck having to turn it off and losing 30 minutes of playing. Also, being killed only places you back at the entrance of a room, making some of the more frustrating sneaking bits much less so. The other bug was simply a quest desription bug on Salene which described the Pay'j quest as the \"escaping the Slaughterhouse\" quest. Other than that, I had no problems with the game's mechanics. Another surprise in this game was the increadible music, which had a great Latin feel and really got your feet moving and sometimes your head moving from side to side.This game's story line never lets up and keeps you on the edge of your seat right up till the fantastic final battle. There were even several spots (especially the lighthouse bit near the end), when I almost cried because of the game's extremely emotional presentation. The only irritating thing is that the game seems to have one of those 'prepare for a sequal' endings, with some little loose ends to tie up, yet I have heard no plans for one as of yet. I'll have to keep my eyes peeled, I guess.Anyway, if you're still reading this (I didn't realize I had this much to say about BG&E;, sorry), this game goes beyond good and bad and reaches a level which few games attain of utter perfection. Every little thing in this game is thrown at you in just the right amount to entertain you, yet keep you begging for more. If you can find this game used, it makes a great addition to anyone's collection, but even new it's still a great deal for a great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-30-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000FPOJOS","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"best GT ever, with caveats","reviewText":"Gran Turismo 5 Prologue is really thin on content for anyone who just came off Gran Turismo 4 or even Gran Turismo 3 A-Spec. So, if hundreds of cars, thousands of aftermarket parts, and dozens of tracks is mandatory then don't consider GT5 Prologue.However, what's actually on the disc is almost perfect. The driving is excellent and the force feedback with a wheel is tremendous. The technology is great, with gorgeous lighting and the best looking cars I have seen in a game. The challenges are easily beatable depending on your skill, but I have tons of fun just trying to do hot lap and rise up in the rankings.The only place I can really ding the game is in online play. There is no way to make a private lobby, and early races are plagued with people who play like its Burnout. But it's in there, and you can earn money for better cars quickly. A better online system would give the game a lot more replayability.So, basically, the physics, look and feel, and feature set are all greatly improved over past games. It doesn't have much content but the core driving experience is as usual superb.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003O6JIVE","reviewerName":"Steve","summary":"Review - Final Fantasy XIII-2","reviewText":"I got this game a few weeks ago, and truthfully, this game is one of my favorites on the PS3.  This game improves many of the areas that I was not crazy about in FF13 and It makes many improvements to the gameplay in general.  I find this game to be tons of fun to play and to be highly addictive.  The game can also be frustrating at times as many aspects keep you running in circles.Story (5/10): One of the weakest aspects of this game is its story line.  The game picks up right at the end of FF13 with Serah emerging form crystal and with Venella and Feng themselves turning into crystal in order to prevent the fall of Cacoon.  This game starts off with one of the best and sickest opening sequences I have ever seen in a game, Lightning is in a realm called Valhalla and she is the guardian of its throne (basically the guardian of the universe and time).  She is attacked by Caius and you start the game with a 20-30 minute battle squence in which you utilize Odin to battle Caius with some of the sickest powers I have seen in any FF game.  Once you weaken him a stranger named Noel falls into Valhalla and is instructed by Lightning to travel to the remenents of Cacoon to lead Serah to Valhalla so they can save the universe.  After that, the story goes down hill and simply focuses on finding Lightning and thats it.While the story itself is quite crummy, the ability to complete paradox endings in which you alter the course of history is one of  the best and most inventive ideas I have seen in a game thus far.  I also like that while not directly related to the main plot the side plots follow the history of Grand Pulse and Cacoon as they were in FF13 and you have the ability to change this history is you are able to kill the insanely difficult bosses that guard these endings.Graphics (10/10): The graphics and sequences in this game are absolutely awesome.  They are vibrant crystal clear and crisp, but than again do we expect anything else from an FF game? The cinematic cutscenes are awesome, though they can get a little boring as the storyline slides into no-where land but aside from that they are beautiful.  Truthfully, I was never really into watching the cutscenes for any games until Final Fantasy 13 and 13-2 came around becuase these games did them right (of course you were fored to watch them in FF10).  Thankfully if the scene gets boring you can always skip it.Gameplay (10/10): The game play to this game as with most FF games is great.  Running around in the regular world is a combination of the last 3 FF games with monster encounters being randomized like FF10, you having the ability to avoid them as in FF12/13 and you being able to stagger them and if you pre-emptive strike them as in FF13.  This game improves on the aspect from FF13 as it gives you about a 3 second window to attack the monster (it has a coundown) if you attack the monster in this time frame you effectively stagger it and gain massive bonuses.  I feel that this was a massive improvement over FF13 as now you are more likely to get the stagger where as in 13 you had to actually sneak up behind them.  Additionally while I am not crazy about being stuck with only Noel and Serah (with an occasional addition of Snow as an NPC), you can now tame monsters in a very pokemon esque manner and make them part of your team, so in essence the monsters are you third party member.  The monsters generally only act in a specified manner, like one is a ravager class, one may be a medic and so forth.  While I prefer character development to monster development, this was definately an interesting addition.Battle-System (10/10): The battle system was greatly improved from FF13.  The Paradigm shifts happen very quickly that you barely are aware of them (in 13 they take forever) and the speed of battle itself if much faster than in 13.  Additionally, this game introduces to you a system of commands that you can perform to stagger a boss.  These commands are in the God of War style and I  think they enhance the game quite a bit.  I must admit though if you do the commands it will cut down boss fights to minutes (when I used the commands on Atlas, the first boss, I beat him in under 2 minutes, so there is definately a benefit to using them).  Secondly the auto pilot for your team is back, but thankfully this game makes your team smart.  In FF13 your team used whatever powers it felt like, often screwing you by using its crummiest (why use fire when you have firaga?), this game is very different, if and enemy is weak to fire, you will use your most powerful fire attacks, the AI in this game is so much smarter than FF13.  While I am still not a fan of the computer controlling my team as it makes the game far to easy, it definately cuts down on battle time and speeds up the pace of fights which is definately a good thing.  For veteran RPGers you will definately need to crank up the difficulty as the game will be far to easy for you on easy mode.Activities (10/10):  We all know how linear FF13 was and we all complained about it.  Well, this one is not linear at all, I would say even to the point where you NEED a guide.  There are som many places to go, so much stuff to do, so much to explore and to get.  There are even invisible chests and items for you to get.  There are about a million secret endings in addition to the regular one which is an awesome addition.  Also while you have a main storyline you can take a million side quests and different options to get to where you want to go.  You are basically free to do what you want.  Additionally, you have the chance to return to a world via the \"Historia Crux\" in which this ultimatly resets the area allowing you to fight bosses over again to gain accolades or to fix errors that you have made.  Thankfully when you save the game it saves your progress in that section so you do not lose you place in the game or in the world that you are in.Music (10/10): The soundtrack to this game is very good.  I would say it is one of th ebest for a FF game that I have played.I definately recommend this game as it is so much fun, there is so much to do and it will keep you busy for hours.  You will definately need a guide or a walkthrough for it as the game is massive.  Almost everything about this game is perfect and I think you should go out and buy it.  Yes the storyline sucks, but aside from that the game itself is phenominal and worth the money for, you get all that youpay for here.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2012"}

I played through RE4 probably 7 or so times and loved the game, so needless to say I had somewhat high expectations for this installment.First, let me say that the addition of a teammate is both a blessing and a curse.  The blessing is that it adds a whole new dimension to the game, Sheva is pretty adept at killing bad guys and 99% of the time games are cooler in co-op.  When the AI controls your teammate it's a bit clumsy.  The accuracy is spot on but they can get in the way, block your view, etc.  Having a friend as your partner is fantastic though.The curse comes in the fact that games are simply NOT as scary when you have a partner, that's part of the fear effect of the RE series, you're by yourself.  Even RE4, while you had Ashley, she couldn't fight and dies easily.This is not a typical RE game, it isn't scary at all.  There's a part or two that's disturbing, but nothing to make you jump out of your chair.  Personally though I really like that, I'm not big into horror games/movies.The graphics are fantastic, the music is pretty good, and the sound effects for the weapons and explosions are decent.  The controls, what many call outdated and difficult in the demo, really weren't too bad, they fit the game well.  Everyone wants to run and gun, but the enemies don't really attack you in a way that makes run and gun necessary.  Later in the game there's a really basic cover system ala. Rainbow 6: Vegas and GoW, although it's pretty basic and you can beat the game without using it I'm sure.Overall I really liked the game, although I must admit I like the first four chapters (really the first two) alot more than the last two.  They built the game up so much about being in Africa and such but alot of the game might as well be anywhere as it all looks the same, Resident Evil 4 has the same problem.  It started out as a little village setting and turned into a secret military facility type place.  They should have worked with the African setting a little more in my opinion.  The first 2 chapters are so great, running from street to street through a city, they should have used that setting more.The weapons for the most part seem balanced (minus the machine guns), although I wish it was more difficult to acquire some of them, maybe make repeat playthroughs necessary.  The machine guns are the one weapon I never seemed to use.  The damage is really low and you blow through ammo like it's hotcakes.  The need to beef the MG's up and give the player a reason to use them.  Also, in several classes of weapons there seems to be one stand out contender that is easily \"the best.\"  For me it's the P226 pistol, the M3 shotgun, the AK-74 MG.  All have much higher damage than the next closest, although they all lack the perks that some of the other guns have (critical hits, penetration, spread distance).  I'd actually like to see even greater differing attributes for the guns, in the end it doesn't really matter what pistol/shotgun/MG/Sniper rifle you have for any situation because they'll all work, make it so that some are obviously better for certain times.Also, there's an exploit that you can use that is intended I'm sure, but needs to be removed.  You can load a game, quit, and save any items you pick up.  What's wrong with that?  There are several places in the game where I'd load, there would be TONS of ammo right in front of me, quit, save weapons, rinse, repeat.  I did it because I kept running short on ammo...isn't that sort of the trademark RE style?  You never have enough ammo?  Well, now I have alot more than enough...There's a decent spread of enemies in the game, although some are simply fodder and others are annoyingly tough.  Like, out of nowhere in chapter 6 they intruduce a new type of enemy with no real story on what they are so you're not really prepared.  Some of the bosses are overly easy, others are pretty annoying, to avoid any spoilers I'll leave it at that.  The boss of the game wasn't hard, figuring out how to fight him was difficult for me though.**Spoiler**Wesker coming back was neat, but he's transformed from a miscontent normal Joe in the 1st game to a superhuman ninja from space.  The same thing with Jill, in the original RE she's a \"barely hanging in there\" cop, now she's using karate and all sorts of stuff...and she's blonde?  What the heck?  Why not leave her as the short haired-beret wearing cop who's the \"master of lockpicking?\"  Bring back a somewhat believeble enemy/scenario and a somewhat normal plot.**End Spoiler**I'm not exactly sure what the purpose of the bulletproof vest and melee armor are as I seemed to take the exact same amount of damage whether I was wearing it or not.  Maybe it's just my imagination...I played the game by myself the first time through, although I really wish I'd had a teammate, it would have been more fun.  The one random person I play with online though was silent and he just ran from place to place...might as well have an AI teammate who actually helps.  The benefit of playing by myself is that I got to go at my own pace, and I did so.  I didn't rush at all, I went very slow, tried to collect alot of stuff (although I only found 6 BSAA badges!), tried to get as many treasures as I could.  Then I played through it again with a friend and it was MUCH more enjoyable.One gripe, once you upgrade your weapons you have the option to use unlimited ammo, it sucks ALL the fun out of the game.  I've got a fully upgraded magnum and 95% of the enemies in the game are dead in 1/2 shots with a gun that fires 2 times a second and doesn't have to be reloaded (that will penetrate as well).I played through Mercenaries. It's a nice twist, sort of a cross between The Club and Horde mode on GoW. It's a survival setup, but you want to kill alot along the way. Playing solo is downright hard, playing with a teammate (even an averge teammate) makes a HUGE difference. Guy who joined my game was pretty nice, he and I beat every level pretty quickly with an A ranking. We had to repeat a few of 'em, but for the most part it wasn't very difficult, I kinda wish they'd boost the difficulty. The only difference between A and S in Mercenaries is how you chain the kill streaks together, by the end of either of them you're pretty much out of guys to kill (once you break 100K or so that is).  Same thing applies here, some characters are very good, some are a bit crappy.Overall I enjoyed the game enough to call it a \"good purchase\" for sure, and with the coming competitive multiplayer it'll add some fun to the game later, although the fact that Capcom is charging for it is outrageous.  I've played through the game about 3 times now, and I'll probably do so again on Professional mode.I give it an 8.5/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2009"}

I've reached 100% completion in open-world titles including Grand Theft Auto IV, V, Red Dead Redemption, and Sleeping Dogs-- just to name a few. I expected such a title to be an engaging open-world with lots of content and things to do. Which, it is. I'm currently working towards reaching 100% on this title, and it's something that's both challenging and fun to do.It has lots and lots of references to the Batman universe, and doesn't break character. It pays true homage to both the theme and characters of the comics.The combat is easy to learn, but hard to completely master. It's not only fun, but incredibly addicting to attempt to master entirely. By the end I was racking up combos over fifty-sixty on a regular basis.The one drawback to the game is how the game forces you to return to mission environments to complete challenges. It's bad enough the challenges are in the same area as the missions, but it forces you to return again because you don't have enough equipment to complete the challenges at the time. This seems like a poor design choice, either because of the small-medium map, or because they couldn't figure out how to create good hostage rescue rooms without using all the equipment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2014"}

To be honest I shouldn&#65533;t have necessarily been thinking Turok would be a great game. The first two Turok&#65533;s for the Nintendo 64 were well done, but far from perfect, and Turok 3 basically [wasn't good]. So the track record was far from perfect, but still there was no crime in wishing&#65533;I suppose. But ultimately Turok is a bad way to start off the fall, its one of those big name, big budget games that looks promising, but ends up falling way too short.For fans of the original series, you&#65533;ll find your typical Turok gameplay has remained unchanged, from the Tek Arrows to scaling vines and the terribly out of place platform jumping areas. Now this style worked for the Nintendo 64, but Acclaim should try evolving soon to join the rest of us in the new millennium. The biggest problem here is that the shooting just isn&#65533;t fun period. Blasting lizard men, baboons and dinosaurs gets about as fun as stacking blocks in Tetris, it&#65533;s all the same. The weapons have been seriously downsized from the other Turok&#65533;s, there&#65533;s maybe about 10 weapons to choose from and all of the classic military weapons have been ditched, there&#65533;s one machine gun, and the shotgun and pistol completely [aren't good] so you won&#65533;t even use them. There are still the bows and arrows, axe and your space age weaponry that amazingly rips the space/time continuum in half or something, but can&#65533;t kill the powerful enemies, if you&#65533;re into that kind of stuff. I prefer guns and lots of them.In fact the only new element to the Turok series is the flight levels where you hunter rides a giant winged dinosaur and blasts everything in sight. I would maybe applaud it if it had been before Panzer Dragoon, Star Wars: Rogue Squadron and Sky Gunner. I bought a FPS damn it, I don&#65533;t want to fly, I want to shoot, and the problem here is 25% of the game is flying! Again, this is the only new feature in Turok; this is the exact same game you&#65533;ve been playing since 1997.The more and more I played Turok hoping hood things would result, the more I was disappointed. Acclaim promised genius enemy and partner A.I. and instead we have the biggest group of idiots in the world. Even on the back of the box they claim &#65533;enemies take cover and establish strategic positions&#65533;. Well a perfect example of this was when I shot at an enemy he ran in circles numerous times then dropped his gun and ran away, I guess he figured if there wasn&#65533;t a hiding place within 3 feet he&#65533;s doomed. Another enemy who heard my gun shot started climbing up a ledge making him the easiest target in the world. I&#65533;m not military mastermind but isn&#65533;t it a little dumb to &#65533;climb&#65533; something when someone&#65533;s shooting, a place that offers no cover and manoeuvrability?And when you finally do get allied soldiers, they try to be like Halo&#65533;s marines, but instead their most brilliant move is to run straight at an enemy and wait until they&#65533;re in two feet to begin firing. In fact this is the worst A.I. I&#65533;ve seen in a long time, these enemies need to go back to kindergarten to learn basic movement like run when someone&#65533;s shooting and maybe also learn not to drop their weapons and flee like so many enemies do here.Turok is the first flop of the season and is going to fall off your &#65533;top games&#65533; to try list like the leaves of fall. Its something that could&#65533;ve been great could have utilized technology. Also funny is the aging gameplay system despite the games title &#65533;Evolution&#65533; perhaps they should check the dictionary. It would be in best interest of first person shooters everywhere if Turok would go extinct.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2002"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Max Renn","summary":"Slower pace, but engaging story and incredible facial animation","reviewText":"First person shooter fans will probably be disappointed.  But I'm really enjoying this so far.  I love noir films like Chinatown, and shows like The Pacific.  Basically you're playing a noir movie about an LAPD detective who recently served during WWII, and who's doing his best to clean up the streets despite suffering from war-related post traumatic stress.The dialogue style is reminiscent of a Chandler novel.  Voice-acting is on par with film noir, so don't expect naturalistic speech.  The much-touted MotionScan technology is pretty interesting.  Some of the facial animations are quite amazing, but we are still definitely living in the uncanny valley.  Maybe in a few years the dead eye issue will diminish.  The graphics are still pretty good, though, don't get me wrong.  The game features incredibly detailed environments, both inside and outside of buildings.  I live near LA, so it's fun for me to see historic landmarks recreated accurately in the game.  Also, I'm really enjoying the music, especially the main theme.  It fits the somber tone of the story perfectly.Driving is pretty much like any other Rockstar game.  The shooting and hand to hand combat starts off easy, but it will get challenging (don't worry non-action game players, you can skip these scenes if you fail them a few times).  The substance of this game lies mainly in the interrogations and evidence collection.  Searching for evidence reminds me of Heavy Rain, where you walk around a crime scene and happen upon objects which may or may not help you in the case.  Instead of those silly sci-fi glasses from Heavy Rain, in LA Noire, you're helped in your search by musical cues which let you know that you're near a possible piece of evidence, or you might see a metallic object glinting in the sunlight.So far, I've found the interrogations to be a bit tricky.  If you bring up the wrong evidence, or piss off the interviewee, you'll botch the interrogation.  While I am glad that Team Bondi and Rockstar have introduced MotionScan (a true game-changer in video game development), the actors' portrayals of guilt and innocence made me wonder whether actual perps would act this way.  Some of the nervous ticks might seem a bit over the top.  Once again, however, I realize LA Noire is an homage to noir films, and cartoonish acting is expected, especially in older movies.  Speaking of the actors, I've recognized over a dozen Mad Men regulars and extras, although I think there are dozens more.  I love that.  It's hilarious and distracting (in a good way, thankfully).This game exemplifies Rockstar's attempt at elevating video games to a serious art form.  In LA Noire, Rockstar's trademark social commentary about America of the '40's (and by extension, the present) illustrates video games' potential to compete with or transcend film's ability to be both emotionally impactful as well as instructive.  So, suckitt Roger Ebert.Edit:I finished the game and played all of the extra missions.  My ratings still stand.  I think the repetitive nature of the game play will keep me from playing L.A. Noire again, but I had a blast and it was absolutely worth full price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"Proof that the gaming industry is engaging in grade inflation","reviewText":"Ok. First of all, a funny story that will let others laugh at my misery. I was really excited about this game from Rockstar coming off their entertaining Red Dead Redemption experience. Although I knew this would not be GTA cop version, I still felt it would be a worthy experience. It received glowing reviews and I was convinced I had to buy it. The next day, I got an email from Redbox saying L.A. Noire was available to rent. The next week I knew why.Firstly, the commercials and the reviews for this game gave an impression that this was still an open world experience. In fact, it got nearly 9/10 across the board from all the critics. This game is no better than a 7/10, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. I remember the days when a 7 or even a 6 could still be a fun game. Five or six years ago, 9 and 10s were very rare. Today, almost any new hyped game coming out gets a high score and this is very misleading. This is not a blockbuster. Do the critics really think this game is going to get game of the year? The high scores should go to the contenders. This is one of those games that's a fun experience, but will not leave you remembering it forever.The critics raved about the \"realistic\" 1940's L.A. virtual replica, how you could drive your cop car around and solve cases in this living world. Well, these are true, but are horribly simplistic. This is very much a linear game set in an expansive environment (albeit empty environment). Their is a story to tell here. The city itself is very convincing as a virtual city, but is generally uninteresting because there is nothing to do in this city aside from the main story. You cannot go to clubs or restaurants like in GTA or do really anything you  would expect to do in an \"open world\" environment. You realize how shallow this open environment is with one of the tacked on side quests. One of these is the landmark quest. This consists of nothing more than finding the famous L.A. locals from the 1940's. Unless you somehow know the 1940's L.A. layout, you will most likely never find them all. Often you \"discover\" these by stumbling upon them during the game, often driving too fast to see them or care anyway. If you somehow accomplish this feat, I think you get a trophy or xbox accomplishment. Its basically worthless unless you are into collecting those (even they do you no good in real life or in the game). The other side quests you can do are similar to the \"help a neighbor\" missions found in rockstar games. More on that later.The storyline is you are a detective and a former WW2 veteran. His name is Cole and is a very cut and dry character. There is no motivation behind his actions making him one dimensional at best, although it feels like he has no dimensions at all. A real misfortune as the character has no likability which is very important to make the player care about the game. Anyways, you start out as a beat cop and then advance through the ranks. Somewhere in this process, a very long story is evolving. The game is split up into \"cases\". These are basically levels. You start out in the station and are given your directions to go solve the case (drive to point on the map and listen to boring discussions in the car). However, the story itself is not always told in the cases. Often, you will complete something, and then you have a flashback to the WW2 days. All of this is foreshadowing to the future story. Another side story develops with the finding of newspapers throughout the game. This is another foreshadowing technique except this element really fails. When you pick up a newspaper, it activates a video (so you don't have to read, yes!). The only problem is these are so vague (as to not give too much information away) and boring that they incredibly uninteresting to watch. They tell the side story of a doctor doing some experiments with drugs, but you don't know the point so you wonder why you are watching it to begin with. Ok, I get it that they can't give it away, but since the story is so disjointed, its just another detail that quickly fades from your memory throughout the quest. Even more strange is that the real story does not even really get going until the second half of the game. What you get is the occasional vague newspaper video and the flashbacks mixed with other mini cut scenes that slowly trickle in the story. Meanwhile, the actual first half cases have little to do with anything. I have never played a game where main story elements were so in and far between. This would not be a bad thing, unless you are really interested in the Noire genre. Because this is done, probably to stretch the game out, it is very uninteresting as to what is going on and is very easy to tune out. After I was done, I was on wikipedia to read up on all the details.This same disjointed storyline also appears in the gameplay. The gameplay formula quickly consists of going to the crime scene, mucking around in garbage and junk until you decide you have enough clues, interregating witnesses, and then trying to apprehend suspects. At first this sounds like a lot of fun (and it is) but it feels like a chore after awhile (about halfway through the game) especially in some of the harder cases. The game tries to break this up through random climbing sequences and chases scenes, but these to become tedious and feel very familiar. The controls are quite simple. You walk around and pick up and look at clues. There are very little buttons you need to remember. In fact, the game even chooses when you pull your gun out so you know exactly what you have to do. The same thing happens with the chases. Just hold the sprint button until you get close and you automatically tackle the guy. Rinse and repeat. In the middle of the game, one of your cases turns into a type of scavenger hunt which was a nice release from the normal search crime scene/interragate model. I thought, \"this would be a great way to explore the city!\" Well, you drive around to a location, search around until you find a clue, but wait....this turns into the classical prank you pull on your kid sister - a clue leads to just another clue to another location where you have to find yet another clue. This process repeats at least 3 times more than you want it to. In the meantime, you realized how uninteresting this big world is.Another game play element consists of the neighbor missions. If you hated these in games before, you will really hate them in this game. These occur when you are driving in between murder sites and other locals in the case. They were so boring, I only did a few. It happens like this. Whenever you start a case, you get into the car with your partner to go to the crime scene. Then, your radio in the car will sound off with a dispatcher saying someone needs saving. You can accept without disrupting the case by pressing a button. Big mistake, you end up driving in real time about 10 minutes to wherever the scene is. For some reason, it is never close to where you really are. Then when you get there, it involves some chore, usually breaking up a fight or stopping a man from jumping off of a building. They are usually very short and very unexciting, especially when you are at detective level. Why are they asking you to break up petty crimes when you have got big cases to break open? It feels lame compared to the scope of things going on in the cases. Unfortunately, all of these bad things would normally make you turned off, but the amazing facial technology and interesting moments make you keep playing.The cases themselves are generally interesting and tend to get better as they go along. It can be very fun trying to read people in the interrogation room. Later on in the game, you get to make some decisions about convicting people of crimes. It feels like you are really in control of this mystery. Unfortunately, what happens is that all of your progression in the game is not effected by your decisions. You HAVE to advance so even if you bust the wrong guy the case is completed and you get promoted. However, the very next scene, you are getting chewed out by the chief for making the wrong decision. The only problem is, none of this matters because you have to move onto the next case because the show must go on as they say. This also branches into another complaint about the game where there are no save points during during these moments. In games like these, people want to save before they  make a major decision, often to go back to see what would happen if you chose something different. This simple function would have added a lot of replay ability to a game that had none to begin with.Ultimately, I have never been so bored yet had fun at the same time. There are enough shoot outs, twists and chases to make you keep playing. And some moments are more fun than others for sure. The technology is really good and is what really makes this game. I would recommend at least trying the game out for the experience. Rent it if possible or buy used.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2011"}

Here is what comes it the kit: Drum kit(3 pads, 2 cymbal risers, kick pedal) with midi in and expansion port, drumsticks, usb microphone, guitar with connector/usb splitter, stickers for guitar.  All you need to connect in one box, no need for extra usb hub if you do not want it.A bit about the drum kit, very playable, durable upper, kick pedal is a bit flimsy, but alright for my purposes.A bit about the new guitar.  This features detachable faceplate, extended neck, larger strum bar, longer whammy bar, and the tap/touch pad.  this guitar is not necessary for any features in the game, but for advanced gamers, they may find it a new fun way to bend the sounds on long notes, or get through hammer-ons and pull offs faster. I'm pleased I can get through this on the old Les Paul.Now, about the game itself, see song listing above, it's amazing.  Just a ton more songs available in the game, only a few to \"purchase\" in the game, the rest unlock.  The venues and graphics are all sharp and fantastic to look at.  The animation of the Guests who come in are spot on, such as Ted Nugent riding in on a Bison, or Zach Wilde's attitude behind the 6 string.  There are many other guest such as Billy Corgan from Smashing Pumkins, the Lead Singer of Paramore, and the drummer from Blink 182.  Overall the game play will keep you busy for many hours (took me almost 4 hours to get 50% through, minimal breaks). The head to head battle's with guitar legends is now replace by guitar challenges with masters like Ted Nugent And Zach Wilde where you don't try to cut strings and stuff, you just try to keep up with them and make yourself and them look good.  If you do, you play an encore with them.Also, there is a recording studio that allows users to make and play their own music, a first like this for this genre (though rock revolution tried).  And much like legends of rock, there is online team play, head to head battling.If you do not have another \"Band Kit\" and are looking to have one, this is an excellent choice, and having played Rock band and Rock Band Two, this is at or above both of those, especially since they are all \"Master Recordings\", no covers, and it has plenty of great songs fulfill my need to thrash, rock, or pop my way about stage.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2008"}

However, it does not make the game any less fun.  Although it's based off of a system where everything you do is counted towards good or bad points, you do not play a god and instead have to follow a more strictly enforced storyline.  You are the hero that everyone needs while simultaneously trying to avenge what happened to your hometown and your family.  The choice on HOW you deal with that is all up to you.  You can be a benevolent helper that everyone loves, or the evil lord that everyone runs away screaming from.The game itself is a lot of fun, with easy controls, lots of options, tons of side quests and stuff to do, and has really been an inspiration for more modern games like Skyrim while still maintaining that old world RPG system of puzzle rooms, doors, and locked key chests.Even though the game may seem, at first, to be a bit childish, it can be raunchy and violent at times and so a mature audience is definitely required.  That being said, it is clever and witty and will definitely make most gamers out there smile.The style of combat is simple, but this is also the focus of my single dislike about the game.  It's, honestly, a bit too easy to beat.  If you spend the time doing the side quests and main quests you are going to be a master at nearly everything available to you in the statistics category.  Even if you aren't, you can put all of your skill points towards the Physical Shield spell and become, nearly, invincible.  However, that doesn't make the game any less fun, so it's definitely recommended to be played (especially for a measly $10) and enjoyed!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2013"}

Sometimes this will even cause freezing where the system has to be rebooted to resolve.  Sometimes, noticeable lag.-Aiming is off at times.  You can have your site in the chest of the enemy and miss.  They can shoot 6 foot to the left and kill you. (seen through killcam). Therefore, aiming and killing can be very random and frustrating.  You are constantly say, \"I killed him\".-Forget games like Headquarters as a good team will simply monitor spawn points and continually kill you.-Introducing COD cash has basically eliminated the need to level.  If you use the M-16, it can be fully customized VERY early in ranking thus making gaining levels pointless.Therefore, for all the reviews that say this is great (referring to Multiplayer) are not being objective as this game certainly has MANY flaws.

Any Question?","reviewText":"Every once in a while, a game comes along, which redefines very essence of gaming and sets a standard for all other games to follow.  It could be graphic, game play, music, innovation, originality, and experience.  When I play a game, the most important factor I see and cherish ultimately comes down to experience.  I can pick only three games; Ico, the masterpiece which shouldn&iexcl;t be missed by anyone, and Metal Gear Solid, another masterpiece where everything was masterfully controlled.  Lastly, I pick Super Metroid for SNES, which literally made me cry for 3 hours, and almost, almost made me to determine to never play video game again back in college years.  So you see how much I&iexcl;ve been anticipating for true sequel of Metroid.  Now the question is does this fourth &iexcl;true&iexcl; sequel of Metroid lives up to its legacy?  Now just finishing Metroid Fusion for the first time (you will get goosebump all over when you hear that classic Metroid title music, SERIOUSLY). I can&iexcl;t help but being immersed in this world of, you tell me, like world of exceedingly wonderful mood-This very sequel, Metroid Fusion, will mesmerize you with the time-tested foundation of previous Metroid games with enhancement on every aspect.  Graphic looks so vibrant and vivid that you will literally go WOW, seriously.  Music wise, I would say they sort of took out that out-in-the-space atmosphere more and inserted more of movie score like, making it feel like more of movie.  You know, that&iexcl;s true because previous Metroid games had almost one objective, like destroy the Space Pirate, or exterminate Metroid, and that was it.  However, Metroid Fusion contains many objectives, as part of story line, and yet they don&iexcl;t feel like an individual objective, which would cut the flow of story, but it makes it like a well-made movie.  You know, that was really nice addition because not only you are playing this classic of classics with all the great element intact but also with great story line like a sci-fi movie.  Really, you will see what I mean.  There&iexcl;s this one aspect, a great aspect of the game which will be revealed toward the end of the game, which elevate this already a great game into something good enough to compete with games like Ico and Metal Gear Solid.You know, I can&iexcl;t help but to make a comparison with this recent game, Castlevania :H of D for GBA.  Actually Castlevania implemented the concept from Metroid starting from PS version, Symphony of the Night (or may be back in NES time), which forces you to obtain certain item in order to proceed to next area.  Not only Metroid Fusion kept that tradition, but also they threw in lot of secret passages.  Seriously, as I was playing, I got really stuck and thought of it as bug.  But there is always way to get out and proceed with the game.  One thing I sort of didn&iexcl;t like about Navigation Room was that it does somehow take away that full sense of exploration since it literally tells you where to go, unlike Castlevania.  Ok, going back to the comparison, without a doubt, the Metroid Fusion really shines compares to Castlevania: H of D when it comes to boss fight.  Yes, in Castlevania, boss fight wasn&iexcl;t that hard because you literally have countless potion to heal yourself.  However, in Metroid Fusion, you will have to either defeat them or you will be defeated.  This really distinguishes Metroid Fusion apart from rest of games out there because you will have to really try hard, not only just trying hard but also maneuver Samus quickly and cleverly.  You can&iexcl;t just beat the boss by jumping and shooting some missiles without putting any thought into it, you will actually have to decide your move carefully.  You see, in previous Metroid games, when you have, let&iexcl;s say, 8 Energy tanks, you are like undefeated, right?  THAT&iexcl;S SO WRONG in Metroid Fusion because trust me, even if you have 10 Energy Tanks, the way they balanced your health/energy point is almost insane, one hit will take away more than half of your whole energy tank, not just boss but also regular enemies.  So there&iexcl;s this constant tension, even if you are walking with 10 Energy tanks with 150 missiles because just &iexcl;mere&iexcl; enemies can inflict tremendous damages, mark my word.The very first game I played for Nintendo was Metroid, and it really showed me what an excellent video game is all about.  After defeating that Mother Brain, and evacuating the planet within limited time to see &iexcl;another&iexcl; Samus, it gave me this sense of &iexcl;fulfillment&iexcl;.  When I finished Metroid 2 for GBC (I personally consider Metroid 2 as the best GBC game along with Zelda DX), I was left with this sense of &iexcl;completeness&iexcl; with brilliance of Metroid game. When I finished Super Metroid, I was crying like a baby for 3 hours (seriously, you gotta play for yourself to really &iexcl;experience&iexcl; the experience) with sense of &iexcl;Emotion&iexcl;.  Now, you have Metroid Fusion, which will give you the sense of fulfillment, completeness, and ultimately emotion.Like this one review of Metroid 2 said, &iexcl;IF YOU WANT TO EXPERIENCE THE BRILLIANCE OF NINTENDO, PLAY METROID\"DON&iexcl;T MISS IT.

Do the math, PSP 3000 = $169.99 + 16gb memory = about $60 - $80, so total it would be $230 - $250, the same cost as getting a Go, and you still have to buy/carrying UMDs. So, if this is your first PSP/Portable console, if you can afford to get it go for it, if not get the PSP 3000, just wait or don't get it, but don't let other people biases or displeasure deter you, do the research, way the pros and cons. After all, this is just my opion of the device. As as I said so far, it think it was a great purchase.Pros:1. 16GB internal memory2. Bright, vivid, beautiful screen3. Very Slim and Sleek4. Games/Movies/Comics on the go5. Ergonimically and Aestically pleasing6. Digital Content7. Expandable MemoryCons:1. Very Pricey2. Proprietry Connection3. Lessened Battery Life4. Non Removable Battery5. New Memory Format6. Previous Adapters Not CompatibleOverall, I am very pleased with the purchase, it is a great device. I think people are mainly dissappointed with the device because of the price, which I will agree is much. And knowing Sony, they will probably release an update version with 32gb of internal memory and a built in camera and reduce the price of this one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"josak","summary":"[4 Stars] One of the best entries in the series.","reviewText":"Meant to give this 4 stars.

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"The Right Mindset is Essential to Enjoy this Game","reviewText":"Let me start off right away by saying that if you think the best games are ones that punish you for anything less than a perfect performance, games that have constant risk, or games that elicit unhealthy amounts of adrenaline release during play, then Prince of Persia is not for you. When I first played this game, it was a rental back in 2010, and my experience with it was really soured by the fact that I was trying to play through the game before it was due. When playing the game like that, it becomes repetitive and grating. This is not a game you play with the goal of the ending constantly in mind. No, rather, this game is an \"experience\" that you're supposed to immerse yourself into and take your time in. You really must get yourself in the proper mindset to enjoy it. I've recently bought the game again, and changed my attitude from when I first played it, and I enjoyed it immensely.It's evident as soon as you boot up the game, that the developers put a lot of love and labor into this game, and that fact becomes only more evident as you play through the game. The environments are absolutely gorgeous and imaginative. If you've ever desired to play a game that reminded you of childhood fairy tales with a child's massive imagination, then Prince of Persia will be very pleasing to you. The graphics are crisp, the colors are vibrant, and the design is superb. That is PoP's biggest strength. The story is not particularly unique or groundbreaking, but the writing and voice acting is so good and compelling, that the story is actually very well done. I found myself fascinated by the different environments of this mysterious land I was exploring. I was very compelled by the various bosses' stories. The banter between Eleka, your constant companion, and the Prince is believable and enjoyable. You really grow to like the characters over the course of the game. The sound and music is also very well designed. These are without a doubt PoP's strengths.As far as gameplay goes, it's about what you'd expect from a Prince of Persia game. Crazy, cool acrobatics are the name of the game here, with lots of wall-running and gravity defying moves. Combat has been revamped to be more combo and flow oriented with focus on fighting one enemy at a time instead of the frantic hack n' slash frenzy of past Prince games. For what its worth, it works very well. Eleka gets access to various special powers that are pretty neat to use. Each boss requires different strategy to beat, and they're all very fun because of that. You'll end up fighting each boss several times though, so it may get repetitive to you.One big thing that's different about this entry in the Prince of Persia franchise is that much of the difficulty and challenge of past entries is largely gone. Eleka will always save you from death. You cannot die in this game, as many gamers complain about far too loudly. The game holds your hand a lot, making it obvious when double-jumps, or dodges in combat, or anything else you could imagine, are needed. Is this a bad thing? It really depends on your perspective. A lot of people complain about the lack of challenge, but to me, I think it's obvious that wasn't Ubisoft's priority in crafting this game. It's obvious that it is meant to be absorbed as a work of beautiful art, rather than a game you play for bragging rights because of the difficulty. Satisfaction comes from taking in the beauty and learning about the world and characters of the game, not beating a super difficult boss, or pulling off a large sequence of acrobatic moves in a row (although you'll do that a lot in this game).Is Prince of Persia for you? It really depends on your attitude and desire for what video games should deliver. Personally, I absolutely love theSands of Timegames in the Prince of Persia series. In my opinion,Prince of Persia: The Sands of Timejust simply can't be beat in terms of best Prince of Persia game. However, if you enjoy imaginative games that focus more on a beautiful experience than a challenging one, you'll be rewarded for picking this game up. Too often, people play games expecting the game to spoil them and live up to what THEY want from the game, rather than understand the game's focus and mold their perspective and expectations accordingly to really enjoy the game the way its supposed to be enjoyed. The gaming community has really fallen in that much of it is now comprised of spoiled brats who complain if they don't get exactly what they want at any given moment from the games they play. What happened to the open-minded gratefulness that used to be so prevalent in gamers' minds? It makes me sad. Anyway, Prince of Persia is pretty cheap now, too, so it's not like you're losing out on too much. Buy it, take it all in, and appreciate it for the right reasons.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00002STXS","description":"Mega Man Xis a robot designed by Dr. Light to choose his own path in life. Years after he is created, Dr. Cain finds X and mimics his design to create a race of such robots called reploids. When the sigma virus infects these reploids, causing them to commit acts of evil, it is up toMega Man Xand his partner Zero (who is quite powerful, contrary to what his name implies) to stop it.","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"Brand new Mega Man series made its debut on SNES","reviewText":"After 6 Mega Man games on the NES, Capcom was ready to move on and rather than simply continue the series, they came up with an alternate take on Mega Man himself. In 1994, Mega Man X was released and they introduced a brand new Mega Man series that made its debut on the SNES. It was a breath of fresh air for the popular franchise and was a major hit among gamers and video game critics.A brand new series means a brand new story and it goes something like this:Before Dr. Light passed on, he made a new kind of robot that can think and make decisions on its own. But he felt the world wasn't ready to witness this breakthrough so he sealed it away in a capsule. Many years later, another scientist uncovered and released the robot. After being blown away from what it can do, he tried to duplicate the technology on a group of robots he made and they turned against him. The new robot, Mega Man X, must now defeat these robots and their leader, Sigma before they take over the world.As Mega Man X, you explore 8 themed stages modeled after the boss Reploids. Beat each one and you collect their main weapon so you can use to defeat enemies and other Reploids. As you get closer and closer to Sigma, you can also collect items, health and weapon upgrades scattered throughout the game. Just like the NES Mega Man games, you receive a password after you defeat a Reploid or if you use all your lives to write down and continue your progress later.The PROS: Everything! What a way to update Mega Man and spin off an entire new series at the same time. They kept the core basics of the NES Mega Man series and threw in new characters, new story and new graphics, sounds and music. Beating the game is half the fun and so is looking for the various heart upgrades and weapon upgrades to your armor suit. And to add icing on the cake, the game had a secret armor upgrade that was a nod to Capcom's other popular franchise, Street Fighter. It made such a huge impact that two more sequels were made exclusively for the SNES. Great, great game overall.The CONS: With a new series comes the realization that none of the characters from the NES series make any appearance whatsoever. Mega Man X on a whole is a tough game to beat but only because the difficulty level spikes through the roof during the last few stages, especially when fighting Sigma. The battle alone made or broke gamers who reached to that point so either you celebrated with jubilation as you watched the ending or cursed out its name in pure frustration.If you're a true Mega Man fan, then you know what I'm talking about as far as playing this great game. It was a refreshing new spin on the Mega Man franchise and gamers everywhere loved it. For those who haven't tried it yet, you absolutely must if you have any interest in playing classic Mega Man titles. You can track down a used copy for your SNES, search for a used copy of the Mega Man X Anniversary Collection for PS2 or Gamecube, or download this title for the Wii via the Virtual Console Service for 800 points ($8.00.) Either way, it is worth it and a true classic game that belongs in anyone's game collection. I highly recommend you check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004EVWYYG","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr. H","summary":"The term \"SSDD\" Comes to mind","reviewText":"Same Sh** different day. Literally.I had played pokemon 10 years or so ago and I had the blue version. It was pretty fun and new at the time and I loved to play it all the time. I also bought the gold version and found that to be even more fun with all the new features, and shortly after, I played sapphire. Sapphire was pretty fun having the new 2vs2 battle mode and all the new pokemon and extras. I didn't play any pokemon game after that and when this game was coming out I thought what the heck i'll give it a go and I bought a DS for this game.From the beginning I could see a huge difference in the graphics from the older ones I had played and this one. As I progressed through the game I got more and more dissatisfied with this game. The new pokemon have the worst names and the new features in this game hardly justify the need for everyone to say this game is completely different. This feels like the same game I had been playing 10 years ago but with a new coat of paint on top. The story lines are getting worse and worse as well. By the time I beat the fourth gym in the game which I believe was at 40+ hours game time, I could not stand playing this game anymore. Perhaps this game is more appealing to the newer generation of kids, but me, a 21 year old, this game just doesn't cut it.When you compare 10 year old games to their newer versions, usually you can say the newer ones are much better (in terms of gameplay). When I am playing a pokemon game that is over 10 years newer than the original, I expect MASSIVE improvements. The only new thing this game has is a 3vs3 combat which really doesn't make the game more fun, and just a new line of pokemon. I am very disappointed in this game and it's lack of upgrade.I am definitely done buying Pokemon games from now on, and advise everyone else to stay away from this game unless you know for a fact that you will like it. I may have been too hard on this game but I put my hard earned money into buying it and the game did not deliver for me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2011"}

One of the reasons the game has been so well received is because of how versatile and appealing it is for all different kinds of gamers. The level of customization in this game really makes the player feel like they apart of Tamriel (the world Skyrim resides in). From being able to intensely customize your character, to being able to customize your abilities and even name your weapons. Because we are in the genre of high fantasy, the world of Skyrim is so mystical and magical it makes it very exciting to explore all the different parts of the land. The way the game was designed you can easily play for 100 hrs (I played for 200 collectively) and still have quests to do. Most games don't produce in excess of 30 hours of gameplay let alone 100+. Because the world of Skyrim seems so infinite and there are so many quests the fun essentially never stops. The story is a great and epic tale of a chosen one called the Dragonborn, who has the ability to 'shout' like the dragons of old who flew high above the skies of Tamriel.

Those types of missions from the past games, while also seeming slightly ridiculous, cancelled out the fun I had with the rest of the game that seemed more or less rooted in reality.Frankly, after playing Saints Row, I was expecting the GTA-type-game crown stolen and not returned by the SR developers.  Saints Row was simply more fun, the missions seemed to make sense and have a clear payoff and impact on the game.Saints Row also wasnt bogged down by game components that I thought were unnecessary, like having to eat and lift weights in San Andreas.  I was expecting the same pointless missions, the same pointless activities in this installment of the GTA series.But I was wrong.  Rockstar chose to base this game a little more in the real world (as it goes) and focus quite a bit more on character development.  Rockstar also seems to have included quite a bit more extra content, such as the internet, TV, games, etc that are probably more a result of more powerful consoles being available for their developers.At the end of the day, these types of games are pure escapist fun.  For probably the first couple hours of GTA IV, I was concerned maybe Rockstar had really slowed things down too much, but as the game went on (and the hours and hours piled up I'm sad to say), I found the trade off was a much more immersive world where you cared about things a little more than the past GTA editions.When the game was over, I can honestly say I'll probably play it through again, if for no other reason than to focus on the parts of the story I didnt get to this time and to take the other paths and choices that the game offers you.  If I went right, this time I'm going left.And really, thats the goal of a game developer, right?  To keep you coming back for more?Great job to Rockstar, great game, and great choice of direction to take the series - you almost sank it, but I think there will now be even more GTA converts lining up to pre-order GTA V thanks to some smart decisions in development.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2008"}

Isaac, a technician, is tasked to help repair a planet cracker, a massive mining ship. Once aboard, their craft is shortly destroyed, and they find themselvse trapped on a ship filled with monstrous conversions of the crew.Sound: 11/10. This is where the game makes its biggest bang. The environmentals are so good that you'll be grateful when you see a monster. The sound of clattering pipes, venting steam, shorting circuits, all so innocuous, yet they manage to create the lions share of the feel. The music is barely secondary to it, helping only to accentuate it.Graphics: 9/10. Very few bad things can be said about the visuals of this game. The walls and environs are placed and unique. The graffiti is humourous and usnettling in turns. The only flaws deals with interactions and backgrounds, allowing pieces to fall or tumble through, though this is rare.Gameplay: 9/10. Combat is pleasantly creative, with psionic abilities in the place of industrial equipment, and welders and repair gear as the weaponry. There are very few actual military pieces, with the exception of the pulse rifle. Inventroy is well set up and challenging to juggle. Make sure to download the free Obsidian Suit, which will make life far simpler. The HUD design used in this is also incredibly creative, and a cheery, bright counterpoint to the blood and death.Story: 9/10. The premise is well thought out, and makes sense in context. The story is peeled back like layers of an onion. Theres enough facts and logs placed around that can fill the gaps, but leave the main storyline vague, which as everyone knows, makes for better horror than nailing down every nuance and detail.Only a handful of drawbacks exist. The \"store\" is oddly placed, and an unusual setup, considering most 7-11's don't sell military hardware. The bodies are static, meaning that when you walk through one, it bursts like an over ripe fruit, and results in a game of kick the head, which follows for quite a distance if you can't walk around it. The HUD, whose praises I was just singing, is next to impossible to read in some circumstances.Overall, the game is one of the best horror adventure games ever made, on the level of the original Silent Hill and Resident Evil, and will make you jump or start with fright, and set your heart racing with nothing more than the sound of a dropping pipe.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2008"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"Fallout 3 is NOT - NOT! - Oblivion with Guns...","reviewText":"I had read Fallout 3 reviews, both here, and on popular gaming sites.  I did a good bit of homework that initially convinced me not to get this game - not because of quality, but simply because of gore.  I'm not a big fan of gore, blood and guts, and had decided to just stay away.Then I started hearing people say this was \"Oblivion with guns.\"  I loved Oblivion.  I still feel that Oblivion deserves the title \"best video game of all time.\"  So I ignored all of my research and purchased it around Christmas-time.  Even the guy at the counter said, \"Oh this is a great game - you'll love it.  It's like Oblivion but with guns.\"I'll say it again incase you missed my title - this is NOT Oblivion with guns.  Oh certainly the Bethesda influence is immediately recognized - save anywhere you want, fast travel, being able to \"wait.\"  You've got primary skills, secondary skills, leveling...  It's definitely a Bethesda game - an Oblivion \"sibling,\" if you will.But Oblivion was a beautiful game, filled with swaying trees, multiple moons, beautiful horizons...  Fallout 3 is hideous, ugly, forbidden.  The main playing area is appropriately called the \"Wasteland.\"Please understand - I'm not knocking this.  It's SUPPOSED to look like this.  The year is 2277 - some 200 years after a nuclear war that literally destroyed the world.  Every character you encounter has a weathered appearance, every building is littered with ruble, crumbling walls, etc.  In fact, the few times you find a \"clean\" environment - such as a major computer mainframe during a main quest, or the area called \"Oasis\" which is a side-quest, it'll actually surprise you - you'll feel like you've left Fallout 3 and suddenly loaded a new game.But it will affect you.  If it doesn't affect you, then I think you should be placed in a room with rubber walls.  The sheer concept of an irradiated wasteland in which exists multiple societies of dwindling populations sits just outside of what we normally consider \"imaginable.\"  The choices you have to make as a player - I think it's safe to say - exist at a level that a real human being will probably never have to consider.  Sometimes you HAVE to let achievements (Xbox360) or certain rewards (such as weapons, armor, etc) be your guide to your decisions because if you actually try to think morally, you'll probably have nightmares and turn suicidal.  This game is dark.  It's cut-throat, it's vicious, and it'll affect you.This game will also scare the s**t out of you, too.  I can't count how many times I've been rooting through an abandoned building (most buildings in Fallout fit into this category) only to get whacked in the back by a mutant or some other hideously disfigured creature when I absolutely didn't expect it.  I'm not used to my heart pounding when I'm playing video games...Because of this, you'll never feel safe, never feel comfortable.  Even in my own room (you only get one residence in Fallout 3, not multiple houses like in Oblivion.  And if you want the GOOD residence.....) I was startled when a dog showed up.  Turns out it was just a prop in the \"pre-war\" appearance I purchased for my room, but still - I almost pumped a round of shotgun ammo into it...  For the first few hours of gameplay, I would skip nighttime in the game because it was just too creepy to explore in the dark.  I since have gotten used to it, and at level 19, there's really nothing I can't handle, but again - it affected me.  Oblivion was nothing like that.As far as content goes, gameplay, quests, etc, I can't possibly review that stuff.  I will say that the beginning of the game can be difficult from a combat angle while you're at low levels.  This game does not level up enemies as you level up, so first they're tough - a rat takes 3 shots to kill!  As you start leveling up, you suddenly realize that you're popping the heads off of super mutants with one attempt - that quickly becomes immensely satisfying.  I find myself not minding the gore when I know that I don't have to worry about \"that guy\" anymore.I'll also say that Fallout 3 is NOT a first-person shooter.  If you bust into an open room filled with baddies and just start opening fire, you'll be dead.  A lot.  My only real complaint involves aiming.  I found very quickly that I needed to be able to look around (basically, the right stick) quickly.  So I set the sensitivity to max.  This of course makes aiming very difficult.  All of the guns use the left trigger to \"zoom in,\" but it has no affect on controller sensitivity.  In fact, with almost all guns, the aiming button is worthless.  I use it with the Sniper Rifle - that's it.  I would have really liked to see this button A) pull the gun up close to you such as with COD 4, and B) slow the movement of your character to allow for more precise aiming.Because of all this, I tend to use the \"V.A.T.S\" mode very often.  This mode - engaged easily with a button press - effectively pauses gameplay, and allows you to select anyone within range - good or bad - select a body part, and add it to the queue.  You can make multiple selections if you have enough \"action points\" available, and therefore - at higher levels - can basically stack multiple headshots on one enemy, or even stack headshots on multiple enemies, all before selecting \"OK.\"  Then you'll watch your character take the shots in super-slow-motion, one at a time.  I will say at higher levels that this is incredibly satisfying, and even starts to make the game a little too easy (but then again, you've earned it, so enjoy it.)  I just wish that I could pull off headshots a little more confidently on my own without having to rely on the VATS system so heavily.  Of course I could set the sensitivity down, but then I can't move as quickly - and believe me, when a super mutant is tearing into your a**, you want to be able to turn around as fast as possible!!My only other complaint is that I can't level up individual skills as in Oblivion.  If I wanted to be a Master of Sneak in Oblivion, I just had to sneak around a lot, and eventually I'd get it.  In Fallout, you have to allocate skill points when (and only when) you level up.  Because your levels are limited in Fallout to 20 (or so I've read) that means I have a finite amount of points I can allocate to skills, which means some stuff I'm just going to have to suck at, period.  There's nothing I can do after level 20 to improve any of those skils EXCEPT for reading skill books, of which there are only books for a few of the available skills.Fallout 3 is one of those few games that is definitely worth the $60 purchase price.  But be warned - if you're the kind of person who finds an insect in your home, catches it and releases it \"back to the wild,\" then Fallout 3 is NOT your type of game.  More often than not I've had to replace a character's head with shotgun lead simply because \"it was the humane thing to do...\"  Don't think I've enjoyed it - I'm usually the compassionate player.  My Oblivion character was nearly God-like.  This game forces you to think and act differently.Fallout 3 is nothing like \"Oblivion with guns.\"  Oblivion was an adventure - it let you stretch your legs, explore, and was generally inviting.  Fallout 3 exists on the opposite end of the spectrum.  There's no adventure here - just a devilish trek through an undeniable hell-hole.And it WILL affect you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2009"}

This title is a polished puzzle-platformer that's great for casual and hardcore gamers alike.  There are plenty of levels that offer a wide variety of challenges.  Many have stumped me for a while, and some are challenging even when you know what to do.The gameplay is unique and charming.  You go through each stage feeding the Blob jelly beans that transform it into various items (ladder, trampoline, parachute, anvil, etc.) that help you traverse the current level.  There are enemies, pitfalls, and spikes that can end your adventure prematurely so it's best to keep a watch out and prepare to solve some inventive puzzles (fortunately, there are plenty of checkpoints so you don't have to redo much if you do die).  Some are easy while some are very challenging.  Regardless of the challenge, the charm of this game will keep you coming back for more.Not only are the graphics absolutely beautiful, but the animations/sounds/voices are perfect.  You can even give the Blob a hug just for the fun of it.  Every time I play it the charming nature of the entire package just amazes me.The only real gripe I have about this game is that loading times between levels can be longer than expected.  They're probably about 10 seconds (fortunately they don't happen extremely often) which I think is too much for this kind of game.  The load times should be virtually non-existant, in my opinion.  However, this is a small issue that fails to taint a marvelous masterpiece that all Wii owners should definitely experience.One issue that might be important to others is that there is only one save file, so multiple people can't have their own save slot.  However, you can replay any level as many times as you want so it's not like others can't experience the same levels in order from start to finish (although they won't be able to find the hidden chests that unlock concept art and videos if you have already found them).Overall, this game is simply to wonderful to miss.  My wife thought this game looked like a joke, but now she imitates the Boy and loves how cute it is.  Anybody can enjoy this game so I really advise you to give it a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1K","description":"The power-packing Xbox hardware delivers the third Oddworld title in one of the most brilliantly realized settings to grace any gaming system. Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"C. Minnick \"Life is cartoons and sports.  Eve...","summary":"Wierd, but fun","reviewText":"I liked this game so much!!

{"product_name":"B0088MVPRY","description":"","summary":"Great Game, But Not a \"Complete\" Set of Skylanders","reviewText":"The Skylanders game/character product is one of the best ideas I have heard of in a long time.  You get action figures, a \"portal\" that lights up, and a video game.  The interaction between the game, the portal, and the characters is so clever that I wish I had thought of it.The linking of a video game and action figures that can be enjoyed \"offline\" is really a good one.  The creators of the game were interviewed and said that they designed the figures without knowing that they were far more detailed than would usually be approved in the toy industry.  As a result, you have really fun toys that are distinct looking.WARNING: This is a \"starter\" kit.  You can play the game and enjoy it.  If you (or your kids) want all the figures, you are looking at hundreds of dollars in additional purchases.  As other reviewers have stated, the supply for some figures is very limited, so even if you have infinite cash, you may have a tough time finding them outside of constant eBay scouring.I have more than one friend whose kids are obsessed with these and who have spent a lot of money on them.  Their kids enjoy them a lot, but if you are someone who knows they won't be satisfied until they own them all, you should be aware what you're getting into!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2012"}

With the click of a button, a race starts on the spot with said opponent.  It could be a short drag race down a busy highway, or through a crowded city with mulitple routes to the objective.

Once you clear a stage or minigame on the adventure mode, it unlocks and you may just play it by itself from the main menu when the game boots up. You may play as 6 different characters, all with their own unique stories, stages, and minigames. I thought this was a brilliant implementation of the game. Although, admittedly the Sonic and Tails stages are way more fun the the stages for Big the Cat, Knuckles, or the robot. The Amy stages are somewhere in the middle.The controls are somewhat frustrating at times, particularly in the adventure mode. The NPC humans in the adventure mode look downright like stick figures graphically, and stand there like manequins unless you knock into them. Then they flinch for a moment and go right back to their original position.The adventure mode plays like an exploration game. You must figure out what to do to get to the next cutscene, minigame, or stage. You must find the object or area that will take you to it. This is a rather mundane and boring, sometimes frustrating, part of the game.Sometimes the camera angles in this game make it so you can not see your character or get any sense of direction. Again, this is most often in the adventure mode.The cutscenes in the adventure mode are well presented and timed. The fade from the adventure mode to the cutscenes is well paced. The graphics look great, and soundtrack well performed.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the sonic characters, as you can play and develop so many of them. If you like action or 3D platformer type games, you will probably enjoy this game as well.This game is definitely worth a play though to see if you like it. I did, I own it, have beaten the game with several of the characters, and still enjoy playing it to this day. However, this game is hardly the best the Dreamcast has to offer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2007"}

It may seem this way when you see Sonic the Hedgehog speeding at the speed of light on the Gamecube. This is may seem like a rehash of the Dreamcast game, Sonic Adventure 2.

But yet, for excellent games, there comes a price. This...horrible, infuriating camera chooses which way to go and you can't fix it!!! I hate that! But, thank God, Sonic Adventure 2 Battle has 12 players that have their own stroyline! That puts the replay value higher. Plus, there is the little extra that seperates the Dreamcast version from the Gamecube version. The Chao Garden which you can transfer your Chaos to your Game Boy Advance from your Gamecube.

Waiblinger","summary":"One of the best games ever!","reviewText":"Rarely does a game come along that intrigued me with its storyline as much as Mass Effect did. I typically do not like RPG games a lot, but Mass Effect had me captivated. Bioware has created several masterpieces in its time, and this is one of them. Here are a few thoughts on the game itself:The inventory system is fun, but can get annoying later in the game when you keep having to sell (or convert to omni-gel) your items.The mini-games (for hacking things) are pretty easy and you will almost always successfully hack whatever you are trying to open.Exploring planets can get really boring the second and third play-throughs. The MAKO needs to go faster!The amount of depth for each character is incredible. You learn their likes, dislikes, history, etc. Every person has their own personality, and it is evident from the way they behave.Your decisions throughout the game affect the outcome. Always the sign of a good RPG.The balance of character classes is a little off. Unfortunately biotic powers are not nearly as strong as weapons in this game, so playing as an adept is much harder than as a soldier.There are tons of planets to discover in the Mass Effect universe. Going to all of them and uncovering the stories there makes not only this game much more interesting, but also contributes greatly to Mass Effect 2!This is one of the top games of the decade and one tha thas lots of replay value. I highly recommend it for somebody looking for a fun action game with an extremely immersive story.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001D7T2VM","reviewerName":"James Skemp \"JamesRSkemp.com\"","summary":"More than just God of War meets Zelda/Metroid","reviewText":"Darksiders, like Nier, the last game I played through and beat, didn't get all that much respect when it first came out. But Darksiders features more than just God of War meets Zelda gameplay, it tells a story worth seeing through until the end.The following review is based upon a playthrough on the Xbox 360, on the hardest - Apocalyptic - difficulty.Darksiders is similar to God of War in that you play in a third person view, slashing up enemies and powering up your weapons and variety of moves. Unlike Bayonetta, for example, for the most part you can get away with mostly just slashing away, so long as you dash and jump to avoid attacks, even on the most difficult setting. Blocking is also an option, but whether because of the button combination to do it, or more likely because of my recent playthrough of Bayonetta, I didn't find much use for it.One grace that Darksiders provides is that the button smashing cutscenes in Darksiders are limited to only a couple. As someone who dislikes God of War because of the large number of these types of scenes, and had a heck of a time in Wolverine during the one scene that used them, this is absolutely wonderful.The gore and violence is approximately what you'd get with that type of game as well, so the M rating is well deserved.Darksiders is similar to Zelda, or even Metroid, in that not all areas will be accessible to you when you first start out. Only a few areas are absolutely required, but the optional items make full use of backtracking (not that the game doesn't require backtracking). Puzzles also make an appearance, only a few of which really drove me crazy, especially near the end.The music in the game is quite majestic, and I found myself sitting and waiting in some areas just to hear snippets, but is never in the way. The rest of the soundtrack is equally good, and do a fairly good variety of enemies, I didn't find anything horribly repetitive.The story is the last part I'll mention. As is usually the case you start out strong and rather quickly lose your powers. Here you actually lose them, instead of a game like Prototype where you flash back in time, and must recover them, learning new powers along the way. You really don't make much use of your powers at the beginning of the game, so it's not a horrible loss.But I found the story compelling enough to draw me into the game, and that was most clear by how I felt during the ending.During my game I ran into three spots where my console completely froze up, requiring me to turn the console completely off. All were after long playing sessions, so it may have been related to that. They were also rather late in the game.As noted above, I played on the hardest difficulty setting, and my total play time was approximately 22 hours, with around 90% of the achievements complete, and grinding to level my weapons and moves, found all optional unlockables. I choose the Xbox 360 version only because it was available where I picked it up. As far as I'm aware, there's no difference between the versions (although one article discussing a possible sequel suggested the PlayStation 3 version was better, for some reason).Normally Darksiders wouldn't be my type of game, and I honestly wasn't expecting much, but it completely blew me away. In the hope that they'll release another Darksiders, changing only the story, I give this game 5 of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2011"}

The bottom line is that even if you are remotely interested in wrestling you should get this game. I personally am a huge fan of the old school wrestlers and the create a wrestler mode is so advanced that any wrestler that has ever existed can not only be created but their likeness(via face morphing) and mannerisms(via create a animation mode) will be faithful to their real life counterparts. Despite the fact that this IS the BEST WRESTLING GAME EVER MADE, there are some minor glitches and overlooked features that should be recognized in a fair review. The worst of these is the pink mouth glitch that overshadows what would be a flawless create a wrestler mode. This glitch automatically makes the inside of any created wrestlers mouth bright pink. Consequently whenever your created wrestler is in a talking animation they look abnormal compared to those wrestlers created for the game who have teeth and black inner-mouths. It should also be noted that women can't be used in season mode, there are issues with Kevin Nash's black and white nwo entrance, and a glitch that crashes the game if you lose the hair match(which should cause your hair to be shaved like Kurt Angle's). Finally, if you are interested at all in this game don't let any of these minor glitches keep you from getting the game, as all games have their own glitches.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-13-2002"}

Probably one of the best games I ever played.If I had to compare I can see many different similar games incorporated in this. Most notably would be resident evil. Even down to when you die and the blood coming across the screen. I also notice the kinesis seems very similar to the star wars games. Very cool though. And the aliens seem very silent hill / suffering.This game is pretty scary. I'm telling you this as someone who watches horror flicks to fall asleep to. Its not scary for what it is, its just that these aliens jump out at you whilst walking down a quiet corridors and at moments you least expect it. And if you have surround sound this game is perfect for it. You can hear aliens all around you, but don't know exactly where they are or what kinda they are. Also adds to the creepiness.I love how this game has many different elements, such as kinesis, stasis, z-gravity...The zero gravity is very cool, but also at the same time disorienting. Made me a little nauseous at times.The weapons are pretty cool too. The line gun was probably my favorite, especially once fully upgraded. The flame thrower was not so hot, but came in handy one in a while. Especially against the Brute and Swarm creatures. The line gun will probably be your main weapon since it is accurate, fast, and the ammo is abundant.I just finished playing this game on medium and it seemed a little easy. I might have been better suited to play this game on hard setting. The weapons and health seem over abundant throughout the game, although, there were a few times in the game where I had to fight past those aliens with very low health and ammo until I reached a point where I could obtain more.There are a few things which would make me give this game 4 stars (even though I gave it 5 because of its awesomeness). 1 would definitely be that this game is very buggy. There was a part in chapter 7 where I was supposed to remove asteroids from a zero gravity room, but the game never loaded them. It took me 3 days of trying everything possible, including doing every side mission I could before this part (which you are actually supposed to do afterwards), loading from other chapter 7 save files I had, making new ones, trying someone else's disc, trying a friends PS3 system, making new save files...nothing worked until I tried going back to a save file from the previous chapter. I had to do a lot of what I already did again which sucked but going into chapter 7 all over again somehow made the asteroids load into the game where they should have been.I contacted EA when it first happened but they were no help. They pointed me to their forums, but this game is from 2008 and it is now 2010. No one really frequents those boards anymore so I didn't get any answers. Shame on EA for making such a buggy game with no apparent downloadable updates and no support for when things go wrong.After being on the board I notice a lot of other people had very different problems like mine. Thankfully this was the only problem I ran into and got passed it.Another thing that I did not like about the game is the viewing angles. Its very hard to see and focus where these aliens are. I think a 180 turnaround button similar to what was in resident evil would have helped greatly when aliens are attack you from behind. But when they are coming at you it from behind its hard to turn all the way around and get the camera angle to focus on them without being attacked to much. It takes a while to get used to, but its still annoying all the way to the end.2 more things to mention which isn't too much of a flaw..the sound track is nothing to boast about. I'd say it's generically theatrical. Also, I wish they just stuck to the alien aspect. I didn't like how they turned it into the whole human testing type of story. Seem too resident evil / zombie to me.At the end of the game they add a bit of replay value by giving you a new rig to buy, letting you keep what you had when you beat the game (besides the kinesis and stasis. you have to wait to obtain it in the storyline), and also giving you 10 power nodes and 50000 cash money. I don't usually replay games, but being I breezed through it so easily I may just humor replaying on the harder or impossible setting for more of a challenge and to max out my weapons.So to review IMO:GAME PLAY - 10GRAPHICS - 10STORYLINE - 9CONTROLS - 8SOUND FX - 10SOUNDTRACK - 7REPLAY - 7","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2010"}

Rather than Bowser kidnapping Peach, this time he's kidnapped Mario and Luigi, leaving the ditzy blonde, often-captured Peach to save the day. The gameplay is familiar, with Peach running, jumping and breaking blocks to solve puzzles and advance through levels. The Princess also has a couple unique powers of her own, such as a magical talking parasol and an array of powers tied to her emotions that make use of the Nintendo DS's touch screen.Super Princess Peach is not a challenging game, but that's okay. With cartoonish graphics, a very cheerful musical score, and a big smiling umbrella as your guide, the game is obviously meant to be light-hearted and enjoyable. If a standard Super Mario Brothers game is a dinner, this game is a light snack. It will make you smile and give you a few hours of enjoyment. As you progress through the game, you will unlock a handful of mini-games that will give you something to do on the side. Like the main game, these mini-games are a fun diversion that will kill some time and give you a slight challenge.Unfortunately, there isn't a lot of replay value to Super Princess Peach. You can have almost every secret and mini-game unlocked after one play through the main plot, and you can unlock everything halfway through a second go-round. Still, the game more than justifies its price tag by doing what a video game is supposed to do: making you smile and giving you a few hours of fun. As a quick diversion, Super Princess Peach is light-hearted and well worth the time. More serious gamers might find things a bit too easy for their liking, but even they can use a breather once in a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2009"}

The graphicalquality does not change between cutscenes and gameplay.  Kojima and his team pulled out all the stops on the beauty of this game, as they have always striven to do.SPOILER ALERTThen there is the story.  A lot of people harp on the Metal Gear Series because the story is full of twists.  One person even said that the plot was twists and only twists.  That person missed the point completely.  Especially by the end of this game, it becomes apparent what Kojima had been pushing for.  The message about humanity is clear... the MGS series has always been anti-war, anti-genetic determinism, anti-environmental determinism, every mistake that humanity has ever made with regards to war and control of the populous has been addressed in some way.  Consider the history through which Kojima derives his inspiration.  His home country of Japan experienced an apocalypse during WWII while causing an apocalypse in mainland Asia at the same time.In all situations of war no matter who begins the fight or where it starts or ends, the young will repeat the mistakes of the old, and the old will let the knowledge gained from their mistakes slip away with death.  Even the most heinous actions, deception, murder, are a means to an end, and the end is all that really matters.SPOILERS OVERGameplay was spectacular.  The MGS franchise is one of very few that has made significant gameplay improvements with every subsequent release.  Control of Snake feels much more fluid, yet at the same time you can feel his age in the way he performs.  Though he is more agile and powerful than the average human could ever be, he isn't quite the same old Snake.  He is THE Old Snake.Old Snake gets a lot of neat toys in this game, too.  Most notably is his chameleon suit.  If he lays flat, his suit will automatically adopt the pattern of the materials that are on the floor.  By pressing the \"triangle\" button while up against a wall, he will adopt those coverings as well.The second great toy is Drebin's shop.  Drebin is a weapons launderer who gives Old Snake full access to replacement ammo and other supplies.  ID Locked weapons can be converted to old-world weapons that do not require nanomachine permissions.  There are A LOT of weapons in this game.  First time through you probably won't get to experience all of them, and that is okay.  Just check them out on your next run.  The game is only about 10-15 hours long depending on how you choose to play.  Also, through Drebin's shop Old Snake can modify his weapon.  The first weapon, the M4 Custom is a good all-purpose weapon.  It packs a decent punch and holds 30 rounds.  It can be modded with a shotgun attachment, grenade launcher, or foregrip for stability.  Laser sights and scopes can also be added to the M4 and other select weapons.  So play around and have fun.Toy #3 is the Metal Gear Mark II, Hal's minature Metal Gear Rex that is mostly harmless...mostly.  When you need a buddy to turn the corner and remain unseen for you, Mark II can cast an invisibility cloak and make sure the coast is clear.  If things get sticky, it has a shock wire function to incapacitate unsuspecting foes.  The same tool can be used to knock on surfaces to distract your enemies and guide them away from Old Snake's true position.  It is a neat little gadget that you may or may not find to be useful.Next up, the enemies.  In this game, it is impossible to hate the enemies you fight (except for Vamp) because they are amazing, flat-out.  Whether they are GECKOS (bipedal beast machines), FROGS (all-female supersoldiers), or Private Military Company militia-men (remnants of their humanity will keep you grounded), or the Beauty and the Beast Corps (best enemies in of all time in videogames?), enemies are not just targets.  Kojima and his crew made the enemies in this game characters to be admired.  They neither have names nor faces, but they will f*** your day up very quickly if you do not respect their power.  From the top down, they are all capable killers.The humanity of this game lies within Snake's allies.  Meryl, Eva, Hal, the Colonel, Mae Ling, Raiden, Rosemary, Naomi, and especially Sunny represent the other side of life.  Old Snake is a manufactured product of war, the only life he has ever known.  No machine can imitate or destroy the compassion that these individuals shared.  This is passion.  I won't go on, can't explain much else without major spoilers.Gameplay, people, visuals, this game is stunning.  Metal Gear Sold 4 exemplifies why videogames deserve to be celebrated as art.  It has the story worthy of novel publishing, breath-taking visuals, engrossing music, and an all-around realism that we celebrate in paintings such as the Mona Lisa.  If only more videogame producers put this much time and effort into a game.  Production for perfection... long hours, perspiration, and inspiration to produce the culmination of one's efforts... that is art... this is art.If you are a casual gamer, this is not for you.  If you have never played the other MGS games, this is probably not for you.  Play through MGS1-3 in order to get the story and gameplay straight, and then play MGS4.For everyone who has been trying to compare this game to COD and HALO...come on.  MGS4 is not a pure shooter.  They put it nice and bold on the cover, \"Tactical Espionage Action\".  That means be sneaky and use force only as needed.  Play a \"shooter\" and judge other shooters with it.  MGS4 is NOT, I repeat, is NOT a shooter.Could this go down as one of the best games of all time? Absolutely.  Game of the Year?  For sure.  It is in a league of its own.  Nothing else plays like it.  Few other games are as engrossed in the mystique of political/sci-fi conspiracy.  Too few have such dedicated stories.  In most games, the producer's passion is not as apparent.  MGS4 had a 105 degree fever with Kojima's ardor for gaming perfection.  The game feels like he and his team cared.Gameplay 5Video 5 - Cutscenes are long but not at all boringAudio 5Story 5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2008"}

Edwards!","summary":"I prefer C+C Generals but Tiberium Wars is still fun.","reviewText":"Command and Conquer: Generals was the first RTS game to snag my attention for quite some time when it came out.  The unit balance seemed to work along with the various tech trees and every piece of your army seemed to retain its usefulness.  It was also nice having a general with access to various skills as you progressed.  Tiberium wars is fun, but almost everything that really worked for me in Generals is now either watered down or totally gone.The game is new and I expect patches, but as the game is now the unit balance is a little off to me.  Veteran players will probably argue against me on this but the GDI seem to walk all over the NOD faction.  NOD has some annoying units like super long range Beam Cannons, respawning turret defenses, and fanatics/suicide bombers but almost everything seems to be undone by filling GDI APCs with a selection of troops and leading them to battle with Mammoth Tanks and Zone Troops.  I have yet to lose a single Mammoth Tank in the campaign thus far and I'm almost positive that half a dozen Mammoth Tanks could beat the game.  The NOD are just too weak in their defenses it seems.  I only briefly played the Scrin and they seemed completely overpowered and only balanced by how slow they were, but that's only a brief analysis.Unit effectiveness is also an issue here.  As you move up the tech tree things quickly become obsolete.  Your first few unit options quickly become worthless once you open up your advanced units.I don't like that they did away with the Generals.  I liked being able to select a General with a certain skill set and that added a small, but nice little boost to strategy and game variety.  Now you just earn your various troop drops and air strikes by working your way through the tech tree, and there seems to be less there.A new addition I am digging is that things build completely then you place them so there's you don't have to worry about a lone rocket soldier or something taking out a fresh building.  There's also some decent strategy here because from the start you only have one build cue and there's a specific building to allow you to build more things at once.  One of the few new things this game offers that I think really work.There doesn't seem to be as many garrisonable structures and you can't build them either.  I generally found structures to be a good way to defend areas in the previous game but they seemed to have removed a large amount of them or perhaps moved them further away.  Either way they're no longer a readily availabe convenience.  You can have basic soldiers \"dig in\" and make bunkers but it's not really the same.  If you want to garrison snipers you have to find a good building for it.The graphics are nice I'll give this game at least that much.  It's no Supreme Commander but they're still well done.In summary, it's a fun/good game and the best RTS to come out since Supreme Commander but I think mechanically speaking it's far inferior to C+C Generals.  If your computer can take it I suggest you pick up Supreme Commander and give this game a pass until it comes down in price or up in balance.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2007"}

This game, the way it looked, I didn't have much expectations, but I was surprised. Here is why.PROS.AWESOME SOT LIKE GAMEPLAY: This game goes back to the roots of Prince of Persia. Sands of Time trilogy (SOT) wowed me with running on the wall, jumping from ledge to ledge and reversing time type of gameplay mechanics. In this game they go back to the roots and give you more of that gameplay.NEW MAGICAL AND ACROBATIC ABILITIES:  In addition to what mentioned above you get some new moves and magical abilities. Most notable of them all is to freeze water for given amount of time. Developers have wonderfully make use of this ability give this game a novel feeling. Freezing and unfreezing water with proper timing makes it very important to move from one part of the palace to another (Very difficult to explain in words, have to see the gameplay to understand it).  In addition to freezing water you also have other unique abilities such as swift jumps, crow hooks and one VERY UNIQUE one. But I don't want to spoil much here.MASSES AND VARIETY ENEMIES: In this game they have made good use of next gen console processor power in enemy battles. Unlike previous Prince of Persia games where you had 5 or 8 enemies at most, in this one you will have 15-20 enemies (if not more) at the same time. While initial enemies will look the same, as you progress in the game, variety of enemies will appear that will require you to change your strategy in defeating them.POWERS AND SWORD UPGRADES: Defeating enemies will give you orbs and these orbs can be used to upgrade your combat and magical powers. You can make your attack stronger, life bar larger, have fire walk power, ice sword power, stone armor power, wind explosion power or you can increase the time to reverse time. Each one of these can be upgraded up to 4 levels. Personally I loved the RPG element they added to this game.DECENT STORY: Not much to describe here. Voice actors are good and the game has decent story. Don't want to spoil too much.LOTS OF TRAPS: To many of you, this may belong in cons section, but I personally like challenges. In addition to acrobatic gameplay, there are tons of traps in the game that requires you to successfully guide prince through them. To me this was very challenging but the fun part of the game.CHALLENGE ROOMS: After you beat the campaigns, you can attempt challenge rooms to test your skills. While there are not that many of them, they are better than nothing.CONS.FEELING OF CHEAPNESS: I enjoyed the game, but when I played it, I just can't help but to feel that this game was either made on low budget or shortage of time. Unlike previous prince of Persia games where artwork was the strength of the game, this game didn't carry out the legacy. Sure things look great in 720p resolution, but in terms of artstyle and graphics, it look similar to PS2/Xbox games.BOSSES: There are bosses in this game but honestly they are not impressive. I love the game with strong bosses, especially those who require unique strategies to beat. Unfortunately, the bosses in this game are not much fun and can be beaten using mostly the same strategies.SANDS OF TIME TRILOGY CONNECTION: According to developers, this game takes place between first two games of SOT trilogy. So I was really hoping they have some information on DHAKA or some sort of connection to him. But to best of my knowledge, they didn't. So somewhat disappointed.CONCLUSION:Honestly, if they had put some more money into this game and had not pressured the artists to release it along with Prince of Persia the Movie, I think this would be a five star game. Nevertheless, I loved it. I think if you are Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Trilogy fan, then you should definitely give this a shot, especially now that it is selling so cheap. Chances are you will enjoy it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

During World War II, many lost souls from the global conflict were left to wander the world in search of salvation. Desperate to escape  their terrible plight, they sought to resurrect Dracula's Castle from the rubble of society, assisted by two mysterious vampire sisters. Now Jonathan and  Charlotte must work together to confront the two vampire sisters, and ensure that this villainous catastrophe is not unleashed on the world.GameplayEvolving the action-adventure gameplay that has been the series' trademark for 20 years,Castlevania: Portrait of Ruinlets players switch  freely between Jonathan and Charlotte as they proceed on their heroic mission, each with their own strengths, abilities and style of play. Players can now  utilize powerful combination attacks in which both characters unleash the full extent of their combat abilities to decimate the game's more than 100  different enemies and bosses. In their quest to stop Dracula's resurrection, Jonathan and Charlotte can collect and use different weapons, equipment, and  items to increase their overall skill level and acquire new abilities.As mentioned before, players can switch freely between both characters, a  necessary option to win the game. For instance, you need to analyze certain situations and carefully choose to play either Jonathan or Charlotte in order to  successfully battle against the vampire army. The two characters can also combine their powers to pull-off powerful combo attacks.

Bakehorn","summary":"The castle got a new paint job","reviewText":"Just about 15 months ago I was whipped with Konami's Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, which was at the time and still is one of the best Nintendo DS games. With its only flaw being a severe lack in touch screen support, Dawn of Sorrow was a game that even the most jaded gamer would have trouble complaining about. Just weeks ago, Konami released their second DS Castlevania, Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin. Does this second attempt manage to replicate the same greatness of Dawn of Sorrow?Jonathan, who's inherited the Belmont vampire hunting mumbo-jumbo, is joined by spellcaster Charlotte in yet another journey to explore Dracula's castle and defeat the bloodsucker himself. The pair finds out that Dracula isn't the big boy in charge, however-that would be the daunting Count Brauner, who's filled the castle with enchanted portraits that take Jonathan and Charlotte to different worlds. Jonathan and Charlotte have to stop Brauner and his minions. The story is very Castlevania-ish and won't surprise anyone who's played a game in the series before.Two characters can be controlled at once on the game screen. Jonathan primarily attacks with weapons found throughout the castle, while Charlotte uses magic abilities that can be found randomly in the souls of defeated enemies. You have the option of playing with just one of the two characters or both at the same time, and both styles of play yield different benefits. Playing with two characters requires you to watch out for the health of the CPU-controlled second character, which is actually represented by the Mana bar that also limits your magic attacks or skills. If the Mana bar depletes, the second character disappears and you continue on normally with a single character. This system works but I felt at times that it made some battles too easy. Castlevania has, for years, been a game where even a single large enemy posed a huge threat. Now, with two characters attacking at the same time, that's not such the case.Still, everything looks and feels just right. Both characters control very well and special attacks are done easily with a simple button combination. Throughout the game you'll find all sorts of special abilities that allow you to move around the environment even more than before-just like in every Castlevania, getting the double jump ability opens up a large amount of real estate, and it's quite exciting to find any new ability. I've always put Zelda, Metroid, and Castlevania in similar places for their adventurous progression; it isn't until you find a new item or ability that you can truly proceed or unlock every nook and cranny. I like this design, it's simple but still forces you to look around and play with everything.Replay value is extended beyond the normal kill-the-boss-and-proceed progression of past Castlevanias. You can now accept mini-quests and side missions to earn special moves, weapons, and the like. Some of these side quests are very simple, but others aren't explained well and will have you searching high and low through every area of the castle just to complete. The rewards are well worth the trouble, making this distraction a worthy addition to the game.Portrait of Ruin, like Dawn of Sorrow before it, has beautiful 2D visuals with a ton of detail. Enemy sprites seem to have several layers that react independently, making the animation that much better. Some of the 3D effects used are very, very nice, like 3D enemies and backgrounds. The only thing I'm starting to like less and less is the anime character style. What happened to the gothic style of Harmony of Dissonance, Circle of the Moon, and Symphony of the Night?Overall, Portrait of Ruin is a good game that doesn't outdo its predecessor but definitely deserves some attention from action, adventure, and Castlevania fans. In future Castlevania games I'd like to see Konami tinker with more 3D effects and less anime-inspired art, and I'd also prefer if they'd stick to a more traditional design. The portrait idea was cool but just seems like a cheap way to introduce levels that are dramatically different than Drac's castle. So the final word: it's good, even great, but not as good as Dawn of Sorrow.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2007"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B003GSZAOY","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"Very Good","reviewText":"Nothing beats the original, but as the story continues to unfold, it becomes rather interesting. Even though i believe this is the last one. WB taking over i thought would be a really bad move, since Sierra made the first and it was superb. Also i really liked Timeshift(from Sierra) as well for all the reverse, stop time, and slow motion actions you could perform in it. Well the same holds true for this game, although it's more gruesome and the story is much better. The graphics if you have a great gaming rig look great, much better than consoles (of course), but still not as good as say Starcraft II or Battlefield BC 2, somewhere in between. The shooting is the same, as is taking cover, jumping, aiming etc. Everything is in tact, and in many ways it's a bit better than FEAR 2 Project Origins, which i liked a lot. It was far scarier and really engrossing, also it didn't have a lot of guys running around saying, lost him, GD, S.O.B, target spotted and the likes. So FEAR 3 doesnt break any new ground, it just does a nice job of covering the old and picking up where it left up. The game wasn't a big seller, and there was not a lot of hype surrounding the game. I didn't even know about it till about 4 months ago, when i saw it in Game Informer. So if you like the other FEAR games, then you'll enjoy this one as well, the first is the best, then the second, and then 3, as it should be i think. So expect some good, bloody, impressive scares, but don't look for this to be FPS of the year. Even though it's not your average one, to someone just getting into the franchise, it may seem that way. For those of us who know and love the series, kudos. Good job WB. Seirra would be proud.Btw, is the little girl ever gonna change into a woman? (wink)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-15-2011"}

As a Vine Voice, I knew I had to at least try out Toy Story 3 to write this review.  Imagine my surprise when I threw in the game to 'try out' for a 'few minutes' and found myself late for bedtime three hours later.I started out deep into the 'Woody's Roundup' mode, basically a giant toybox/sandbox of various game genres and experiences.  You earn currency by helping out folks around town, or exploring, then use that currency to buy toys and to unlock areas of the toybox area.  Everything from racing modes to platformers to dressing up the townfolk and more is included.  The game even features a 'Gears of War'-ish shooting mechanic (you can throw balls at targets to activate different items). I played this mode for at least 4 hours and didn't see an end in sight.  It was constantly rewarding.  Simple enough for new gamers, but engaging enough for people like myself who great up on the Atari 2600.The game is very polished as well.  It never felt glitchy or cheap.  Just constantly well thought-out and the environment grew as my experience did.My only knock is in the menu navigation.  I read that the game had two modes: the perviously mentioned toybox mode, as well as a story mode to play through the experiences of the film, Toy Story 3.  For the life of me, I couldn't find the story mode!  It wasn't until I chose to 'QUIT GAME', that I was kicked out to the familiar board game menu, and able to navigate away from the toy box.  The actual story mode is fun, but very short.  I finished it in less than two hours.This is easily the best family game I've played in years.  Something for everyone, and for fans of every gaming genre.  Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001TOMR0C","reviewerName":"Halicon5","summary":"Red Steel 2 raises the bar for quality motion controls","reviewText":"It has been months since I've played a game that I felt motivated enough to write a review about.  Red Steel 2 has finally managed to break my general disinterest in game reviewing.  Red Steel 2 shouldn't even be associated with tragedy that was the original Red Steel.  The original had its heart in the right place but the overall product was rushed for release, had buggy controls, and was considered un-fun by almost everyone I know.  This new game isn't perfect nor do I think it is the best game ever created; nonetheless, this game is noteworthy and awesome in every way the original wasn't.  Red Steel 2 also gives me an excuse to connect my Wii Motion Plus peripheral, which was sadly getting very little love.  This game shows how to do motion control and pointer controls right, it shows a great sense of style and narrative, and has catapulted itself onto the short list of \"games I think everyone should try.\"CONTROLS: Above all else, this game is about the controls.  The motion controls aren't perfect, but they are better than any motion control game out there with the possible exception of Tiger Woods 2010.  When I say that this game sets a new standard for quality motion controls, I am not exaggerating.  Responsiveness and accuracy are superior to anything I have played to date.  Going forward I suspect that a lot of developers for the Wii, Playstation Move and XBox Natal will be using this game as their measuring stick.  When the Wii first came out, I think this is the type of experience that people were imagining.  I'm just disappointed that it took this long to get to this point.  Combine the quality motion controls with responsive and accurate pointer controls for the gun play, and... I just am impressed.  It works.  There are some quirks, to be sure, but it still works.  The most negative thing I can say about the controls is that there is a bit of lag after swinging your sword before you are restored to pointer control making switching from sword to gun a slower process; the good news being I rarely find myself needing to switch quickly from my sword to my gun, so this isn't a huge problem.  Blocking enemy attacks is also a bit dicey, but I am confident with more practice I will be able to adapt better.One thing I do have to say about the controls is that this game isn't really \"couch friendly.\"  The motion controls frequently require full arm motions and pivoting at my hips has helped many times.  To achieve the control I wanted, I pretty much have to play the game standing up.  That little warning at the beginning of every Wii game where they feel compelled to tell us to make sure to have enough space to play might mean something;I have already managed to pop my curious dog in the face quite a few times when she gets too close as she checks out what all my flailing around is about.  Additionally, the short cord between the nunchuck and Wii remote creates some problems.  Considering I have short little stumpy arms I expect that people with longer arms may have more difficulty.  I have purchased a nunchuck extension cord with hopes that the extra cord length will keep me from accidentally unplugging the nunchuck.  That way I can tangle myself up in extra cords instead.  I'm not sure if I'm going to win this battle.GAMEPLAY: The game is a first-person shooter/swordplay adventure.  The arenas and levels are relatively small and compact, in some ways sort of like the Metroid Prime series or the first Fable on Xbox.  You will blast and slash your way through lots of bad guys and bosses; accept missions; upgrade equipment and buy special moves and so on.  In terms of level design and game progression the game play and progression is handled well, but there isn't really anything new or revolutionary that most other quality action games aren't already doing.  What makes the game play standout from the rest of the pack is how the controls allow you to interact with the game.  Sometimes I feel a little overpowered compared to the enemies, but I am only playing the game on normal difficulty.  Boss battles seem a bit tougher than I expected though.  Additionally, there are a few points in the game with Quick Time Events, which I really don't like, but luckily there are checkpoints within the QTE sections that prevent you from having to repeatedly work through several minutes of timed button presses only to die at the very end and start over.  The QTE sections do work, but as a general rule I don't like QTE in any game, so I am biased.GRAPHICS/PRESENTATION: This game looks good.  Possibly the best on the system at this time.  Not just \"good for a Wii game\" but genuinely good, and I attribute that to the quality art style that feels like a cell shaded graphic novel western with samurai.  Think \"Mad Max\" mixed with some \"Seven Samurai\" and a bit \"Fist Full of Dollars\".  I feel compelled to compare this game's style and quality favorably to Borderlands on the other consoles, even down to the way that boss characters are presented before battles.  In fact, I would say that the explosions and many particle effects look nicer on this game than on many Xbox 360 games I own.  Not because the Wii can do it better, but just because Red Steel 2 has some very talented animation and effects artists.STORY: The storyline is pretty decent, definitely better than most action games, but it definitely has had some moments where I was underwhelmed by the voice acting. Par for the course in that regard.SOUND: The music is awesome and ambient sound effects are excellent.  I love the Asian/Western themes.  Voice acting is decent enough, but has a couple of rough/forced moments where I get the feeling the actor was thinking \"Ok, I read the cue cards; now where's my paycheck?\"  Also, hearing so many Asian characters talking like rednecks is a bit of system shock for me.VALUE: The game length is feeling like it will be about average for an action title and I expect that I'll beat the game on my first play-through in about 8-12 hours.  The game has some a challenge mode that I haven't even delved into yet.  Judging by how much I'm enjoying the core story mode, I'll probably be back for more to explore the extra challenge mode.PROS:+++ Excellent motion controls.+++ Gorgeous graphics and art style.+++ Silky smooth frame rate that doesn't seem to stutter at all.+++ The game setting is quite awesome with a futuristic Mad Max/Samurai/Western feel.+++ Good sound workCONS:--- Your arm will get tired with extended play sessions and you might find it necessary to stand while playing.  It really isn't all that couch friendly.--- Some flat voice acting combined with some stuff that really feels out of place.--- Frequent load screens, but they are cleverly hidden as open door animation.--- Quick Time Events, but at least they have mid QTE checkpoints.--- The controls for blocking enemy attacks could use a bit more tweaking.Overall, I have to put this game on my \"must play\" list of recommendations.  The high quality presentation and style combined with some of the best motion controls seen in any game just put this one near the top of the heap.  If you don't choose to buy the game, at the very least rent it.  It does require the Wii Motion Plus, which is also important to remember.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2010"}

This latest incarnation of the DS, the DS Lite, shrinks the once clunky sized system down and re-shuffles the microphone and power buttons making the hand held easier to operate than ever before, while also making the screens bigger and brighter.  As for the system's game library, it's getting better and better as the weeks go on and we see games like New Super Mario Bros., Metroid Prime: Hunters, Mario Kart, Animal Crossing, Tetris DS, Meteos, Sonic Rush, and the upcoming new Zelda game and Final Fantasy III; both of which are sure to be smashes, as well as a nice sized list of games to avoid for the DS (such as Marvel Nemesis, Splinter Cell, King Kong, and Kim Possible) as publishers and developers both decide to make use of the DS's stylus and touch screen abilities, or just ignore them in general.  The DS Lite is hands down the best hand held system on the market right now, and is incredibly affordable (for the price of a PSP, you can buy a DS Lite and at least two games), and even though there are reports of a cracking of the system's outer piece, the DS Lite is still the hand held to buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-23-2006"}

Regarding the Single Player mode, I never did play Portal (1) but this one was easy to pick up and figure out what the story was behind it all! I have gotten stuck on a few levels but once I figured them out I felt stupid for not knowing my way faster. I recommend this game to anyone that likes First-Person-Shooters, Puzzles, Mind Tricks, or anything else! When you step through a portal, it messes with your mind a little and feels just awesome!For multiplayer gameplay, this game requires absolute teamwork to solve most of the levels. My only complaint about Co-op is that you can only play online with friends, not random people. This doesn't really impact my overall rating for the game as it is affordable although it is a newer game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004TCT3","description":"Featuring a new adventure that's filled with numerous enhancements and  innovations, this long-awaited sequel toPok&eacute;mon Red,Blue,  andYellowgreatly improves upon the series' winning formula, and makes  for an even more insanely addictive and wholly absorbing gaming experience.LikePok&eacute;mon Gold--which essentially is the same story, with minor  gameplay variations--Pok&eacute;mon Silvercasts players in the familiar  role of a young Pok&eacute;mon Trainer who's out to collect as many different  kinds of Pok&eacute;mon as possible. As in previous games, gameplay consists  mostly of exploration (completing various quests in the process) and  Pok&eacute;mon battles, which employ a unique battle system that's like a  complex twist on rock-paper-scissors.But, despite the similarities, it's quite apparent thatPok&eacute;mon  Silveris a whole new ball game from the start. The game is played out in  real time, with the current time and day of the week (recorded by an internal  clock) having a direct impact on gameplay elements, such as what Pok&eacute;mon  you'll find in the wild, and when certain events occur and characters appear.While there are too many new and improved features inPok&eacute;mon  Silverto list here, among the highlights are 100 new Pok&eacute;mon  (including two new types), new evolution processes (including breeding), and a  more streamlined game interface that has better-organized menus and button  shortcuts.Although it's easier to progress inPok&eacute;mon Silverthan in the  previous games, the sheer amount of fun and game time that's involved is  daunting. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better value than this one.--Joe  HonPros:Insanely addictive and wholly absorbing gaming experienceTime and day of week impact gameplay directlyBevy of new features and hidden secretsImproved graphics and more streamlined game interfaceCons:Minor compatibility issues when using Game Link with previous versions","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"You keep coming back to it even though it still feels the same","reviewText":"When Pokemon first came out, it became a huge phenomenon like the next Furby or Tickle Me Elmo. Like many of them, a lot of people didn't understand why was it so popular? I still don't but I like playing the games so that must be something. So far there have been 3 \"tiers\" to Pokemon. There will be a set of 3 games, followed by a new set and so on. So you had Red, Blue and Yellow, now we have Gold, Silver and Crystal. This is for the Silver version(which could also be the Gold one too).Story: What little story you can actually come up with. Basic plot in one sentence: kid from small town wants to be Pokemon Master and collect gym badges and be the best ever. There might be small plot elements throughout the game but this isn't really something that takes you on a wild ride.Graphics: It's Game Boy Color so it's not as impressive. Looks more like a colored Game Boy version. We do get Pokemon in color and their details are a little more refined but nothing big graphically and they usually are never.Sound/Music: Sound pretty much comes from sound effects from battle moves and a Pokemon's cry. Music is okay, nothing instantly hummable but nothing chalkboard-like.Gameplay: The big draw of the Pokemon games are the fact that there's so damn many of them. There's 251 of the creatures and that's not even before getting into the GBA ones which add another 100 or so. You collect them and train them so if you want all 250(the last one like last tier's Mew, Celebi this time, requires either a Gameshark or going to a Nintendo event).The other draw, or setback depending on your circle of friends, is the fact that some Pokemon are only available in the version you bought and have to trade with someone who owns the other. So for example, in the one I bought, Silver, I have Weedle but I want a Caterpie but Silver doesn't have it, Gold has it. Why do I want a Caterpie? It evolves into Butterfly, to me more useful than Weedle's final form Beedrill. Ooh, speaking of which...Certain Pokemon have evolutions. The most common way to get them is if you level them up to a certain level. Another is using a stone. Example being if you use a Leaf Stone on a Gloom it turns into a Vileplume, but using new Sun Stone turns it into new species Bellossom. There's even pre-evolved forms of favorites from last tier. Pokemon mascot Pikachu for example is form 2, his first being sickengly cute Pichu. Other Pokemon evolve when you trade with someone else, others need a special item and versatile Eevee gets 2 new forms.Sounds like a lot of stuff already and I haven't even mentioned time specific Pokemon like nocturnal Hoot-Hoot who can only be caught at night. Or breeding your Pokemon with others to get different forms like Pichu. There's so much stuff in the game it takes a more fuller review to hit everything.In a way it wouldn't make sense to recommend this since we have the next tier, Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald out but it's still good game nonetheless, regardless of the cuteness factor.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2005"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved.

However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

The details are there and the voice over is still topnotch.Gameplay: Same as it was when it was on PS2. I kind of wish you could aim and walk but no. I soon got use to the controls are about 2 hours. Also I heard it was touch controls but from DEFAULT all there was is touch the screen to change weapons or for healing. I was expecting to be able to look around or aim via swiping the screen. One thing that bugs me is when you're running and close to a wall he likes to lay against it. So when you're tryin to run from enemies and have a tiny ounce of health left than it sucks that you just died because Snake laid against the wall when all you was trying to do was run around the corner. I guess after playing so many other games when you have to press a button to hide behind a wall you forget about this game's controls.Graphics: Topnotch. Snakes look all clean and detaily.

This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak.

When the previous model was a Cobra.I owned one of the original PS3's back during first release. I sold it because there wasn't much to play and I regret it ever so much.I looked and looked but couldn't find an old one anywhere. So I got a deal on the PS3 Slim or better yet the PS3 economy.This system is so cheap and watered down compared to the original PS3 it's a shame. I actually waited for the price to drop because I never felt it was worth what Sony was originally asking for it. No touch sensitive power and eject buttons(I really liked that feature), no fancy gloss piano black coat, No embossed silver PlayStation lettering, or even the nice silver paint job around the entry bay.There's a reason if you can find the old ones they still go for so much and it's not because of the backwards compatibility either. They just look better and offer more features.The PS3 Slim is a flop but if you want to play PS3 games you have no choice. I admit I only purchased a PS3 because I've always been a fan of PlayStation's library of games but with the Xbox 360 game makers are mirroring their releases so aside from the few console exclusives it really does boil down to preference as essentially you can find 90% of the games available today on either console. The new looks of the Xbox360 have improved quite a bit from the bland looks of the original but Sony took the opposite idea and made their beautiful system look bland.Right now my Ps3 and Ps2 sit side by side in my game room and honestly the PS2 looks more note worthy in looks. So it only does everything but not as much as it used to be able to do.So just what are the benefits of the slim? Yeah, the hard drive is bigger, and that is it's only redeeming quality. Everything else has been trimmed down. Now it's just a cheap plastic case with plastic non touch sensitive buttons, limited access ports, and no backwards compatibility. It looks exactly as how it is, Sony needed to cut costs so they made a cheap version of their console and here it is.The sad part is that the new version cut out a lot of the features the older version had so it's an inferior system to its predecessor. What's the main difference with the slim? It's smaller, and it's lighter and it saves power I guess? Yes,3 key features no one ever cared about to begin with.Oh well that's all I really have to say about this model, that and that my Panasonic VCR I brought in 1992 has a better looking design.Just what was Sony thinking?","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2011"}

This is a great game, it has all the mob feeling you need, the proper story to back it up, and most of all the intense gameplay. Mafia 1 was outstanding and way ahead of it's time in my opinion, although it was last generation. They did a great job keeping it on the same track and not making it like a 'GTA' game, this is a Mafia game. How the story progresses throughout the game is simply amazing. The length of the game is just right, not too short, not too long and on going. Although this game is pretty 'open-world', it is pretty linear all together. Meaning, you cannot go into all the stores, you have limited side quest, you have to stick to the story most of the time to progress in the game.Graphics : 9/10, one of the best looking games of this generation. The feel of the cars getting smashed, the seasons changing around you, dusk/dawn, it's breath taking.Story : 9/10, a true masterpiece of a game, it's hard to not like the story if you are into mob games. Plain and simple.Mechanics : 10/10, From shooting mechanics, to car controls, this game is spot on and excels in every category.At this price range of &lt;25, with getting all the DLC and everything with it.

Hoover \"chicagojosh\"","summary":"Solid Mixed Bag","reviewText":"Yes, commercials and \"sneak peaks\" are supposed to hype a game up to the point where we all turn into zombies and line up for hours in mindless anticipation for hours upon hours of entertainment.Unfortunately, the buildup to this game, well, seemed to have left some details out.The Good:Nice control scheme and sandbox style play. It didn't take too much time to realize exactly what your character is capable of and start truly utilizing the environment to your advantage. As the beginning tutorial starts to play out, I started to wonder if I would be able to retain all of the controls they were throwing at me, but the controls are actually quite intuitive.You can't button mash your way to victory, even if you blaze head-on into a fight. This forces you to stay on your toes, instead of just hitting 'X' and hoping for the best.The main character is the only one sporting an American accent. Knowing there is some sort of explanation (see below,) makes it alright. The voice acting is good by video game standards. The camera is controlled with the right stick, but the more methodical gameplay makes it much more bearable than in, say, 'Stranglehold.'The Bad:I don't think this is a spoiler, since it's the first thing that happens in the game (if anything, it really should have been talked about more by the developers.) Anyway, the developers decided to use make the Crusades part of the game some sort of \"genetic memory\" thing that is being extracted by scientists in the modern day. This feels 100% forced and completely unneeded. The only explanation I can think of, is that one team had created this awesome digital effect for locking on, while another dev team had created this great story about assassins during The Crusades. The producer came along and said \"great! Now make up some reason to get that effect into that game.\"While the controls are extremely intuitive, there are still times where they do something which makes no sense. It's extremely frustrating to almost be free of pursuing soldiers just to have your character do a wall jump instead of climbing onto a ledge like you had planned. Also, armor clad soldiers with drawn swords outrunning a highly trained assassin? I don't think so.All in all, I'm not upset I bought this game. I don't consider it a huge disappointment, but at the same time the problems the game has are large and glaring.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"SnS \"&#34;Those are my principles and if you ...","summary":"Near Gaming Perfection","reviewText":"Dragon Age has been out for about two months now.  I have been playing that long.  Not that really anyone cares how long I have been playing, but let that tell you at least one thing.  This game is AMAZING.First off, I would like to address the issues some are talking about the graphics.  WHAT ISSUES?  Sure this game may not be necessarily cutting edge, FFXIII graphics, but they are pretty impressive graphics nonetheless.  Facial expresions are pretty darn good and the lip-syncing is some of the best I have seen in a game.  The vistas are great and expansive and the architecture is impressive by any measure.Secondly, the gameplay itself.  It does require some \"getting-to-know-you\" time.  Prepare for menu after menu, learning what works and what doesn't, and for some of the harder fights (looking at YOU Archdemon) getting to understand the tactics assigning.  However, once you get the hang of it, it is pretty straightforward and very immersive.Thirdly, the attention to detail in this game is VERY impressive.  Sure, the relationship bar thing that lets you get in to serious relationships with some of the party characters is great albeit not unique.  But, I am talking about nuances.  Your party talks among themselves in downtime making for some very entertaining moments even when battles are not erupting.  The slightest things sometimes lead to greater moments.  Being a jerk to one person can affect whether or not a quest presents itself later.  The conversation tree is massive and some things your character can say are absolutely hilarious.  That is my point, there are so many fantastic ideas and details merged in to one grand game with a TON of replayability.  The characters each have their own personality and motivations.  Some are endearing, some are not, but all are memorable and play a crucial role in a wonderfully written story that is fantasy fiction at its best.The soundtrack is pretty darn good.  While I consider it to be the weak link, it is by no means bad.I literally have 5 games now going at once after my initial playthrough.  I have characters ranging from my evil mage to a Boy Scout of a rogue.  Each game has been different with different dialogue presenting itself as my characters' decisions play out.  Even though the game has six origins, the nuances YOU can create within those six can be massive, with gender even playing into how the origin stories play out.  Which does bring me to the biggest flaw of the game.  Because I have so many save files for different characters, the initial load up is a bit slow, but honestly if it was that bad, I would have erased some by now.It you fancy yourself a role player, action player, a gamer at all this game should be picked up immediately.  Bioware has seriously hit paydirt with this game and I can't wait for the next installment.  (I might also add that, as of this review, there are three DLCs two out and one out soon; adding a decent chunk more to the game itself including another playable character for your party.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2010"}

Once the novelty of the microphone wore off so did his interest in the workshop.I did not think the painting was set up very well. You use your voice to splatter the paint but where it goes depends solely on this randomly moving snail. Not sure what it is supposed to be teaching.... The reading, both graphics and narration, is tediously done. The voice changing options were irrelevent since the microphone does not come out very clear. It is very hard to distinguish your voice in the distortion. Same with the sing alongs.Also if your kids are already playing more complex video games (as mine are) they will be bored to tears with the slow pace of this one. If they are just starting to be introduced to them maybe it would be okay.

It feels solid, they're comfy in the hands and worth the cash in the end.However 3 years later and the controllers are showing signs of wearing out far earlier than the box of controllers I have.Pros:Feel good in the hands, buttons feel responsive, can plug it in OR remove the batteries if you want to slap in a fresh set, works well for most games.  And my favorite part, it hooks up to both the 360 and PC, and lots of games happen to know what controller it is when you hook it up. Even works wirelessly (need an adapter for that)Cons:The analog sticks seem to get lose with age and in 2/3 cases are so loose when left idle (not being moved) characters will start walking in a direction. Given how much more expensive controllers have gotten over the years I'm not sure I'm alright with this but the controllers are still good in some most regards.Right out of the box this is one of the worst D-pads I've ever used, it's slippery and doesn't always register the right direction, I'd never use this for a platformer as it can barely handle changing weaponsOverall:I do like the controller for 3rd person shooters/racing games/action adventure games (devil may cry, kingdom of amalur), but over the years other controllers have outlasted this thing by a long shot, my NES, Genesis, Saturn, Playstation, Playstation 2, Gamecube controllers all work perfect after years of use/abuse. 2/3 of these units after just 4 years of use have shown far far far more wear, it'd be fine if those older controllers weren't significantly cheaper at the time and now.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2012"}

Supporting up to 256 players at once, MAG is an online only FPS boasting some heavy action and well designed battle fields, but when compared to the mega popular Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2, MAG is an FPS that isn't for everybody.  While the game pulls no punches in terms of its violence and bloodletting, the name of the game with MAG is teamwork.  Team coordination is an essential element to MAG, as well as tactical thinking as well, which makes the game all the more worthwhile.  While the action itself is spectacular and there is a nice array of weaponry to put to use, MAG isn't without its share of problems.  There are a number of connectivity issues that definitely are in need of improvement, and the scaled back graphics engine is noticable as well.  Flaws aside though, MAG still delivers its promise of 256 multiplayer action, and it delivers it well enough to warrant players to keep coming back.  All in all, if you own a PS3, you should definitely by all means give MAG a look at the very least.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt. Olympus.God of War'sEpic Gameplay Comes to the PSPPlayStation Portable has always been head and shoulders above its competitors in the handheld market when it comes to processing power, and inGod of War: Chains of Olympusthe PSP platform may just have reached its highest level to date.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists.

I've just been burned too many times by mediocre games or even solid games with mediocre gameplay to actually purchase a whole lot of stuff on the market.  So I rent.I knew about 15 minutes into Borderlands that this was a buy.  There was no turning back, this game was going to consume many, many hours of my life (or lack thereof).  Simply put, this is one of the best-balanced, best thought-out, best graphic (for its type), best sound/music snarkily humorous overall games I've ever played.A lot of time and thought clearly went into Borderlands, and the gameplay, graphics, loading-times, sounds, enemies, guns (!!!), and rewards system are almost peerless.  Borderlands makes you want to come back, time and time again, to get that better sniper, to get that better shield, to up your experience to improve your skill...it has such drawing power, and as I found out, replay value.  Once you are of a high level, running around and spanking previously insurmountable enemies with ease.  The DLC thats been put out so far extends an already beloved game, doing what DLC should do: take a game you love and crave more of and...give you more!I can't even begin to say enough about the pop-culture references this game digs up.  Suffice to say, if you are a pop-culture geek, you will go into a geektastic shock when you fight enemies like Hanz & Franz, play missions like \"Scheming That Sabotage\", hear references to the old-school videogame Gauntlet, movie quotes, and even two great soundtrack songs from indie-greats Cage the Elephant and DJ Champion.  These developers either grew up embracing pop-culture, or certainly did their homework.This is a remarkable game, and I think one of the best I've played on this generation of game platform.

At times though, this teacher can be a little cruel by pulling out the odd trick question or two on a subject you've never studied.I would consider this to be a study aid vs. an actual game.The first warning bell went off after opening the game, the actual manual was roughly 2 pages, with all of the standard warnings and support information. Also included was a large fold-out instruction manual explaining how to properly set up your PS3 and makes the case that the game is optimized for those with an external sound system.  I do not own a surround sound system and I don't mind HDMI a/v. I like the one cable solution. In the case of Rocksmith, processing both audio and video through the same cable creates video lag, which can lead to notes not triggering correctly.I used a simple Ibanez Gio electric guitar (the type that comes with the starter packages found at most musical instrument stores). This is great because it shows you don't have to break the bank and buy a very expensive electric guitar to play.The game has a nice selection of music ranging from the classics to current favorites, and does a good job of transposing these songs to the game for a proper \"feel\". The downside is that the game introduces different playing techniques during playback and doesn't explain what the icons are until after the song is finished. During a song by The Black Keys, the game introduces hammer-ons and pull-offs and then didn't explain what they were until after the song was over. During Red Hot Chili Pepper's rendition of Stevie Wonders' Higher ground, the game introduced Palm Muting, but again didn't explain what the icons were until the song was over. This lack of information will make it hard to play the songs properly the first time around. Which leads to a lot of backtracking over the material, but then again, practice does make perfect but I found it more tedious and got sick of the available songs very quickly this way.Overall, it's not a bad package and a good way to dip your toe into the world of guitar playing. I would try this before signing up for real lessons, but nothing will replace a real teacher. For someone like me who has been playing guitar for a number of years, it's a fun little trainer to keep my technique up. The added modes that allow you to mess with the amp selection and effects pedals are fun. It actually helps me figure out a sound before I go to the music shop to buy a specific effect pedal.3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2012"}

No. But it's sure a helluva lot of fun and it has really raised the bar another notch. In my opinion, the graphics are up there with the best (CoD4, Ghost Recon: AWF, and Assassin's Creed). The character development is the best ever, you really start to like these guys. The dialogue is natural and funny, not the usual 'try too hard to be funny and fail', but an easy, believable funny. I've played it from start to finish in every imaginable angle of attack (even running down as many enemy soldiers with vehicles as possible) and I can't get enough. The vehicles handle easily and naturally (not like HAZE where it seems your always driving with the brake on), you can view through the drivers window and listen to one of three radio stations or go 3p. Each vehicle has it's unique handling characteristics and sound as does each weapon type. And on top of it all, the story line is unique and fun. Believable? As good as anything else out there. And, while the AI has some repetitive factors on the replay, like gun positions and tank locations and certain attack lines, there is also a lot of variation that keeps it interesting.WOULD LIKE TO SEE: some real stealth segments and some bad weather and night time ops.Personally, I don't think there's anything in the genre that is better, on a par maybe, but not significantly better.For those of you that can only find fault, all I can say is, \"If you can do better, do it.

David Swan","summary":"New Chassis, Same Engine","reviewText":"If you're itching for a Pokemon revolution prepare to keep waiting because this game isn't it. You wake up in your upstairs bedroom and leave the house after talking to mom before getting the chance to choose your initial Pokemon among a group that includes a water Pokemon, a fire Pokemon, and a grass Pokemon.  Pokemon works because it combines two things old school games love, collecting and leveling up but the game mechanics have barely changed in the 17 years of the franchises existence and they aren't changing here. The cities are light years ahead of the cities in previous games but they certainly aren't pushing the 3DS to its limits. The cities still have a lifeless quality to them with a sparse population of single phrase people who either stand immobile for eternity or move in a short pattern.It feels like Nintendo has backed itself into a corner and I saw this coming years ago. The game mechanics are so intertwined with the series that Nintendo seems terrified to change it. Even little things such as hunting for Pokemon in tall grass reappears in iteration after iteration. I have this suspicion that part of the problem is the very nature of Pokemon. There are now close to 700 and these creatures do not cycle out. It is an ever increasing number and with each new game the developers need to create new models and animation not just for the new ones but for the entire list. I have to wonder if the sheer magnitude of creating models and animation for all these Pokemon isn't draining away the time that could be spent on creating a real living world of human characters.I have to confess that this game was the fastest I ever got bored playing a Pokemon game.  It's still a great concept even with all the wrinkles and crows feet and I'm going to give it four stars but it seriously needs a change. I do believe it's possible to maintain the purity of the franchise without slavishly cloning the game with each iteration. The game might be more entertaining for newer players who haven't seen the same basic game for nearly two decades.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon is INCREDIBLE","reviewText":"Pokemon has been a regular staple in gaming for quite a long time now.  And while this is not news to anyone, the way in the which the games have been slowly evolving actually has been.  Pokemon X and Y is quite possibly the strongest game in the series in quite some time.  This time around the developers have really gone all out.  It's incredible no matter how you slice it.  If you are a Pokemon fan, X and Y is worth trying.Pokemon has had quite a consistent formula for a long time.  Nothing really changes here.  Though there is actually a bit more of a story than what has been in earlier variations of the game, the basic frame work is still pretty much the same.  You'll pick a Pokemon at the start (always between Grass, Fire and Water) and set out on your journey to catch as many Pokemon as you can, as well as to set out to find all the gyms.  The pacing of the game is rather slow at times, but this isn't really that big of a deal.  Because of how big X and Y is there's not a lot of downtime.  You'll find that in many places there is always something to do.  You'll choose either a boy or a girl, but you'll find even your player character can be customized.  You can give him or her a nickname, change their clothes and even do things that are leisurely to them as opposed to just your Pokemon.  As such, despite sticking to a lot of tried and true conventions, the world of Pokemon X and Y is most definitely bursting with life and energy.  The characters you meet might be a little annoying, and the writing and dialog are pretty bad... but Pokemon has never exactly been known for its writing to begin with.  The only part about it that may erk returning players, is how long it really takes to get going.  Everything about the introduction you've seen before.  You've been through choosing a starter before.  You know how to catch Pokemon.  There are a lot of things you won't need to be reminded of, but for the sake of new players you'll have to sit through a lot of these tutorials anyway.  The good news is it doesn't last too long.  The game will cut you from the tutorials earlier than expected, but it still takes some time before you really jump into the heart of the quest.Though there is a lot of awesome additions here, the core structure of the experience is pretty much the same.  You'll catch Pokemon out in the wild and add them to your roster.  You'll battle trainers who wish to challenge you.  You'll still go around collecting those gym badges.  Pokemon are in the tall grass as you'd expect.  There aren't too many additions to the core experience.  You can do things such as ride a Pokemon around in the wild and that's not so bad at all.  You can also build your compatibility with your Pokemon by giving them some much needed attention by petting them or just giving them attention.  You area also able to do some specific training to raise specific stats by playing certain mini games with your Pokemon.  It's pretty simple stuff.  It doesn't make too much of a difference in the long run, but they're still additions.Battling is exactly as it always has been.  Pokemon has always had a rock/paper/scissors element to the battle system.  It's what makes it so strategic and what makes it so that you can't simply power through everything with just one Pokemon.  For instance, grass type attacks are strong against water type Pokemon, but grass is also weak toward fire.  You can carry up to six Pokemon in your roster at a time and you'll always be allowed to switch between them in battle if need be.  You'll want to train all of your Pokemon and keep a good variety.  Because there are so many to collect and battle, however, it's pretty important to realize that there is no &#34;best&#34; team.  Anyone can build a team to their liking.  You'll appreciate a lot of the new creatures and grow attached to particular favorites.  It's a simple battle system, but it's surprisingly addictive.  The random encounter rate when walking through tall grass is a little high, but it's not really a bother for seasoned veterans.  And like in previous versions it can be easy to be drained from fighting too many trainers that you simply can't avoid.  Again, not much of a problem for a seasoned veteran, but sometimes when you don't feel like battling trainers and there's no way around them... it can feel like they're just a speed bump in the way of getting through a dungeon or a route.The Mega evolution concept sounded great on paper, but it's not quite as amazing as it sounds in practice.  Yes, it's pretty cool to see some of the Mega Evolutions, but it doesn't last that long.  Certain Pokemon can get one evolution higher, but it's only really a temporary boost.  It's nothing permanent and you can only use it once per battle.  There's nothing wrong with the concept, but it's only really a temporary boost.  And after a while you'll find you don't really need it in battle.  Pokemon X and Y is not exactly a difficult game.  You'll level up a lot faster here than you do in other installments.  Though I'd never describe Pokemon as a difficult game, this particular incarnation seems to have really dipped in the difficulty.  Most battles (even with gym leaders) are not too taxing, even if you go in unprepared.  The game requires less grinding to get yourself prepared for any challenge and even should the worst befall you, the punishment isn't very severe at all.Graphically, Pokemon X and Y has had quite the overhaul.  Before Pokemon has never really struck me on a technical level.  The gameplay has always been what kept it so fun and kept me coming back.  The graphics were usually not quite as good as what the platform was capable of producing.  This is not the case with X and Y.  The game is absolutely gorgeous with some good looking character models and some very detailed locales.  Pokemon X and Y isn't the best looking 3DS game out there, but it is most definitely a looker.  It's got fully detailed models and characters.  It has a nice distinct cartoony like look that is just perfect for Pokemon.  It's a charming aesthetic look at.  The fact that the game is so huge makes just how GOOD it looks that much more impressive.  It doesn't feel like anything was sacrificed to make the huge world in which you're playing in.  But nothing looks quite as amazing as the battle.  Though the environments and backgrounds themselves are not quite as detailed, they're still nice.  But what really shines here, is looking at your Pokemon in battle.  No longer are they merely flinching to attack.  Rather they have full movement in battle.  It's nice to see a flying Pokemon actually flapping its wings.  And though no attack really &#34;connects&#34; (you won't see Fennekin actually scratch a Pokemon, for instance) you will see some pretty nice looking animations.  In the past Pokemon hasn't really been a looker (and it didn't exactly need to be) but here it's quite nice to see a lot of care and devotion taken to the games presentation.  Particularly with the Pokemon and even with your character model.  You can change their clothes and accessories and really personalize it.  From a presentation standpoint, Pokemon X and Y looks absolutely amazing.The music is also just as good.  It's very energetic and catchy.  Just as most Pokemon tunes have always been.  There are times when the sound effects still sound a little dated, but again, as with most things here... it's not that big of a deal.  The battle themes, in particular, are really catchy.The multiplayer has been given a lot of treatment, however.  It's a lot easier to keep track of friends as the game will tell you when they're online.  Likewise, the game will track other players nearby.  This interface is intuitive and very easy to use.  It's also easy to set up trades and battles this way.In the long run, Pokemon X and Y really isn't all that different from its counterparts.  It still has the same basic formula at play.  However, some of the gameplay tweaks help it stand out.  The additions and improvements are noticeable and enough to warrant a look for any fan.  More than that, a lot of the gameplay is still really good.  Some of it has been refined.  The game may be easier than its counter parts, and the characters you come across quite bland and generic, but these are minor flaws when compared to the addictive gameplay.  Pokemon X and Y is a gem.  A game that deserves a look.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2013"}
