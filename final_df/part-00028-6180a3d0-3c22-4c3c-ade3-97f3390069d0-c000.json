Where's the franchise? What happen to the graphics? They said that this game was going to better than the last one. WTF i bought this game!! Everybody is getting so i didnt want to be left out. Plus, they have updated teams. The graphics are terrible. They are like Madden 09 or around there. I rather play Madden 11 or 12 than playing this shit. The tackles are terrible. I can't even explain but it looks like they are some glitches. When my player gets tackle, his body like dis forms and goes to different directions. The sound was okay to hear and the commentators were little better than the last madden. The kicking suck like butthole.. Watching a real life game, you can see the ball travel straight to the air and going towards the goal. The ball's height got be like 30-40 feet high. In the game is like 10-20 feet. No power, no strength, and no distance between the kicker and the goal. Its like 40 yards out and everytime i kick the ball, it lands before the endzone. Just terrible!!!!!!!! I dont even know i want to keep this game. I can see other reviews with bad ratings. I completely agree with them. This year was suppose to be the year to have incredible games. NCAA Football 2013 was trash and along with this game. EA Sports needs to find good ass people who can create the game and the way it was suppose to be created. This game is no where near to be nominate for the best sport game of the year. Just bad! I wish i can flick off everybody in EA Sports gaming facility for a bad job they did. Lost 60 dollars for trash lol.Graphics- 4/10Commentators - 8/10Gameplay- 6/10Sound- 8/10Features- 7/10 (no franchise mode)Controls - 7/10Kicking- 2/10","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2012"}

I got it as soon as it came out with no hesitation. But, I was disappointed. This game has better graphics, more crops and animals, you can eventually make hybrids, there are new recipes, and you can dig in the ruins. That's cool. But, other than that, it's not really better. In fact, it's worse in some other aspects. The music really got to me, and I don't have the stuff needed to go to the other town (a GBA, a link cable, and Harvest Moon: Friends of Mineral Town), so I don't have much variety. Every time I started up the game I dreaded hearing Breeze or Winter. The wife and kid got pretty boring, too. The same 3 phrases, day in, day out. And the fact that the cows have to be impregnated yearly to keep producing milk can become a problem because, a baby per year per cow won't leave much room. And it costs money, and it takes so long for the baby to come and the cow to produce milk again. And the ducks still aren't doing anything except eating up my food after a few months. Also, the graphics are pretty good, but they aren't amazing. Of course they have to be decent on a GameCube, unless they try to make it crappy. And finally, there are really no holidays. I mean, you can go to the New Years party and see people have little symbols pop over their heads, but that wasn't even fun the first time. They're all pretty much the same. In previous games, there were holidays like the chicken fight, which was a mini-game, and thanksgiving, where girls give you chocolate. This is better than Save the Homeland, which I also really looked forward to, but it's not as good as Back to Nature. You just don't really have much to look forward to except at first marriage and then things like a new cow growing up. I got quite bored. If they had taken extra time to add variety and real holidays, this would be a great game. But no, all I can say is try renting it for a week or so. If it starts to get boring, it won't probably won't get better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2004"}

However, as the program's equally secretive decision-makers demanded this technology be adapted for military applications, Krone's feelings of self-entitlement and anger grew.  He secretly desired a new existence, a new world where his scientific endeavors could be shaped and experienced without outside interference.The combination of Krone's mind and his suit technology gave him the ability to create and control another existence - an existence where a man of science could finally operate without restrictions and do so within a place where science itself was properly respected&#133; regardless of the effects on humanity.It is now up to you to trace Krone's last known appearances and stop his tyrannical rule over Alpha District.

You can SLOW, REVERSE, and STOP time. You have to use your timeshift abilities in order to progress through certain parts of the game, usually a simple puzzle here and there.This game was a challenge even on easiest mode. I died many times. And had to stop and think about how to use the timeshift ability to get past certain parts (reminded me of Portal). You can only hold 3 guns at a time along with grenades, and melee attack. You don't need medkits in this game, your suit will regenerate itself (similar to Crysis). There are ammo caches scattered through-out the maps, which will fully reload all your weapons, which is nice. You can drive in 4-wheeler ATVs and control turret-mini-guns at certain points of the game. There is also a radar, which tells you where to go, so you stay on track which is nice.Graphics look really good.Concerning gore and realistic violence, it is okay. You can't really blow people's heads off or do cool headshots. You can gib and explode enemies but only with the RPG and higher-end explosive weapons. Each weapon has an alternate fire. There is a hellfire/flamethrower weapon, however the bodies don't cremate or turn to ashes, they kind of just light on fire and fall to the ground.

{"product_name":"B00004SVXG","description":"NES Game","reviewerName":"Jarrett P. Suhr \"naraku junior\"","summary":"A fun game","reviewText":"Here are the statsic for the first two boss if you due gutsman  and cut man. It will take about 14 hits to take out cut man if you due not use his weakness bomb man ability and for cut man you can take him out with only two hits throw the two boulder atr him each one should take away half his vital if he does not dodge them he also may  have a second weakness against fire man but it maye not be as effective and may take more hits. Guts man it takes about 21 hit to to defeat this or any robot master if you don't fight the master with his his weakness first which is bomb manFor guts manCut man can be defeated with two hits of a boulderActually if you have this one game cube and are very lasy enough they actually have a cheat  on the action replay for megamans I belive 1-4 that automatically starts you off at the doctor willy stages which are ridiculous short in the first game compared to it's 7 proccessors.I will now list a total estimate endurnace for the remain bosses because it varies depending on the order the fought them the first time if you now which ability does the most damage. They had two cartoon series for this but both have been of the air for a while the megaman battle network cartoon shown megaman NT warrior was discontinue back in middle of 2004 or 2003 I belive due to lack of interest or something like that.Here is the estimated esitance strength for all boss starting at electric man the first time and there weakness.Boss 3Eletric man  has 1/3 resitance against cut mans ability.Boss 4Ice man has 1/3 resitance against electirc mans electric blast ability.Boss 5Fire man ironically has  1/5 resitnace to ice mans ability I guess it makes since because it frozen water ignore the pokemon rulesBoss 6Bomb man  is apparently weak against fire mans ability  he only has a 1/7 resitance against it which makes him the toughest boss in the game some far endurance wise excluding doctor willy if you use the proper weakness re use these same powers at the end when you refight the robot master.Megaman triva factThis game only has 6 but starting in number two there were eight robot master per game after the second installement on. The last two games  where done on either on Sega Gensis, or one  of the other two sega system  because nes had been stopped make them in nes format after number six do to a lose of interest and a demand for better computer graphics or something like that. There was a cartoon series based off this did very well in season one and two but did very poorly in final season the one episode they did they acting or something was so bad that after that one episode for the third season the so was discontinue. They have two dvds sets of this cartoon show for sale that are about three disk each have about maybe 2 hours of episode on each disk. I rented one of them from blockbuster a long time ago I austin when they were still half VHS back in the middle of 2003 or earlt 2004 I belive it was. I only watched it once because of the long running time the late fee policy had not been abolished yet I remember correctly.Wily stage bossesThe original yellow devil made out of clay not the slime version from number Mega Man 7 or Megman 8.  7  elctric mans ability shot in the eye will take it out. It only has one attack be glade this was before power figther games came out in Japan when it could turned into a sphere shape and shot laser at you and split up into three devils and regain some of its health when the convere back into one depending one which game you were playing.A single mega man holgram not three like in megaman 2 or 3 and the games  after them.This boss does not have a precise weakness will minc you use what ever power you use against you the real megaman this player took him out with 14 of fire man hits will doging some of  holligram megaman fire man like sonic boom shaped attacks.You also have to fight all the main robot master over but I think he cheats a little he takes cut man out with 10 single shot attacks I belive it's supposed two take 15 to 21 single shot to defeat a robot  master or special boss  or at least that main in the other games I have played.The one eyed robot with the bubble shield around it can be defeated by combine rapid fire which guts mans ability about 14 hits maye more or less of the two cobine will take it out.Doctor willy fightYou only fight will once in this gameTakes about sixteen total hits from fire man and cut man combined that what this player did For the first half use first man then switch to cut man the second half when you hit the gem in the center which is hard but possible the fire attacks are only about half as effective as the cut man attacks are.I will do facts and statics for mega man X and Megaman three later in about a 1 hour twenty minutes or around 11:30 AM.This was a smash hit back in the mid eigites when it came out. this is done with out the cheats on Here are some tips on how to beat this game on Megaman collection in gamecube format with cheats. Put in your actionb replay and put on all the codes except the one that automatically takes you to doctor willy stages. It took me about  30 to 2 hours to beat this due to  a few occasional deaths due to miss time jumps and falling in the voids areas with the fly megaman cheats and accidentall touch spikes a few  times by hover up to high and fast. Doctot will has a strong combine resistance  from both parts of the fight of about 30 to 50 if all six robot master abilitys and your normal blaster shout are used depending on the combination you used them in. To lower willy rsitance in the second part of the final battle avoid using ice mans and bomb mans and gut's mans ability since the saucer defense strength is to strong against them and there are no bricks for you to pick up and throw. So I recommend you use a combination of normal shoot combination electric man, cut man, and flame mans attack to cut the resitance damge  to about 1/10 to 2/3  the percent estimate of above. I will be send the boss data for all the other megaman games on here except legends and mega X I am currently checking for a megaman 2 speed run I now there is one for seven or 8. I found a speed run but it was for the japanese version here is and estimated of the total boss damge resitance  for the japanese. The 22 bosses include the robot master remathc had about a combine total  damage resitance of 173% due to a differcne in weakness and more frequent uses of the weaker and less sucesfull normal shout and rapid shooit abilities and the glitche such as beinng able to walk through walks and sometimes move at faster speed which were taking out of the us edited version.  If you want to beat this gamer in about 26 in the american format other than practice doging and time alot use the weaknes  listed on the megaman main web page under the hints for megaman. I copy the exact weaknes s but can't paste then. Got go my room called I got to ghome and pick up a relation ship quiz and do some alst minute cleaning up the apartment.  I have use on thing to say hey Willy Say Heloo to  robotic friend!  Here are the mega man three boss statis for total combine damage resitance of proton man and magnet the first time have a combine damge resistance of about 28% against the rapid fire attack that mena s each indivudalseperate shoot fire in chain of three takes away about 3.7% of the max damage. After Mega man three in the middle of Megman 4 or 5 near the final. Protoman who was aparetnylu had substained some damage while he was being created before rock anhd roll our porject the doctor against willy and temperaly went out of control willy used him he eventually got repaired and freed profffesor casrtocks daugter and the end of megaman 4 and 5  she appaears after you deplete  cause version of saucer health bar. You do fight protoman against some time inbetween 6 and 8 but it's a special secret boss battle that only occurs if you do certaain tasks in specified booss strength he is blastically test your up graded system since you got the more powerful mega buster that comes out in the middle of megaman 3 or four when willy Robot's attack stamina size and speed and endurance increases if you don'ty have there weakeness.  Here is the new boss weakness for next protman fight he has a damage resitance of 24% or the equivlent of 8 mulit shoot rapid fire attacks which shoot out three bullets at a time compared to one single  and does double to triple the damagae since Protman does not have and e4xact weakness this is the best techinque for counter him.  Doged a t least ten percent of his blast and the next robot master or more you should making it trhow this leavel with health. Higly Recommend getting this on the megaman anniversayry with the new features like automatic save after the defeat of ever robot master or some sub bosses to make it less complicated.  Here is the quicvk way to defeat Hard many he ha 1/7 defense resitance some magnet mans ability does a masive amount of damage about 14 to 15 percet damge each time  it hits. Heres how to defeat top man with eassy mail him with three of hard mands projectile fist attack and he is gone for now until the finally of the game.  For shadow many four hits of top mans attack will do him in. He goes down. I'm afraid I'm  afraid your going to have to wait unti some time tommorow between 7 am 4:00 PM to get the rest of the boss statisic because the staff member at the program does not think this is a wise use of study hall. He wants me to bring my realtions ships book her when the next test isn't probably for anothe like 15 days or something like that the topic I consider controversal. I see you tommorow gamers. Unless the staff member goes off due before this study hall ends around 8:00 PM. Go foward and defeat evil may the buster be wity you. I am back sorry about the delay here is the quickest way to beat spark man next to using the drain health with X button cheat if play the Gamecube format with cheats on. Spark Man has and extremly low damage rsitance strength of 1/7 orr lose about 14 percent of his health each time he is hit with shadow man's weapon ability. Hit him seven times and he goes down. The same startegy for the main robot masters I am listting now will probably also work again at the finally when you rechallange them again at the end of the game. The next guy beats snake man with shadow many weapons which it has a  super high damge resitance at 1/15 mean each blade that hits only does about little more than  6 percent damge per hit 6.6 per5cent about if you want to be that precise. But I think he could have taken down sooner I'm not sure if this player used the right weakness. I am fast foward through the  bits ofg normal enemy fights this to get this complete sonner. I belive when the games started get even longer than in the first two installments longer that pluse. I think is when they have additional extra robot master in this game before willy called Doc Robot or he is Megman 4 5 or 6 you have to fight him twice in four stage he use the powers and the forms of previous robot masters from previous game.  The next boss is Gemi man who;s weakness I know from watching my roomate at my last college program play this game at leats thrice pluse. If this kid use the right weakness mhe should defeat him quickly.  I have the status  I ma compele of minutes. I think this player just skip a protman boss fight somehow. Thi s player was experiend he used gemini mans ultra weakness. Gemmin man has a resitance  damge strenght of only 1/5 to the search snake hit him with five  of snake mans attack at 20% damage each he is gone until the final.  To victor goes the supplies or his power to me more precise. It time for the final boss fight with a robot master from this man needle man I belive his summer weakness is the gemini laser from playing this at least three times and watching my roomate play it I am 95% positive.  This guy took him down with three hits. I don't think he used Gemin man I belive he used needle mans or weakness top man. Top many is super deaddly he ahs a mear 1/3 damage so three hits of 33% will take hin down for know I belive gemi laser has about the same damage sligtly weaker. I think I don't got top man's weakness. But I don't know both of top mans weakness  which I some how neglected to record. But top man is very unusally. He has a super low resitance to his own ability three blows from his own attack will do him in but use shadow  mna or gemi or the rapid fire if your with out a cheat on thatr automatically gives you all the weapons for the first bat5tle. Next I belive are the mfour annoying doc robot stages where you must fight him two0 times per stage. Yes I was right this is the one game that this annoying master known as doc man is. Here are the doc robot stsatics. For the first doc robot fight if you are due the  stages in this order his super weakness for the first battle is magnet mans attack which he has 1/8 resitance agin. That means each time you hit you do a massive 12 to 14damage each set of 2 to four magnets.  Eight hits he he goes down its on to the second battle for this stage statics.  The next boss fight will be quick man or are replica of him hit him with 7 snake man abilities these will do slight more damge about about 13 to 15 percent damge per hit and he goes down. The next fight wight doct robot with bubble man inside 7 hits of about 13 to 15 percent damage if you I belive the shadow man weapon will mtake him down he was attack really fast but I belive that was what he was using.  Hit him with 9  of needle mans three projectiles acts and he goes down. PS he is using wood man who has the same annoying barrier ability of plan man and skull man. So wait until a break min the leaf bare then fire out it will  do now damge when it connects. For doc man with flame inside hit him with dust mans attack but expect to lose 98% of your health due to the super close range that is need  for this attack to work successfull. If you have a e try to use it to avoid dying especially if its the original nes version. For the next doc mans stage with air man has 1/9 damage resitance hit it with 9 attacks from spark man's ability and it goes.  For crash mh and doct robot he has 1/4 resitance against fglash man hit him four time quickly and he goes down with out you die or minal damage to your health bar. Know we have one really annoying battle before the willy and robot master refight and the other willy  stage break man.  High hit with about eight rapid fire attacks and he retreat then. You will learn about dark willy betrayal in a cut scene. To beat the hover robot in the water filled room hit his turtle minions and destroy them shade mans does the most damge per turtel opr set of turtle s robots destroyed repeat this attack pattern 5 times this boss goes down. To the next stage you are reunited with a famous boss for megaman 1. The giant  yellow cylopse monster now as the yellow devil for this newer slight better still clay version hit it in the eight with 7 of hard mans attacks and it goes down. Next stage I have and appoint in 35 minutes I will make the rest of this really speedy. The next boss I hologram megam one willt take damge. This kid found it took out is hole health bar with one seacrh snake I dont think that I possible the two hit kills were supposed to go away after number 2 I thought well. Any way use snake man on the holgrams detrmine which one takes damage and take it out they will switch places beteen the free platform areas. Were donwn to the final 10 fights ten eighr robot master and the two will fight with and with out game and only nine minutes left will credits. So I will give you a total resitance because these enemies are going to go down at light speed. the remain totals boss including willy should have total combine damage resitance should be defeated with a total of 75 hits. The end seqeunces  play basically the roof collapse on you and you wake up back at doctor lights lab your here a wistle and doctor light assume protoman megaman protype or brother as he is refered to in the cartoon series. You have just defeated megaman three.  If you curse if while alwqays gets away he is eventually captured at the end of megaman 6 this is a spiler so do read this if you haven't played the games after this but escape because he had built eight other robots  a few games prior to this that were designed to seek out while if they were not activated or senses his presence after a six month period. Congralutaion you just beat the third installment of megaman if you followed these tips. Now go foward and fight evil. I will send megaman four statics next or what ever game I can find in the series that I have not laready posted boss statics for yet. I aready have statics four megam X- 3 and megamn 7 and 8 and megaman legend I can find a speed run of for. So I have to do my own at home and type of the data because I don't have a youtube acoount or and emulator program on my labtop and the internet is being real slow to reconnect due to being tampered with. So I will start megaman 4 speed run at home which I will type up the status and bring them in and type them in by hand later. They have and X speed run but I am supposed to have a meeting with my mentor Christian which she is about ten minutes over due either she doesn't know I'm in here or the schedule changed. My normal indepedent slash lunch slash indepdent study time  I have been doing this megaman three speed run and erase  JPEG of the computer to save menmory during instead because appointments go change. Which means next apoinment or appoints that I would have had in between 1 and 4 when my afternoon meeting is called then I am stuck out of the building for the rest of the eight hour period of today due now study hall. I got to try to find my menitor I'll send you the megaman four statics from home later today if the iternet has recieved all the sent data from before it got connected that failed to go through. I'll see you later mega buster HOA! The first boss fight you can't win you can't destroy vel the first time after a certain amounts  of hits. A cut scene will occur and Zero will appear will fire his mega buster like weapon take of one of the original Viles arms before he got update to look more like Jango feet in Megman X 3. For the chilling Penguin  use your mega buster from a distance and dodge as much as possible.I think about seven max power hit if you don't shot him when he is isinvulerable like when slides across the floor our us his ice scultpture attack or spiting his ice ball projectiles from his mouth and when he is standing in a certain position will bring him down. This person had to him him will 11 charged shoot a couple of times he fired at the wrong time like when the pnenguin was standing in a poisition or dogging at which he is invulerable when performed even if they shot hits. He will flash if I hits correctly so will the other bhosses.  I don't know what his master weakness in the super nes game or the reformated Plastation 2 and gamecube version. But on Megman extreme 1 it is the flame stags ability but that because  the boss differ on extreme depending on the difficult setting there not all from X one some like the stage are from the second game and later stage is only one medium or extreme mode.  This player defeat the storm eagle using 8 charge shoot and a few multi shots. The next boss is the flame mamoth this maverick is supposed to be so massive his whole body doesn't appear on the screen. For the mamoth who is not a big as I thought the quickest way to defat hit him with about 6 of storm eagles attacks and  cyber dumbo goes down.  The next boss this guy did is the Spark Mandrill.  For the mid way boss the blow fish slash land mine 5 hits will take it down of the storm eagles attack. 8 of the chilling penguins attack will take this over grown cross of  shocker and king kong out.  Next boss is the armored Armadillo I think his weakness may be spark mandrills power.  It is a weakness not as effective as the ice on the Mandrill but elevn hits from the spark mandril will fry this over wrecking ball.  Next boss is the launch octopus.  It has an eleven percent resitance to the bubble attack this boss has fast speed so you need to attack equalty fast to avoid a kill I playing with out cheats or auto save avilable.  The kid next does the bommer hanger.  If I remember correctlt chamleon is weak against this bosses ability so you might want to due it next if your going in this order.  11 of the octupus bosses attack will defeat this boss who also has high attack speed and strength.  Next boss this person challenges is the Sting Chamelon. I was correct ten hits from the boomer rang will bring down this giant reptile. Due it fast enough he won't even be able to use his cloacking ability.  Now the last half of the Game is the sigms stage Sigma is the equivalent to Dcotor willy for the Megaman X series the main bad robot. It's time fight Vile again but this time zero is behind and electric containment tube this time. After  four shot zero break free the second half of the battle once  Vile mogure like battle robot is destroyed begins  and all health lost is restored. Hit him about 7 more time if you are using the right weakness for a total damage resitance of about 12% then proceed on to the end of the stage this might actually be a midway boss.  You have to fight bommering guy again I don't now why they didn't save this for the warp tubes before sigma. But use the missle attack again  he should go done with about the same amount of hits maybe a few more. The next boss is the spider its weak spot is the smal jewel on it back this another one of those boss with high attack speed but low defense  if you counter fast enough before she pulls up out of  firing range.  I only have and hour  ten minutes and my next free time period is only about and hour so  not until around 3;00 PM unless med check get out super early like 25 minutes. I am going to be fastfoward a lot through this.  Next you have to fight the chilling penguin again 11 fire beam attack if launched when he is not on in and invulerable position and Cilly Will 3000 goes down again. Next you fight the hawk again I believe this is the finally before the sigma battles. His attack weakness is a laser  multi shot weapon the chamelons about 7 to 12 hits he goes down.  Use the same laser ability for the robot in the room with the spikes.  Fight the armadilo again use the same ability again from the previous fight. Next is the Chamelon rematch fight use the boommer attack again like the last time. The chilly penguin again for the second fight with the monkey maverick boss. The same weapons also for the octupus the elephant, For next new boss use the booomer like on the chamelon 11 times to take it down. For Sigma dog use the same  attack you used on the monkey eight times or the ice attack. For the final fight with sigma you can take him down with 29 mhit then the remaining time is the credits kind of a waste but if you beat this game with out cheat nor bypasses stages with password  in under 44 minute minus credits that's pretty impressive I could not do that. You have beat this hard game congrulations. I have one last thing to say Megga Blasta  HAA!The first boss fight you can't win you can't destroy vel the first time after a certain amounts  of hits. A cut scene will occur and Zero will appear will fire his mega buster like weapon take of one of the original Viles arms before he got update to look more like Jango feet in Megman X 3. For the chilling Penguin  use your mega buster from a distance and dodge as much as possible.I think about seven max power hit if you don't shot him when he is isinvulerable like when slides across the floor our us his ice scultpture attack or spiting his ice ball projectiles from his mouth and when he is standing in a certain position will bring him down. This person had to him him will 11 charged shoot a couple of times he fired at the wrong time like when the pnenguin was standing in a poisition or dogging at which he is invulerable when performed even if they shot hits. He will flash if I hits correctly so will the other bhosses.  I don't know what his master weakness in the super nes game or the reformated Plastation 2 and gamecube version.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2007"}

Obviously there has been a lot of controversy and hype surrounding this title, but I'm here to tell you that it's great on its own.  It is more or less a sequel to the first Modern Warfare.  There are some familiar characters from COD4 that make an appearance here.  Most of the action looks identical to COD4.  Overall, it's a lot of fun.The graphics and framerate are top notch.  The visuals are very nice and have roughly the same quality as COD4 (that's a good thing).  You can see beautiful vistas with great draw distance.  Very little in the way of texture pop in.  I couldn't ask for more.The game mechanics work pretty much the same as COD4.  Gun play is very satisfying, and the array of weapons is impressive.  Enemies seem fairly bright as they try to flank you.  Plus, in some of the grassy, outdoors environments it's kind of hard to see some of them.  Firefights can get intense quickly and are sometimes brutally hard (for me).Multiplayer is just as fun as COD4's.  The matchmaking system works pretty much the same way.  There are all kinds of medals and awards you can earn.  I love the ranking system.  If you're big on MP, you will most likely enjoy what Modern Warfare 2 has to offer.The campaign is pretty short.  I got through it in about 6 hours.  As I've been saying, there is a lot in Modern Warfare 2 that is similar to COD4.

{"product_name":"B00001XDUB","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Excellent","reviewText":"Before SIlent Hill was released, all we horror gamers had to scare us were the Resident Evil (Biohazard) series of games, with big, flashy chills and spills, and the Alone In The Dark series, which were just plain bad console conversions of average PC games. It just goes to show what can be done with a genre when a development team sits down and outs their heads together properly.Eclipsing Resident Evil and all other competitors in terms of scares, character development and sophistication, Silent Hill, upon its release in 1999, was unfairly ignored by the general public, even though critics were highly impressed with its blend of psychological method-scares and real-time environments. The public, used to zombie dogs bursting through windows and super-sharp pre-rendered backdrops, couldn't seem to get into a foggy real-time atmosphere where what you heard was scarier than what you saw. However, thanks in no small part to it's sequels (the standard-setting Silent Hill 2, and the graphically amazing, slightly hollow SIlent Hill 3), the original Silent Hill now enjoys something of a Classic status, and I have to say, it's very well-deserved.You play Harry Mason, a widower, whose daughter Cheryl goes missing en route to their vacation in the resort town of Silent Hill. Along the way you encounter allies and enemies (Cybil the Cop, Dr. Michael, Nurse Lisa, and the memorable Dahlia Gillespie, one of the series' coolest characters to date) and unravel the ghastly truth behind the desertion and possession of a seemingly innocent town.The graphics haven't aged well, but still have the ability to scare. One of the first survival horror-games to utilise fully modelled realtime environments, the camera angles and darkness/fog make for some truly chilling views. You find your way with the aid of a map, torch and a radio that emits static only when an enemy is close. Since darkness and fog are very cleverly employed in the game (ostensibly to keep the slowdown to a minimum, it also serves to heighten the tense atmosphere) what you hear and do not see is a lot scarier than what you do see. There are also several of the truly cool, nightmarish vignettes that the series has become famous for - Pyramid-Heads in steel cages, the Mark of Samael, and terribly wasted corpses cling to walls and ceilings and give us a deeper sense of the ravages of satanism.The gameplay and controls in the game, while doing nothing really new for the genre, are loose and easy. This is a system that will never be perfect, lacking the fluidity of the Tomb Raider games and the precision of point-and-click adventures, but does the job nicely. The auto-aim of games like Residnet Evil isn't present, so shooting can become a tense and exciting exercise - but you'll more often than not end up running scared from whatever it is you can't see.The characterisation is superior, thanks in no small part to superb pre-rendered cut scenes and excellent voice acting. Konami have taken great pains in all of their Silent Hill games to make sure that we understand the characters in the game, and the original is no exception. Our protagonist Harry is the dullest of the players, but he's still a likeable and well-realised character. Cheryl is not the stereotypical bug-eyed Manga cute girl we've come to expect from Japanese games, and she;s all the more realistic and endearing because of it. Nurse Lisa is sinister and forbidding in her surroundings, but her innocence and frailty is heart-rending - I defy anyone not to mist up when she makes her exit in the game. And Dahlia Gillespie is a masterpiece, she's a scary, eccentric old woman that will stay in the memory long after you've finished playing.I hate giving away plot points in my reviews, and I won't here, either, but a word of advice from a survival-horror completist - CONSERVE YOUR AMMO. Depending on the ending you get (one of a possible five) you may have to fight up to three end-of-game bosses. And nothing spoils your enjoyment of a game more than having to replay the final half for more ammo.All in all, Silent Hill is a convoluted, enthralling game. It may be slightly rough-looking in places but it's well-worth the ride, and an absolute MUST if you intend to play the laterst installment. Highly recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00006LEMX","description":"Looking for a new obsession to keep you up nights? Let me introduce you to Hotsuma, the main character inShinobi, the much anticipated new action-adventure game from Sega. Fans of the original 2-D game have been waiting seven years for the next installment, and won't be disappointed by this energetic 3-D game for PS2.The premise hasn't changed much--kill bad guys, kill more bad guys, kill a boss, move on to the next level. You, Hotsuma, are the leader of the Oboro clan. As your clansmen are destroyed, you set out to avenge their deaths by slashing hellspawn and enemy ninjas to death with your powerful sword, Akujiki. As you move through game levels, Akujiki comes alive with power, absorbing the souls of those you kill--and turning against you if you don't keep him well fed. The basic moves--run, jump, slash--are easy to learn, but with each level you must master difficult combos to defeat trickier enemies. Moving quickly and attacking instinctively is essential to killing fast and furiously--each kill gives your sword more power, while each moment of hesitation makes your weapon impatient for blood.Shinobi, at heart, is a souped-up arcade game with awesome graphics. The anime-style cutscenes woven around the slice-and-dice sequences provide an interesting story, but one that doesn't relate very directly with your job on the streets of postapocalyptic Tokyo. Your moves are cool though--spinning in midair to collect coins that will unlock secret levels, killing three ninjas with a flash of Akujiki, zipping around so fast that a shadow of your ghost remains. It's easy to get caught up in the exhilarating energy of the game. Serious gamers will enjoy confronting bosses, who may take several frustrating tries to kill. But when you finally defeat them, you will feel the power of centuries of samurai.--Maile BohlmannPros:Fantastic graphicsExcellent scripting and voicingFairly easy controls and maneuvers at outsetExciting fighting sequences with intense gameplayCons:Killing early bosses can be unusually difficultLong sequences with no save pointsStoryline frames fighting sequences, rather than interacting with them","reviewerName":"Tex \"dionysus_olympus\"","summary":"Average game -- that still needs some improvement","reviewText":"First off, I played the original Shinobi back in the 1980s in the arcade, and it was one of my favorite games.  In fact, this game was one of the few games that I beat on one quarter, due to the arcade's glitches.  However, this game is fun, but not quite as fun as Devil May Cry.  The three-dimensional effect is quite an improvement.  Even the graphics are an improvement.  Lastly, the boss fights are quite interesting, and the bosses for the most part resemble the bosses in Metal Gear Solid 2 and Devil May Cry.  This game definitely reminisces of the original arcade version.  The inclusion of extras such as other playable ninjas including Joe Musashi was definitely good.However, the game lacks several elements.  First, the technique of sword slashing should have been improved.  Hotsuma, the main character, should have more abilities for his sword as he continues in his quest.  Next, the game should have saved cinematics, as in some games nowadays.  Third, the game should have included the original version of Shinobi (or some past version of Shinobi), as in Midway's Spyhunter.  Furthermore, the music could have been improved greatly, like including modern techno or something.  Lastly, some of the graphical elements could have been improved; as the inclusion of a replay of Hotsuma's slash and hit  before his ultimate pose at the end would have been exceptional.  This game is a must-buy for Shinobi fans like myself...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2002"}

(no spoilers)","reviewText":"Read some of my other reviews and you'll see I suxxorz at multiplayer. I think I am too old or whatever to compete with the kids reflexes. That being said, I still really enjoy FPS games. Single player works for me as long as the story is good and the combat is realistic. If you want a good multiplayer review please check the others posted here on Amazon. Reason being there are some fantastic ones that focus solely on multiplayer aspect. My review is of the single player mode (Campaign).Enter in Battlefield: Bad Company 2 and you have a solid FPS game that has a really good background story.Synopsis:The initial game sequence takes place in WWII. Germany, Japan, the US are all working on Weapons of Mass Destruction. Germany had the V2, US had the nuke, and Japan is working on its own uber weapon. You begin the game trying to capture it. Once that is over you move into modern day.Story:I wrapped this up this weekend in anticipation ofRed Dead Redemption. I decided to bump it up to normal mode, up from the default mode. Let me say that in normal mode I never started a level, heck never made it past the point when it says _Saving_ longer than a few moments. There are enemies everywhere. Snipers, close combat guys that switch to RPG and take out the pillar you are hiding behind. Its really good. I enjoyed the whole story, I think it was well thought out and the plot was very good. Good enough to push me to finish it.AI:Your fellow NPCs are ok, most of the time they shoot with decent accuracy. Its obvious that you are carrying the whole squad. Its cool though I like to play a sniper anyway so I would let them run in and lay down suppressive fire and then snipe from afar.Enemy NPC's are pretty good. They sometimes look like the enemies in a Rambo movie, running out in the open standing square to you and spraying fire. Which is comical at best. Other times they hide in great places, shoot out your cover, and make life really difficult. I died probably 10 to 15 times each level, thats how good they were. Even if you reset and started over knowing where they were it was still tough to take them out.Firefight:Wow, I have shot a M79 grenade launcher in real life. Also many other of the weapons they use I have shot their ancestor while in the military. The attention to detail with regard to arching your long range fire is impressive. You cannot aim the cross hairs on an RPG directly at the target and hope that the round will hit it. No, you have to use the ticks below the main cross hairs and raise it up to enfilade your fire. Pretty cool stuff. I also enjoyed the firefights from the vehicles.Sticking points:Its not all rosy so let me discuss some of the tiny details that are so minor that it doesn't make it unplayable.1. NPC deaths - sometimes mobs will die and fall into a wall with their legs and arms flailing around in space. Funny but weird.2. Unlimited ammo on vehicles. Sometimes I would just sit outside of a town and blast the buildings for 20 mins to level the town with my 40mm grenade launcher.3. Subtitle text - seriously its like 8 point font on my screen. I don't know why you cannot bump it up.Good things:1. Funny dialog, its raw and hilarious, much like my days in the military. Doesn't bother me but it might be offensive to some.2. Perfectly modeled vehicles. They look spot on. From the sea stallions to the Russian helicopters they are spot on.3. Lush environments. Many cool places to visit, cold tundra, hot desert, sticky jungle. Each place is designed well and looks perfect.Summary:For a first person shooter this game does not let you down. Its funny, yet relevant, hard and challenging. I think you cant go wrong if you are looking for a game to fill these shoes.Thanks for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2010"}

Now he hacks to find out who ordered the hit on his family. While the game info tells us to expect to hack and control the city, chase down leads and ultimately find the person behind the tragedy the fact is that the game is very, very much like so many other open world games: drive here or there fast enough, lead the cops on a chase, follow the glowing blue lines to hack the box that will enable you to enter a building and expand your hacking powers and such. If this were GTA or Saint's Row you'd be doing a lot of the same things: drive here, kill these guys, expand your influence. It's really similar and what was supposed to make this game distictive really doesn't add much.You can do cool stuff like mess with street lights and hack people's ATM accounts. You can listen in on their fictional conversations. You can hack gates to let you in to neighborhoods. You can set off explosions. Later, you can control even more of the city, but most of the stuff is really to help you get away from cops. Most of it is a shrug.One cool thing you can do is to take control of cameras and then move between them and then hack from a distance. This does bring something new to the table. Consider this CtOS mission: you can inflitrate a building with a bunch of armed guards, collecting a key card, and gaining access to part of the city's network. If this were GTA or Saint's Row or even Assasin's Creed you could go in guns blazing or (in the case of AC) climb over walls and stealthily kill everyone. You could do that here in Watch Dogs but I found I got wasted a lot easier in this game going that route. In this level, for instance, I went another route altogether. I hacked camera to camera and then used set up lures to move guards into position for my expolosions. Then I hacked noisemakers to move them out of the way. Then I hacked lifts and lights and alarms. I hacked guy's explosives that they carried to cause them to detonate. Then when the guard with the key died I hacked the card. Then I hacked a guy who was carrying a camera (why? Who knows but you can then be on a moving camera to get to other places in the building.) I used the camera guy and noises to move him closer to the node where I hacked the system and got access to the network. I did all this from outside the compound, safely on the street, just another dude standing around. It was more rewarding than running in guns blazing.When you do that kind of stuff - when the hacking actually enhances the game play - then this game shines. But too often I'm stuck trying to drive a car all over fictional Chicago within a time limit. I don't want to play a race car game. If I did I would've bought Gran Turismo. I want to play a hacking game in an open world. As such, I've been disappointed and frustrated at times playing this.The game shows potential and likely sequels will be so much better. In the mean time, this is a fun diversion that never really lived up to the hype.Note about the systems: I had both 360 and One. I felt like I lost nothing playing on the 360. The One looks better, of course, but how it played was very similar. If you only have a 360 don't worry about missing out on anything with what comes shipped.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2014"}

I think the G27 has smoother and stronger force feedback as well, but that's subjective. What's not subjective is that I got the shifter and pedal set included for the same price as the Fanatec wheel alone.I just wish someone would make a good adapter for the XBOX so I could enjoy Forza4 with the wheel like I do GT5!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2012"}

Mario and Luigi team up with some Yoshis to get through 74 levels in 8 different worlds to save Dinosaur Land.A brilliant start for the SNES as in 1990 in Japan as they released the Super-Famicom (Japanese Nintendo System), Nintendo wowed players back then in that country and it became the highest acclaimed game in the series back then since SMB 3. It spawned hype here in the US earlier in Nintendo Power and many other game magazines even about the shiny new Super Nintendo entertainment system and it's launch title \"Super Mario World\". On August 13th 1991, the SNES premiered with the game that went with out and fans were originally worried if it will live up to be a masterpiece like \"Super Mario Brothers 3\" and if it was a masterpiece they got, it's a masterpiece they finally got.It's the best looking game in the series at the time with it's highly advanced graphics and sounds as it was an evolutionary stepforward to the saga. While not offering many new elements as the previous game, this one does offer a feather that can make Mario a caped superhero where he can fly like his Raccoon counterpart in part 3 to performing a bellydive and spin around, he can ride his allies known as Yoshi where it can devour enemies and this is the first game where Mario uses his spin jump. Like SMB 3, this one brings back the map system and Mario could backtrack and re-enter levels. The game has brilliant 2D colorful visuals that still holds up as it has a work of charm to it including amazing special effects that impressed the hell out of gamers including myself when i got this game with the system for christmas back in 91 when i was 10. It was nothing like gamers here in the US has ever seen before from rotating boss battles to all the way to the climax of the Banzai that Bowser rode.It's easily as awesome as SMB 3 and another time-tested classic that is always a treat to replay as it's one of my fave games ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005BW7Q","reviewerName":"Robert N. Kallister","summary":"A Masterpiece","reviewText":"Square has always been known for making some of the most innovative, interactive, and interesting games in the video market today.  Starting back in 1990 with Final Fantasy, the company has exploded into other RPG's, strategy, action, and even fighting games to thrill their audiences with.  But when the designer of one of their popular titles \"Xenogears,\" Tetsuya Takahashi, asked to make a prequel series of his project, he was denied.  So, he did the next best thing, and turned it over to Namco, most famous for Pac-Man and the Tekken/Soul Blade series.The game is hands-down gorgeous.  If you're an anime fan, it will only heighten your experience, since the characters are designed in a very Manga-style fashion.  A vast array of colors decorate clothing, backgrounds, and special effects to almost perfection.  The characters move very fluidly, and though it's all game graphics (no CGI in this one), there's very little \"overlap\" choppiness that happens when graphics are placed in the same place simultaneously.The storyline is phenomenal.  You're dragged into the life of Shion, a young scientific engineer who has just created an android called KOS-MOS, designed to protect against the threat of an alien race known as the Gnosis.  KOS-MOS uses a special energy transmission known as the \"Hilbert Effect\" to turn the Gnosis from ghostly, transparent apparitions to full flesh creatures that can be defeated.There are a LOT of long cutscenes that feature dialogue between the vast array of characters in the game, but for those of you who played and liked Final Fantasy X, this shouldn't be much of a problem to you.  If anything, I think this only increased the appeal as the story is unfolded in spoken dialogue, as opposed to having to read everything.The combat sequences are just how I like them: traditional.  It's turn-based, with a variety of commands, such as fighting, using \"Ether\" (Magic), defending, and changing position.  The actual \"fighting\" is a combination of different types of attacks, which are either ranged or melee.  Some types of attacks hurt certain enemies more than others.  Plus, there are \"special\" attacks you can do which can hit one or multiple enemies.Character customization is very innovative.  You can learn skills by spending points to extract them from equipment, you can upgrade your \"special\" attacks by spending points, and you earn normal experience to level for gaining stats, HP, and Ether points.  Plus, there's a variety of different clothing, armor, and accessory options your characters can choose from to help them out.In addition to the normal game, which features an astounding soundtrack by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, there are side games you can play, including a very interesting, challenging, fun card game.Two of the characters, Shion and Jr., bring along walking robot constructs called AWGS.  Though they're seen a few times during the story, and you eventually get to both use and customize them, they're not a very important part of the overall plot.  They don't regenerate HP when you rest, meaning you have to use items to repair them, and they don't have a huge variety of weapon choices.  You'll find battling with the characters outside of the AWGS (pronouced \"eggs\") is a lot more effective.Overall, this game is a 10 of 10.  Right up there with Final Fantasy X, Metal Gear Solid 2, and Grand Theft Auto 3.  A must-have for anime fans and RPG fans alike.  You'll find yourself strangely attracted to this game, a sort of addiction you can't explain, but you'll enjoy the experience.  If you don't already have a copy of this, get one today.  After you finish it, get ready for the highly anticipated release of Xenosaga Episode II: Jenseits von Gut und Bose, where the characters from Der Wille zur Macht come back to resume the fantastic story from where it left off.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2004"}

When you start the game, you choose either to play the role of a boy or girl, and depending on your choices, the hero will grow up to be tall or short, good or evil. Players can get married and have children; female player characters will become pregnant, which will then be reflected by their physical appearance.Early in the game, players are presented with a stray dog for a best friend, who will need to be fed and loved, and will accompany the player throughout his or her life.

I had played Fable I, not liked it at first,but then gone back to it, and when \"The Final Chapters\" version was released, got much more into it. Iwas not much for RPG type games, and still don't play them much, but this one was interesting to mebecause of the way it was presented, and that it was simple enough for a \"casual\" or \"beginning\" RPGplayer to pick it up, without a lot of the depth or complexity of MMORPG's or \"Oblivion.\"Anyway, having enjoyed Fable, I waited a long time for this game. Finally, it was released, and I got it home, started it up, and was quite impressed with the opening cutscene, very nice. (I had a feeling that bird would do what it did; I don't know how). Without giving too many spoilers, you start as a young boy (or girl) poor and fighting to survive;something terrible happens (as it always does to start off RPG's), and you beging your journey with rudimentary weapons and some gold. As in the first game, your first authorized use of your weapon (yes I randomly attacked a few people first, I'm evil) is those stupid giant bettles again. As before when you kill someone or something, squeeze the left trigger to gather their \"orbs.\" The \"orbs\" are used to purchase your level ups, as in the first game.The course you follow is up to you; you can follow the main story, or quest, do things on the side, randomly kill, steal and plunder, like in the first game (but as in the first game the guards are levels above you, so it's stupid to try to fight them at first); one thing I enjoy, as I did in the first game, is to simply explore a town, sneak into a house and steal whatever I can when no one is looking (hee hee). Even being a simple theif, though will turn your alighment towards \"bad.\" Which is alright with me, I ususally prefer to be \"bad.\"Some things I don't like: The interface is still hard to use. I never liked it much before now it seems worse. The map isn't too good. Also on a standard def TV (am I the last one left with one) the menu pages are hard to read, and some of the instructional text in the game is way up on top of the screen and hard to read. And I agree with other players on the save system: there is an autosave, and you can save when not on a quest, but there seems to be only one slot, so if one or the other gets corrupted you could lose hours of work. I also think it's past time for \"mute\" characters. Yes, it's a lot of programming, but Fable II is not a bargain game; and they can fit a lot of content on one disk; look at how the main characaters are realized in GTA IV, Mass Effect, and other games.Some things I do like: Cutscenes are amazing. Combat is OK-I am not a melee expert and appreciate a simple interface that does a lot. I still find myself eating something when I want to draw a weapon, or casting a spell when I want to shoot somebody though. Still frustrating.The most amazing thing: I love the dog! Absolutely amazing AI programming. I have never seen anything like it-the dog will follow you, show you the way to hidden (and buried) chests, etc, and help you in combat-if you knock a stronger foe down, the dog will attack it. Finally, however your character develops, the dog will take on a similar apperance: if you're good, it's a handsome shepard mix-looking thing, if you're evil, it's a fearsome, snarling beast. Very cool!On the reported freezes: I have not experienced any glitches or major bugs yet; I have seen other users report the game freezes; unfourtunately when a game freezes, it ususaly means your 360 is failing (sorry). This was my experience-I purchased my first 360 in August 2006, and it gave me good service (it ran 24/7 for more than 2 years because it was networked with my computer used as a sometimes media hub)-when games began freezing in it, a short time afterwards it red ringed. From what I understand, it is VERY rare for game software to brick consoles, when this happens it's because of a console update that goes wrong because of an error that happens when the firmware is written to.Conclusion: Fable II is a good game; if you enjoy RPG's you will like it. If you are new to RPG's you may want to rent it and check it out. Minor problems aside, it's fun and there is lots of replay value, vis. play through as a male, then a female, then evil, then good, and so on. Recommended.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2008"}

Why? Basic Wii U plus Nintendo Land separately = $360. Deluxe Wii U with Nintendo Land included plus the extra accessories (all handy in their own ways) = $350. Unless you REALLY hate the color black for a video game console, by all means get the basic with Nintendo Land separately. But if you don't want Nintendo Land and would prefer having physical copies of games rather than downloading them from the eShop, the basic Wii U might be better for you.On another note, I have the deluxe Wii U, and I have already reviewed it, but this is more of an updated review, and since my review for the deluxe is buried under 200 other reviews, I might as well post a review here, since the basic doesn't get as many reviews.So, the Wii U. I really like the console. When we got it it offered countless hours of fun but after we finished the games we had...then what? I recently got Lego City Undercover, a really fun and LONG game. It should keep me occupied until other games come out later this year. The GamePad controller is really awesome and will, like the Wii Remote, revolutionize the video game market. The second screen opens up a whole 'nother world for video games and offers NUMEROUS new ways to play. Some games make use of the controller better than others...the use of the controller as your communicator in Lego City is very cool and works extremely well. Other games, however, allow the option of Off-TV Play, a feature where if someone else desires to use the Wii U's TV, you can simply bring the game/movie (streamed through Netflix, Amazon) onto the GamePad while someone else uses the TV. This feature here is AMAZING and works really well. The use of the GamePad as a TV remote works extremely well too. From the GamePad (via the TV button), you can turn on/off your TV, cable/satellite box, change the input, channel, adjust the volume, access your cable/satellite guide, and so much more. The Nintendo TVii service also features a remote that has many more options than the TV button, but personally I use the TV button more. The GamePad is part video gaming awesomeness, part universal remote...and it is amazing. The GamePad, although it looks huge, clunky, and heavy, is actually extremely light (you'd be surprised how light it is based on the size) and is very comfortable to hold. Your forefingers naturally rest on the little shelf on the back where the trigger buttons are, your thumbs naturally rest on the analog sticks, and your other fingers comfortably hold to the grips on the back of the controller. The layout/placement of the buttons and analog sticks are VERY well done...you barely have to move your thumbs to access each button. The only exception here is the home button, power button, TV button, and, of course, the touchscreen. Speaking of which, the touchscreen, although resistive instead of capacitive, responds very well to the touch of your finger and is very durable. The screen is not in HD, however, but it is still really high quality and you won't really see too much of a difference. The controller itself is very durable. I have younger siblings and this thing has been dropped, slapped, and abused, and a scratch has yet to appear on the controller. Oh, and the Wii U is backwards compatible with everything Wii, so that's a major plus.Miiverse, the Wii U's and Nintendo's online social community, is amazing. The service allows you to connect to fellow Wii U owners and discuss games and it's also a very good place to go if you get stuck in a game. The service is definitely still in its youth and has MUCH room for improvement, but so far it's off to a good start it's constantly updated and made better by the Miiverse team. Miiverse is now available for internet browsers and will (hopefully) soon make its way to the 3DS and smartphones/tablets as an app.Now let me talk about some of the main issues people have been complaining about with the Wii U:Loading times - Well, the question now is: what loading times? The most recent system update, released April 25th, DRASTICALLY reduced the loading times of practically everything on the console. The loading times for everything now range anywhere from 5-8 seconds, opposed to before the update when the loading times ranged anywhere from 15-30 seconds. Simply saying Nintendo did a good job is a HUGE understatement. This update alone shows that Nintendo has been working their butts off to fix the loading times for us and by-golly they did it. The summer system update is said to decrease the loading times even further...will the console achieve instant-load status after the next update?Poor GamePad battery life - If you fiddle around with the brightness settings of the controller you can extend the battery life by a couple of hours. But I will agree the battery isn't stellar.Lack of a second GamePad - Well, here's the thing. The Wii U will support two GamePads...but here's the major problem: adding a second GamePad decreases the quality of the HD from 1080p to 720p and reduces it from 60fps to 30fps. Until Nintendo can work out these problems, I doubt that Nintendo will advertise the Wii U being able to support two GamePads.Wii games won't play on the GamePad - Well, duh, they're Wii games! They weren't designed to be played on the GamePad! Most Wii games were developed before the idea for the Wii U even existed! It's like saying DS games won't play in 3D on the 3DS...of course they won't! This really shows how oblivious and stupid some people are nowadays.System updates take a long time - Well, somewhat true. The updates don't typically take a long time. There are two reasons why the console would take a long time to update: 1) your internet speed is poor and 2) the sheer number of other Wii U owners trying to perform the same system update at the same time. The most recent update should've taken at most 15 minutes, but with everyone trying to update (hello, faster loading times, of course everyone's going to update) at the same time, it could take up to an hour to do.System/app updates take over the system and can't be performed in the background - That USED to be true. The most recent system update also allows future system/app updates to be performed in the background. System updates can now also occur while the Wii U is turned off in standby mode.The Wii U has poor hardware - Yes. Nintendo's new console will once again be the weakest for the new generation. Yet it will have a larger IP library, more exclusives, more quality games and the major plus: we get all of these in glorious 1080p HD, running at 60fps, and with a whole new way to play. And it's also looking like the Wii U will be the only console this coming generation to be backwards compatible with the previous gen. Nintendo is always innovating, something the other companies seem to have forgotten about...they wait and see what Nintendo is doing, make a cheap rip-off two years later and then claim that they came up with the idea and that Nintendo stole THEIR idea. To me, what console I get all depends on the quality of the games it has, not how powerful or how graphically strong it is. To me, it's not all about graphics - it's all about gameplay.No Virtual Console service - Try again, the Virtual Console service launched April 26th with 10 classic games and more are on the way - including EarthBound. Virtual Console also allows Off-TV Play, so you can play your classics solely on the GamePad.And here's the major one: A poor game library - Well, this really depends on your situation. If you skipped the Wii generation and are thinking about coming back with the Wii U, then this console already has a HUGE game library for you, full of all the good Wii exclusives. However, if you're upgrading from Wii to Wii U, then there isn't much right now. There are several good games out there, such as New Super Mario Bros. U, Lego City Undercover, and I heard ZombiU is really good too but I don't own it. But, Nintendo has announced a LOT of new games for the console (a 3D Mario, Mario Kart, a new Zelda, and an HD overhaul of Wind Waker are among them) and Nintendo has stated that the second half of the year will be full of new Wii U titles. Game & Wario has been announced for June 23 and Pikmin 3 has been announced for August 4, and Nintendo unintentionally let slip that Mario Kart will be coming this year as well.To wrap things up, the Wii U is a very good console. It's really fun to play and I enjoy every moment I spend on it. The GamePad is an awesome controller that will revolutionize the video game market once again. Yet there is definitely much room for improvement, including the sparse video game library and the youthful online experience. A lot of the system's problems were fixed on the 25th of April, yet a few still remain. I would whole-heartedly recommend this console (deluxe of basic) to anyone...just not right now. I would wait to buy this console until the games start rolling out later this year. This is just one of the perks of being an early adopter.I give the console 4.5 stars out of 5. Before the system update, I gave the console four stars, docking half a star for the slow loading times/frequent freeze-ups, and docking another half a star for the small game library. Now that the former has been fixed, I can proudly give the Wii U a solid 4.5 stars out of 5. And trust me, the console deserves this. Once the game library is significantly strengthened, I can give the system a full 5 stars out of 5.The Wii U has definitely had a rocky start, but, like the 3DS, I predict that the Wii U will soon find it's footing and become a great system to own.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2013"}

I did not find it fun and after a while I found it a chore to play. I was initially impressed with the use of stylus but I really wished there was a button scheme as well.Spirit Tracks uses the stylus input system just like Phantom Hourglass with no option to use the buttons. I thought the boat in Phantom Hourglass was not that great but little did I know that the train would be even more irritating to travel with. The train system and the use of the flute (blowing into the mic) ruined the game for me. The story is not powerful or intriguing, either. This is a rental at best, skip the purchase and wait for the next one with better controls and gameplay mechanics.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2009"}

However, I was mainly displeased at how the game was played. It's a very open-ended game so you will find yourself going through a spot on a level, destroying, searching, finding, and back tracking quite a bit. Here is my review for Metriod Prime for the Nintendo Gamecube.Graphics: 10/10. Definitely the best standout for the game. Unbelievable graphics show how powerful the little Nintendo Gamecube really is. It's quite easy to compare these graphics to a Graphical King like Halo. Hell, when you walk over some things in this game your mask will get foggy. That is pretty cool. The enviroments look great and so do the critters. Samus' suit is very shiny too. :]Sound: 9/10. Very well done sound. The music is great, the different baddies you shoot at make unique sounds, the bosses do as well, the water sounds good, everything sounds good. It really adds to the experience with the game.Control: 9/10. The control for many may be extremely frustrating and confusing, but really it's not all that bad. There are quite a few different controls but it's nothing to get bent out of shape about and get so depressed you want to hang yourself in the bathroom, no, but they are somewhat hard to get used to, I guess. But after you play for about a half an hour you will get the feeling.Fun: 7/10. This is where the game just sinks for me. The game is great in everything else except the fun. It's fun until you get to a hard part and you have absolutely no idea what to do so you need to backtrack and whatnot just to pass a little part of a level. Another flaw is no multiplayer; which definitely should have been added in this game because it could have been a great party game; even if there would be no online play. So basically, this is a single player game that is about 50% exploration, 20% boredom, and 30% action. This game I found to be very hard, so if you want to succeed in Metroid Prime, you had better get a strategy guide. Good luck.7.9/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2006"}

I have to say that this one is the only one since the first remake that really changed much.  The 3D graphics are really nice, and the voice acting makes the game feel more modern.  The biggest change, however, is the challenge.  I remember plowing through the first part of the game without stopping.  In the previous versions, one didn't need to stop progressing to level the characters until after the village of Myst.  This version is way different!  Even the battles in the beginning can wipe the group!  Any hard core Final Fantasy fan will likely be very happy with this.

I haven't played the game again though.]Burnout: Paradise has many great qualities and Criterion should be praised. However to fully appreciate this game and become good at it you basically have to memorize the entire huge city. I've been playing the game for about 20 hours and I can barely remember where the short cuts are and what's the best street to turn down for races and stunts. Especially because you're driving so fast. They do have flashing street sign indicators but they're only a little helpful.Let's say I start a race. I then pause and look at the terrible map when the race starts and plan out my route. Then I drive about 10 seconds, pause, then look at the map again. I find myself doing this over and over during the race. This frequent pausing breaks up the fun and momentum of the race. So let's say I lose the race. No big deal the whole point of a game is to practice and get better. Great. But then you have to drive alllll the way back to the starting point, miles away. I've won many races so it's not because I suck, but I've rarely been able to get particularly good at any races or any other events. I don't feel that satisfaction of getting better at a game, just blazing speed and blind luck.People say it's no big deal because another event is right around the corner at a traffic light. But how am I going to get better at the previous race if I don't do it again for a long time? So you basically just wander around aimlessly from event to event, not ever really perfecting anything. The whole thing begins to feel like a meandering, directionless mess. It's a shame because I've had a lot of fun with this game especially the stunt runs, but the map problem is so bad it's to the point I'm getting really bored with this game after only 20 hours and a B license.The game does have many great things about it (not Showtime), the graphics, the speed, the handling, the stunts, and I also love open world games. If you spend half your life memorizing every nook and cranny of the city then you'll have fun. If not it gets old after awhile, especially after the millionth slow-motion crash. If they fix the awful navigation system and lack of a restart function for the next installment, it'll be a classic game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2008"}

Blood Omen was one of my first playstation games, and it still stands as one of my all-time favorites.  When Soul Reaver hit about 3 years later, the dramatic change of game play and surprising turn of the story was a huge hit, and I became instantly hooked.  Like Blood Omen before it, I was compelled to finish Soul Reaver to the end, and to this day Soul Reaver also stands out as one of my all-time favorite games.  Afterwards, the offerings of Soul Reaver 2 and Blood Omen 2 were decent, but the gameplay didn't live up to the standards set by Soul Reaver.  Defiance changes everything...once again, the Legacy of Kain series successfully combines a spell-binding story with excellent gameplay.Picking up shortly after Soul Reaver 2, Defiance has you assume the role of not only Raziel, but Kain as well.  Although Blood Omen 2 allowed you to play as Kain as well, I must admit that it was a real gift to be able to play as Kain again, especially since the gameplay in Blood Omen 2 was awful compared to Defiance.  As the story progresses, you will switch between Kain and Raziel in a series of chapters.  Often times, the chapter you are currently playing ends with a brief cliffhanger, and thrusts you into the other character's shoes.  What is great about this game is that the designers understand that the following this series has is mostly a cult following, or rather somewhat small amount of very devoted people who truly love the story.  Long-time fans will be thrilled with the questions answered, most notably questions from Blood Omen and Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2, but unfortunately many of Blood Omen 2's questions still go unanswered.  Despite this, I myself was absolutely stunned by the story...I almost got lockjaw syndrome from my mouth being gaped open in shock during the entire last 3 hours of the game.The gameplay is tons of fun.  Unlike the mediocre combat offerings from Soul Reaver 2 and Blood Omen 2, I actually found myself thirsting for combat in this game, and when it happened, it was alot of fun.  Although fundamentally the same, since both Kain and Raziel have the exact same special moves (which are learned through the game by gaining combat experience), Kain and Raziel play somewhat differently.  Kain is definitely the stronger powerhouse, able to make short work of most enemies, where Raziel is considerably weaker, but is much quicker and is better at evading enemies rather than facing them head on.  When playing as Raziel I found myself wanting to avoid combat until I started gaining more special moves as the game progressed.  The special moves are easy to perform and the same for both characters (though the look different and are called different things).Unlike previous games, you cannot pick up weapons as you go.  Kain and Raziel both wield their versions of the Reaver.  Kain possesses the Blood reaver, while Raziel possesses different incarnations of the Soul Reaver.  As you progress, both Kain and Raziel's Reavers gain new powers, which substantially sets them apart from one another.  Each weapon can be powered up by using it to finish the opponent.  So instead of consuming the soul or drinking the blood themselves, Raziel and Kain can instead use their Reavers to consume the Soul or Blood of their enemy.  Another gratifying aspect is that there is a purpose to getting the new Reaver upgrades.  Each one has its own unique power that is useful in the right situation.In terms of overall gameplay, Kain and Raziel have different games.  Kain's game focuses mostly on locating keys or artifacts to progress, and is combat intensive.  Raziel's game, however, is heavily puzzle-oriented and lighter on combat, though there are situations with overwhelming enemies.In terms of flaws, this game is utterly packed with glitches.  On countless occasions, I had to save the game(which can be done anywhere, thankfully) and turn off the machine because the game would suddenly stop playing sounds.  Other times, the game froze when there were large amounts of enemies on screen.  This also happened when the game seemed to go nuts and spawn massive amounts of enemies on the screen, which couldn't be hit.  The game then proceeded to freeze.  Sometimes the audio cut out during cut scenes, which was royally annoying.  There were some minor clipping issues during combat as well.Overall, despite the countless amount of glitches and bugs, Legacy of Kain: Defiance stands out as one of the BEST games I have played in a long, long time.  I don't think i've been this compelled to sit down and finish a game since the first Soul Reaver.  The story is excellent, with the same returning voice-acting cast, some of which are notable Hollywood talent.  All of the cut scenes are saved as you progress, so you can view them at any time.  This game was also longer than the past 2 outings, clocking in for me at about 25 or more hours.  I was very happy with this game and pleased to see that it was so improved over the last 2 offerings.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2003"}

I never played the previuos one's until Vice City came out and a guy let me play it. The game I remember was fun to play but the content was extreme so I gave it back to him never thinking I would in turn buy the next installment a year later San Andreas.But the game caught my attention because I grew up in the early ninties and remember the L.A. riots in 92', Boyz to Men ABC 123 and all that Jazz. I even remember Low Riders being the commmon vehicle on the road and bass systems everywhere copied from California trends and movies.I thought I woulld give this a try for once. I wasn't shocked with the language other than it being so vouger. The violence didn't effect me neither since i knew what to expect from playing Vice City. What did shock me was the dificulty of the story line missions.The game does do a great job of easing you into the game's missions by giving you simple tasks at first to complete but once your in it gets down right hard. Right now I am stuck on the Big Smoke mission called \"Just Business\" because of mainly the aiming controls in the game. You have to do a varity of things overall in the misssions which creates a good varity but there is no easy, medium nor hard dificulty setting just plain hard which is not good for me since I am not some GTA gaming expert. I have used some cheats just to get through some of the misssions not that I wanted to but the game seems unforgiving in some of the misssions. Maybe it's just me I don't know. I played through Half Life 2 no problem, Far Cry no problem, this is a hard game to get the hang of and just when you think you have it down a they pop a crazy mission at you which you have to repeat a 100 times just to get through it until the next crazy mission that comes along. This is not fun and the more you play the more you get angry. The best part of the previous GTA's was the openness not a impossible story line that you can't complete? I rather be racing or riding dirt bikes up in the mountains than trying to pass a mission just to progress the story line just to open the other areas so you can go to them. What fun is that? Shouldn't they have opened all the areas up from get-go and let you decide if you want to play the story line misssions or not? Isn't that more fair than pushing you to play the way they want you to play? That is not openended at all and certinly not for beginners!Anyway, I don't think I will ever finnish this game's 100 some missions nor get out of Los Santos but to warn newbe's to the genre, this is a hard game so you better be ready in spending some teadious hours upon hours just trying to pass one single misssion to progress the story line. No easy, medium or hard setting just frustration, frustration, frustration!To me that is unfair and certinly not fun nor openended but rather discriminating if you ask me and certinly not like the userfriendly Vice City was! Be warned!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"Christopher Lankford","summary":"Puts the player in control of the game for once!","reviewText":"You know it's beautiful, and you know it's linear. What it seems no one has an opinion on is its new battle system. Here's the scoop:Back in the good ol' days of SNES (through PS2), if you wanted to play a game with a decent storyline, you had to sit through at least 35 hours of mindless character-statistic checks and waiting for a bar to fill. For some reason, developers decided there was something wrong with that, so tactical and action RPGs have become more prevalent than what we now refer to as &#34;traditional&#34; (or &#34;menu-based&#34;) RPGs. Square Enix has stuck to its guns, but finally innovated on a long-stale formula.In Final Fantasy XIII, specialization--the heart of any system that requires thoughtful gaming--is key. You must use pure damage dealers, pure support casters, and pure &#34;tanks&#34; (damage absorbers). You're literally forced to. And you can only use them in predetermined (by the player) trios. This means, at the very least, you'll have to set up a trio for offense, one for emergency healing, and a balanced trio.But the game has also (finally!) brought status ailments and buffs to the place they belong: at the crux of a player's stratagem. Buffs and ailments are so critical that it's often, if not always, preferential to &#34;debuff&#34; the enemy rather than deal direct damage. So you'll need some character trios that protect and heal a debuffer, or buff while attacking, or......you quickly see where this is going. And you're only allowed six different trios (&#34;paradigms&#34;, in game). And the buffs and debuffs don't last long, and you need to heal very frequently, so you're switching paradigms constantly.And then there's the ever-decreasing &#34;chain counter&#34;, a bar that fills when you go on the offensive and drains over time. This means you're rewarded for staying on the offensive as much as possible, moreso than in previous traditional RPGs.The net result? A game that pits you against time, not your enemy's arbitrary stat numbers (your level is kept rigorously controlled, since the game is so linear). You have to keep the chain counter up, your enemies debuffed, your allies buffed, and your allies at high health at all times. That's at least four things to do, and there are only three characters. That means constant attention must be paid to the ebb and flow of battle. In the end, it puts the player where they should be: in CONTROL of the game. In previous Final Fantasy games, the enemies (particularly bosses) told you when to heal, when to cure your ailments, and when it's okay to attack. Now you can say the same to them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2012"}

Folklore is old-school with better graphics, fun, pretty, but don't expect much repeat playing.The game centers around two characters trying to figure out why a woman jumped off a cliff, one a reporter, another thought it was her mother. The mystery is not yours to solve, as you compelete each level in the game the story plays out, but that's annoying. There's little voice work and almost no animated cut scenes. This is not bad, but the cut scenes look like comic books, you read the bubbles. It's boring, tedious and pointless. The story and the adventure don't matter to eachother. See, all you do is walk through each level / area and fight until you destroy the main monster guy at the end. Then you take the other character and complete the same, exact area. Then you talk to everyone to update the story and go to the next area. Not much of an adventure, certainly not an RPG, more like, Halo.Now, there's some nifty gimics. There are no weapons. When you kill you take a soul, you assign that soul to a button and use that monster as a weapon. There's a hundred monsters, (according to the box) so I'm presuming there's as many weapons. The boss-battles are very Zelda-ish in style. A large monster in teh middle of the screen, a speacial combiniation of things to kill it. This is okay, but borrowed and familular.You can fight and power-up, boring, but usefull -- in that way it's like an RPG, and only in that way.Folklore is fun, but painfully simple, it's beautiful, but pointless.

Danzig","summary":"A Crack in the Formula","reviewText":"As a longtime fan of the Ratchet & Clank games on the PlayStation, I have to say that I am quite disappointed in this second R&C; PS3 game.The R&C; games have always been above all easy to pick up and fun to play.  Intuitive in the extreme.This latest installment is WAY too complicated.  The story is too intricate, the new weapons and procedures are too difficult, and even the space navigation system is overly fussy and complex.  In particular, the recording system that Clank must use to proceed practically gives me a headache.You know the game is off the mark right from the opening cut scene, a ponderous bunch of blather about time.Of course, there continues to be plenty of humor, most emanating from the intergalactic goofball Captain Quark, but IMO Crack in Time falls far short of the exhilarating perfection of its immediate predecessor in the series, Tools of Destruction.I hear that the next R&C; title will be an online melee, which I will also pass on.  NOT interested.Some have complained that the R&C; games have become too formulaic, but there was NOTHING to complain about in TOD (except that I wish it had been longer), and I could happily play more adventures like that one for the rest of my life.So -- I hope the developers get back to basics after they get their meleeing out of their system -- and return the R&C; series to the intuitive and supremely enjoyable gameplay that TOD delivered in spades.Those looking for the supreme R&C; adventure should check out Tools of Destruction instead of Crack in Time.  It's the most fun you can have in life short of having sex, riding a great roller coaster, or eating a well-made brick-oven pizza with top-quality ingredients!UPDATE: This is the first R&C; game I've played that I'm not going to even try to complete...  The Clank recording sequences are simply unbearable.  Even working with a walkthrough, I find the sequence of actions so tedious and elaborate, I completely lose interest.  This game is supposed to be fun, not work!  It reminds of the worst of the Jak and Daxter games, not the giddy romp the previous R&C; adventures have been.

{"product_name":"B003O6FV8S","description":"","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"Just Dance 2 is a worthy successor to the original","reviewText":"The original Just Dance was the first dance video game to feature \"real moves\" to popular music. Before it, dance games were basically exercises in timing--stomping your feet on a mat or moving your hands to match an on-screen pattern. But with Just Dance, you weren't just playing a video game: you were learning real dance moves that you could take anywhere. And as you played the game over and over, you got a great workout without even knowing it. The game was a smash success, selling over 4 million copies worldwide. The game wasn't without its faults though, the biggest of which was the accuracy of the motion control. Even if you did the moves perfectly, sometimes the system wouldn't register them.When you start out the game, the starting menu is refreshingly simple. There are three options: Dance!, Store, Extras. When you click \"Dance!\", you see three options: Just Dance, Dance Battle, and Just Sweat.The \"Just Dance\" option gets you right to dancing to individual songs, just like in the original. Up to four players can play, each holding their own Wii remote. As in the original, you try to follow a mirror image of a silhouetted figure on the screen. Stick figures scrolling along the bottom of the screen will help you prepare for the next move, an indicator on the screen will tell you how well you hit your moves, and a \"score gauge\" will fill up with each correct move you make.There's a great selection of 44 new songs, with something for everyone. Whether you want to dance to Elvis Presley's \"Viva Las Vegas\" or Outkast's \"Hey Ya\". I like Ubisoft's approach; while other music games tend to focus on just one genre, Ubisoft included something for all ages and tastes.Some of the songs feature \"Duet Mode\". These songs are identified by circle icon with two figures standing with their back to each other. This is a neat new feature that allows two players to dance alongside each other with each doing different choreographed moves, so you end up dancing a neat little routine together. For example, in Avril Lavigne's \"Girlfriend\", the dancers start by pointing to each other. Then, one makes air guitar-like moves for a while while the other swings her arms. Then, the two go back to synchronized motions. It makes for a cute dance routine.The \"Dance Battle\" option takes players through five rounds of competition. Up to four players can compete against each other, and the winner of each round gets a point. The player with the most points at the end of rounds is the winner. You can mix and match from these modes to create different competitions:- Classic: In this mode, players \"just dance\". The player with the highest overall score gets a point.- Duet: This mode consists of all the \"Duet Mode\" songs. The player in the pair who scores the highest gets a point.- Simon Says: In this game, while dancing an icon will appear randomly for each play while dancing (Stop, spin around, clap). The player must perform the action accurately to score points.- Medley: In this mode, each player has to dance to five song samples.- Race: This is a frenetic mode where each player has to fill their score gauge to win the round.\"Team Battle\" is the same as \"Dance Battle\", except that it allows up to 8 players to play in two teams (they don't all play at the same time, the system will separate the players in the teams and display the players' names when it's their turn). This is great to have at parties where you have can get lots of people playing together and rooting their own team on.My favorite new feature, of course, is \"Just Sweat\" mode. In it, you set an objective of calories you want to burn, and then you just dance away until they're burned off. 30 minutes dancing sure beats 30 minutes on a boring treadmill or exercise bike, as you not only burn calories away, you get practice learning the choreographed dance moves. And after dancing to the fast part of \"Proud Mary\", let's say I have newfound admiration for Tina Turner!The new \"Store\" option allows you to buy downloadable content, which will even further expand the playability of this title.And now the answer to the burning question you've been waiting for: did they really fix the poor motion tracking?The answer is, happily, yes! Even though the game still uses only one Wii remote, and still doesn't even need MotionPlus, I'm happy to say that the motion tracking picked up my motions almost perfectly. It was even accurate not just to my timing, but also my arm movements and angles. The game developers made a vast improvement over the original in this department.Overall, Just Dance 2 is a worthy successor to the original. The improved motion tracking is just what the doctor ordered, and they made the game even more fun for people playing together. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2010"}

The first had a real \"last-gen\" feel to it, graphically, and what I felt to be pretty horrible playability overall.Not so with Bound in Blood.  Red Dead Revolver was, in my mind, the best western game made thus far, and I think Bound in Blood now takes the title. (of course, RDR was PS2, so thats like comparing different model years for cars, but progress marches on nonetheless).  Bound in Blood has pays strong homage to the Western genre, and like Western movies, a lot can go wrong, but they do it right.  Bandits, deserts, multiple Indian tribes, authentic weaponry, FPS shooting and canoe/horseback/wagon play...coupled with a strong storyline and pretty decent voice acting, they really nailed it, making one the most enjoyable games I've played on the PS3.Graphically, its high-def texturing and epic panoramas of the Wild West.  From eerie ghost towns, vertigo-inducing mining areas, and one-horse hamlets straight out of Deadwood, they paint the picture in 1080p glory.  I'm a details guy, and I extra appreciated the believability of the swirling mists, the small desert whirlwinds, and the shimmering heat effects from the desert valleys.  They didnt have to do it, but it really adds depth.  Heck, even when you click on pause, the game freezes in an old-west sepia-toned pic.Music is strong, game mechanics are pretty solid overall, and reoccuring events like showdowns and kick-down-the-door shootouts with your brother are a lot of fun.  Again, being able to play the game through twice with only small parallels was something added that didnt have to be there but I think adds tremendous replay value.Frequently when your expectations are low, you arent dissapointed, and I went into Bound in Blood with low expectations, but had a great experience.  If you like Westerns, this is a must-own, on your shelf beside your Blu-Ray copy of Outlaw Josie Wales and Tombstone.  Red Dead Redemption comes out next year, and they are gonna have to hustle to top this (although knowing Rockstar, they will).  Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2009"}

No USB connection to the PS3 console is necessary.  All it needs is an AC outlet.  Like the PS3 console, it contains a smart circuit that turns off the charging current when the controller is fully charged.  An AC adapter with 100-240V 50/60 Hz 0.2A input and 5V 1A output comes with the charger.  It can charge two controllers at the same time.  I have only one complaint: To plug in the controller, the user has to line up the controller socket perfectly with the cordless USB 2.0 mini-plug of the charger.  It takes some practice.  An LED light turns red when a controller is under charge and turns green when the charge is completed.  It took 1-1/2 hours to charge my controller from 1-bar to full charge.

I love pretty much ALL (good) RPG's, and Dragon Warrior has never disappointed. That being said, I think that Dragon Warrior 7 might be the best of the bunch...Yeah, yeah, I know. Final Fantasy continues to have groundbreaking deliveries, with breathtaking graphics and symphonic sound. However, strip away the pretenses, and what you have is so-so role-playing action. However, Dragon Warrior 7 delivers on all of the aspects necessary for a good role playing adventure...First off, the game is long. In fact, over 100 hours, to be exact! Also, there is very little in the way of cinematics, and so the gamer is actually PLAYING the entire time (unlike the aforementioned Final Fantasy games). Characters have the freedom to train in over 50 classes (although many of the classes are difficult to obtain), obtaining many new skills and spells. The world of DW7 is huge as well, and also includes forays into the past (in order to unravel mysteries which I will not speak of here). There are a few fun pastimes; for example, you can try to build your own town, or monster park, or you can play a few hands of poker in the casino. The enemies at times are downright difficult, forcing you to use strategy in a few of the battles. There are some twists, and although a former reviewer said the twists were trite, I nonetheless enjoyed the fact that it brought more gameplay. I cannot say enough about this game, but if you like true RPG action, and are sick of games that have you watching movies, I would strongly recommend purchasin this game.

Malone","summary":"I imported it... some preliminary thoughts","reviewText":"After four years of playing imported Japanese RPGs (starting with FFVII in early 1997) I finally reached the point where I could finish them on my own. I was able to complete FFX and Xenosaga in Japanese without ever consulting a FAQ or asking for help from anyone. I was really happy about this. So I was a little dismayed when I imported FFX-2 and found myself stopping before finishing it. Did I get stuck? Not really. It's just that FFX-2's battle system is so fast and frantic that it was too much for me. I never seemed to get comfortable with the ability system. I was pretty upset when I heard that FFX-2 was going back to ATB instead of going with FFX's innovative CTB battle system, but I was upset over -nothing-. This newly retooled ATB system is the fastest, most dynamic RPG battle system ever. It's like Grandia's system on methamphetamines. I hope I can enjoy it more when I can read the menus more easily. It's pretty overwhelming in Japanese, whereas I had no problem with FFVIII, FFIX, FFX, and Xenosaga.The story and atmosphere in FFX-2 is very tongue-in-cheek. Don't take it too seriously. The creators clearly didn't.Basically, I'm surprised that FFX-2 didn't suck me in enough to motivate me to plug ahead until I finished it. That signals to me that something's wrong. But I'm waiting until I play it in English to really form an opinion on it.EDIT: The battle system was much more fun and managable for me in the English version. However, the rehash of FFX's story/characters and episodic/mission based structure left me pretty cold. To me this is yet another mere FF spin-off, falling well short of the high quality of the FF series proper.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2003"}

But honestly, Killzone 2 was a bit more challenging, and even more exciting.

This WOW series could have been the best game ever only for blizzard's idiot way of ruining the game by making classes way more powerful than others, destroying classes you spent forever perfecting in a single patch due to their stupid a$$hole nerfing of classes, thereby making the game supremely unfair and pointless to play for anyone who is not an op class of the month..... The subscription fee's are retarded and a complete waste of money, yes the game is enjoyable at times but not worth the fee rape. You pay 40-80 dollars for the game, another 40-60 for each major update then still have to pay monthly to pay the stupid game. Playing the game or the updates should be free, stop raping Blizzard. Everything you want to attain like gear, items, mounts, rep, achievements etc take forever (on purpose) to rake in your money of course. They set caps on honour, justice, valour, conquest so it takes two weeks min to get one piece of damn gear, dungeons take forever and get boring, after getting fully top geared in pvp gear it means nothing and is a total waste of time due to blizzard's unfair buffing of certain classes (alliance even more so) you die just the same.  For example as an affliction lock I keep gemming up and gearing up, get great damage that usually lasts a week or so the I log in as usual and my damage is a jolk, maybe a quarter of what I worked so hard to get just days prior..  This is unfair and total bs for a customer of your broken game.  Then they want to charge you 20 bucks for a unique mount?!?! wtf! The servers crash if too many people are in a major city for a raid (and you pay for the downtime too), you need other people in a raid group to do dungeons even low level raids that you can solo on a high level character so nothing can be done on your own, every time you get the best (fill in the blank) they just release a patch and make better ones rendering your useless and making it pointless to try and accomplish anything in this game. I spent a lot of time on this game to realize it completely sucks. If it were free to play after paying the outrages sums for the game and all it's extra parts it would be passable but the fact that everyone pays the same subscriptions fee's only to have certain classes benefit and other suffer unfairly is completely stupid and a waste of time. You pay to have all your work undone as blizzard wants, to complete quests, dungeons, raids as blizzards see's fit, the servers crash at random times or in a major city raids and blizzards kicks people for it, not being able to play on tuesdays so blizzard can spend an hour to all day fixing stupid crap in the game rather than fixing stuff that needs to be fixed, getting banned or suspended for doing anything other than what blizzards wants. Seems to me blizzard forgot who the customer is.

I don't think I've had this much fun with a MK game since the second one (yeah the one from the Super NES/Genesis days). MKII was always my favorite, but I may have to stop saying that now. Usually games now days are too in-depth. There are just way too many things to do that end up overwhelming a player sometimes. I felt that's what happened with the last several MK games. This one goes back to the simpler 2-D ways that made this game so friggin' great. No stupid changing fighting styles, nor \"run\" functions. This game incorporates simple button combos like the old Killer Instinct game and meshes them in here. Not to mention that this MK captures the brutality of the fights that the last several MKs just didn't do well, and of course the fatalities are back in full force. There are also several modes to keep you engaged. For me, and this is weird for a fighting game, but the Story Mode has really been the thing that has really captured my interest for this game. It really explains how the MK Universe gets a reboot, and how all the crazy things that happen in the universe unfolds. Plus, it kind of forces you to try your hand at most of the different characters. My only complaints I have are two MINOR things: the Krypt to unlock all the stuff is a little too over-the-top creepy for me, and that this IS a re-boot (I'm getting sick of the plethora of reboots that have come out over the last few years; movies and games alike, but I had to get this game since I do love the MK series so much). Bottom line, this game surprised the heck out of me, and if you like fighting games you need to play this game. Not to mention bringing Kratos in for the PS3 version is a nice touch!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2011"}

Way to hard and time consuming with the larger creature battles.Both times I raced through skrim doing only main quests.I recently re bought it because a friend of mine was talking about all the cool side quests.Now I am going through and taking my time.  Doing everthing the world has to offer.It is pretty awesome.1st the character creation is the best.  Very detailed.Next the world is huge.In this huge world are cities, dungeons, mountains, forests, and it is the 1st living world rpg I have experienced.  This is not a game it is pretty real.I recommend doing as many side quests as possible.  You will find weapons and earn a lot of experience and also magic to help you be more prepared latter on.Also the side quests are about as interesting as the main quest which makes it fun.Also the first time I played it, it froze a few times.The second time I got it is froze once or twice.But so far after the patches it hasn't had any bugs.So if you were putting of getting this because of the stability of the game, I think it's good now.Also I didn't ever experience the slow downs, but then again I havent ever put in more than 30hrs.

The reason is the tremendous realism that is present in both the game play and the environments. You see, I bought this game for two reasons. The first is I really enjoy FPS style games. The second is that Chernobyl and The Area of Alienation are fascinating to me. You see, the entire playable map in the game, with only a few exceptions, exists in reality. The Garbage, the Junk Yard, the Red Forest, Pripyat, are all real locations, and they are modeled in this game with extreme accuracy. If you doubt this, do a Google search for photos of Pripyat and The Area of Alienation or readZones of Exclusion: Pripyat and Chernobyl. It's truly impressive that as you play this game you are exploring the real and strange world of the worst nuclear accident in the history of the world.The realism extends to game play. The weapons in the game are varied and use different ammunition types. They jam, need repaired, and are upgradable with both NATO and other attachments. You can attach grenade launchers, several varieties of scopes, etc...The AI is better than average. Human opponents will frequently flank, hide, and even charge if they think they have the advantage. There are times when they get confused, and begin to run around aimlessly, but those occurrences are rare.A few frustrations include some poorly translated dialogue that is at times unintentionally funny. Things as odd as a shotgun being described as a riffle, or a man in The Bar constantly asking \"Do you respect me?\" I wish that I could have told him no, and then killed him in a dual, just to make him shut his face. Equally annoying are some of the cued dialogue that also repeats endlessly. If you've played the game, \"I said come in, don't stand there!\" has been ingrained in your mind forever.There are now some really excellent mods available for the game, which do among other things, improve the graphics, adds back vehicles (why were they ever left out in the first place?) improves the armor decay algorithm, increase what stores sell, and makes weapons available that were left out (again, why?) of the final product. I highly recommend you research and add some of these mods if you're going to play the game.As an aside, there are more than 3 endings. There are 7-8 at least, but only 2 'real' endings.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-24-2008"}

Luckily, all of the above shortcomings can be fixed by a serious patch.STALKER introduces a number of very smart gaming ideas, features beautiful environments and manages to create a realistic atmosphere in our room. Nevertheless, this still being an FPS after all, the gameplay is so unbalanced that it feels like swimming in thick syrup: a lot of effort adds up to only little progress.Nice new weapons that jam all the time. When they don't, it's almost impossible to replenish their ammo. Enemies that seem to absorb bullets like cartoon characters: they go down only after repeated shots!Your character gets tired and hungry, sure, adds to the realism of the experience - but isn't radiation suppose to cause fatigue as well? None of your enemies seem slowed down one iota...No, I am complaining about the difficulty of the game - it's the unleveled fields that got to me.Playing STALKER made me nostalgic of the original UNREAL (another game which revolutionized the atmospheric environments at its time). UNREAL however was exceptionally balanced: a head shot with a snipper's rifle would take off both your own head as well as any enemy's head.Now, I have a pretty decent system (P4 at 3.2MHz with 2GB RAM and a 512MB nVidia 7600GT on an ASUS P4P800), well beyond recommended requirements, yet it was impossible to play STALKER longer than a couple of hours before either the lagging eventually got to me or the whole thing just crashed. The requirements for RAM alone are staggering...My advice: wait until the next big Patch is available (mind you, patching does NOT support older saved games...)Recommended only for the next generation of PC systems(unfortunately, my copy is gathering dust as you are reading this, waiting for my next system).","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2007"}

The fact that you can recruit monsters to fight on your party adds a bit of randomness, which is nice.  You can change up your party many times and get a slightly different feel for combat each time.  One thing I noticed is a distinct sense of humor here:  It feels rather Japanese, which is nice.

Lustig","summary":"Mindless repetition meets creative thinking","reviewText":"I never played Thief before the PS4 so this type of game is new to me.  For the most part, it's first person with the occasional cut to third person (primarily for climbing).Your character is a thief who lurks in the shadows and &#34;steals&#34; things.  This is a combination of fun and mind-numbing boredom.  The fun is finding a new place to pillage but it's pretty boring searching cabinet-after-cabinet, draw-after-draw, prying open window-after-window.The challenge to thief is to find the hidden goodies that the game designers built in.  To get them all, you'd need an almost infinite amount of time, patience, skill and luck.  In other words: There are plenty of guides on the internet that have the combination to the safe if you can't figure it out.  Some places have puzzles or mazes and the guides help if you get stuck someplace for too long.Thief uses food to repair health and poppies to regain focus.  I prefer it when health regenerates slowly over time but that's a personal preference.The marketplace doesn't make sense.  Even if you complete every chapter, every side mission, every client job and loot every house, you'll still never have enough money to buy most marketplace items.  This make you decide to choose a direction for your character: archer, fighter, stealth, etc. and use all of your money and focus towards those skills and upgrades only.  The idea is that if you used to stealthing around, you probably don't need to upgrade your blackjack or bow.There are a lot of redundant button presses and movement when opening windows, picking locks, sliding through openings, etc.. Some kind of map assist feature would help because the route isn't obvious until you learn the maps.I'm generally not a big fan of Unreal games so begrudgingly I give Thief 4 stars because I played it for a decent amount of time before losing interest.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2014"}

While Spec Ops: The Line isn't a first-person shooter it is again that has a very unusual and semi-interesting premise. The whole sandstorm hitting Dubai and Marines needing to go in for a survivor/rescue mission is unusual and I was kind of wondering where would go. All in all not a bad game if you like third person shooters.  At times I did really like the atmosphere of the game and it does have you wondering where the story will go. Even though the premise of the story is kind of ridiculous still a semi-interesting game.As a disabled gamer I'm always concerned with the button layouts and always appreciate again that add button remapping on the consoles. Unfortunately this game does not have but remapping and you are stuck with only four or five presets to choose from. So for me I was unable to aim down sight and press the fire button at the same time.

A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options.

Lets just say it again!  Fantastic!  Geralt is one of my favorite game characters ever.  All of his speech options are wonderful.  It's like being the kind of man you would be if you were in fact a Witcher.  This is a man who talks like a sailor, and is only good because he wants to be, not because he's been shoved into some nice hero role.  Let us also note he is -dreamy-.  If we were a random girl, we would totally give him our playing card.  That's gone, though.  Playing cards have been traded in for mild sex scenes with very few women.  I'm not going to lie, as much as I complained about my ladylove being a collectible, I really missed it in this game.  Couldn't we of had the sex scene -and- the card?I love the fact that your choices do make a difference in this game.  Yes, the game could be difficult, but it was a good difficult.  The options weren't HARD, since you knew you were just going to come back and play again anyways.  It's not like Alpha Protocol where you suspect that every single option is going to lead to another replay.  Just a few, well placed choices to make your gameplay that much more interesting.It is an action RPG.  I don't really have a problem with that.  Some of my favorite games (Mass effect 2) are action RPGs- if you do prefer a more traditional RPG you may want to avoid this and just remember the first Witcher fondly.The graphics are beautiful!  Mmm!  And not terribly graphics card intensive, either.I still preferred TW1, as I loved it's quirky wonderfulness... but I do think this was a 5 star game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2012"}

This is the greatest Sonic since Sonic 2, and possibly the greatest so far.  The game is highly refined, beautifully crafted, and smooth.  There are two modes of play \"Classic\" Sonic, and \"Modern\" Sonic.Classic Sonic:A polished form of the original Sonic formats, this delivers 100%.  It plays exactly how you would want it to, and has no choppiness or off-beatedness.  So there you have it, at least half the game is exactly what most people are looking for... specifically.Modern Sonic:This is what we've seen in basically every Sonic game from the millenium til now, but without all the gimmicky crap.  It is basically a less restricted version of Classic, therefore being way faster paced, and potentially much more difficult.  You have to get through levels in a much different way, yet it still feels \"Sonicky\"  I think even retro fans will be satisfied with it.You've seen all the levels before, sort of.  When played on the Classic mode, the earliest stages will be the exact same format as they were on the Genesis, but they look much prettier.  But the two acts of each level work differently than in prior games. Act 1 is played with Classic Sonic, Act 2 is the modernized version.  Now you can run through Green Hill Zone and Chemical Plant in a totally revolutionized way!There are also challenges, mini-levels that take place on existing levels with a special restriction or enhancement, and a specific section of the track and a time-goal.  Some are rather tedious and aren't very fun, but the majority are very entertaining and add \"gimmicks\" that really spice up the experience.All in all this is in the running to be the best Sonic yet, and it's really about time.

I got this game over the weekend and have found myself totally addicted to it.  I loved the first Borderlands and now I find myself loving this game even more.  Here is a quick summary of the game.Borderlands 2 is an action role-playing first-person shooter video game that was developed by Gearbox Software.  As with the first game, Borderlands 2 players complete a campaign consisting of central quests and optional side-missions as one of four treasure seekers, &#34;Vault Hunters&#34;, on the planet Pandora. Key gameplay features from the original game, such as online collaborative campaign gameplay; randomly generated loot, such as weapons and shields; and character-building elements commonly found in role-playing video games are in Borderlands 2.I love this game and would definitely recommend it to you.Thank you for reading my review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYK44","description":"","reviewerName":"Joseph Sayre \"Venom Computing\"","summary":"It's gonna be your new Meat Bicycle!","reviewText":"P0 - Overview-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Borderlands 2 comes from humble beginnings, a sleeper hit a few years before this title released, it mixed up the RPG and FPS genre by giving a little of both, all the while proving that games can be fun, competitive and well made even if you're not facing each other and murdering the crap out of your friends. Borderlands 1 put you and up to 3 others out in the world to survive and cash in on pandora's lavish treasures. Money, Guns, Shields, Mods, all there for the taking, and along the ride were some impressive enemies, some hilarious characters and writing, a colorful cell shaded world to destroy. Now It's younger brother intends to usurp its predecessor, but can it?For fans of the series, and for newbies alike, the answer reverberates off the walls, echoes off a distant mountain, and slashes into your brain at 6000 decibels with a resounding yes.Before I get going, this is an in depth review, if you'd like something quick and dry, its at the bottom of this review under Summary. This review is split into 3 main parts: Gameplay, Graphics & Sound, and Story, each has underlying parts. Here is a quick Reference:P0-1 Table of Contents-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P0 - Overview:P0-1 - Table of ContentsP1 - Gameplay:P1-1 - ControlsP1-2 - TechnicalP1-3 - MenusP1-4 - Equipment, Areas and EnemiesP1-5 - Save progression and Multiplayer.P2 - Graphics & SoundP3 - StoryP4 - Summary-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P1 - Gameplay:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P1-1 - ControlsBorderlands controls more or less like the first, with few changes. The Xbox controls shine here, LT is Aim, RT is Fire, AXBY interact. Honestly the game does a well enough job on the tutorial, and its pretty straightforward for a shooter. You shouldn't be lost in the controls. There are a few quirks but they are easy to get used to. One mention worth noting is that getting into vehicles and out of them is a little different than the first game, aside from that though, there is little difference.The game is smooth, the inputs aren't laggy, even on a poor connection and I don't have a major issue with the way characters move, but they are a tad floatier than I'd like, but aiming, shooting and jumping feels good. You don't need to compete with the controller to get your character to do what you want. In short, BL2 is tightly controlled, and commands do what they should.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P1-2 - TechnicalThe game loses a little bit of a foothold here, but it's minor. I've run into a few minor technical issues:I've encountered a few times when my character warps a little or gets stuck on objects a wee bit, this generally occurs on tiny objects or in tight spaces about the same size in height as your character. Sometimes minor glitches occur when moving objects like platforms become temporarily able to be passed through or the game does not keep characters from moving along with them. Some environmental hazards like the geysers on bad connections may not work as intended.**UpdateAs i've played more i've encountered TONS of glitches, ones where Moxxi won't give you a gun and you can't tip her anymore, ones where you can't intersct with certain objects in the world, some where your inventory will be unable to be accessed in the \"sell\" menu of vendors, solid bright colored ammo chests, inability to deal damage with bullets until you zone or die. Certain weapons shooting through enemies entirely, Salvador's Gunzerk doesn't work, and some instances when enemies will exist in the world but you cannot see them. Never see ANY of these in single player. Lag's a cruel mistress.Other than a few minor things which almost never occur, the game is very solid and smooth, no framerate issues with particle effects that I have seen, and environments and enemies do not clip through objects very often if at all, nor do you. However, enemies can and will drop Mission specific items in areas you CANNOT reach forcing you to reload or wait for respawns. However this again, is rare.Physics and enemy movement have improved, as has AI, enemies react to fire taken, being shot and dying much more realistically in this game, expect enemies to be dodgier, more likely to react to bullets fired in their direction, for bullets to have weight and substance and really look like they're causing injury, and to see enemies react pretty realistically to taking a mouthfull of buckshot to the chest at close range (FLOORED!)Technically, the game is stable and generally accurate.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P1-3 - MenusMenus are pretty much the same, but if you didn't play BL1, let me lay it out, you have 5 main screens: Map, Missions, Equipment, Skills and Bad*** points. All of these screens are pretty self explanatory, easy to use, understand, and navigate. The menus in the game are straightforward and serve their purpose, maybe without the flair of other games, but they get the job done.The one gripe I have is the equipment screen, the new focus on the visual interface here makes it a bit harder to use than your previous Borderlands equipment menu. Previously, the menu was text based, showing the name of the gun, then when it was highlighted, you could see the gun's image. Now you need to highlight the gun's image to see its name. Considering you can spam the X button and pick up like 10 guns from the field when you're done with your genocide, this makes it just a BIT more tedious to find the awesome gun you picked up that had a cool name and awesome stats if you weren't paying attention to what it looked like. It's minor sure, but it's there, and this menu IS used a lot so it rears up a lot.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P1-4 - Equipment, Areas and EnemiesEquipment is vastly expanded; shields, guns, mods, manufacturers, grenades, and Customization have been reworked.Shields have been expanded to include new types, and are much easier to equip at a glance based on more stats being shown than in the previous game. Shield types really can change how you play your character, with some that will benefit characters that brawl close, and some that benefit characters that stay back. For instance, spike shields may benefit characters in the fray and add to DPS, while Turtle shields sacrifice HP for Monstrous Shields which are hard to take down and may be beneficial for characters used to keep the team alive, while even others absorb ammo and give it to you, keeping those few shots you take at the edge of the battlefield sniping down even more.Guns, if you haven't heard are also improved, if a new weapon element, Slag, which makes every other type of damage increase when it is used wasn't enough, there's many new effects, models, designs and so many patterns the sky's pretty much the limit now. Finding the exact same gun is nigh impossible. Believe me, that's a good thing.Manufacturers have been more fleshed out, each has abilities that while can slide into some other Manufacturer's designs, brands generally have quirks and abilities that each brand mantains and general incorporates into most of their weaponry. Tediores for instance, are quick to reload and blow up when thrown and reloaded. (Your character throws the gun at an enemy and it blows up, and reconstructs with a full clip in your hand.) Other manufacturers like Jakobs will have common traits like fire rate as fast as you can use your real trigger finger. This game's actually got brand loyalty, in spades! I actually can say that certain manufacturers make better pistols or revolvers than another based on my playstyle. That's how good the differences are. Its brilliant.Mods: Gone are god mods that turn your characters into beasts, they're replaced by mods that give good bonuses early and gradually reach splendor later, combined with the Relics, (Read artifacts) which effect you and your teams actual stats. The possibilities can become much more deep now, these mods allow you to supplement weak points relics or guns may cause, or amplify those same things is now possible. All in all making class mods exclusive to only class specific traits like skills or weapon types was a good move, while leaving relics dealing with stats, making characters just that much more customizable.Customization returns but better as well, with fully colored suits and a selection of heads for the characters, with the ability to unlock more as time goes on through gambling, missions and random drops, it's a lot deeper than the 3 color change options we had in BL1. I still feel we should be able to have out unique names show up in multiplayer matches if we so choose, but it is a minor gripe. The customization extends to Vehicles like it did before, but a tad deeper with the addition of unlockable skins. All in all though its more icing than anything, and I'm glad its there, but it feels a bit lacking.Areas overall are much more varied and in general larger than Borderlands 1. The map also feels larger overall with more places to go. There are considerably more environmental hazards and this Pandora feels much more dangerous than the last one because of this. Moreover though, each area has a much more distinctive feel from each other than in the last game. I appreciate the livid, lush, colorful environments, and the sand that does return in this game is much more fun to navigate, with dunes and hills everywhere. Pandora never feels unwelcoming to the player in this game, it feels dangerous, but never like the planet is a barren dustball devoid of anything interesting, and that, Is a good thing.Enemies have been reworked, first of all they are rendered much better. Secondly the numbers of them, and the levels they are make a lot more sense, and though more varied, their placements in the world also look more accurate. For instance Skags aren't everywhere in this game, they show up, but generally where it makes sense for their character types. So their numbers are dropped, but for the level, they're still pretty dangerous. New enemies like Bullymongs, look and interact with their respective cold and rocky environments much better than older enemies like crabworms and scythid, which didn't really look like they belonged in the environments they were in.  Bullymongs are white or very dark grey, they're hairy and large, something typical for arctic types of hunters. They look in place, and most of the enemies in BL2 follow suit. In addition human enemies change outfits and strategies based on location. A large bruiser enemy's equivalent is a Nomad, but each fight differently and look very different due to heat in the area and clothes worn, though the tank role is the same.Finally, skills have also been expanded, each respective skill tree feels more focused and is actually longer than the previous game, making for a much different character with each tree build you choose. Not only that, but some skills you can obtain by THEMSELVES completely change the way you'll play the game with a given character. BL2 features more skills than ever, and each is leaned and primed, and obviously tested to give each tree a unique feel.Lastly in customization is the bad*** points. As you complete challenges, your rank goes up, as your rank goes up, you get points, the more points you use, the more your characters' skills go up (across all playthroughs) and its just another way to customize your guys in the skills YOU think are important.In short, borderlands 2 made almost every aspect of the original deeper, and more fun to play with, resulting in a deeper, more immersive game.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P1-5 - Save progression and Multiplayer.Saving works the same as the last game, with autosave and saves automatically when you exit, but the way the game handles Multiplayer missions has really changed things up. In the first game, missions you weren't eligible for weren't doable while in a friend's game, so essentially playing together for exp was the only reason to multiplayer post ending a game with friends you intended to rejoin after they had progressed more. No longer a problem. Joining another game keeps track of ANY missions completed in other games and allows you to skip them upon returning to your game. Allowing you to progress to where you were before you joined to your friend and then with a simple push of the button pick up where you left off.Multiplayer, if I'm not mistaken is host handled differently than last time, I see very little lag even on poor connections, and is vastly improved as far as lag shots were concerned from BL1 (shooting where an enemy actually was instead of where he was on your screen)Overll, Multiplayer is much better with these improvements.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P2 - Graphics & SoundGraphics are marginally better on the 360 version than the previous game on 360, but shading seems vastly improved. The game does have some texture pop in (thanks Unreal Engine 3) but it's not too bad. The game offers more textures and a better day night cycle feature resulting in a much prettier environment, and that's only good. Voice talent and the snappy writing make a return, combined with excellent sound effects make for an immersive, but cartoony appearance and experience.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P3 - StoryThe story here takes much more precedence than the last game, there is a clear cut villain, (who is quite villainous indeed) and the size of the story keeps the game running almost twice as long as the original. With plenty of sidequests that are provoking, funny, sad, and satisfying. The game's story is cliched (what with a mad guy taking over the world) but it works, and it works well, with much more story than your average 6 hour campaign on a typical FPS. Total play time is I'd say 20-30 hours in length with the ability to go through again for a more challenging experience with all of your stuff.The story is long, satisfying and well written with plenty of sidequesting breaks with their own stories, this time around, Pandora feels more lively, which again, increases immersiveness and fleshes out characters more, which is a nice touch.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------P4 - SummaryBorderlands 2 is a must play on any system, its good writing, decent graphics and physics, combined with infinite replay ability, diverse environments, excellent sound and voice work make it one of the best games of this year. Its rare to see a polished game like this. It really does seem like Borderlands 2 was made with lots of love and lots of testing and tweaking to get it just right. The infinite customization of your character through guns, brand loyalty, other equipment, bad*** rank, color schemes and changeable skins make this game not only fun to play with, but fun to show off too. With a long campaign, a better mission system, a more fleshed out set of characters and villains, Borderlands 2 is a must play for your library, and a recommended purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000SSPH3E","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"One of the Finest Fantasies Out There","reviewText":"Final Fantasy Tactics was without a doubt one of the greatest Playstation games out there.  Starting off as a cult classic it became a big success when it was released later as a Greatest Hits package.  Ten years later and Final Fantasy Tactics is still one of the best Final Fantasy games ever made.Of all the Final Fantasy games, Tactics has arguably the best story out there.  It's full of emotion, political intrigue, fantastic characters and it's very deep.  If this is your first trump through Final Fantasy Tactics, prepare to be dazzled.  It's still one of the most absorbing in the series.  To the point where you'll be sad to leave when the whole thing is over.  The game is also backed up by a fantastic new translation that out does the original and makes the world of Ivalice come alive.  The translation alone may actually warrant Final Fantasy Tactics The War of the Lions worth a buy even for those who played through the original game.It's the gameplay that makes Final Fantasy Tactics a treat, though.  Thanks to the job system, customization is nearly endless.  Before each battle you can assign jobs to your characters.  Each job has specific traits about them and can greatly affect how you perform in battle.  Mages have devastating magic abilities while Knights are strong physical attackers.  They also bring their own unique abilities to the table.  Because there are so many job classes to choose from, there's a lot of experimentation you can do.  As you master abilities you'll also be able to mix and match.  You could have a Squire casting white magic, for example provided you've learned some of the white magic abilities.As battles progress you gain experience.  You pretty much gain experience after each and every turn, which is nice.  Not only do you gain experience but you also gain job points to help you master the abilities in your job class.  It's pretty simple stuff and you'll be surprised at just how fast you can learn abilities here.Final Fantasy Tactics provides its own challenges, though.  Not all your enemies are taken down easily, and if you don't take advantage of the opportunities to improve your characters abilities you'll be overwhelmed before you know it.  When they say Final Fantasy Tactics, they're not kidding.  Sometimes little simple mishaps in your strategy can cost you a battle.  Not only that, but even doing things such as casting spells you must be careful with because if any of your characters are in range, they'll be struck by that spell.  You also have to be quick about reviving characters otherwise you lose them forever.  If your first plunge into Final Fantasy Tactics was with the GBA version released in 2003 you'll be in for a rude awakening.There is also a multiplayer thrown in there.  You can work with a friend or battle friends.  First there are melee battles where you can battle up against friends and then there's the Rendezvous Battles where you'll team up with a friend.  These let you get some rare and hard to find items that are otherwise unable to be obtained.While Final Fantasy Tactics is a great game, it certainly doesn't do as much in the technical department as it does in the gameplay.  The game itself doesn't really look any different from the game released ten years ago.  There's little, if any, enhancement to the graphics at all.  For the pleasure of story, however, there are some pretty cool cutscenes thrown in that are incredible looking.  These cutscenes are truly artistic and in depth.  While those cutscenes are beautiful, it's a shame Square-Enix did little to update the games other visuals.  Despite the cool cutscenes, though, there are some slow down issues in battle.Music wise, though, Final Fantasy Tactics easily has some of the best music in the series.  It's still memorable to hear and can still give many video game soundtracks a run for their money.  While the voice acting isn't as good as other video games, they add a lot of depth to the cutscenes.Surprisingly, there are quite a few differences outside of the translation to Final Fantasy Tactics The War of the Lions.  New characters such as Balthier appear.  There are new missions exclusive to the PSP version as well as the multiplayer aspect of the game.  While there aren't a huge assortment of new items and abilities, you'll find War of the Lions takes a much longer time to master than the original.Final Fantasy Tactics: War of the Lions is a great re-release of a great classic.  While it's still a good game a bit more could've been done to update it.  The technical issues will probably annoy some fans, but for the most part you're getting a good game.  Even if you have the original, this one is worth a look.Pros:+A fantastic storyline+Beautiful soundtrack+New job classes+Good cutscenes+Addictive gameplay+Tons of customization+The New Translation is far better than the original, making even the experience of the story completely different for those who went through before.

I should qualify this with the fact that I'm a fairly big fan of the Mario series in general (I also don't like rating anything with a perfect score), but this game needs to be experienced by as many people as possible. The environments, enemies and power ups within the game are simply amazing in their variety, accessibility, explorability (is that a word?) and sheer fun.  I've never tried to get 100% on a game before, this game was the first to convince me to do so.  I've played it from start to finish and gotten the (much more) difficult green stars (yes, all 120 of them) and still wanted more.  The controls are spot on and the graphics are brilliant, if you own a Wii, purchase this game; there is no reason not to.  Oh, and the word I was going to sum it up with was masterpiece, because that's exactly what it is and it will be remembered as such.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2011"}

Unlike so many other star wars games, this is a first person shooter, which is a great touch to the star wars universe. I found the gameplay to be very well done with the healing stations on the battlefield and your squad always with you to revive you if you fall in battle. The coolest thing of all is that instead of carrying multiple weapons, you have attachments to one gun. The attachments are sniper, and rocket launcher. The single player campaign is outstanding, though the multiplayer is so-so. This game is simply a terrific Star Wars title.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00503E9FY","description":"","reviewerName":"Fish Hunter \"Eddie\"","summary":"3 Different Aspects to Rate","reviewText":"Main Menu gives you three options. Campaign which we've all played, Multiplayer and Special Ops.Not a whole lot to add to what everyone else has said about it.  It definitely feels \"plotted out for you\".  You get into some of the later missions and their is not a real flow to it.  You've shot for awhile, now it's time to be a sniper or use the AC130 or Helicopter.  Overall I give the Campaign a 3.Multiplayer the guys are professionals.  Play at your own risk.Spec Ops is where this game hits a triple. Either on line or splitscreen.  You can run Solo also. You have three choices within Spec Ops to play.  They are Survival, Missions and Chaos.  Haven't tried Chaos yet.  Played a few missions and they seem pretty boring.  Survival is pretty awesome.  Either alone or with a splitscreen or online friend you have to survive wave after wave of attack and each wave gets more difficult.  You fight local insurgents, troops, helos, bomb carrying insurgents and dogs, and the dreaded juggernaut(s). On easy it's mission 6 before you get to battle a pair of helos and just helos.  Its wave 10 before you encounter a juggernaut.  On 15 its 2, and 20 its 3 juggernauts.  On the insane level its wave 3 and you're battling everything at once.The Maps:  Most are some sort of cityscape.  However, some are harder to defend than others and it wasn't truly applied to the level of difficulty.  For example one insane scape is perfect for evading and defending.  One less difficult level has an incredibly dificult scape.You can get to level 50 in rank (I'm 43) and I think you get 30 waves, not sure on that.  Highest I've seen is 30 and I've been to 25.  You have three seperate weapons areas where you can by weapons of a certain group.  Guns & Ammo, Explosives & defensive gear and Air Support/Delta force & Perks like Quick Draw.On the Resistance map I believe it's best to set your defense around your Gun stores because of the lay out.  However, I've seen several people set up inside a house near the Air Support store.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-17-2013"}

Each car handles differently and performs just like in real life.  There are several different views including one from inside the car that replicates the interior exactly.On the other hand there are not as many car choices as in some of the previous versions.  There is still no damage to your car and that makes the game very unrealistic and arcade like.  You can hit a wall doing 150 M.P.H. and no damage.

But I for one could not have been more disappointed.Basically, you run from room to room or corridor to room to corridor to room and whip monsters constantly by jumping around and pressing the fire button.You do this constantly.I repeat constantly.With no environmental interaction. Very little character growth (ie. experience, weapons). Very little of anything!You can't even look around the rooms to enjoy the great graphics! (Not as great as Devil May Cry. The wall clipping is a bit goofy too).The only &quot;puzzles&quot; you have are bacically navigating a few rooms and finding buttons or sculptures to push to unlock doors. Some rooms use the very bad camera angle to &quot;challenge&quot; you. (If you know what I mean).Eventually you come to a boss and defeat him and return to the castle entrance to pick another &quot;world&quot; and beat another boss. When you beat all 5 or 6 bosses (can't remember how many) you advance to towards the end half of the game.I felt tired of mashing ONE button for hours, travelling through similar and I mean SIMILAR rooms and corridors. Fighting a boss or two then repeating.Is this really what Castlevania has become.

So it stands to reason that the sequel for a new generation of consoles would continue that upward trend that has been established.  It does.Start up Resident Evil 5 and the first thing you'll notice is the amazing graphics.  The character and environment detail are among the best availible for 360 today.  Rather than feeling like you're in a restrictive space, you do feel like you're walking through a realistic setting.The over-the-shoulder style first seen in RE4 is brought back again.  And for a pleasing change of pace, your partner Sheva is actually helpful rather than a child you need to babysit.  She does have a tentancy to waste ammo on enemies, but for the most part, Sheva can really help you out of a bind sometimes and also gives you ammo if you're ever in need.The game is challenging, but not to the point the it decreases the level of enjoyment.  A major difference between RE4 and the sequel is that RE5 is a very progressive game and rarely has you double back and return to ground you've already covered.  This makes for less time spent finding key cards and trying to unlock doors.  The story unfolds like a well written movie and forces you to guess as to how the game/movie will end.This may be one of the best games available for Xbox 360 today.  The game offers a lot of gameplay hours and plenty of replay value.  Pick up a copy of this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Caleb Williams","summary":"Greatest Game Of 08 Has Its Flaws","reviewText":"On the viewing of the first trailer for GTA IV the world took a deep breath and said \"Holy Crap\" and that feeling carried on right up until the actual games release date when people queued for hours in anticipation of the game, but after all that hype the real question to be asked of people is, \"Was it worth it?\" Both yes and no for truly different reasons and with my review I plan on giving both the pros and cons to this game but I'm sad to say that they're primarily cons, but let's first focus on the biggest pro of them all.Pro: The Attention to Detail: The Liberty City map isn't massive as we were warned in pre-release interviews of the developers, though we had the map size reduction we were given an immensely detailed surrounding. The roads, the walls, even the trees have some interesting detail to offer when simply walking around the city. You come to notice things that you start to think to yourself, was there really a point in putting that in the game when it's sacrificing the activity content of the game.Con: The Lack of Size: As mentioned before we were given pre-warning that the map would be considerably smaller than that of San Andreas. The truly bad thing about this is that the most enjoyable thing about San Andreas was the truly divers environments contained in the massive San Andreas, yet given the smaller Liberty City we are limited to one very clich&eacute; setting of a bustling city lifestyle.Pro: Duck & Cover/Police Search: This has to be the biggest improvement in the game altogether as it gives us a much more realistic element to the whole experience of GTA. If committing a crime there either have to be witnesses or a cop nearby, if there are none of the pre-mentioned then simply the cops wont be after you but if you have a wanted level and are driving around in hope of escaping the wanted circle but are unable to because your car is familiar to them, you have the ability to switch cars and if done properly you can drive carefully past a Police car without them being aware that it's you in the car that they're after. This makes the experience ultra realistic and along with the ability to duck & cover so if you enter into a gun fight with the police you can take cover behind a car door and keep on shooting.Con: Lack of Stuff To Do: This is the biggest flaw in the game and really ruins the replay value of the whole game. In San Andreas there were literally hundreds of activities that you could perform at your leisure if you were bored with performing mission after mission. You could go sky diving, swimming under water, dancing, gambling etc. etc. the list goes on and on but with GTA IV we are given an immensely detailed environment  but at the sacrifice of the activities and I feel this is the biggest letdown.There are many other cons and many other pros for which I could go on about for hours but I'm going to stop at this as it's something a GTA fan should experience and decide for themselves. This should be a part of your collection as it's simply something that could be considered a part of gaming history, after all it's one of the very few game franchises that has seen its tenure cross the 3 generations of the Sony Playstation and if current sales figures indicate anything, I think we can guarantee that this will be a series to continue across many more game generations.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00CXCCH1I","description":"With its first new major sports league partnership in over a decade, EA SPORTS presentsEA SPORTS UFC. The next-generation of fighting has been built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and XBOX ONE by the team behind the critically-acclaimed Fight Night franchise.Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology,EA SPORTS UFCbrings the action, emotion and intensity inside the Octagon to life in ways that were never before possible. The next-generation of True Player Motion not only showcases the diverse, powerful and fluid of attacks of elite mixed martial artists through Precision Movement, Dynamic Striking and Strategic Submission Battles, but also brings the combatants to life with Full Body Deformation and Real-Time Exertion. The simulation of Human Intelligence takes leaps forward with the strategic and adaptive MMAi system and is expressed through the most realistic characters ever created in a sports game.Feel the Fight &ndash; Gameplay FeaturesStep into the Octagon with the most realistic take on fighting ever achieved. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE technology, every fighter, strike, takedown and submission will make you feel the fight.&bull;MMAi&ndash; A mixed martial artist&rsquo;s mind is as important as his heart. Every licensed fighter in the game will have changing goals and fight plans, based on their real-life tendencies and each fight situation. Stop their Plan A, and they will adapt to Plan B or C. Down on the scorecards, look for the AI to end the fight with a knockout or a submission. A smarter opponent equals a more challenging and unpredictable fight.&bull;Full Body Deformation&ndash; Until now, simulation of physical contact between fighters was limited to bodies that barely made contact with each other; as a result, they looked and behaved like action figures made of plastic rather than elite athletes. The team that revolutionized sports by bringing authentic physics to the Fight Night franchise changes the game again with an all-new, full-body deformation system that moves and displaces the fighter&rsquo;s flesh in real time. For the first time, the strength of every submission and power of every strike will truly make an impression.&bull;Real-Time Exertion&ndash; A UFC bout is one of the most physically demanding sports on the planet requiring mixed martial artists to give it their all with every movement. Real-Time Exertion brings each moment of that action to life in your gameplay experience. Through real-time vein popping, skin discoloration, muscle flex, as well as signs of fatigue setting in through the course of each round, you will witness the effort it takes to be one of the best fighters in the world.&bull;Fighter Likeness and Facial Animations&ndash; EA SPORTS UFC will set a new bar for character likeness and emotion in gaming. For the first time in an EA SPORTS game, every single licensed athlete in the game has been created from high resolution 3D head and body scans to deliver revolutionary character likeness and authenticity. Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, new facial animation technology delivers more expression, emotion and will communicate greater sense of awareness and intelligence in the Octagon.&bull;Precision Movement&ndash; MMA is a sport of inches, where every step counts and every movement matters.  Powered by EA SPORTS IGNITE, the Precision Movement locomotion system grounds the fighters, eliminating unrealistic slipping and sliding across the canvas. More realistic physics-driven movement delivers more realistic action as the overall transfer of energy from the ground up delivers more impactful and believable strikes and takedowns.&bull; Dynamic Striking&ndash; A mixed martial artist uses the environment to his advantage and for the first time in a UFC game, you can too. A dynamic environment allows you to pull off jaw-dropping moves using the Octagon, including roundhouse kicks, superman punches and much more. Combine those abilities with the best striking technology in the industry and that one perfect strike could change the fight.&bull;Strategic Submission Battles&ndash; To own the belt, you have to be dominant on your feet and on the mat.  EA SPORTS UFC re-invents the ground game to create a battle for position and control that captures the strategy of a submission battle. Like the real sport, in EA SPORTS UFC fighters will work through multiple stages as they work to advance or escape from a fight-ending submission.&bull;Real Damage&ndash; Every fighter knows that one good shot can ruin your day.  EA SPORTS UFC introduces a non-linear damage system which can result in big damage coming from a single strike. The system produces a greater variety of cuts and contusions that is true-to-life and has never been possible in a simulation fighting game.","reviewerName":"Stephanie","summary":"So boring","reviewText":"This game is so boring, i thought it was going to be fun but then i realized its by EA","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2014"}

And I sympathize. It was almost an afterthought. Set in New Vegas in 2281 this game has many, many factions who all seem to have a problem with each other and each has a deep story. There are the two big players: the New California Republic and Caesar's Legion. They are vying for control of the Hoover Dam for obvious reasons. Then some of the smaller factions like the Omertas, White Glove Society, Great Khans, Powder Gangers, The Kings, The Boomers and so on play their part in the grand scheme of things. And with each you can gain a level of respect or infamy. This essentially determines their reaction to you and if your infamy is high enough with a certain group, they may just open fire on you. You are of great importance to the ruler of the strip - the enigmatic Mr. House, who claims to have been alive when the first bombs fell in the first apocalypse of 2077. I have to say there are many facets to this game and it is one of the more impressive stories I've seen in a game.Interaction is somewhat more complex now as you have a running tally of your reputation with certain groups. For example, if you help out a group and don't ask for caps to do the quests you'll likely gain fame quicker. If you blackmail them into paying more, you may just receive the title of neutral or accepted as opposed to idolized. I've had conversations with so many people which changed the outcome of a quest. My favorite thing is that you can use your skill points to affect how much money you'll receive or even your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. points to observe and change dialogue options.Gameplay and Combat 7 of 10For the most part, the gameplay is identical to Fallout 3. You still go on quests, help people out (or don't). You have choices in the dialogue to decide how you're going to influence them. There are probably between 100-200 total quests. Many start off with one part and then branch off into other optional parts depending on how good or evil you want to be. Some of which will take you a few hours alone to complete. The gameplay value is just unbelievable for how much the game costs. I'm currently 42 hours in and I'm likely only halfway done.Combat as well is very similar to Fallout 3. However, you now have the ability to take human companions with you (one at a time) and a robodog named Rex. They can be very helpful. Essentially you'll come across them in your travels and you can try and convince them to come with you. Then you have the ability to command them on how far back to stay, how to attack, what types of weapons to use and their life story - quite literally. They'll attack anything that you are fighting and you get the full XP even if they kill the enemy by themselves.However, one of my biggest gripes with the combat is that you will almost undoubtedly walk into areas where you aren't supposed to be. By that I mean you're too weak to fight the enemies there and you'll be killed forthwith. Here's an example: I walked up into the mountains to go exploring and these giant mosquitoes called Cazadores assaulted me, poisoned me and I was dead in three hits. Similar things happened with Deathclaws and Radscorpions later on in the game. The worst part is this can happen anywhere on the map. Apparently there are certain areas you're just not supposed to be until later on in the game. Watch out!Casinos 6 of 10 (not factored into game rating)There are several casinos in New Vegas, but there are only three \"big\" casinos on The Strip. The Lucky 38 is closed off to everyone except for Mr. House and you and you can't play anything because it's closed off to everyone. The other three casinos are open to the public, but I spent more time talking to people than gambling in them. There's really only Blackjack, Roulette and slots to play as far as I know. I really didn't bother with the casino games because I made a lot more money a lot quicker by just exploring or stealing stuff. It's just like in real life - the house ALWAYS wins. And if you win too much I've heard you'll get banned from them anyways.Graphics 7 of 10There's not much to say about the visuals in Fallout New Vegas. The landscape is on par with Fallout 3 in terms of quality and detail. People seem to look somewhat better and more lifelike, but the graphics are nothing special. The obvious reason is that the game has bugs as it is, you don't want it freezing up because of the graphics as well.Character Development: 7 of 10Most of the leveling in New Vegas is identical to Fallout 3. There are generally the same perks as well. There are a few new ones and some other ones that have two sides to them now. One such is the mysterious stranger and the female version which is called miss fortune. The level cap from the expansion pack however was carried over to New Vegas with 30. And you will absolutely need to be above level 20 to go exploring in certain areas. This is explained better in the gameplay section.Weapons and Crafting: 8 of 10This is without a doubt the largest cache of weapons I've seen in a game. There has to be over 100 different types of weapons and I believe half of them are new. Some of the most noteworthy: the anti-material rifle which is a .50 caliber sniper rifle, the marksman carbine which is a semi-automatic replica of an M4A1 marine firearm, a grenade minigun, C4 plastic explosive and a bunch of new energy weapons. I can't go into much detail about the energy weapons as I focused more on bullet based firearms for my character. And of course the favorites are back - mini nuke, missile launcher, gatling laser etc. One really nice stat displayed for each weapon now is called DPS which is the amount of damage inflicted per second. Added in New Vegas is the ability to upgrade your weapons with things like scopes, long barrels (accuracy), larger clips, quicker firing and better weapon condition. Also, there is a threshold on the weapon which if you keep the weapon's condition above, it will always do max damage and never jam.New Vegas has the old workbenches still but now has things called reloading tables where you can create ammo for your weapons if you have the proper materials.  There are now hollow point bullets for damaging unarmored enemies and armor penetrating bullets for the more Kevlar or scale enhanced enemies. These have been indispensable in taking out the giant radscorpions or ghoul reavers. Normal bullets can be woefully ineffective against these enemies as I've been killed easily in the past. So the game is far more balanced in terms of combat. If you're smart you can survive without having to bankrupt your ammo supply. One thing I noticed is that your character's level will pretty much determine what types of weapons you can buy/find. In other words, you're not going to find a missile launcher at the local trading shop at level 4. In fact, I still haven't been able to find a mini-nuke launcher or the diagram for very many creatable weapons (I'm level 27).ConclusionIn all, this is a good game. It suffers from most of the common problems that a Bethesda game does and a couple of new ones. Loading times and freezing top of the list. There is a lot more patience involved than you'll need in a common FPS. It is considerably more difficult than Fallout 3 in my opinion, but more balanced. And of course you can change the difficulty at any instant in the game. The game is more addicting at the beginning than it is pure fun. But once you've hit a groove, Fallout: New Vegas will grow on you. It isn't revolutionary like the first time you saw the V.A.T.S. combat, but if you are fan of action RPGs and have lots of free time it's worth buying. For those new to the genre, you should rent it and see if it's up your ally.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2010"}

Rhodes","summary":"A good game for a starving RPG system","reviewText":"The Gamecube, for as long as I can remember, is perhaps the most neglected system for RPGs.  XBOX has KOTOR, Jade Empire, and more.  PS2 has the Final Fantasy games, Xenosaga, Star Ocean, and tons more.  Why the hell would any RPGer want to get a Gamecube then?RPGers now have something on the Gamecube, that's actually an original game (not some port like Skies of Arcadia or Phantasy Star Online), and it's a damn good original game at that.Tales of Symphonia centers on the dying world of Sylvarant.  The world is slowly losing its mana and \"The Chosen\" must go on a quest for regeneration and restore mana to Sylvarant.  It all goes back to ancient times when the tree of mana was planted to give the world energy.  Does it sound cliche?  Sure it does, but as the story moves on you'll see some of the most jaw dropping plot twist in any RPG that ultimately takes you away from the world of Sylvarant.  Are you saving the world?  Or are you saving the universe?  You decide.Gameplay wise, Tales is probably one of the funnest games ever.  To be frank, battle is in real time.  When a battle starts you take control of one of four characters (you can switch, but only outside of combat).  Each character can perform techs, magic, use items and such.  Since it's real time you can easily run around and take your time.  To put it frankly, it's an action/adventure battle system.  If you liked Star Ocean's battle system, you may like this one.  It's also multiplayer with up to four people.  Battling is also contact-based rather than random battle like Final Fantasy.Surprisingly, in battle, your AI is incredible!  You can set the computer up to do anything and be content with what they're doing.  If a character falls, the computer will revive them.  Not all the strain is put on you.  YOUR AI CHARACTERS ARE ACTUALLY SMART!  Customizing them is endless as well.Small problem with the battle system though.  Should you be playing with more than one person, the camera only stays centered on PLAYER ONE!  So if player one runs away from his allies, then your friends won't be able to see what they're doing.Learning techs is also intersting.  Each tech must be used fifty times.  Once that happens you can use the tech again and a character will randomly learn another.  But this is certain on two things.  Your characters level, and what \"Type\" they are.  Characters are either \"T-Type\" or \"S-Type\".  If you don't want a character to be T-Type you can easily make them go the other way.  Likewise, if you odn't want a T-Type skill, you can make a character S-Type and make them forget T-Type skills.There's more.  What type your character becomes depends on \"EX Skills\" gotten by EX Gems.  There are four levels, all of them varying in many different ways.  Each character has his or her own set of skills.  You can also combine EX Skills to form \"Compound EX Skills\".  Each time you put on an EX skill, you're deciding whether your character will be T-Type or S-Type.  The more S-Type EX Skills you put on, the closer your character goes to S-Type and vice-versa.Dungeons--if you can believe this--are actually fairly small.  Most of them have puzzles or two, and they're not hard.  You can fly through dungeons just like that.  But don't think that this makes Tales a short game.  The first time through you'll easily spend over sixty hours playing, and that's not including every side-quest.Graphics wise, Tales is a beautiful game.  Anyone who likes anime will love this game.  If you don't like cel-shaded graphics, then you'd be shooting yourself in the foot by buying this game.  But it does look gorgeous, and the frame speed isn't slow either.Soundwise, the game has its moments.  A few tunes can get repetative very quickly.  The voice acting is good, and much like Star Ocean, you can skim through most of the dialogue if you happen to read faster than your characters talk.  There are moments where it's clear the voice actors tried too hard, but it's forgiveable.Tales of Symphonia is not without fault though.  Can it hold a candle up to Final Fantasy.  You better believe it can!  But much like Final Fantasy, and any game, it has its faults.For one thing, the story is repetative!  Especially at the beginning of the game.  It DOES go in a different direction later, about at the middle point, but then a few hours after that middle point, we end up doing the same thing we did at the beginning of the game with a different character!Also, later on in the game (MUCH later) backtracking becomes to prominant.  You'll spend a lot of time running back and forth between towns that are VERY far from each other and sometimes--literally--in a different world!  And you don't move very fast on the world map.  It becomes to be very annoying, very fast.  The game also won't let you get too far ahead.  You won't be able to explore an are before you reach it, you'll automatically leave.The game is a good length, and it has TONS of sidequest, but lets face it.  A long RPG tends to have a lot of meaningless dialogue, and portions of it that mean nothing to the actual story, yet you have to go through with it anyway.  In Tales, there are A LOT of meaningless moments.It's also a disappointment that you can only carry twenty of each item.  Dungeons may not be long, but battling is tough!  It sucks when you have to constantly run out of the dungeon to buy more items (this same problem plauged Star Ocean: Till the End of Time).  Then when you come back, all enemies are there again, and they WILL give chase if they see you.However, there are more good things to make up for the minor small ones.  For one, the game is FULL OF SIDEQUEST!  You think Final Fantasy has a lot of side-quest?  Think again, these side-quest will keep you busy for hours!  The optional bosses are challenging, but the rewards are worth it!The characters are also loveable.  It's perhaps one of the most important thing in an RPG to have characters you like (after all, you'll be stuck with them for 80 hours!), and Tales has likeable characters.For an RPG deprived system, Tales of Symphonia is just what the Gamecube needs.  It's a great game that can rival Final Fantasy in so many different ways.  One of the most amazing storylines I've ever seen, and some of the most addictive gameplay.  There's also high replay value with you being able to start over and \"inherit\" certain things based on your score at the end.Tales of Symphonia is an incredible game!  If you're an RPGer with a Gamecube, you actually HAVE something now.  Rejoice, Tales is a game that gives even Final Fantasy a run for its money.The Good+LONG game (over 60 hours)+Enticing and engaging storyline+INCREDIBLE PLOT TWIST!+Loveable characters+INCREDIBLE BATTLE SYSTEM!+AI Characters are actually smart!+A good challenge+Tons of side quest, with awesome rewards+Beautiful graphics+Lots of replay valueThe Bad-In battle the camera only centers on player one-You can only carry twenty of each item?-Way too much backtracking and running between towns... and worlds-A good story, but for the most part it's repetative-60 hours but about 20 of them are spent doing nothing that relates to the story, and leveling up your charactersReally, this deserves five starts but the cons were a little daunting at times, but look at all those pros?  You tell me Tales of Symphonia isn't worth the buy?  It's an incredible game, that any Gamecube RPGer should get!  Grab it.  Play it.  Enjoy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2005"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Making the leap, and taking a stumble","reviewText":"The Tekken series makes the leap to next-gen with Tekken 6, which finds Namco's long running fighting franchise continuing to supply spectacular fighting action. First things first though, while Tekken 6 still sports the same deep fighting system that it has for quite some time now, it isn't without its flaws. Campaign mode, in which you play as new character Lars and take down waves of baddies. The mode is inconsistent and suffers from a bad camera and stiff controls, and while it appears to be marketed as Tekken 6's main mode of play, any veteran of the series knows that the real meat and potatoes lies within the arcade mode, as well as the Ghost Mode carried over from Tekken 5: Dark Resurrection. Online fighting is sadly pretty laggy, but Tekken 6 does boast a huge roster of fighters to choose from and unlockables as well, and if you have the patience, the end reward is worth the effort. All in all, Tekken 6 isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but it is definitely worth the trip regardless, and definitely one of the better fighting games you'll find on the market today.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2009"}

It hurts me to not give it 5 stars but I have to be honest, the games kinda easy, sure it's super long, but back in the day of the old castlevania games, they were just so challenging in terms of obstacles and amount of enemies. But with this game, with all the save spots, free extra health and lack of extremely hard obstacles it's kinda hard to die. Although, if it had been that hard then I probably wouldnt be playing it over and over again.

At a time when side-scrollers were falling to full 3-D games, Konami proved that there was still room for a good 2-D game in the gaming industry.\"Symphony\" boasts impressive environments, huge bosses, multiple endings, creepy music, and more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at.  My only problem is that it's just too much for me to remember--when I'm being mauled by Beezlebub is not the time to look up the \"Dark Metamorphosis\" spell.  If you take the time to learn all your spells, as well as the ins-and-outs of all the Familiars, though, you won't have that big a problem.I have just a few picks about the game:1.) As stated before, the inventory/spell system is HUGE and can be intimidating.2.) Voice acting.  Aughh.  Wish there was an option to turn the original Japanese voice acting on, like you can in \"Lament of Innocence.\"3.) Bosses.  Bosses are typically easy, provided you have enough health-restore items.  However, I frequntly found myself being turned into a bloody pulp (literally) by the sheer numbers and strength of ordinary enemies--isn't it suppossed to be the BOSSES who kill you over and over again?Don't get me wrong, \"Symphony\" is one of the best Castlevania titles to date--but if you're looking for a more user-friendly Castlevania game, I suggest \"Aria of Sorrow\" for the Game Boy Advance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00B59L9T6","description":"The fear that was originally brought to players in Resident Evil Revelations on the Nintendo 3DS system returns redefined for home consoles complete with high quality HD visuals, enhanced lighting effects and an immersive sound experience. Furthermore, the home console version will deliver additional content including a terrifying new enemy, extra difficulty mode and improvements to Raid Mode such as new weapons, skill sets and the opportunity to play as Hunk and other characters from the series. Raid Mode, which was first introduced to the series in the original version of Resident Evil Revelations, sees gamers play online in co-op mode or alone in single player taking on the hordes of enemies across a variety of missions whilst leveling up characters and earning weapon upgrades. The critically acclaimed survival horror title takes players back to the events that took place between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil 5, revealing the truth about the T-Abyss virus. Resident Evil Revelations features series favorites Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, plus their respective BSAA partners - Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat.  The action begins on board a supposedly abandoned cruise ship, the 'Queen Zenobia', where horrors lurk around every corner before players head for the mainland and the devastated city of Terragrigia. With limited ammo and weapons available, the race is on to survive the horror of Resident Evil Revelations.","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"It's back!","reviewText":"Resident Evil Revelations is great! After the disappointment of RE6, I was thinking that the series was headed in the wrong direction permanently, but Revelations has slightly reassured me. It's not ambitious in what it sets out to do, but by keeping things simple it provides a very acceptable RE experienceFirst thing to note is that this is a port from a hand-held console game, so it's not up there with the crystal clear graphics of 5 and 6, however it looks perfectly acceptable to me. It certainly looks a lot better than I was worried about.  The best thing about it is that it is something of a return to the very first game, as the main action is all set within one single location - a large abandoned cruise ship. What this means is that the entire map cannot be opened up at first, but by gradual completing of stages or finding of the now famous \"shaped-keys\", various locked areas that you encounter early on are returned to much later in the game, which to me gives a nice feeling of completion.The story sees Jill Valentine and a new partner named Parker coming aboard the empty, adrift cruise ship the Queen Zenobia. Of course it's not really empty - something horrible has happened and the ship is teeming with monsters! As the pair explore the ship they encounter all types of obstacles that need to be surmounted, and nasty creatures that need to be dispatched. All the staples of the series are here - finding gradually more powerful weapons, finding the aforementioned keys, double crossing characters, sequences set against a countdown, the lot.The game plays borrows some elements from the later releases though, The game nearly always has you playing as one of a pair - although your partner is purely AI controlled and seemingly indestructible like in RE6 - but with one difference: they can't harm anything! Any shooting or attacking they do has no effect. I found this out when one one occasion I decided to let Parker clear up a room with one remaining monster in it as I wanted to save ammo - well he shot away at it for almost 5 minutes and the darned thing never got any closer to death. So basically the partner is just there for show. However I didn't mind so much because I wanted to be the one in control.As I said, the graphics are pretty good, particularly if this is scaled up from a  handheld game. Maybe a little low on detail, everything looks a bit \"smoothed off\", but it really wasn't a drawback at all.  Oh, and some fights are HARD! Unlike RE6 where everything was too easy, in RER, wait until you reach the battle on the Promenade Deck with the infected \"Comms Officer\" (you'll know the bit when it happens!). That fight is tough, and there are others like it. Which is a good thing.Things that perk up the game a bit more are the chapters where you play as other people. At certain points in the game you are suddenly whisked out fo the Queen Zenobia and playing as Chris Redfield on a snowy mountain, or Parker in a shiny skyscraper office! This is confusing as you have a totally different weapon set so it's difficult to manage your inventory when they keep switching you around. And some of the stages are flashbacks! However these sections add variety if nothing else.There's still more - you can upgrade weapons with spare parts, simple but fun, and theres a special \"Raid Mode\" (outside of the main game completely) where you basically just battle through sections that get harder and harder, gaining better and better equipment and abilities. A bit mindless, and similar to (but not quite as good as )\"The Mercenaries\" from earlier games.So to sum up, I enjoyed this. Far from being a filler game to cash in on the series' reputation, this is a genuinely worthwhile addition to the franchise. Finally something that feels like the original Resident Evil again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00007KQE9","reviewerName":"Veil_Lord","summary":"Good But Not Perfect","reviewText":"I like this kind of game.  Sometimes I'm just in the mood for mostly mindless violence.  This game fulfills that in spades.  In the last level of one of the campaigns I killed 1800+ enemies.You get the feel of being part of a real army.  Your other generals lead troops and below them you have majors and such who control smaller groups.  The enemy has similar.  You can affect the course of battle by assassinating enemy commanders.  This raises your morale and helps your warriors.  As you earn rank you can get a larger and larger group of bodyguards, up to a maximum of 8.  They can either be normal solders you fight all the time or some cute women guards.  I chose the women because the enemy uses them less and it's already hard enough to tell which soldiers are on your side and which are enemies sometimes; colors are often very close to each other.It's got some limits though.  The soldiers don't just stand around like in Devil Kings, but they don't exactly fight each other realistically either.  They still stand there looking at each other a fair amount.  The levels can also get a little confusing as to how you complete them and are in some cases a bit cheap.  One level where you have to kill an escaping general before he reaches his boat has him running away mid-battle even if you reach him in time.  Still, the in-game save feature makes this game a lot more mellow and removes some of the pure rage you'd otherwise feel getting cheated out of a win otherwise.This is a really good game.  It's probably even worth buying new, but if you can get it cheap used it's a no brainer.  The only catch, if you don't like mindless hack and slash you should probably avoid this game, but otherwise GO GET IT!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2012"}

This time karts are customizable (not too many options). Drivers can choose character, cart, wheels, and glider. Karts all come equipped with the same propellor.(spoiler, but if you've played any Mariokart game, not really) There are 8 grand prix collections, with only 2 to begin with. New parts are earned by collecting coins in Grand Prix. New drivers are earned by winning 150cc grand prix's. Gold wheels are earned for getting at least one star in every grand prix. (spoiler)So far the game plays well. As usual, 50cc is more for learning the track and controls, 100cc helps you adjust to turns at higher speeds, and 150cc is complete chaos because most tracks are relatively short. Achieving stars on grand prix can be difficult, as it is dependent on the number of coins collected, and some levels have very few coins.Spotpass is pretty cool, and makes collecting ghost data and records of friends faster.New VS modes and levels have been added to a few classic levels. I haven't played VS yet, so I don't know if the lag is as bad as MarioKart DS.Overall some nice features have been added, but I still can't decide whether I like the addition of the propellor and glider. The customization of karts is nice, but generally the most ridiculous options yield the best results. Its fun, and will hold my attention when I'm stuck in the car or procrastinating for midterms, but nothing really new. The 3D again is a nice feature, but doesn't really help gameplay, and if your like me and turn the system every once in a while it can be the difference between first place and falling off a cliff (Lakitu keeps stealing my coins :/ )","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2011"}

My fears seemed to be realized when I hit the first Quicktime events. At the urging of my son, I persisted, though it took me at least two hours of play before I really got the hang of how the game really worked. At that point it sucked me in. Almost. There remained the problem of Quicktime events and a really jarring, and quite lame, cut scene story that takes you out of the game.The greatest part of this game is how well the open world mode works. Ironically, that makes the restricted missions and \"railroad\" cut scenes all the more jarring--it's like two games in one, with one being truly great.Possible spoilers:I also got the distinct impression that the original game was extended by adding a second island. The guy you thought was the main boss wasn't. Worse, you don't even get to really kill either based on your ability; instead you are subject to a truly awful series of cut scenes with quick time events. All that matters is how well you mash keys. It was extremely anti-climatic.My other main criticism, though minor, is that taking out enemy bases got a little tedious. There were times that I deliberately let alarms go off just to make it more challenging. I wish a little more thought had gone into making the end-game bases much more difficult in every way.Again, however, the great parts of Far Cry 3 are truly awesome.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2013"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Spectacular","reviewText":"The DS has received some wonderful RPG's and strategy games as of late, and Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift is no different, and in fact, this may very well be the best of the bunch.  Anyone who remembers the original Final Fantasy Tactics will be happy to know that this game bears much more resemblance in terms of tone and overall gameplay to the original game than Final Fantasy Tactics Advance ever did, and is also one of the best games that Square-Enix has unleashed on the DS thus far.  The judge system from FFTA is used here yet again, and it is used quite well and offers some rewarding moments of gameplay during battles.  The game's strategy mechanics are top notch and are the best to be seen on the DS, and the game is a piece of beauty to look at as well.  Undoubtedly one of the best looking games to grace the DS yet, nearly everything presentation-wise is a work of art from the art direction and design to the game's score.  There are tons of customization options and lengthy quests as well, meaning that Final Fantasy Tactics A2 will definitely keep you busy for quite some time.  While it doesn't feature the most engaging story or anything that hasn't been done before, Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift is a spectacular strategy game that delivers the goods, and stands as the best third-party strategy game to hit the DS yet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"J.  Martin","summary":"Buggy Game, but Also One of the Best!","reviewText":"This is probably the best game I've played in years. I have to say I think this game has Half-Life beaten by quite a bit. The game is essentially an RPG-shooter type of game, or perhaps action-RPG (but also has guns and other modern weapons as opposed to swords and such). Bioshock comes packed with an intriguing and mysterious story of a quality I don't think I've ever experienced in a video game.Bioshock is totally compatible with the Xbox 360 controller for Windows PC. The game works flawlessly with this controller. Anyone who wants to play the game with the Xbox 360 controller for PC will appreciate how easy it is to activate the 360 controller controls in the games menu. You can easily switch between using the Xbox 360 controls in the game menu, or using the keyboard and mouse controls if you prefer that.Gameplay and fun aside, the game is good for other reasons. For one, this is a very thought-provoking game. Walking away from playing it will leave you thinking. In my case, it left me with a certain sensation and overall mood that I don't typically get otherwise without reading a particularly thought-provoking book.This game has only two downsides that I'm aware of. The first one, as the title implies, is that the game has lots of bugs. I experienced crashes with considerable frequency compared to other games I play. Of course, other people I know say that they never had any such problems with crashing. So different people seem to have different experiences with regard to the crashing, but I had a few crash issues.The only other downside that I can think of at the moment is the fact that the retail edition of this game contains SecuROM. If SecuROM bothers you (as I personally believe it should), it might be a good idea to buy the Steam version of this game instead since that version does not contain SecuROM. I own the Steam edition, and I love it.I would strongly recommend this game to people who are looking for good games they can use their Xbox 360 controller for Windows PC to play, people who like RPGs, people who like games with an intriguing and thought-provoking story, and also to people who like first-person shooter games. This is a high quality game that has certainly earned my recommendation, and I am personally looking forward to seeing Bioshock 2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2009"}

Which allows players to control Desmond, a bar tender in the future of Dec. 2012 (dun dun dun) as he is put into a machine that allows him to access and control an acesstor's memory while trying to save the world. In the third installment (technically the 5th) we are in controll of Conner who is another ancestor of Desmond. Conner is a Native American during the American Revolution. So expect to to take part in historical events while meeting our founding fathers (Sam Adams, George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, etc).I am a huge fan of American History especially of that of the Revolution so this was a great experience to see 18th Century New York and Boston in its glory. What is new to the series is the inclusion of animals. In past games you would only see the horses to which you can ride, which are still in the game. Now we have dogs, pigs, and chickens. But what is more is there is also bears, deer, wolves, bobcats, etc in the forest to which you can hunt and skin to be able to sell for some extra cash to buy weapons, gear etc. Its a fun addition that focuses more on quick time events when the animal is attacking you as you must be quick in pressing buttons at the right time.A huge improvement is to that of the Homestead. In past games it was already set up, you have to buy stuff to improve it. This year its an empty forest space. You have to do whats called Homestead Missions to get people to move to it. Then do more the further improve it. Its fun and nothing too challenging. But besides that the side missions arent as good. As in past games there was a tomb you can explore to get an item to further your game skills. There arent as many just a few to retrieve items to find another item. They are a lot smaller then in past games. There are other side missions where you look for Big foot, a ufo, the headless horsemen and other mythical creatures. In other words I believe the side missions could be better but they are still enjoyable.A new feature which some are saying is the best feature is naval time battles. Where you take control of a ship and battle other ships. Its a fun thing to do as you most watch the winds and either raise or lower the sails while trying to avoid rocks, cliffs and cannons.In past games, one feature which was fun, is the ability to climb buildings like a kid in a playground. This year they have expannded it to the point where the forrest is exactly like that. Trees, rocks, cliffs and branches can be climbed as if they were a building which most of the time, its a fun thing to do. Swing on branches as if you are Tarzan.Now for the flaws. The are tons of bugs and glitches. Now there was a day one patch to fix this but you will still encounter them a lot. Also unlike previous games, the hero's (In this case Conner) motives are questionable. As in past games where the assassin is doing things through honor, Conner is more on this path for revenge. Dont get me wrong so was Ezio (who some say was the best assassin) but he still had honor. Also this is the last game for Desmond's story so fans were expecting an epic ending. I wont go into detail but its disapointing.Should you get this game? Yes, its still a very fun game to play. If you are new to the series, this is the perfect game to start off as it gives a sumnmary of the story so far at the start of the gamePros:-American revolution setting-Hunting animals-Being able to climb trees, rocks, branches, etc like you would a building like in past games-Take part in histroical events and meet the founding fathers-The Homestead is more interactive-Naval BATTLES!!!!-Perfect game if you never played a previous gameCons:-The ending-Bugs-Conner's motive's are questionable-Side Missions can be better","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2012"}

I'm going to be honest, I didn't really like it when I first tried it.  I wasn't into it yet.  But the more I played the more I got into the single player story, the more world I had to explore, and the more weapons I had to kill the new types of enemies.  The graphics on the 360 are very good, they are pleasant to look at and the world of Far Cry 3 is enormous.  The landscape (which is slightly smaller than Skyrim) is full of jungles, beaches, mountains, towns, and animals.  The variety of weapons and their customizability is awesome.  You can buy many attachments and paint jobs for all your weapons.  The AI in the game are very good as well.  They are smart in that they look in the direction they hear you in, but cannot actually spot you if you are hiding in plants or behind other objects.  My favorite part of this game is the stealth.  As you progress through the game you learn skills that allow for many different types of takedowns (basically assassinations).  However if you don't like stealth, thats great too.  This game allows you to dispatch enemies however you want.  If you want to drive in with a jeep and splatter a few people, then get out and mow people down with a light machine gun thats an option too.  I have to say the grenade launcher and RPG are very satisfying.The entire package of Far Cry 3 as a game is, in my opinion, excellent for your money.  You get a long single player campaign (that I thought was quite fun), a huge world filled with enemy outposts, radio towers to clear, and challenges, along with a co-op campaign, multiplayer and even a map editor!  I really liked the endings to the single player campaign, they left me feeling accomplished like I haven't felt after another game in a long time.  Exploring the world is very enjoyable, and there is so much to do outside the main quests.  Trials of the Rakyat are some of my favorite, where you kill waves of enemies with given weapons in a certain time frame.  The crafting system of the game is rewarding, it allows you to expand how much ammo you can carry and allows you to make syringes to give you various in game bonuses.  The co-op campaign was fun as well but not nearly as good as the main campaign.  The map editor is very complex, which I think is a good thing.  It's like forge in Halo, once you understand how it works you can basically create any sort of map you want.  I am not much of a fan of the multiplayer in this game for a couple reasons.  One is that their are so few people playing it that it is impossible to even ever find a game in some gametypes that I would like to play.  Another is that the leveling system allows people of much higher rank than you mow you down with very powerful weapons while you struggle with crappy ones at a low level.  I understand that many games are this way, but I wish it was a little more balanced.  Maybe if this game had more people playing multiplayer I would get matched with people my rank with similar weapons.Other than multiplayer I only have one major complaint: Why the differences in gameplay between the Single player Campaign and the Co-op campaign?  What I mean is, why do I get detection markers in single player but not in co-op?  Why can't I throw rocks in co-op?  Why is their no marker for takedowns in co-op?  Going from single player to co-op feels like losing stealth :(My measly complaints aside, it really is a great game.  I would buy it just for the single player campaign and the huge open world.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2013"}

After finishing it (60+ hrs w/o DLCs; 80+ hrs with all 5 DLCs), here is what I thought.**********PROS.**********LONG, JUST VERY LONG AND ENTERTAINING RPG: These days when most of the games (even RPGs) are 10hrs, it was a rejuvenating experience to play this long RPG. Just like other RPGs and games in general, while some elements were redundant, it has plenty of variety to offer as you progress in the game. Even after playing 50+ hrs (not even touching the awesome DLCs), there were always exciting and unexpected events in the game. Great job Bathesda, great job.CHOICES, CHOICES, CHOICES: In this game, just like Mass Effect and Bioshock, you will have to make choices, lots and lots of them. And each choice you make will have major consequence on the outcome your missions and game all together. Again wonderful job. There will be time you will make a choice, finish the mission,  get the results and out of curiosity replay the same mission again (assuming you saved before the mission), to see what outcome you might have gotten if you were to make a different choice.KARMA METER: The choices you make will give you extremely positive to extremely negative karma. And different karma will change behavior of people of wasteland towards you allowing you to do different missions, unlock different achievements and different rewards. Depending on the choices you make, you will turn certain groups into your friends and others into enemies. Words simply can't describe the experience. You have to play it get the feel for what I am saying.OPEN WORLD: Yes you are free to roam in wasteland and go wherever you want to go. I personally loved it. While to progress in the story you have to go to specific places on the map. You can take whatever route you can take and complete whichever missions you like.SURPRISES WHILE ROAMING IN OPEN WORLD: This was one of the strongest aspect of the game. While roaming in open world and exploring new areas and wastleland towns, you never know what you are going to encounter. While a lot of open world games have the same type of enemies and areas in open world, this game will introduce to plenty of varieties. Can't tell more without spoiling.RPG ELEMENT: As you defeat enemies, complete missions, solve conflicts and progress through game, you gain experience and level up. Leveling up will allow you to enhance your traits and unique abilities (for example, your aiming, your melee power, unique abilities like  your conversation skills, atomic explosion when you are damaged enough etc.)COMBAT MECHANICS: The game is First Person Shooter for most part, but it has unique combat mechanic.  While playing FPS, you can freeze time so do speak and target specific enemies part for higher damage of decapitate them. This can make game very strategic as some enemies faster or bigger than others and sometime enemies can have devastating weapons. So if you use this time freezing and aiming trait well you can target specific body parts or their weapons and slow them down.VARIETY IN ENEMIES: A lot of long games becoming boring in short time as they have the same enemies over and over again. But that is not the case for this game. As you explore the wastleland, you will come across plenty of different enemies ranging from thugs and little creatures to heavily armored soldiers and super mutants. LOVED IT JUST LOVED IT.DECENT STORY: While it is not the strongest aspect of the game, it does have decent story with somewhat of a suspense and oh depending on the choices you make, story and ending changes.DIALOGUE TREE AND GOOD VOICE ACTING: If you played Mass Effect than you know what I am referring to. While talking to different characters, you can choose what you want to tell them. You can be charismatic and friendly or you can be rude. You choose. Again what you choose affects the end result of the game. To me what was nice was these dialogue were well designed and voice acting of hundreds of people you talk to was much better than what I expected. This truly makes gaming experience more rewarding.(IF YOU HAVE GOTY)FIVE DLCS = 10+ MORE HOURS OF GAMEPLAY: The five DLCs will add to the main story of the game, but in addition it will take to you to a hidden slave town, alient space ship, pre-nuclear explosion war era and on a mystic island. I loved all five of them especially the island and story+ dlcs.INCREASE LEVEL CAP TO 30. If you don't have these dlcs, you can level up only to lv 20, but if you have these dlcs you can level up all the way up to lv 30. That means more traits, more choices and more unique powers.******************CONS******************GLITCHES: This is simply unacceptable. There are glitches in the game that can make you go crazy. For example for me I completed a mission and I didn't get achievement unlocked for that particular mission. Fortunately for 360 version a lot of these are fixed by patches. Nevertheless you will still encounter some.LEVEL CAP: I also didn't like you can only level up 20 or 30 depending on which version you have. I wish they would at least let you level up to lv 50 and get all the traits possible.****************CONCLUSION*****************I truly wish they would have worked hard to fix the glitches, but contrary to those glitches this game has a lot to offer. 80+ hr of gameplay paid me back every single cent I spent to buy this game. I highly recommend this game to RPG and FPS lovers. If you can get GOTY (9.5/10), if not then at least give normal edition a shot (9/10).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2010"}

This is the kind of game that breaks up marriages.  I lost myself in the Fallout universe while playing this game.  You will be calling into work complaining of \"stomach cramps\" or whatever bull hocky excuse you can come up with just to play this game.  There is so much to do and explore in this game, it blew my mind.  The graphics really draw you into this post apocalyptic universe.  The main storyline is quite enjoyable, but the side-quests are what really steal the show.  From taking on giant mutant ants, to cannibalistic families inviting you in for dinner, this game never ceases to surprise me.  I really enjoy the old-fashioned sounding music they came up with too, it actually sounds like old-timey music.  The slow-mo effect, while not anything new, is rock solid fun.  I also enjoy all the mature content, if this had been released with a teen rating i would have killed someone in slow-mo.  This game is a keeper, you won't find yourself at the local gamestop pawning this one off for 5 bucks store credit.

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"Mike Harris","summary":"Awesome!","reviewText":"This game is not just awesome, but this game also has exellent humor!Pros:Great Humor: Munch burping etc...Awesome game play: interesting level designs, etc...Challlange: Pretty much a challange, it toke me 4 hours to complete on of the levels on the game.Cons:Can't think of any!Overall: 5/5I will highly reccommend this game to anyone who like adventure games, or likes the other oddworlds.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2005"}

MP3 is less forgiving, you feel like you are really vulnerable and you have to plan your tactics (most of the time, more than once) to survive a saving point or even a level. Enemies can take a lot of bullets, you do not.Something that I am really enjoying is the character development; yes, it is cheesy, but you will have a feeling of sadness and at the same time is kind of funny listening to MP talking to himself (I think this is totally intentional and part of the game design). ***spoiler*** Also, I really liked the gameplay in the Favelas. The Hoboken part was also nice, however, I can tell you Hoboken does not look that way, at least not nowadays.I am not giving 5/5 because in my PS3 I have experienced some technical issues, not show stoppers and not that many, but again, compared with my benchmark, they were significant.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2012"}

Unlike, say, God of War 3, I had absolutely no knowledge of the Red Dead \"series\" until I read about the game leading up to its release last month.  Needless to say, I decided (after looking into it) to purchase it and while I'm hardly finished (I just started, actually) I must say it is truly an enchanting title.  I never played, nor got into the Grand Theft Auto series so I didn't know what to expect in terms of gameplay, but the sandbox style is certainly engaging for a newcomer like myself to the genre.  The PS3 version is graphically quite brilliant, however I came across several glitches in the beginning (my horse, hitched to a post, kept walking backwards and stalling with its legs on top of the post itself until I pressed \"Ride\") and graphical bugs that seem to hit the PS3 version over the Xbox 360 one.  Notwithstanding, I enjoy riding from Point A to Point B (after falling off a cliff, I realized the second time I was riding on a slope that I encountered new scenarios along the ride, which makes it even more tempting to spend more time just riding).  One issue I've had is reining in (literally and figuratively) my darn horse - that thing has a mind of its own, and if you don't pay attention it'll wander off and get into trouble (I soon came to therealization horses are not the smartest of creatures, at least in Redemption).  The voice acting is superb (John Marston's voice perfectly suits his character) and the graphics are stunning.  Gameplay appears to be equally as brilliant.  Overall, Red Dead Redemption is a title that lived up to the hype preceeding it, and a worthy addition to your collection.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2010"}

If I had a choice of whether to play Gamecube or DS, it would be the DS.  One of the reasons is because of Yoshi Touch and Go.  I can't stop playing it.(8 score) Plotline: Continuing the story from Yoshi's Island but from a different view point. A stork is carrying 2 babies when Kamek attacks and the stork drops both babies. You must guide Baby Mario to the ground collecting coins(The more coins you get the better the Yoshi)and dodging enemies. Bay Mario can only take 3 hits and then Game Over. After 1000 yards(3000 feet) of falling, you'll land on a Yoshi's back and try to get as far as you can wuthout getting hit or you'll die(Talking about Marathon mode).Fred's Marathon High score: 6780 yards(10 score)Control: Rather simple, poke Yoshi to make him jump, draw a line to make a bridge of clouds, encircle enemies in clouds to turn them into bubbles and slide them, and poke somewhere on the screen to throw an egg at the designated area.(9 score)Sound: Classic Yoshi grunts and noises. All the noises for the enemies are still the same. Music seems rather classic and fits the levels nicely.(7 score)Graphics: The graphics aren't as good as those of Yoshi Island because they don't look as crisp. The graphics seem to fit the game though...(8 score) Multiplayer: This would seem like a big thing for this kind of game but it's not that great. You can still do single-card play or multi-card play with multi-player. This is sort of like marathon mode only it's not never ending. The person who gets to the end will win but if someone dies the other person wins. A lot of people would think that you would get there at the same time but no. Say there's someone who doesn't like to waste eggs and likes to dodge enemies while the other person is all about killing everything. The person who likes to dodge would be behind the person who likes to kill for a little while because he's creating more paths to cross because he's making a lot of bridges. But he'll eventually catch up because the person who likes to kill will probably run out of eggs.(9 score) Entertainment: Yoshi Touch and Go is one of those games that's good for playing about 30 minutes at a time and those 30 minutes will only seem about 5 minutes. So this game is a great time killer if you have nothing better to do. This game is rather amusing to play.(10 score) Glitches: I've come across no glitches in this game.(8 score)Replay value: Even though this game has no story mode, it still has 4 great game modes you can play. I would consider Marathon mode to be the main mode because it's never ending and has an assortment of levels that are randomized so you'll never know what level will pop up next. Most people consider that the days of getting the best high score are over. But they're not, it's the thing that keeps thriving you to play. A never ending game mode will provide a good long game time.Overall score: Check my personal ratings below.0-5 Bad, 5-6 So-so, 6-7 Okay, 7-8 good, 8-9 great, 9-10 excellent.It has to be above 6 for me to approve the game to recommend it to you.Yoshi Touch and Go: Fred's Score:8.6(Game is approved.)If you liked this review go to [...] to see reviews for games, tips,ads, and news of upcoming stuff.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2005"}

You are only really able to go one direction and you have few options for exploration. There are usually two ways to handle an area: stealth or run-and-gun. It seems to rely heavily upon linear design with the occasional big set piece...but the big set pieces are not exactly riveting.A huge set piece where you fight the same enemy repeatedly for the rest of the level loses most of its impact. The guns seem underpowered against mutants...horribly so. The mutants tend to be bullet sponges, which makes mutant swarms situations where you must be tight with your allies because, unlike you, their guns tend to take them down.Your weaponry is really effective against humans. You get the usual weaponry, except with the addition of pneumatic weapons which, while slow due to the need to pump up the air tank, can hit with tons of impact. Grenades are nearly impossible to use effectively as the AI, for its assorted flaws, is really good at getting out of their way.The economy is based on trading military grade ammo, which is more powerful than the much more prolific dirty ammo you normally use. Its a conceit that never seems to have a major bearing on the game as the gun most useful for an area can usually be looted early in the area. One huge problem, though, is that you are not really advised how the system works. My first visit to a market was baffling to me.The gameplay is less than stellar...but the atmosphere is really good. You feel like you are in a nearly hopeless situation, fighting forces you barely comprehend. The outdoors are irradiated, devastated, and laden with mutants who can effectively kill you with ease.  Anytime you go outside, you are required to wear a gas mask. Only problem is that you get attacked by mutants and the gas mask isn't invincible. Plan on swapping them with ones from corpses regularly. The NPCs act as you would expect most people to behave, but anytime you are given an ally for a mission, they seem to almost be Messiahs, which hurts the reality quotient a bit. Basically, it seems they wanted to make you Gordon Freeman...but, instead, made you normal and made everybody else Gordon.Metro 2033 is a solid title, but not one of the elite FPS out there. It's not bad, but I cannot state that there aren't many games with better mechanics out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0H0NU","description":"Batman: Arkham City Armored Edition Wii U","reviewerName":"John S. Dean \"John\"","summary":"Enjoyed it except for the advanced training missions","reviewText":"I've never had a Batman game before.  Only other \"superhero\" type game I ever had was a couple of the Spiderman games, simply because of the unique movement through the environment compared to the first person shooters that are my normal bread and butter on a game console.I purchased it specifically for the Wii-U because I like the Pad's integration in games.  Spiderman, Lego City Undercover, it adds a nice touch.  And here, as well, it adds to it.  Like Lego City Undercover, when you're talking to someone via radio, you hear them on the speakers of the pad.  However, this was my first strike on the game - when you turn OFF the sound on the pad (such as when you're playing after kids are in bed using headphones) then it does *NOT* automatically put the sound through the normal output with the rest of the things so you can hear it on the headphones.  That was one thing I got used to on Lego City, that if I turned off the volume on the pad, the radio conversations would play both sides over the headphones then.  Not this one.  And I had several instances where even with the pad volume on, I'd only hear one side of the conversation, it would glitch the other.  And sometimes it was the main character's voice missing, not the one that would've played on the pad anyway.There are a lot of combo moves.  If you're not a fan of having to memorize a ton of button combinations for one game, then pass this one.  But that being said, you can survive just doing the basics.Flight is frustrating.  Just gliding around and grappling to points to move is easy, but there are \"advanced\" challenges that require some serious accuracy as to when to stop your  fall when flying to get into a tunnel or something, and being a 2D video game, it can be a  pain getting that change from dive to level flight at just the right moment.  In the forums people talk about having tried a single challenge for two days, and giving up and putting the game away.  The challenges don't appear to be tied to finishing or even progressing the game (I haven't finished the game yet, but I've advanced pretty far and to this point not finishing them isn't causing me any issues), but I understand their frustration, dealing with a couple of them myself.Graphics are smooth - even flying around and having the cityscape all around.  Combat is smooth with only a couple instances of hesitation and delay.  There are a multitude of attacks to choose from, but you may get bored with the nonstop fighting since each fight is pretty much like the next.You also can pick up \"Riddler trophies\" which are hidden things scattered around the city.  Most have switches or puzzles of some sort to figure out to open a cage holding the trophy.  Some you can't get till later in the game, so if there's one you can't figure out, just mark it on the map and come back to it later when you have more gear and more options.The interaction with the Wii-U game pad is very well done, other than the sound glitch.  But I also had issues when I would go to the upgrades page, since initially it never let me scroll to the sides, so I never knew there were more upgrades available than what was shown on the first page it displays for each category.  When I finally tried again since I had maxed out everything I could early on, and found that it could scroll, it wouldn't STAY scrolled, and kept reverting back to the first page.  Eventually I got it responding right, but it took a bit.  But those were the only glitches with the pad so far.Switching from Batman to Cat Woman is pretty cool as well, different fighting styles and different weapons and abilities.  Those trophies I mentioned above, they come in \"his and her\" flavors, some are for Batman, some are for Cat Woman.Going into \"detective mode\" lets you use your suit's enhanced capabilities, such as seeing things around walls, and it makes finding \"bad guys\" a lot easier when you're just flying around looking for some butt to kick to get some experience.Even with the few glitches and problems, it's very enjoyable though.  I paid less getitng it quite a bit after launch, and at this price it was definitely worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-29-2013"}

Before you can even begin to deal in the real races, you have to be able to pass 5 \"simple\" tests. The first four are no problem, but then you have to run a lap in under 30 seconds, and the only way to do so is to pull off tricks. Rather than a simple \"X\" or \"O\" button mashing system, you have to use the stick to pop your ATV into a trick at the right time and then push a button in air to execute a trick. It takes a while to get used to this, but it can be done.There are a lot of fun things about this game. You can customize you ATV from the ground up in color and such, but you have to win races to get money to do so.A casual gamer will probably not find this game very fun, but if you are willing to invest the time and get into it, you'll enjoy this experience.

{"product_name":"B002I0J6KU","description":"","reviewerName":"Kevin Graham \"Kevin\"","summary":"great game","reviewText":"Hi,I bought this game for my 2wks off at Christmas.  I had it once and liked it but found it too hard.  I decided to give it another shot.First off all you get to pick your character, a pawn you get to keep, and 2 other pawns that you can swap out as your level increases as the two loaner ones levels don't increase.I found for me it works best to have an arrow shooter because their are some airborne enemies and some that are safer to fight from a distance.  Later on when you reach a certain level like 15 or 20 you can change two a hybrid class and I picked assasian and was able to wield a one handed sword and arrow.Also I found it best if you keep you party balance.  I get 1 two handed wielding warrior, 1 mage, and my pawn is a 1 handed wielding sword person, I think soldier but not sure.Anyway, also you can enhance weapons at the vendors and you use items from fallen foes and found around the world.  Also don't forget to upgrade your main support pawn weapons that is always with you.When you go this route.  So far I have been able to beat any foes I encounter.  Thats not to say that I don't die or have a challenge.  But the 1st time I got it I spent a whole day to try and beat a chimera.  This way I can beat a chimera and about anything so far in a few minutes.  The hardest for me was the drake.  But I beat it in a few minutes.Now I haven't faced everything yet I am level 40 with about 33hrs in.Now the game runs pretty flawless.The graphics are great and the combat is really fast and much more fun than any other rpg I have played.  The weapons have real weight to them.  Also when I am traveling I run most the way and this game doesent slow down and I play for about 5hrs straight.The character customization is great too.  You can make your character and pawn male or female.The quests are cool as well as the locations.  Some of the quests are a little vague on how to do them, but with a little thought you should be ok.  I know a few of them it seemed the map didn't show me where to go and I had to kind of look for a little clue from a particular quest that you get an item that is needed for another quest or the pawns if they have done the quest before with another user will give info.Oh yah the 2 support pawns belong to other as their created support pawn and they are in the rift when you are online.  So when you do quests with them they bring back rift crystals and items from quests with other users.  Rift crystals are used to buy pawns above your level.  Ones at your level are free.Anyway, so far really loving this game.  If you are just starting out and have trouble try a different loadout, or you can try it on easy until you get your characters built up and the hang of how to fight the enemies.Thanks,Kevinedit 1/1/2013Just finished the main story of the game, skipped a lot of side quests and have not done any post game stuff.

Ubisoft's montreal studio presents THE SANDS OF TIME, a technological breakthrough that will change the face of action adventure gaming forever.

A sweeping adventure of betrayal and triumph, the epic legends and deadly creatures of mythic persia burn to life in this suspense filled tale featuring more twists and turns than the labyrinthine palace itself.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Someday my prince will come","reviewText":"When Ubisoft sees success in a franchise, it doesn't waste any time preparing a sequel--as proven by the many games that start with \"Tom Clancy's&\" on the market in recent years. Best of all, the sequels are usually as good, if not better than, their predecessors. That's certainly the case with this year's Prince of Persia, subtitled Warrior Within. On the surface, Warrior Within could be classified as a second part to last year's reinvention of the Prince of Persia franchise, Sands of Time. Those who played Sands will be comfortable getting the hero to do his trademark wall runs, jumps from column to column, and other acrobatics. They'll also feel right at home when it comes time to fight, as a mix of sword fighting and gymnastic moves to keeps enemies off-balance. However, instead of just making new levels for the prince to romp through, the developers have deepened the gameplay with more fighting moves (including some cool throws and other close-up combat), dual weapon wielding, a big selection of weapons (some with bonus effects), and--perhaps adding the most fun to the game--a broader catalog of time powers. The character is easy to control, but learning the large quantity of combos makes for a highly rewarding game. The designers have also gone for a darker mood within the game, as well as for the title protagonist. It's clear that his 2003 adventure has left him more than a little pissed, something he surely takes out on each and every baddie who crosses his path with lots of bloodshed. He also seems to have aged a bit, though it could just be the vast artistic improvements made to his face that give that impression. The game suffers on the technical front--and it's something that many developers and publishers still can't quite figure out: 3-D camera handling. There are times when you'll be close to a wall, and it'll make swinging the camera to where you want to look a bit difficult. In other situations, the cinematically styled viewpoint is forced on you, with the perspective zooming out on the whole room, which can make some critical navigation and aerobatics more difficult than they'd be if you could put the camera right where you want it. Still other situations have the camera drifting a bit while you move, which makes some hazards that much harder to overcome. Chances are, you'll be able to overlook most of Warrior Within's foibles in favor of the hours of entertainment the game will offer. If you've been saying, \"Someday my prince will come,\" you can be sure he's here now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Lars Kingbeard","summary":"PS3's killer app is here","reviewText":"Hideo Kojima has done it again. MGS4 is the most detailed, convincing, and well-researched game I have ever played. It offers a compelling and imaginative glimpse into the future of high-tech warfare, a nuanced, intelligent storyline, vastly improved gameplay, and incredible graphics.The metal gear franchise has always pushed the boundaries of what a game could be, and challenged the preconceptions of the audience. MGS4 starts out with, of all things, a short live action film about marine fauna. The in-game store discounts weapons (in real time) on wednesdays and sundays. These are just a few examples, but there are many more. The story has both the philosophical and political musings as well as the bizarre humor and one of a kind characters that fans expect.The gameplay is more open and the action is more intense than in prior games. The environments seem much bigger and are bustling with npcs engaged in building to building warfare. Snake can join either side in the conflict or ignore them and sneak by. He has a ton of new weapons and gadgets as well.The graphics are among the most impressive I have seen in a game. The characters are solid physical presences with subtle, lifelike facial expressions. The mechs move with an animal grace and hunt with a keen intelligence that belies their artificial construction.Overall, the game is an experience that should not be missed by anyone with a PS3. If you don't already own a PS3, this game alone would justify its purchase. It is by far the most creative, original, and technically polished game to appear on the system to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2008"}

But room for some polish","reviewText":"I had heard about this game a few months back, but I didn't have very high hopes for it. But after reading some of the reviews from fellow gamers, I thought it was worth the risk. And at only 40 bucks, it was certainly a nice surprise!For starters, let me lay some groundwork on what I consider a GREAT superhero game, and there really aren't many. The two that top my list are Batman: Arkham Asylum and City, and Wolverine: Origins. Although some of the other games I've played are solid, even good, they aren't great. Recent mediocre released like the Iron Man, Spider-Man and others abound.Enter Deadpool, the Merc with a mouth. Right off the bat, let me say that this game is NOT for kids. In fact some of the content may scare a few adults off, lol. There are numerous references to sex, gay sex, drugs--you name it. And not inuendo either, so just be ready for it. Personally, I like games that don't pull punches, so it's cool with me. Also, it is very gory. It is common to see an arm, leg or head fly off while DP carves on them.There are some nice customization and upgrade options for DP, so you can get a variety of melee weapons, guns, explosives, etc. This game plays very much like Wolverine: Orgins, and I mean that in a good way. It is brutal, violent and savage, with the added benefit of guns and teleportation. Also, this game REALLY, REALLY, feels like a Deadpool comic, and that is said with admiration. He interacts with the player throughout the game and you are pulled into his world, which is as funny as it is violent. They nailed it on this aspect, and I tip my enthusiasically tip my hat to High Moon Studios here. They really did credit to the franchise and they get comics AND Deadpool. Voice acting is spot on and hilarious as far as DP is concerned. Beautifully done. Graphics are solid. They won't blow you away, but they won't turn you off either. There are some flaws, and this is where some additional polish could be done.1. The controls can be a bit clunky at time, and even though there is a \"counter\" button, it usually doesn't implement itself well and I found myself dissappointed after playing Batman: Arkham, which implemented it flawlessly. Still, it's not poorly done, just not perfect.2. The game is short. There is no sugar coating this one. I don't think it even took me six hours to finish. For this type of game to get a five star rating--at least for me, I'd like to see a full 8 hours of campaign time.3. Challenge mapes! This was a great addition and I'm glad they put it in. Like the Arkham series, this gives the game some serious replay value after you're done. There is also an \"infinite\" mode that you can unlock on each map, which eliminates the time limit and the enemies will just keep coming as long as you can stay alive. Difficulty seems to ramp up a bit early, but then I don't have DP upgraded all the way either, so I'm sure that will help me carve through chumps better in the future.There are already some DLC challenge maps on the marketplace, which I haven't played yet, but I'm definitely going to pick them up for some extra playtime. This is a very solid game that most of us will really appreciate after a frustrating day at work or school. Trust me, you WILL work your frustrations out, lol. At 40 bucks, this is a VERY good value.I hope it helps. Please mark my review helpful if I assisted you in making a decision.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2013"}

The sense of speed is simply mind-boggling, you probably wouldn't find a faster game. The majority of track designs are absolutely great. The story mode is deep, plus there is a Grand Prix mode, and it's also four player. You also race against up to 29 opponents, and of course the gameplay is absolutely great. One problem however, is its difficulty. For Pros, this may be seen as a nice challenge. But for novices, the game can be frustratingly hard. This may turn away some.

In almost every respect it's like a more advanced version of the Halo trilogy, from the enemy types to your suit's features to the storyline. There are tons of amazing environments and game-engine cutscenes (the graphic are some of the best I've ever seen), but more than that, the plot and characters are actually interesting (I never played the first game, but this one continues its story) and the different weapons and tactics you can use open up different gameplay possibilities. Just like in Halo, later in the game you'll probably want to cloak and avoid many fights rather than go in and get killed by respawning bad guys, but it's worth it to get to the next section, as there's always something good that overcomes the drudgery. There were a few places where I got frustrated or things seemed impossible, but keeping at it got me through them eventually. Also, it's true that you'll come across a lot of glitches and other weird things (that seem to get worse the longer you play and the farther you get). But for the sheer amount of content there is, you can overlook the occasional disappearing weapons or enemies running in circles/getting stuck in walls.This is also the first major game that I've played online (outside of a few LittleBigPlanet user maps), and it's surprisingly fun, maybe more fun than the campaign (at least in its later chapters). Because of the limited features you're given, most players around the same level are on equal ground, and as you raise your score you unlock better weapons and skills and more play types. The campaign was a good teaser for multiplayer, as you'll use cloaking, armor mode, different gun attachments and optional skill abilities against your \"human\" opponents.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2011"}

It's got everything you could want from a game: graphics, storyline, strategy, sound . . .  Blizzard hyped this game up pretty big before it's release, and I think they've delivered.Other reviewers have commented that this game is really just an update of Warcraft II that really doesn't achieve anything groundbreaking or original. True, there is almost nothing original in this game, but I think a lot of people forget that others may not have played all those other games (Warcraft, Starcraft, etc.) which were supposedly ripped off.  So whaddya want?  The game is derivitavely sublime.Let's see....  What else can I say?  The user interface is easy and intuitive, the gameplay is always interesting, and the voices are especially well-done.  (In particular I love the Orcish witch doctor:  \"Chew got it, man!\")But I would have to say that the standout of this game would be the graphics.  There are hundreds and hundreds of them, and they're so indescribably cool.  (For example, when characters get healed, or one of the heroes casts a spell, or when the witch doctor sets up a \"healing ward.\")  There are so many cool graphics and animations in this game, it actually sort of interfered with gameplay:  I found myself re-casting various spells pointlessly and getting my little myrmidons to do various tasks all because the animations rocked, not necessarily because they were exigent.  I have to confess I chiefly enjoyed this game simply for the way everything looked.I do have my gripes, though:  The story is strictly for grade-schoolers.  I'd be surprised if there is a single person out there (even the big fans) who can sit through the cut scenes and not think, \"This is lame!  Let's get on with it!\"I for one wish they had just spent their time making more levels instead of taking up memory on the disk with all this silliness.True, the cutscenes look good, at least by today's standards.  They're state-of-the-art, for now.  But the bottom line is that the story line is idiotic and I don't pay big bucks for a game to watch movies!I can say that I have rarely seen the thing bug out.  A couple of times only, and they were quite minor bugs.  Blizzard is well-known for useful patches and substantial customer support.Another thing I like about this game is that Blizzard -- at least for their \"Starcraft\"-style games -- always release some cheat codes a few months after the game's gone on the market.  This is great, so that if you've simply had it with the game, you can enter cheat codes and finish.And these cheat codes can be used for further entertainment:  for example, one of the things I liked doing was using them to subvert the supposed goals of each level, to find out what would happen if you, for example, betrayed your allies -- would the game still let you win?(My favorite was using the \"God mode\" cheat in combination with the goblin shredders to level the elves' sacred forest right before their weepin' eyes, and with their not being able to do a thing about it.  For some extra entertainment, try vanquishing your allied towns without cheating:  nearly impossible!)But the game is a great value:  even if you don't enter any cheat codes and play it through straight, why, you've got more than a couple of months of variegated entertainment here.  And that's not even counting online playing!Another thing I appreciated about the game is that if you get wiped out on a level, you can re-start the level by choosing \"Reduce Difficulty.\"  I thought this was really cool, for those few scenarios that drive you up the wall.But what you're being offered here is a triple pack:  not merely \"Warcraft III\" but the \"Frozen Throne\" expansion pack as well (as well as Prima's strategy guides for both).  When you consider how much you're paying against how much entertainment you'll get out of this, why, you're being entertained for pennies per hour!  So I would have to say that -- especially now, a couple of years after its initial release, what you're getting is an indisputable value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2007"}

It's baffling, and it embarrasses me.  I'm too old for the hobby to be appropriate, I think.  Lord knows there's other things I could be doing with my time:  reading, writing, playing music, etc.  My colleagues and family would be aghast if they knew how much time I spend playing video games.USED TO SPEND, I should say.Because of this game.Fancy working dozens of hours in a careful and agonizing attempt to expand your empire, only to find out that your saved games are corrupted, or every time you hit \"END TURN,\" you crash to desktop.Well, you're getting all those frustrations and more when you sign up for \"Empire:  Total War.\"  I've played every single Total War outing since Shogun, and I have to say that this is the buggiest version they've ever put out.  I was never able to complete a single campaign (not one!) because the saved files would inevitably become corrupted.  Or you crash to desktop every time you hit \"END TURN,\" and regardless of what changes you make before you do so, the game still crashes.Admittedly, I'm writing this review before the 1.3 patch comes out, but still.  By the time that patch comes out, I won't be interested in the game anymore.There's a couple other things wrong with the game as well:1.  Steam.  You can read the details of how this diabolic, mandatory piece of spyware/adware works in other reviews, but I'll just say here that I've had it.  Playing a video game these days is coming to resemble getting security clearance at the Pentagon.  It's ridiculous.  You MUST connect to the internet, you MUST get updates, you MUST set up an account, you MUST view their ads, you MUST allow them to snoop through your computer, you MUST figure any problems out on your own, etc.Forget it, I say.  No game is worth all that.  [The most infuriating aspect of all this is that none of it ever seems to do anything to stop piracy, so the upshot is that legitimate customers are just inconvenienced and have their computers invaded.]2.  The AI in this game is legendary for being idiotic.  Always has been, since Shogun.  You can offer an impoverished country trillions for a useless piece of land, and they'll turn you down.  They declare war on you irrationally, etc.  All this was very disappointing.  Here you put hours and hours into managing your grand strategy, and it's like the other countries are flipping a coin whenever they make a decision.Yeah, I'm happy to say that this cruddy game managed to turn me off not just to Total War, but to video games generally.  I'm sick of them being poorly programmed.  This is not the first time this has happened to me.  I invest so much in a game emotionally, and then I'm unable to continue?  Grrrrr!But books don't crash!  I've never had a situation where I put 20+ hours into reading a book, and then been unable to continue to the end.So, thank you, O shoddy programming department at SEGA!  I was addicted to a stupid hobby, and I've finally kicked it, with your help.  You have my gratitude.  (I know this sounds sarcastic, but I really do feel grateful to you.)So it's back to good old books for me.  Maybe I'll play a few games leftover from years past that I never got around to, but as for new games, this will be the last one.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GZ5Y","reviewerName":"Old School Gamer \"What the hell's a gigawatt!?!\"","summary":"Finally the franchise gets back to its roots.","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying I love the original Kingdom Hearts and it's one of my favirote rpgs of all time. I originally thought it was a joke when I heard Disney characters were going to be in a game with Final Fantasy characters and didn't give it a chance until a year after it came out. Man, I almost made a gigantic mistake as a JRPG-lover by missing out on it.So then Kingdom Hearts 2 comes out. The game is more ambitious in scope of it's story, it is more linear, and it is more flashy with the new combat system. It was a great game. But it doesn't age as well as the original. Kingdom Hearts 2, in my mind, fails at two things. First, the story introduces a new entity in Organization XIII and an entire cast of characters who seemingly have nothing to do with anything from the first game, except they do have something to do with it because Square-Enix says they do. Ok, I can accept that. At least I would be able to if they were fleshed out, explained, and developed so that I'd care about them. Axel turns out to be the best new addition and he's the bad guy. The second spot the game failed was the extreme linearity. The game hands you a pathway, makes it so that you can't miss chests because you literally have to walk right over them to move on, and there is absolutely *none* of the exploration and backtracking that made the first game so fun. I can't express how let down I was when I basicly just played through a huge level interconnected with other ones. It was a great game, don't get me wrong, but it was a decline from the granduer of the original.So here we stand about four games later and the Kingdom Hearts series is getting even more convaluted in storyline, the gameplay mechanics have been tossed around like a bag of chips, and almost nothing in a current KH title is recognizable from the first game that birthed the franchise. Then we're handed Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep....a game I hadn't planned on purchasing out of the gate except that I got a $15 off coupon for Best Buy. How could I pass up the deal? So I picked it up, waited a couple days to beat my previous handheld title DQIX and pop it in......and I've never enjoyed a handheld game so darn much. I don't really play handheld games at home. I play them on break at work, on trips, etc. and beat them when I can. This game is almost the only handheld game that I can't wait to get back to. This is Kingdom Hearts' spiritual brother/sister in the series. It brings back everything we loved, gets rid of all we hated, and makes it a true gem once again.It is set before the first Kingdom Hearts storyline and gives us almost all the info we were hoping for on what set this entire world into motion. There is a lot less ambiguity, more straight-forward storytelling, and things are made very clear by the end. It centers around three main characters: Terra, Aqua, and Ventus who are basicly the precursors for Sora and the rest of the keyblade masters who come after them. You play as one of them and complete their story, then play as the next, and finally the third, completing each storyline seperately. This is a nice mechanic because it allows for a longer story and a lot of perspective for each character. It also allows for you to get to know and care about each of them on a more personal level than having them all together. I suggest like some here to play as Aqua last. Her story is the most revealing and it could potentially ruin parts of the other two. For the most part though, Square-Enix did an amazing job tieing all three stories together without forgetting to conceal most of what happens within in each storylines telling. Very good planning on their part.The battle system is basicly the same as the first game, but now you can use an ability deck that you assign attack/item/magic skills to and you use the D-pad to pick them while you play. This may sound like a pain, but honestly, if you set up your deck right, you don't need to ever touch the D-pad to change them and just use them in rolling order. This game is quite difficult too, especially at first. I played it my first time on Proud Mode which is the games version of hard and you take twice as much damage. First starting out, this is brutal and the first boss is very tough. Once you level though, you become almost too much for almost any enemy to handle and you can breeze through if you're not terrible at the game. There are also finishers moves and special moves linked to these and those sort of remind me of the system in KH2. It makes for some killer combos eventually.The game itself is layed out like the first. You fly to a world, beat it, fly to the next, you can go back and find tresaures you didn't the first time, and there is even a Colliseum ripoff world. This is where the real fun can happen. You have the typical arena fights you can play solo or with some friends online and they are HARD! It takes a while before you're advanced enough to do them on your own, but it can be done and the rewards are definately worthwhile. But the best part is the Command Board. This is the infamous boardgame you've all heard about. It really is basicly Mario-Party-meets-Monopoly. It's main function is to provide a secondary and somewhat simpler/more fun way to level up your fighting abilities. I've sunk at least 8-10 hours into it and the time just flew by. It's a blast to play and the computer isn't cheap at all. While luck plays a role, you get a hand of cards that allows you to pull off different moves like rolling 2 or 3 die at a time, or stunning an opponent for a turn, or confusing them so they turn around and go the wrong way, or even getting yourself more points based on how many tiles they've taken as their own property. It's engrossing, especially for a boardgame.Rather than talk your head off any longer, I'll get to the point. This game is a dream coem true for lovers of the original Kingdom Hearts. It's more mature, more direct, more well-rounded, and includes all the best parts of the original with a few of the newer ones that were actually good. This is *by far* the best Kingdom Hearts game since the original and I really, really hope Squenix decides to listen to all the positive press it's getting and continues to release only Kingdom Hearts games of this calibur.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2010"}

The world that Kain moves through is a lushly detailed gothic environment that is not only gorgeous to the eye, but also alive with the soon-to-be-dead. The AI behavioral response makes peasants and enemies variously flee, take up arms, or remain unaware as Kain moves through crowds or charges, sword raised, into open areas.","reviewerName":"Veil_Lord","summary":"I Really Enjoyed It","reviewText":"I got this for a grand total of about $3.30 including tax, so my expectations are lower than if I'd purchased this game brand new at full price.I playedSoul Reaver 2before this game.  Blood Omen 2 is a prequel of sorts to that that game.  Since they're in the same series, I can compare to them somewhat.  It's kind of disappointing that the camera and some of the combat took a turn for the worse in this game.  The camera can get really irritating at certain times, but mostly it's quite good.  Combat is mostly light attack a grab attack, blocking, and some level of dodging.  I found it very enjoyable.Puzzles are not as complex as they were in Soul Reaver 2 either, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Where you sometimes got lost in that game, Blood Omen 2 more or less guides you exactly where you need to go.  Yeah, there are a few deviations so you can find bonus power-ups, but if you go into an area the only doors you can go through are the ones they want you to.  There's really only one way to solve every puzzle. You'll be flipping a lot of switches, turning a lot of cranks, and drinking a lot of blood.Blood is power to Kain.  Every enemy you kill, you'll want to drain their blood.  It not only refills your health, but it's necessary to build up your experience bar to level up.  You may think you're just supposed to attack enemies, but you should be killing EVERYONE you see.  Helpless and tied to a wall, kill them.  They help you out with some information, great now kill them and suck that blood.  You can't have any conscience in this game or your going to have a really hard time.  It sounds cooler than it is, because you'll fast get tired of watching the blood drinking animation.  Still, it's not too big a deal.Kain has some vampire powers to use like turning into mist so he can sneak around.  He also steals powers from various vampire enemies you kill.  Most are useful, some not so much.  In general, they're all really good.  You can also save pretty much anywhere which is a plus.My only real problem with the game were a series of glitches.  There's nothing game ending, but it's a little rough around the edges.  At one point the entire screen was gray-green and I had to sort of push against the background to find my way through the tunnel and get to a point I could see the background again.  At other times it was just annoyances like trying a few times to get off a ladder or the sound going out.  There were also points where the game slowed down drastically and stuttered, but again those bits were just annoying and didn't ruin the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2010"}

I love the hack-n-slash genre so i can be pretty forgiving on the flaws as long as i can slice stuff up, and this game provides that in spades.  The story in the game is surprisingly good which revolves around templars, religion in medevial europe.  The voice-acting is decent and the graphics are passable(though they look like it could have been on ps2)It's a little more then an hack and slash though, it also features rpg-like elements(another genre i love) and you can customize all 3 charatcers with different outfits and weapons you can find, spend skill points to increase health, combo, magic(or zeal) and special abilites, so you could have a damage dealer. tank character and even healing abilites.  The game also has co-op play and also can be used on-line so you can play right along a friend or family meter and it does a good job with it and encourages teamwork on both puzzles and action sequences.Alot of ppl seemed to dismiss this game for an assassin creed rip-off but owning all the current AC games and now this game, i can assure you that aside from the time period the two are really nothing at all alike. IMHO if you like hack and slash, a little role playing elements, puzzle and action, co-op and a decent story to go along with it i think this is worth a purcahse especially since it's not even a full-priced game.  Just go into first templar without expecting a big AA game and i think it's a fun purchase.

But the reality that the PS2 has sold around a total of 140 million units and it's still selling steadily means that there are plenty of PS2 owners that have yet to experience this epic game. And to those people I say; for as cheap as this game is going right now, every PS2 owner should have God of War (and GOW2) in their collection. It carries such broad appeal to different types of players. My sports junkie buddy who has his video game collection lined with Madden and NBA games sat down and had a great time. My wife even had a go at a few of the levels. As for me, a moderate gamer, it was completely addicting and I've played thru it twice now including in God Mode. You are thrust into a thrilling adventure inspired by Greek mythology oozing with creativity and luscious detail to stimulate your visual senses while challenging your reflexes. The story line is quite interesting and this is one of the few games of which I sat back and watched the cut scenes. The level designs are astounding for being a 2005 PS2 game. I loved the Grecian setting with huge temples and mountains in the sky, raging storms in the sea, and blinding winds in the desert. The game has been accused of being a mindless button-mashing hack-n'-slash, but while that may be true for portions of the game, there are several levels where you will have to use your logic and creativity to solve puzzles. And if you play in God Mode, you will need to learn to properly block along with timing strategic strings of combos to defeat the onslaught of enemies clamoring on every side. It does get very challenging (especially in Hades), but at least it's not one of those downright frustrating games that makes you wanna toss your controller at the screen. There are plenty of checkpoints so you will rarely be required to re-do a particularly difficult scene that you've already passed.This game is brilliant and easily worth the measly seventeen dollars that Amazon is asking.

It is a well done enough game that a young child and parent or two childern of different ages can enjoy it. Perhaps not the first go to game for an adult but for who it is intended for a very well done game.The game has 2 different ways to play. One is a more arcade/puzzle challenge stages that is very diverse and covers almost all the characters of Toy Story 3 in different environments. The stages all contain hints and cooperative play where you will have to use at least 2 different characters to accomplish a goal. If you are playing by yourself you move one character then the other. The hints are a nice feature for younger kids (heck for me too, sometimes I like to work things out sometimes I just want to get to the next stage).You also have a town where you can do short tasks for different townspeople and earn credit to customize the town environment. It is a 'free play' part of the game. I really love the graphics. They are completely authentic to the movie. Overall a great choice to get for any Toy Story 3 fans in your household with the added bounus that an adult and child can play together and both have a very good time.

It is an action-based RPG with a battle and magic systems very similar to that of Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, and the various Final Fantasy games.Here are the Pros: The graphics and sound make you understand the true power of this little system. The fights are fast paced, and characters are colorful and well animated. The music is classic RPG material similar to the Squaresoft games. The story, albeit cliched by RPG standards, is engrossing, and will require a lot of reading and attention. This is a major plus because the time flies by as you are playing, so a long bus ride or flight won't seem so long when you are playing this.Here are the Cons: There are very few. But the one problem that I often experience is that the hours of gameplay required takes it's toll on your batteries. As well, though &quot;Golden Sun&quot; can be considered gound-breaking by handheld standards, the story gives the player a real deja-vu feeling. A more fresh and original storyline would have helped. But a standard RPG story is always engrossing, you just sometimes get that &quot;been there, done that&quot; feeling.&quot;Golden Sun&quot; is a game for the more intellegent and attentative gamer, and a great way to pass time on the road. You will be impressed by the graphics and sound, but you'll stay for the fun and adventure.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2002"}

{"product_name":"B00002STH5","description":"It's taken a while to get here, but Nintendo's 64-bit update to the old SNES classic, F-Zero, is here. F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64?

{"product_name":"B007XYBUBE","description":"","reviewerName":"rodjoh \"rodjoh\"","summary":"It's a Playstation brawl.","reviewText":"First things first: Is this Super Smash Bros. with Playstation mascots? Sorta, but not quiet. The game is blatantly influnced by Smash Brothers and this is something Sony/Superbot wasn't shy to admit. But its gameplay is actually different enough to feel that this is its own game rather than trying to be its Nintendo counterpart.Playstation All Stars is a multiplayer brawler that allows up to 4 players fighting at the same time, both online and offline. The objective of the game is to defeat your oponnents by KOing them. The way to do this is not quiet as obvious at first. Below, each player has an AP Meter which fills up as you hit opponents and collect orbs that fall around the stage. As it fills it will reach level 1 but you can allow it to fill up to level 2 or 3. What you do is that with the meter filled you can trigger your fighters special attacks, which is the ONLY type of attack that can get you a kill. So, all other attack are to fill the meter, Special attacks are to KO.Certainly, the higher the level, the more devastating the special attack is. But then you might not really want to wait so long and just try to get a quick kill now. But then you really need to be precise if you will try this. That's where the strategy in this game kicks in. It will feel awkward at first because you will expect people to fly around the stage like Smash, but the more you play the more you will get used to the fact that that just doesn't happen here. Its an interesting twist to the Brawler formula. Not sure if its better or worse, its just different and its fun.As far as the gameplay itself, everything seems well done. I feel though that the fighters are not balanced, but maybe I just need to play more. But it can't be a good sign when I entered an online match and all for players were using Raiden.As an opportunity to celebrate Playstation's history, this game falls a little flat. It wasn't until more recent years that the Playstation world really grew an identity of its own, previously many characters that were considered \"mascots\" were 3rd party... so with that said it is dissapointing that PS classics such as Crash, Cloud and Lara are not present even though they all are the true PS AllStars rather than a \"Fat Princess\".But I will say that for a first attempt at this genre they did a pretty well job. Its non-epic-enough presentation and lack of true Playstation classics representation in favor of more current frachises is a bit dissapointing. But the gameplay is tight, is fun and it works as a great party game. And God knows PS3 needed more of those.So yes, if you were into Smash Bros. this one is fully recommended. Even better, you get the Vita version for free if you buy this one. Get it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2013"}

The graphics and all the moves stunned me. I thought I was in heaven.Oh, how I was wrong.THPS 3 is THPS 2 to the 10th power. Every element of THPS 2 has been taken and supersized. With over 50 more tricks, all new levels, it can't get much better.What makes the new Tony Hawk Skater game so awesome is it's increased gameplay features. In 1P mode, you can choose from:Single sessionPlay any levels unlocked in career mode or any park you have created you self in the \"Park Editor\" mode. This allows you to get a taste of what career mode will be like without effecting your score.Career modePlay levels one at a time. After a certain number of goals are completed, a new level will unlock. In order, the levels are Foundry, (a construction place) Canada, (lots of snow, lots of rails) Rio, (A skating contest. If you get enough points and come in 3rd place a new level will be unlocked) Suburbia, (a quiet town) Airport, (Not the outside, just the inside) skaters island, (another skating contest) Los Angeles, then Tokyo. (The final skating contest.) And, once you complete 35 goals you unlock a special level where you are a cruise-ship (SWEEEEET!)Free skateUnlimited time. Just skate in any park created or level unlocked.TutorialLearn some basics of the game. It's hosted by Tony Hawk himself.In multiplayer (Only 2P maximum, which is still a downside) you can choose from games or just free skate. The games are:GraffitiBy doing a trick off a certain object (Halfpipe, bench, trailer, ANYTHING!) it will turn to your color. If your opponent does a trick off the same object, but receives a higher score, it will turn to his/her color. The person with the most \"tagged\" objects after 1-10 minutes (depending on what you selected) wins.Trick attackFree for all. Choose any place. Rack up as much points as possible. Person with the most points at the end of the game wins.HorseYou can select any word you want. (Horse, Skate, Loser, Superman, television...) A player goes first. He/she will do a trick, and, if landed, will receive a certain amount of points. If the next player can match or get more points than the other one, the other person has to match or get higher, etc, etc, until someone pulls off a score and the opponent fails to beat the score, or bails. After the person fails the same number of times are there are letters in the word, that person loses.SlapAnyplace, anywhere. When 2 skaters collide, the person with the faster skater knocks the slower one down and gets a point. The person with the most points at the end of the game, wins.King of the hillThere's a crown out there somewhere, and the 1st person to find it becomes king. While you're the king, your time will start counting down. (From whatever time you selected) To make things fair, you skate slower while wearing the crown. If your opponent is faster than you and collides into you, he/she is now the king, and your clock has stopped and there's has started up.Basically, it's amazing. However, the still only limited 2-person multiplayer bugs me. I'll give it a 9/10, which is still very, very, good.Graphics? You want Graphics? I'll show you graphics.  THPS 3 is amazing with every detail in the visual. The levels look amazingly 3D, along with every player. Every move has made it to look real and stunning. I couldn't make it better. With not a single 2D image, there is no way I can't give it less than a 10/10.This is skating we're talking about. You'd think all you hear is a WHACK when the skateboard lands. As the grinch would say: Wrongo! There are about 7 different sounds the game will make when a player lands the board. When a player bails, the sound of the board flying away and hitting something is heard. When a cool trick is performed, another SFX occurs. It's great. With GRRRRRREAT music to go along with it, sound gets 10/10Speed is an important element in THPS 3. I'm not talking about how fast you can travel; I'm talking about loading the game. I can't say I love it when it takes about 10-15 seconds to start a level, or to go to the park editor, or to save, or to go to the skateshop. Other GCube games don't take as long, so I'm going to stick with an 8/10 on speed. Sorry Tony!If you ever played Tony Hawk 2 for the N64, you know how annoying the controls where. With the design of the controller, you where stuck with sloppy movement. This is a BIG improvement. The revolutionized GCube controller makes THPS 3 a breeze. Every move can be executed with ease, and grinding is the Y button, which is very close to your fingers. I must say I'm much better at 3 than 2. 10/10 is awarded to the controlling.Replay ... Obviously! I'm not going to buy a skateboard game and play it once! I think all sports game need to have a 10/10 for replay or they just aren't worth buying. So, of course, Tony Hawk gets a 10/10.As you can see, if you're going to get a skateboarding game, get Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3.Cheats? Well, lemme tell you, it's pretty great. Just enter in 2 codes to unlock all the cheats and secret characters. With cheats on, during any gameplay you can press START, then turn any code you want on or off. With this great cheat element, I'll give it's score a +5Let's review:Gameplay: 9/10Graphics: 10/10Sound: 10/10Speed: 8/10Controls: 10/10Replay value: 10/10Total: 57/60 giving Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 a 95.Bonus: With the +5 in cheats, Tony Hawk Pro skaters gets a perfect 100!

Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying.

Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game.

Patterson","summary":"Are you kidding me?","reviewText":"To start with something nice, the game is fun. Unfortunately there are more negative aspects to the game that really bring it down.First and foremost, the graphics are terrible. Not just that but they are inconsistant. Some textures will be pretty nice and others look like the developers just didn't care. The particle effects primarily in the smoke and fire are the worst I have seen in years. They are almost embarrassing.The game isn't organized well, it seems to just shuffle you around from place to place without much of a purpose. Most of the time I spent either lost not knowing which path to take while hitting select regularly to remind myself of what I was doing.The AI is awful. You can stand right next to enemies and they won't even see you.Too easy. The Mantel soldiers are too easy to kill and at certain parts where you are told to hold off the Mantel \"onslaught\" turns into no more than shooting a couple guys. Some onslaught.The weapons lack substance. I found myself using the Mantel and Promise Hand assault rifles most of the time. Certain areas are easier by using the rocket launcher but there never seems to be any reasoning with the placement or specific use of other weapons.Last is the glitches. I have had lockups after check points and fellow Promise Hand soldiers firing at \"invisible\" enemy Mantel soldiers, hitting me and everyone else in the process.They always say don't judge a book by its cover and this is one of those cases. The cover looks sweet. The game inside unfortunately is not.For a PS3 Exclusive title, this game just does not deliver. Ubisoft and Free Radical should be embarrassed.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2008"}

I debated for a long time on whether to get an Xbox 360 or PS3.  I waited so long that the PS3 and Xbox 360 have each come out with their second version.  There are so many PS2 games that I haven't played that I decided to hold on to it.  Plus, the PS3 was too expensive and the new version was not backward compatible to let me play PS2 games.  I went with the Xbox 360 slim 4gb.  The library of games is deeper and less expensive as well.  I picked up 4 games when I bought the 360.  I started with Assassin's Creed, Mass Effect, Gears Of War 1 & 2, & College Hoops 2K8 .  I am  happy with all of them!  I was shocked at how good the graphics are.  I think the 360 controller is better for shooting games than playstation controller.  The PS controller is better for fighting games to me.  I have added 10 more xbox games to my collection since April 2011 and I just got it 4 months ago!  I need to slow down.  The only only thing I had to get used to was the slight hum of the xbox.  It will also run a little hot at times.  I usually don't play it more than 2 hours at a time so it works for me.

As one of five citizens under the oppressive heel of a sinister government controlled by big business, you must single-handedly make things right in four different locales and several missions. Playing from a behind-the-thug view, your tasks read like \"Revolution for Dummies\": escort and protect hackers, destroy buildings, and assassinate high-ranking officials. In addition to your fists, there's a nice and sometimes gruesome variety of weapons, including baseball bats, machine guns, and even severed heads.State's most noteworthy element is the visual presentation. Accompanied by a striking audio track, the screen is completely packed with riot-like activity-gang bangers, citizens, Corporation officers (the bad guys), and frenzied crowds that react to explosions and gunfire. Some of the details, though, have been skimped on, such as the featureless citizens.Yet the game's play engine wears thin too soon. Missions grow tiresome from their own repetition, and the four locales lack visual and structural diversity. The controls, though, remain firm throughout, although constantly having to manually change the camera angle can become wearisome. Despite its quickly worn welcome State of Emergency's worth a play if you're in the mood to inflict some serious virtual mass destruction. It's also the kind of game you'll truly enjoy if you've ever been wrongly awarded a speeding ticket, victimized by the IRS, or told to stop running by a mall cop.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2003"}

I remembering playing it for 8+ hours a day and I still couldn't stop playing it. There wasn't any real goal to do, it was just for fun and to see how many times you can kill or get killed. Usually, I get killed more often than kill others; so my ratio was way off! lolThis game had so many maps, but I would only play certain maps because they were the most popular and easiest to move around. Dust, dust2, etc.The guns had plenty of selections to choose from but people had their favs as I did to use. I would love to pick the MP3 or AWP.The music was so, so. No one really cared for the music as many times, I wouldn't listen to it and plug on headphones to listen to my own music. But, it was a disadvantage as I loss the audio clues if someone was close to me or what not.Back then I didn't have a powerful computer. I had a piece of crap actually. lol But later, I got a little bit more powerful one for processor, but it still ran this game like crap. I remember updating my ram, video card, and anything I could just to make this game run better. I changed out the costumes for the characters, guns, and anything I could just to make it smooth.

But, today we don't need to worry about that, but back then, DSL/Cable wasn't that in and it was so expensive too.

You've got zero control over what your characters do.  They simply do all this stuff and you have no choice than to go along with it.  As for throwing your kid out a window, leaving the park, abandoning an investigation, leaving your family, etc., you've got no say-so.  But you are granted the heady freedom of deciding whether or not you're going to sit down in a chair.  They should have just made this a DVD where you occasionally were prompted to punch input buttons.Beats me why this game was hailed as so innovative.  It's barely a video game, challenging as it does the very idea of what it means to be in control of your character.  You're not in control of your major choices, only trivial ones, such as whether you want to talk to the man before going up the stairs, or whether you want to go up the stairs first and then return to talk to the man, for example.  But it is fore-written:  you must 1) talk to the man; and 2) go up the stairs.  You are only allowed to choose the order in which you do these things.  I repeat:  how is this a game?  Easily over 99% of your time is simply spent watching your character do and say things you didn't authorize (e.g.:  helping an obvious murderer.  No!  I'm not doing that!  I'm leaving the motel room and calling the police!).Truly the worst video game I've ever played.  In a way, it's not fair to compare it even to the most disappointing games I've played, because those were at least video games.  This is much more a movie you have to sit and watch than a real game.And as Dr. Johnson was supposed to have quipped, \"This is both good and original.  But what's good about it is not original, and the parts that are original are not good.\"  I feel that's a good description of this game:  it's a totally hackneyed serial killer story you've seen a zillion times before and are totally sick of.  But that's the good part.  The parts that are original (how do I open the flippin' fridge?!) are completely uninteresting and even infuriating.Also zero camera control, which is maddening.  Why can't my guy look around?Also:  there are tons of bugs in this game.  Straight out of the box, it's unfinishable, since it's so buggy.  For example, if you pick up the orange juice bottle, there'll be no way to put it down!There are many command prompt issues like this in the game, where you're supposed to receive a command prompt and don't.  Typically this can be fixed by having to restart and reload.  Really, though, Amazon shouldn't be selling defective software without a warning.)Not all of the bugs can be gotten around this way, however.  At one point my guy was standing, rooted to one spot, and there was no way to make him move forward, look around, etc.  Reloading just got me to the same spot.  I couldn't do anything:  I tried for hours to get my character to do something, and he just stood there.Thus I wasn't able to finish the game and all my work was for nothing.

{"product_name":"B00D96BNGM","description":"","reviewerName":"Turtle502","summary":"Decent Sound, Lightweight, Versaitile Connection Capabilities","reviewText":"I'm using these with my entire media setup. It supports optical-in, so I connected them to the optical out of my HDTV. It obtains its power via USB, and since the USB ports on most TVs are powered, I have it getting power from a spare USB port, so the base unit switches on and off along with the TV&#8217;s power. This particular setup only requires two cables. The package includes additional cables and connectors so that you can use the headphones with other setups (Xbox, Playstation, PCs, portable players, etc.). The most important cable is the charging cable, which is long enough to use while connected, several feet from the TV. For the Xbox 360, there is also the voice-chat adapter which connects to the headset adapter of the controller, and allows for a true wireless solution for 360 voice-chat.Major thing I don't like about these - charging them leaves the unit on all the time. They don't turn off when charging is complete. If you turn them off, and then plug them in to charge, the unit powers-on and stays on to charge. When they are powered-on for charging, they also activate the transmitter base, which means it is also on the entire time. If you try to turn them off, the voice announces &#8220;USB connected&#8221;.The voice samples that announce the state of the device are male &#8211; which gives these headphones a very male-centric feel. The voice is rich and deep. It simply announces &#8220;Powering on&#8221; or &#8220;powering off&#8221; and provides the state of the game mode and chat mode. There are no obnoxious &#8220;bings&#8221; and &#8220;dings&#8221; of previous models. This is a great improvement.These headphones are lighter than previous models. I'm not sure how Turtle Beach managed to make them lighter, but they feel much lighter on my head, and are therefore much more comfortable to wear for a long duration. The materials of this particular pair are definitely different. The leather headband seems to be a softer material, and the grey-white plastic is a welcome change over the blacks of nearly every other Turtle Beach headset.From a sound-quality perspective, these are OK but not great. I tend to believe they are typical &#8220;Turtle Beach&#8221; in terms of sound quality. I don't believe they have enough &#34;punch&#34; in the bass, but midrange, voices, and highs are well-defined. I find that preset #7 provides the best sound quality and helps accentuate the bass. I also don't use the &#34;synthesized&#34; surround-sound because I believe it makes the sound &#34;too thin&#34; and tends to add an artificial echo that I just don't think is natural. Fortunately, there's no distortion, no interference, and the wireless signal is always good, even in my very WiFi-busy home. These don't let me walk more than 30 feet from my console, and trip to the kitchen to grab something results in the audio cutting-out completely.These headphones also support Bluetooth wireless, which means you can sync the headphones to your phone, simultaneously while using them with wireless audio. This allows you to take voice calls on your phone while playing a game, a useful feature. What I really like, though, is that these allow you to sync Bluetooth audio from a phone or laptop, which allows you to listen to music, as an example. This is actually helpful, because the sound quality is quite decent for this purpose. The Bluetooth audio and the chat audio have separate volume controls, so you can adjust the Bluetooth/chat audio separately from the game volume.In general, I like these. I think the design is good, and the sound quality serves its purpose. I just wish, for once, that Turtle Beach could design big headphones that have a decent bass response. If you&#8217;re looking for ultimate high quality sound, these aren&#8217;t for you. But if you need decent sound and want to be free of wires, these could serve your needs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2013"}

While it was still a side-scroller like its predecessors, it brings 3-D background graphics and more challenging objectives to the table.  The earlier &quot;Super Mario&quot; games (and many other similarly-styled videos games) were sequential in how a person defeated each board and each world.  With &quot;Super Mario World&quot;, it all of a sudden became the choice of the player on how they wanted to defeat the game.  In addition, there were challenges that lay beyond just merely beating the game.  With the layout of the game being a large island map, the player had a choice of which direction to go when choosing a level to play.  Many of the levels have more than one objective to them, which leads to the opening of secret passages ways and other levels.  There are switch blocks which can be activated from their special locations which help the player beat later levels.  This game contains a special 'star road' and 'special' sets of levels and the ultimate goal of finding all 96 level objectives before going on to defeat the almighty Bowser and free the kingdom.I could go on for hours about how wonderful this game is, but the more important piece of information to be put forth is, &quot;how well does it transfer to the GameBoy Advance system?&quot;.  The answer is:  Flawlessly!!  Aside from my gripe about the lack of a backlight (which is a criticism of the system, not the game), this version recreates the original in every single way possible and even provides a few new bells and whistles that enhance the gameplay.  (It's also worth noting that this cartridge comes with the arcade version of &quot;Mario Brothers&quot;, too).

The world is bigger and more colorful, the characters are more interesting, the story is... well... more compelling and spread over several sites, the cinematic action and the interactive play blend seamlessly into each other, there's a much better mix between shooting, melees, exploration and chases, there are more weapons and... to put it shortly, if you liked Drake's Fortune then Uncharted 2 is guaranteed to blow your socks off.GAME MODESSurprisingly combat is easier than in Drake's (new weapons such as the Riot Shield help). I won't call myself an above-average gamer. I almost always start playing in the 'easy' mode and I rarely dare the 'difficult' modes but Among Thieves makes it so easy and it's so much more natural and fluid when compared with Drake's. And, without giving away anything, there's a lot more than combat in this game.In the easy mode, the hint system will point you in the right direction, most of the time. This is not exactly an open world like Oblivion or Fallout - you go from here to there and you most do A, B, C before you get to do D but it's all so much fun doing it, you often forget about the constraints.And then, of course, there's the Online modes with voice chats which we haven't had time to try yet. Online supports 5 vs. 5 multiplayer modes and up to 3 players co-op modes.Earnings from online or story mode games can be combined to purchase better weapons or equipment.Oh, and there are trophies, of course. Not to mention that you can record gameplay to show it off later.PICTURE, MOTION, SOUNDIt's a game... it's a movie... :) It's both and they blend together. The color are brighter, the vistas are vaster, the attention to detail is sometimes mind-boggling - rain-drops falling, each one producing circular ripples. Amazing. As for the sound, do surround if you can. 7.1 is well... a blast.FINAL THOUGHTSIt's a 5-star without hesitation. Just go and get it if you haven't ordered it yet. And if, like me, you are not the best gamer in the world, don't worry. Chances are you'll manage. If you have kids, buy it.

But with so much anxiousness awaited to the new Nintendo 3DS, it has been a moment awaiting to happen for new gamers, who've have not yet gotten a chance over the years to \"get their wings!\" But now, that opportunity has finally been awaited for new gamers on the go, as well as die hard Pilotwings fans of all kinds. But the question is that with the long-awaited return of Pilotwings, has it lost its edge for Nintendo fans after all this time, not even close.Pilotwings Resort for the new Nintendo 3DS, handles very well as a launch game for the system. The object of the game is very simple, you earn stars to unlock missions through flying jobs, by hang glinding, by a rocket jet pack or by airplane. There are 2 modes to play through, mission modes, and free flight mode. There are several mission to play throguh from passing through rings, to popping baloons, and shooting at targets. The graphics for the game flow through very nicely, and the control is very easy to learn, after just a couple of flights. The game is very fun and also theraputic and soothing, especially flying through the free flight mode. It is easy to adjust to for new Pilotwings fans, or those who've loved the past 2 incarnations from the Nintendo 64 and Super NES eras. My one gripe about this game is that with all the gameplay, I think gamers will overlook this strong title and go to other Nintendo 3DS games like Super Street Fighter IV.Through it all, Pilotwings Resort is a fun and entertaining title that shouldn't be overlooked. It has been 15 years since the last Pilotwings title, and it is well worth the wait. It is a great game from start to finish that tests you ability to fly well, and carries well as a Nintendo 3DS launch title. Hopefully, there will be more for Pilotwings gamers that can carry through the flights soon to follow. The price is definitely right on this game, and truly is worth the effort and each flight that you master is just as fun as the next one. You definitely will get your wings and soar here.Graphics: A-Sound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B+Overall: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003PHLT8W","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"An overlooked and underappreciated gem - one of the finest third person shooters ever made","reviewText":"Vanquish could have been an epic disaster.  It introduces a gameplay style that has never been done before, and the action is incredibly intense, and nearly non-stop, for the duration of its 8 hour campaign.  But one thing I learned while playing this game, is that when you have the masters of the medium, Platinum Games, behind the helm, you can rest assured that you're going to have a great action experience that is not only expertly crafted, but unlike anything you've ever played before.Vanquish is a cover-based, sci-fi third person shooter with a major twist...that twist being your ability to travel at incredibly fast speeds from place to place using your suit's boost power.  The game is structured in a way that if you stay in one place for too long, enemies will either flank or destroy your cover, so if you don't keep moving, you won't remain alive for very long.  In addition to the boost, the suit's enhanced reaction abilities allow you to seemingly slow down time in order to get precision shots with your weapons.  Both the boost and slow motion abilities use your suit's cooldown powers, so the entire game is a balancing act of not overheating your suit while causing as much destruction as possible as you move from place to place at a high speed.  Combine this with an outrageous scenario involving evil Russians on a giant space station , along with with a high pace of action that makes a Michael Bay movie look like \"The English Patient\", and it seems like something like this just wouldn't be able to come together without turning into a huge mess of a video game.  But Vanquish couldn't be further from that.Vanquish has some of the tightest controls I've played in any video game.  And it is due to these controls that the gameplay is able to come together so well.  Early on in the game, after going through a well made tutorial, you'll be thrust into a battle that will quickly teach you what Vanquish is all about.  You'll likely die more than a few times, but what the game smartly does is it forces you to learn how to properly play the game.  You'll not only learn that taking cover will only protect you for a brief, fleeting moment, but you'll also learn how awesome your suit's powers are.  You'll realize you don't really need the cover system too much, as you quickly learn how to harness your suit's powers bring down mobs of enemy robots in ways that will make you feel incredibly powerful.  Once you get into Vanquish's rhythm, the game is pure joy.  You'll become nearly untouchable. Also, you'll start to notice into the smaller details, like the intriguing story, the very cool, upgradable weapons that become available to you, and the different tactics required to take certain enemies down.  As it all came together for me, I realized that I was playing the most tightly-crafted, well-working shooters I'd ever played.  Not only that, but the game looks fantastic, and has an awesome soundtrack to boot.Platinum Games, following up on their incredible achievement that is Bayonetta, has really delivered the goods with Vanquish.  It is innovative, action packed, and incredibly fun to play.  Like Bayonetta did with action/beat em up games, Vanquish has really upped the ante in the third person shooter genre, and given it its own unique spin that stands apart from the rest of the pack.  It's a shame that this game didn't catch on more than it did when it released in late 2010, as it's truly an underappreciated gem in the PS3/360 catalogue, but I think time will be kind to this game's legacy.  If you love fast-paced shooters and want to play a truly innovative entry into the genre, don't miss out on Vanquish.  A truly awesome game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX97I","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"An excellent collection for Metal Gear Solid fans","reviewText":"Disclaimer: The majority of this review will focus on Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker. Since I don't own a PSP, getting this collection was my first opportunity to play the game.The first two games in this collection are the Substance version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty and the Subsistence version of Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. The first game in the collection, Sons of Liberty, comes with a few extras like a cinema mode and some alternate, non-canonical missions set in both the Tanker and Plant chapters that let you play as Solid Snake instead of just Raiden. Other than that, the game is basically unchanged from the original version, which is good for those who already loved this game as it is. As for Snake Eater, there have been even more worthwhile additions. First off, the two original games of the series released on the MSX, Metal Gear and Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake, are available to play right off the bat in Snake Eater's main menu. These are some truly old school games and therefore are quite different from the newer games in the Metal Gear Solid series, although it's interesting to see how certain elements from these two older games managed to still work effectively in the newer ones. The most significant addition to Snake Eater though is the inclusion of a fully adjustable camera. The original version of Snake Eater used the classic fixed camera with the top-down view from the earlier games, but it made being stealthy a rather frustrating experience since you couldn't see far away enemies or even around corners. It simply didn't go well with the larger environments of the game. Fortunately, the camera in the Subsistence version of Snake Eater is just like the one from Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots and it made the game much more enjoyable.The third game in this collection is Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, a game that I'm surprised wasn't just immediately released on PS3 instead of the PSP. This game takes place 10 years after Snake Eater and 4 years after the other PSP title Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops (a game that I actually wish was included in this collection). The man known as Big Boss has just begun building his own mercenary force known as Militaires Sans Frontieres (Soldiers Without Borders) and takes a job from a man named Professor Galvez and his young female prot&eacute;g&eacute; named Paz, who require some help in removing an armed group of invading mercenaries from Costa Rica. Initially hesitant about taking the job, evidence is presented on the possibility of Big Boss's mentor, The Boss, still being alive, so Big Boss jumps on the opportunity to find out the truth behind this unexpected development. Again, as with any other Metal Gear Solid game, the story in Peace Walker is very in-depth and full of twists and secrets, although it's also more straightforward and somewhat easier to follow than the stories in some of the earlier games. The story moves along through comic book styled cutscenes (word bubbles and all) and many of them have interactive quick time events included in them. There are also lots of audio recordings that are acquired as the game progresses that reveal plenty of interesting background information and other juicy details. The stealth in this game is basically a mix of the usual fare from the previous games, namely the smaller environments and more plentiful cover of MGS and MGS 2 combined with the use of more basic camouflage to hide from enemies like in MGS 3 and MGS 4. In any case, expect lots of sneaking around and taking out bad guys unseen, although there is a much stronger emphasis on using non-lethal force to subdue your enemies which allows you to then recruit them and have them join Big Boss's MSF group. The way the recruitment is done is quite unique. After knocking out an enemy, Big Boss can attach a small parachute/balloon to the enemy's hip and then they go shooting up into the air to be collected by a passing helicopter (a.k.a.: Fulton Recovery). As outlandish as this is, it proves to be quite humorous. It's also not simply a gameplay element, they even manage to work it into the cutscenes with some rather hilarious results.Combat is also mostly unchanged from the way it was in the previous games; you will be laying waste to lots of enemies by using handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, missile launchers, grenades, etc. A new addition is the ability to call for supply drops and air strikes (it's possible one of these things was already included in Portable Ops, but I never got to play that game). You can even choose whether you want the controls to be laid out so that they resemble the controls in either MGS 4, Portable Ops, or one of the Monster Hunter games. Aside from the main missions (Main Ops) that drive the story forward and usually involve Big Boss sneaking through enemy territory or taking out attack teams and military vehicles, there are plenty of side missions (Extra Ops) to undertake which cover a wide range of objectives. Most of them are timed and include missions such as target practice, using Fulton Recovery on a certain number of enemies, locating hidden documents, protecting friendly targets, and fighting more heavily armed enemies and vehicles. These enemy vehicles, mainly APCs, tanks, and choppers, can also be captured and added to your own personal collection, just like enemy soldiers. This leads to the most significant change included in this game: base management. The main base of operations for MSF, known as Mother Base, goes through many changes as you add more recruits. Mother Base has several teams that operate within it and the success of the teams depends on how many soldiers you put in each of them (their skill levels are important factors as well). For example, putting enough soldiers in the combat unit lets you gain more experience points (GMP) that can be spent towards developing better weapons and equipment to use during missions as they become available to you. You can even play as one of the combat unit soldiers in the Extra Ops (in fact, some of these missions require you to play as one of these soldiers instead of as Big Boss). Also, soldiers in the combat unit can be sent on Outer Ops (more on that later). Putting enough soldiers in the R&D; team is what gives you access to the previously mentioned weapons and equipment. Putting enough soldiers in the medical team lets you make sure that any sick or injured soldiers will get better more quickly and gives you access to more potent healing items. In short, the more skilled soldiers you have in each team, the more smoothly things will go for you.As for the Outer Ops, they are basically special missions where your soldiers are sent to attack other enemy forces. Aside from choosing which soldiers or vehicles to send on Outer Ops, you have no direct control over how they turn out. When an Outer Op has ended, you are treated to a little video showing how the battle went. These are not fully animated videos showing your soldiers fighting other soldiers, instead what plays out on the screen is basically a combination of a digital chess match and a turn-based RPG. You'll see the icons of your soldiers and vehicles on one side of the screen and the icons of the enemy forces on the other side. Then, the soldiers and vehicles on each side will attack one another one by one. The first side to lose all available soldiers and vehicles loses, while the other side, of course, wins. Even if your side wins the battle, it is entirely possible for your soldiers and vehicles to come back wounded or damaged, and it's even possible for them to be killed or destroyed. While this all may sound somewhat overwhelming and complicated, leading your soldiers and managing Mother Base is actually quite easy to get a handle on and is really accessible to even newbie gamers. In fact, even if you're not that into playing video games, anyone looking to start their own business would do well to play this game simply to learn the basics of proper resource management. There is also a co-op element in this game where other players can join you online and assist you in missions. Being a mostly single player type of gamer myself, I didn't make use of this feature, but for those of you who are interested, it's there and it apparently works well.Peace Walker is indeed a very interesting take on the Metal Gear Solid series and brings some interesting innovations to the table, but there are a few nagging issues as well. For one thing, in typical RPG-type fashion, most of the boss fights are rather long and drawn out since they're all against armored vehicles, tanks, choppers, and the occasional giant robot; plus, they all possess extraordinarily long health bars. One of the final bosses in particular was especially frustrating...in fact, the word \"frustrating\" hardly does it justice. I almost gave up on it entirely. While this particular boss and a lot of the other later ones are optional, you actually do need to complete them if you want to see the true ending of the game. Yes, there's an initial ending and then a second true ending that can only be seen after completing all Main Ops and all Extra Ops (excluding some secret Extra Ops). The thing is, most of the missions after the first ending are made up of a lot of the same stuff that you've already done through the earlier parts of the game, and there are a lot of them to complete. It's basically a bunch of filler to make the game longer, which it didn't really need since the main game is easily about twice as long as all the previous Metal Gear Solid games. To make matters worse, in order to face the true final boss, there's a particular mission you have to complete first, but the game gives you absolutely no clue on how to even access this mission; I never would have found out how to get to it without checking for the solution online. Hopefully, these issues will be addressed in the upcoming sequel Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes, assuming that game ends up having a similar mission structure. As it is, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker dragged on a bit too much for my taste, especially when you compare it to the other games in the series, and this is coming from someone who has played several RPGs in his time. Regardless, this is still a great game and it's definitely worth looking into. On its own, Peace Walker gets 4 stars overall and 5 stars for fun.The Metal Gear Solid HD Collection is worth buying just for Peace Walker alone at its current price (especially if you're like me and don't own a PSP). When you combine it with the other two games in this collection, it's a no-brainer for MGS fans. Get it now if you haven't already.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2013"}

This game really has a lot of twists and turns to it ..... I've played several game series like Halo, COD, GTA & all of the Assassins Creed's but this game stands alone in a class by itself. Even the decisions you make during your quests ... whether its in conversations with who you meet or how you handle your objectives, the game shifts in the direction you want it to go. This is the first time I have played a game by Bethesda and this is a winner to me.Controls are pretty smooth and graphics hold up quite well for a 2008 title. I have encountered a few glitches but they have been far and few between. Ammunition really must be conserved and you must scrounge around (explore) to find it many cases. The traders don't sell a lot so you need to be &#34;efficient&#34; or use good tactics when taking down foes who are much stronger. Blazing guns doesn't seem to be a good strategy based on my own experience so far. As silly as it sounds one of my favorite things to do is lie and see if they believe me !!  Its great when you gain XP and good karma when you can lie your way into a peaceful settlement with a foe. I do need to get my science skill up though since I have been unable to unlock some computer terminals. I'm sure &#34;cracking&#34; those would make my quests easier.If you want something different that will keep you on the edge of your seat then you owe it to yourself to go buy this game. Its kept me busy for hours already and I have a long ways to go. I look forward to installing the DLC at some point but I have enough on my plate for now.

The Capital Wastelands is a huge open world providing many hours of completely absorbing fun. The story is staple SF stuff but the multiple quests required to complete it, along with the equally numerous side quests, make it satisfying enough. What's so impressive is the sheer scale and immersive quality of the world created by Bethesda. You can wander for hours around the Wastelands. I completed every single quest in the main game plus the 5 DLCs that come with the GOTY edition, then went in search of every bobblehead and every behemoth I hadn't already encountered, and now I'm finishing off the unlisted quests -- so far I've spent almost 170 hours in this game and have enjoyed every minute of it. The graphics are very good, if not quite on a par with very recent games. The voice acting is good throughout (one would expect no less from the likes of Liam Neeson), and the dialogue trees are often large and humorous. Also worth mentioning is the inspired retro design and use of music from the 1930s and 40s. The only downside is that it's a little unstable under Windows 7 (but you can't blame Bethesda for that, as it was created before the release of the operating system).

I mean sure the game is pretty short, but it's not pathetic or anything. I personally am extremely satisfied with Spearhead and feel that I got my money's worth.I also love to play online as well and have not noticed any lag issues that some of you speak of. I do run a cable modem, but is that not what you were referring to? I have no lag what so ever. The new multiplayer missions are the bomb! I highly recommend this game to anyone who loved MOHAA. I personally give the game 5 stars. However I can see where some people may have been disappointed with the length of the game. The bare minimum that this game would ever deserve is 3 1/2 stars, and that would have to be from someone who really doesn't care for MOH. Plain and simple, for me at least, Medal of Honor Allied Assault with Spearhead Expansion is my personal favorite game PERIOD.

Posey","summary":"Call of Duty: Black Ops - Review","reviewText":"Call of Duty is a name well known in the video game world.  The game is released every year or two and each release brings with it tremendous sales and an insanely loyal (when they get what they want) online fan base.  Modern Warfare 2 from developer Infinity Ward was a success but didn't receive the critical praise it's predecessor garnered.  With Treyarch's turn to woo the world at hand with a new game, will they succeed or are they forever doomed to be that other development company behind Infinity Ward.I'm probably one of the only people in the world who buys Call of Duty games for the single player experience.  I view the multiplayer as an added bonus that I play, but I'm mainly interested in the single player component first and foremost.  With that said, this review is going to focus primarily on the single player first and then I'll cover the multiplayer.  To date, I've beaten the campaign on normal difficulty and played about 5-6 hours of online multiplayer including zombie mode.  So, how does the game stack up compared to others?  In my opinion, it's the best yet.The single player story begins with your character (Mason) tied up in a room with TV screens all around you.  Someone from an overhead viewing window is yelling at you to remember some set of numbers.  After some introductions between the two characters and Mason realizing he's capture, you begins to flashback to the past at certain points in Mason's life, all circling around the Cold War and all playing a part to tell the story.  The first area you go to is Cuba where you are on a mission to kill Castro during the Bay of Pigs.  When you are finished the mission, you are whisked back to the interrogation room in current time.  The game is played through a sort of flashback segments that work incredibly well to tell the story.  Gone are the days of long hikes in a field to get to the next objective...instead, you are just transported there due to a memory jump.  Think of it sort of like Assassin's Creed but not exactly.During the story, you'll control a couple characters, but Mason is the main one.  I've heard some reviewers say that since you flash to and from a lot that you never get invested in the characters and their story but I didn't find that to be true.  I was definitely invested in the story from the get go and felt for each character.  The story overall though is the best you've ever seen in a Call of Duty game.  I'm a huge story fanatic when it comes to video games and I found myself looking forward to cutscene after cutscene to see what was going to happen next.  The story is great, but you might see the end twist coming a mile away like I did.  Still, it's a great story and it's a welcome addition to the series.The gameplay is the same formula you know and love from the Call of Duty franchise, except with the story set anywhere from 1948 to 1968 in the Cold War, you're going to be using a lot of different guns.  But, since you are an elite Black Ops team member, you'll have access to some weapons that others have never heard of for the times, like a shotgun that has exploding bullets that set targets on fire.  Something else that was more prominent in this game vs. the others was the use of vehicles.  There's some driving sequences but the really fun stuff takes place in the air in helicopters.  There's also a level where you start in a spy plane scouting the ground for a team trying to advance in a snow storm.  They can't see so they need you to guide them.  You have to navigate them around enemies and patrols and if they engage anyone the action zooms into the team and you take over for them.  This was an awesome mission that I really enjoyed, although it was short.  The combat in Black Ops is very similar to the other games so if you liked those, you'll be fine with this one as well.The entire story will last you around 6-8 hours depending on how you play it.  I tend to take my time and explore areas so it lasted longer for me.  Just because the single player game is short though, don't think you won't get your money.  Besides multiplayer (which I'll cover soon) there are other features included on the disc.  For starters, Zombie mode returns with the same winning formula that got it so much attention the first time around.  For those of you who aren't familiar with the mode, you play someone stuck in a building with zombies trying to get in.  You shoot to kill while also bording up windows and unlocking new areas to keep you safe.  Each kill nets you money which can be used to open up said areas or unlock new weapons.  It's great fun and you can even do it with a few other people.  I would have liked to see some more changes to it since it basically is the same game as before, but there is one awesome change they made that you'll see as soon as you beat the campaign.  I won't ruin the surprise.Something else included with the game is a top down shooter that can be unlocked from the main menu.  You need to break out of your restraints on the main menu by rapidly hitting the right and left triggers.  When you stand up, make your way to the computer and interact with it.  You can enter in two codes, DOA and zork.  DOA opens the top down shooter that is co-op enabled and something I would have gladly paid 10 bucks for on the marketplace.  The other is zork, a MUD that you probably won't play ever again after messing with it for a couple seconds.  Both open a new achievement though, so, you're welcome for the codes.The graphics in the game are nice, but nothing spectacular.  It looks like the engine they used in previous games hasn't been tweaked much since the models and explosions look very similar.  This isn't bad, just nothing new.  I did see some screenshot and video comparisons of the 360 version and PS3 and the 360 version is easily discernible as the better graphical version.  The only reason I say this is if you are like me and have both consoles and you want the better looking one, the Xbox 360 is the way to go with this one.  But, if you don't pay for Xbox Live, the choice is already made up for you.  Just something to keep in mind.Ok, on to the multiplayer.  The multiplayer this time around got a pretty big overhaul in terms of Call of Duty changes.  You still level up just like in previous iterations, but the levels come a lot faster.  Instead of unlocking weapons and perks at specific levels, you earn currency in the rounds that you use to buy items.  So, when you hit a certain level a bunch of weapons/perks, etc. become available for purchase all at once.  You then level up and earn money which you can then go and buy the one you want.  Hardcore fans of the multiplayer might be disappointed with the change, but I think it's a welcome addition.  I'm not a huge multiplayer fan because of the time sink involved.  With this new method, I can get to a level, earn some cash, and then buy my favorite weapon instead of having to level up a ton more to get it.  You get what you want, when you want it, in the order you want it.  You'll still have things to look forward to since certain weapons are only available at different levels.  Along with these changes, there is also a theatre mode (like Halo has with it's forge) where you can watch gameplay videos from your games and then change camera angles, save, and upload to the net for others to see.  I haven't played with this yet, but I did view some from other people.  The community is already taking part in it and it looks to be a defining feature of the online game experience.The customization is another aspect of the multiplayer game that has been adjusted.  Your first perk you choose decides what your character will look like.  You actually get to see a ragdoll of your character and you can change the perk to change the look.  You're going to pick the perk you like best and not the look but it's still near to see your character before going into the game.  Before, weapons decided the look, now it's the first perk.Another new feature to the online multiplayer is the wager system.  As I stated before, you earn money from rounds to buy things.  Well, if you are a gambling man, you can bet money to win more money.  There are a couple new modes (which I haven't tried out yet so I'll keep this brief) which allow you to bet money to place in the top 3.  These modes include things like \"One in the Chamber\" where you get one bullet and a knife to kill everyone.  Kill someone, and get another bullet.  Others involve bow and arrows and incremental guns with each kill.  This is going to be a fan favorite for a lot of people do to the very competitive nature of the games.  But, if you aren't that great at multiplayer but still want to bet a little, you can do the contract system.  With these, you pay to accept a contract and then try to meet it within the time frame.  For instance, the one I took yesterday had me pay 50 bucks to get 10 kills in the next round.  When I did, I won my money back plus some.  It's a neat system that people are going to love.  If you don't, just ignore it since it won't affect you.Call of Duty: Black Ops is a huge game.  So huge, that you would expect all of it's features to come on two discs, but they don't.  Treyarch has gone above and beyond the \"call\" to make something that is not only a great game, but is their own.  This is the game that sets them apart from Infinity Ward.  World at War was a great game, but there was still a feeling leaving them as the other developer.  That sentiment is now gone with Treyarch's love and affection put into a game that is the pinnacle of the series.  Black Ops is hands down the best Call of Duty to date.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

This game, while does have the same basic story line as all the others really brings new ideas, areas and of course new Pokemon as well as old favorites.  The Kalos region seems to be a cental location to all the other 5 areas (Kanto, Jhoto, Hoen, Sinnou, and Unova) which has more of a European flair than Japanese like the past installments (though given the diversity there is a Japanese area).  I love the fact you can customize your character with new clothes, ways to VR train your pokemon, and or course new ways to travel (skates enter the picture as well as riding certain Pokemon), the graphics are amazing and do POP in 3d mode.  And the new battle animations are more enjoyable than the past games - the only gripe i have on this is the fact only Pikachu (I know the most recognized and famous Pokemon known)has a voice, all the others use simple bit sounds (though they try to sound like their names)and the new air combat and horde modes bring new ways to fight and catch pokemon.  Overall I give this a major thumbs up and while only got my first badge, can not wait to see what new things the Kalos region brings.GOT TO CATCH THEM ALL!!!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2013"}
