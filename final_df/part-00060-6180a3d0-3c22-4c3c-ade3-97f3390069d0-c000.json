You can use anything to defend yourself with, a trash can, chair, broom, stick, bottle, you can use anything you see (trust me). A fun little thing is, you can go in stores and pick up things, without anyone saying anything (who hasn't thought of that) like clothes and weapons (shotguns, rifles, machineguns and a host of other weapons) you can also go in the maintenance room and combine items together and make your own weapons, (like a baseball bat with nails for spikes and so forth) nothing complicated at all.

My daughter loves this game and it has enough going on to keep her interested and enjoying the game. Only a couple of items that will detract from this getting a solid 5 stars. 1. The price point for the game is very high! This is a relatively basic game with decent graphics, but compared to other mainstream games for the PC or other console game systems, the price doesn't come close to justification. Lastly, the game supports multi-player with another DS, but requires that both players have the game (other titles have multiplayer connections without requiring both parties to have the game). A limitation in my book both for price and overall functionality. It is fun, and I expect that it will be in my daughter's game library of favorites for some time. Even used versions of this game are only a fraction off the current retail price which has been north of $34 USD for some time. I'm sure that Nintendo has a business model that keeps them in business, but it would seem that a lower price point would help with higher overall volume of sales!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Louie the Italian Jew \"Lou da Joo\"","summary":"Great multiplayer experience","reviewText":"Halo is one of those games that has defined the XBox from its inception. I've had friends say that this is the reason many even purchase an XBox, going back to the PS2 days. Some say the 360 has improved the series, although some may disagree.This was my first Halo experience, and I must admit I have mixed feelings.+++++ What I liked:I loved the multiplayer aspect. As a person that really is horrible at video games, I usually feel guilty at doing so poorly for a team and not being able to shoulder the weight for myself. With Halo, it's every man for himself. If I do poorly, I get a poor score, and nobody is mad at me. If you've never played Halo3's multiplayer, I highly suggest it. I also liked being able to play individual parts of the game after you've completed the game. The game is a lot easier to navigate the second time around. Navigation becomes second nature the second time around, and playing individual missions avoids having to play every other mission in order to play your preferred mission.-----What I didn't like:Waypoints help you navigate your way around in Halo 3. The waypoints helped me a lot in reading the map, but there were some waypoints that I couldn't set up because there was an obstruction like a building, so I just guessed in those instances or set up waypoints beyond the obstruction, but usually that didn't help.  The maps were hard to follow and I spent a lot of time going back and forth. Although, you can press up or down on the D-pad to further assist you, I felt that I spent a lot time navigating through the maps the first time through.The second aspect I didn't like was finding beacons. Most were easy to find, but I remember two which I spent an hour looking for before I decided to cheat by looking on youtube walkthrough videos. What was the purpose of placing a beacon in the sky? That just frustrated me. The third aspect I didn't like was firefight. I liked it, but I couldn't play with friends, mostly because I don't have friends. I wish I could have paired up randomly with someone online, but the game didn't allow that.Overall, the multiplayer aspect earns 5 stars, but I think the single player campaign mode could have been improved.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"M. Herzog","summary":"Surprisingly Awesome","reviewText":"I'm a huge Halo fan.  Played the first two to death.  I remember me and friends had to by chords long enough to go from room to room in our dorms to have some awesome matches.  I love the franchise and usually and a rather trustworthy fan.  However, ODST was not something I was particularly interested in.  It just seemed like a quick cash grab.  I read the reviews, most of which liked it, but it just seemed like I was getting a short campaign and a bunch of maps.  Hardly worth the full retail price tag.  Luckily the price significantly dropped, so I decided I'd give it a chance and I am glad I did. Without giving too much away, the single player is an experience in itself.  You get to play as multiple characters, each with different personalities showing different portions of the story.  What surprised me is how much I liked the characters (well, most of them, but I'll get to that later).  I really enjoyed going through each story, watching it unfold, and learning what happened to various characters, only to move onto the next part of the story.  And for you firefly fans out there, Nathan Fillion voices a character that looks just like him, and you even get to play as him from time to time.  So even if you don't like Halo, you can pretend your Mal from the show.But there is a few drawbacks.  The first, the \"Rookie\" character has no lines or personality.  He's just a throwaway guy.  This wouldn't be a problem, but your play as him more than anyone, so its kind of a shame his character wasn't given more of a personality.  Also, the campaign is fairly short, especially for Halo veterans.  I would expect you to finish the campaign in about five to six hours.Overall a great game.  I really was surprised.  Now that the price has come down, I would highly recommend giving it a try.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2011"}

So when I do get \"busted\" by the enemy, and they're standing right next to me or in front of me because I couldn't sneak up on them, or sneak pass them well enough,  I like to be able to knock them out BEFORE they can raise the alarm, scream like hello kitty, or do whatever they need to do so that their buddies (or they themselves) can kill me.  Thankfully, this game has done a great job with the hand to hand combat so that I dont have to worry about this problem anymore. I now feel that I have a pretty good fighting chance to continue through the game without having to go back to the \"try again\" screen if I fail.I think the improved close up hand to hand combat system is a great balance between stealth and action.  It made the game a bit more fun to play because I had the option to either stealth my way through a level, go in guns blazing though a level, or mix up both aspects of stealth and action to get through a level.  I really had a much deeper experience playing this game than I had when I played the first 4 Splinter Cell games.Character models, graphics, atmosphere, locations, voice acting, music, gameplay, and story are all excellent.I always thought that as far as stealth actiion games goes, the Splinter Cell series was better than all other stealth action games out there, and judging by the improved combat system here, I still think that Splinter Cell is the best. It just keeps getting better and better. Looking forward to playing the next installment of this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00178630A","description":"","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"Going back to hell has never been this much fun!!!","reviewText":"It's a dark and dreary day outside here in MD and it's just perfect for this game.  Yes, I had some of the problems that others had getting into the game and yes Blizzard, requiring a constant internet connection to play DOES INDEED SUCK, but it's the first day of launch and one of the most anticipated PC games since the LAST Starcraft game is back to suck time out of our hands once again.I remember getting a hold of Diablo II back in 2002 to play while I was out sick and it dominated my life for nearly 4 months and in that time, I had to upgrade my PC twice so that it would run properly.  This time I was prepared and so far, so good.Thank you Blizzard for doing the same as you did with Starcraft and making this installable on both a Mac and a PC as I had no problems installing on either but again, requiring one to be online to play single player was not a good idea!EDIT:Diablo III: Is the trip back to hell worth it?So after 2-3 hrs of waiting for the servers to go online, an hr of phone time with Verizon to reset my internet connection and finally putting four or five hrs in, here is where we stand:Issue #1: Blizzard really dropped the ball on the server issue. While I had no probs getting on very early yesterday, when I came home yesterday afternoon, the servers were down for at least 2 - 3 hrs (which gave me some time to play Max Payne which is a game that reminds me soooo much of Stranglehold which came out in 2007) and trying to log in a few times got so bad, that I actually had to call Verizon to have them reboot and refresh our routers from outside. Finally around 6pm I got on and played until around 11pmIssue #2: No way in hell (hehe...see what I did there?) should this be an online only game to play. I get the idea considering how bad Diablo II was abused but there is no reason with the server issues that they had should a game like this require a constant internet connection just to play. And it really sucks that there is no LAN option similar to what Diablo II had.The game itself:After playing so many of the clones like Scared I and II, Titan Quest (one of the best clones) and a few forgettable others, I was glad to say that this was worth the wait. Yeah this game plays akin to a FTP MMORPG but without all of the hassle. Your game is instanced which means you or whomever else you allow in run that instance and you don't have mobs of people to share a game world with.Graphically, it's not phenomenal or mind blowing but on both my PC and my wife's iMac the game is running at full tilt although her machine has the option of running it at max res of 2550 x 1600 which makes it a little more crisp. However, the environments are dark and creepy, not bright, cartoony and Fable-ish like what some feared would happen. I got no lag time when lots of monster crowded the screen and I was impressed by some of the lighting SFX. The one small complaint I have on the graphics is that most of the time you are outdoors, there is this 'fog' that takes away a lot of the detail of the game but ones you go inside not so much. Also because it's an isometric view, you really can't scroll in close to see a lot of the details, but what is cool is the gore fest that you get; eviscerations, decapitations and so forth to ensure that you are playing the right game and it's good!Control-wise, I still feel like I need to calibrate my mouse a bit because sometimes I feel like I am moving although I want to shoot and vice-versa but thankfully it's compact and you aren't made to feel like you need to learn a lot of buttons to play it.But game wise? It's DIABLO plain and simple. It's dark and dreary with plenty to kill. What i really like and loathe simultaneously is that surprisingly there are a lot of environmental pieces that are destructible such as walls, tables, bannisters and so on but the problem is even though you can use some of these as traps to kill monsters, it doesn't affect you or your companion, which for a game like this is a bit cheap but oh well.Loot drops are plentiful and I don't know if it's me but in Diablo II, I don't remember finding as much magical stuff so frequently as I have thus far. My stash is mostly full with stuff I may be able to use and because now I have the blacksmith available, I can break down some of the junk and build better weapons but as soon as I get my 14K of gold, I am buying more stash room! And that is the other thing, you can and will accumulate gold very rapidly so no worries about being able to eventually buying a \"Sword of Thrashing\" for 5k because in less than 2 hrs you can afford it!Now while people will probably criticize the new leveling system, I like it. Once I level up, all I need to do is go in, activate the new skill, see if I like my new skill as opposed to my old skill and K.I.M. No need to fol around for an hr, trying to figure out where to put your points because it's done for you. At first I didn't like it but after 2 hrs, I was like let me hurry and get my Demon Hunter leveled so I can hurry up and continue!And how unfortunate was I that the server went down for maintenance the MOMENT I made it to the Skeleton King? Besides it was 11pm and I needed to go to bed but that old feeling of 'just one more dungeon' had crept back in like days of old with Diablo II.Blizzard did a good job of recreating that dangling the carrot feel that I haven't had since 2003 and I have no idea if they put crack into these games or what but few other games had me as hooked as Diablo II and so far no one has recreated its success. However, Blizzard needs to seriously fix the server issue because the forums have be lit ablaze by angry gamers who really wanted to get their fix and due to numerous server outages, were unable to do so. it's not like Blizzard didn't know to expect so many people; 800,000 people in the US alone reserved it and almost 1.5 million across the globe. Once they get past this issue and things settle down, I have a feeling that enough people will jump on and play the hell out of this game over and over like we did 10 years ago.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2012"}

The expression \"Logitech giveth and Logitech taketh away\" seems most pertinent.So, let's start:Opening the box and getting everything out is very simple. All the parts are well designed, but you're immediately greeted with what I think is the biggest issue with the G25/27 set, - the cables. So many cables! 400 cables! (at least it feels like it)The wheel has a cable coming out of it that goes into your PS3; the pedals have a cable coming out of it; the shifter has a cable coming out of it, and then there's the power brick that has a cable to be plugged in. All these cables plug into the wheel itself, and it's definitely not a pretty sight. I don't know about other people, but I don't have a place where I can leave my steering wheel/shifter/pedals plugged in 24/7, so setting all this up and putting it away again is a COMPLETE pain in the rear.Putting the cable issue aside, there's a lot to like with the G27. It's an improvement over the G25 in many ways:1.) The G27 wheel uses helical gears (or diagonal-cut gears) vs the G25's straight-cut gears. What this means is that there's a reduction in noise when turning the wheel, and it's also smoother while maintaing powerful force feedback! Great stuff!2.) The shifter on the G27 no longer has a sequential mode (i.e. clicks up and down only), which is no big loss to me. I prefer either the regular 6-speed or using the paddle shifts on the wheel. While it may seem that this is still a LOSS compared to the G25's 6-speed AND sequential shifting, the new addition to the G27 is that the gears don't CLICK into place. On the G25, every gear change would greet you with a CLICK as the gear was put into place. Logitech have removed this sound so the gear movements don't hurt your ears with their plastic sounds as the G25 did. Now, some people have modified their G25 shifters to remove this sound, but it voids your warranty and I've read of several people irreparably breaking their shifters by doing this... In any case, for me, the G27 shifter is an improvement over the out-of-the-box G25 shifter.3.) The pedals are now adjustable, which makes it a joy to heel-and-toe while racing. The pedal layout is a huge deal more comfortable than on the G25 pedals. This, for me, is a huge improvement. My right foot would get very uncomfortable with the G25 layout.4.) There's a new set of tachometer LEDs on the wheel, though I've yet to play any game that supports them yet... It's a neat little feature, though, if it does as advertised.5.) The G27 also has some more buttons on the steering wheel, which you can customize, of course.So how does it play?VERY well, depending on the software!Need for Speed: Shift PS3:I first tried out Need for Speed: Shift on the Playstation 3, and was pleasantly surprised to see that no setup is needed, and the controls just work. In fact, it even shows you a picture of the wheel/pedals on the control screen (albeit just the G25, but still...). It's great to have the wheel work out of the box with no tinkering. THAT said, there's perhaps too much force feedback in Shift to be particularly comfortable. The faster you get, the more the wheel fights with you. At 120mph, it's very hard to keep the wheel straight. I've track-driven several times at near 150mph speeds at times, and I can safely say my steering wheel doesn't fight me in real life like it did in the game...So, for ease of use with Shift, I'd say 5/10. It's just too hard to keep the wheel straight at relatively high speeds...Gran Turismo: Prologue PS3:NOW we're talking. None of the fighting I experienced in Need for Speed: Shift, and plenty of smooth corners and subtle force feedback. It's fair to say the force feedback is a tad muted in Prologue, but it's infinitely more comfortable to play than Shift, and a real joy to hit those apexes time and time again. 9/10.Overall, this wheel is excellent, but the pain of setting it up is just too much to ignore. It really is a cable nightmare. The wheel, pedals and shifter could easily be wireless by this point, meaning the only cable needed would be a power cable to the steering wheel for the force feedback to work. I suspect the inevitable G29 will remedy this, as the way the G27 currently works is a direct copy of the G25 which is 3 years old as of November, 2009.Overall, though, a great wheel, if you can be bothered to go through the setting it up...!4/5Note: This wheel is for PC AND PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

{"product_name":"B003Q55YCU","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Frye","summary":"Not a CoD-beater, but an unsettling story helps it become something unique and interesting.","reviewText":"First-person shooters are usually not focused on story. Games like Call of Duty are more focused on action than an interesting storyline. Who cares if you can't remember why you're hunting down a terrorist, because THEY JUST DROPPED A NUKE!!!!! I'm not saying that Call of Duty is bad - I'm just saying its story is forgetable. This is where Homefront comes in. This game has a much bigger focus on story than many other shooter franchises, putting players in the middle of a Korean occupation of the US. Does this shooter succeed in its goal, or is it just another bland shooter?Homefront's campaign starts off with one of the most emotional openings I've seen in quite a while, showing players the true brutality of the savage Korean occupation. Seeing people being beaten on the streets, while a baby is crying over his parent's dead bodies is truly unsettling. Soon after the introduction, you are a member of the Resistance, fighting back against a superior force. Writer John Milius (Apocalypse Now, Red Dawn) has created one of the most emotional stories in video games, and I actually felt like I was about to cry in a few spots. My only complaint about the story (and trust me, this is the only one) is the main character. He never talks, and you have no idea what he's thinking. Giving him a voice and mind would have helped the story quite a bit. But, considering how great the rest of the story is, this is a very minor complaint.While the story of Homefront is really quite excellent, the gameplay never quite reaches that standard. Don't get me wrong - the gameplay is not bad, it's just slightly repetitive. This game definitely gets the basics of first-person shooters down, however. Shooting feels satisfying, and the action is almost always non-stop. One thing I like about the game is that the game doesn't throw thousands of explosions at your face every ten seconds. The game is more about action-packed gun-fights instead of non-stop explosions. The game has just the appropiate amount of action - there's always a lot of it, but it doesn't get over the top.However, back to my complaint about the gameplay - it just gets a bit repetitive. While the locations are diverse, the game just doesn't have quite enough variety. The first four chapters are basically just \"shoot all enemies, then proceed to shoot more in a different area.\" While the remote controlled tank you can control in the game (nicknamed \"Goliath\") shakes things up a bit, the game is still slightly repetitive as a whole.Luckily, the last three chapters (sneaking your way through a camp, defending a convoy in a helicopter, and taking part in a full-on assault of the Golden Gate bridge) are much more fun that the first four chapters. The variety here is a lot better, and it makes me wonder why it wasn't like this in the beginning of the campaign. In particular, the Golden Gate bridge siege is one of the most memorable moments I've experienced in first-person shooters.Overall, the campaign was very good in Homefront. While the beginning of the campaign was repetitive, the later parts of the game make up for it. The emotional story was something new and refreshing that I have never experienced in a first-person shooter. A sequel, being developed by Crytek, has also been announced, and is coming for 2014. While that's a long way off, I can't wait to see how the story continues from this game, considering the massive cliffhangar ending of this one.Once you have beaten the campaign, there is also a multiplayer mode. This mode is a fantastic alternative from bigger franchises, and features a slew of unlockable weapons, gear, and perks. Vehicular combat is also a big focus here, and the remote-controlled drones are also deadly. The maps are very well designed, and the game is also very balanced. One complaint that I have with the game is that there aren't that many maps and modes. There are a total of seven maps, and while these maps are well designed, I think that there could have been more. However, the biggest disappointment is that there are only two game modes - Team Deathmatch and Ground Control. While both of these modes are fantastic fun, I think that there could have been just a few more modes of play.However, these complaints are minor due to one simple fact - Homefront multiplayer is a blast. The tight gunplay from the campaign transitions well onto the multiplayer battlefield, and the leveling system is fantastic, with perks, weapons, and drones waiting to be unlocked. Also a great feature is that the game's two game modes (TDM and Ground Control) both appeal to two different types of people. Those who want more of a straight-forward, CoD-like experience should pick TDM, while Ground Control is very similar to Battlefield's Conquest mode. People wanting more of a tactical experience should play Ground Control.However, one of the best parts of Homefront's multiplayer is the Battle Points system. The Battle Points system is where things get interesting. See, when you capture objectives and kill enemy players, you gain battle points. These battle points can be spent in-game on drones and vehicles. Whether you want to spend your points as soon as you get them or save up your points for the bigger and more powerful vehicles and drones is up to you. Either way, most matches begin with foot soldiers and small drones, and end with attack helicopters and battle tanks. All multiplayer matches don't feel like minor skirmishes - they feel like all-out war, mostly due to the 32-player count, but also due to the massive amount of vehicles and drones on the screen at once.Overall, the multiplayer matches of Homefront are some of the most fun I've had in a first-person shooter. Homefront has earned its place among the ranks of Call of Duty and Battlefield, and anyone looking for a good time couldn't go wrong with this game.As for Homefront's overall presentation, the graphics are pretty good. Textures look really good, and the framerate holds up no matter what's happening onscreen. However, the graphics aren't quite as good as its competitors. For instance, there is some aliasing issues in the game, as well as a blurry texture here and there. However, Homefront is still a very good looking shooter, despite these issues.Now, on to easily one of the best things about this game - the audio. The voice acting here is Hollywood caliber, with the characters delivering emotional lines without things getting too cheesy. The sound effects are also some of the best I've heard, with the fantastic gunfire and explosion sound effects making it feel like you're in a real war. However, none of these componets come close to the quality of the soundtrack. The main theme is so good that I have to listen to the two minute long song at the main menu before I even start playing. The soundtrack fits the game really well, and its so good that I actually went on to iTunes and downloaded the song to my iPod. It's just that stunning.As for how long you will be playing this game, let me just come out and say it - a pretty long while. While the campaign is pretty short, and really only worth 1-2 playthroughs, the multiplayer features a pretty in-depth level cap of 75. There is no prestiging like in Call of Duty, but the game is still a blast to play, even when there is no more to unlock.Overall, this game is fantastic. The campaign is emotional, the multiplayer is fantastic, and the game will last you a long while. While I wish the campaign was less repetitive, the game is still a very good choice for someone tired of the more popular shooter franchises.Story: 9.5Graphics: 8.5Audio: 10.0Gameplay: 9.0Lasting Appeal: 8.5Overall Rating: 9 out of 10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2012"}

The story is told through good mission design and wonderfully rendered cinematics.Graphics:  9/10The game looks great.  There are jungles, deserts, frozen tundras, space stations, mechs, battles, giant monsters...  Everything looks great and the character designs are excellent (Which is what you'd expect from Capcom.)Gameplay:  MixedThere are 4 basic gameplay Modes and some are better than others.Single Player Campaign:  7/10You can play through the story alone or with friends.  If you play alone, you can select 1-3 AI allies to help you.  But these guys aren't the sharpest tools in the shed.  They're more like a sack of hammers.  They just sort of run around and help a bit.  This is good because it allows the player to do the important stuff and feel like a hero.  But it's also bad because it doesn't feel like they're helping enough.  At least they don't hinder you.  Most of the levels are over the top outstanding, but a few of them are a bit confusing.  It's not exactly clear where you need to go and you might be a little bit frustrated at times.Coop Campaign:  9/10Man, this is fun if you have the right people.  It's the same levels, but you and your friends feel like an elite special forces group of badasses as you take down enemies together.  The game allows you to customize the look, animations, weapons, and special abilities of your characters.  It's not to the degree as something like World of Warcraft, but you really can set up your character to specialize in a certain type of situation.  (Battling vs Mechs, Monsters, Troops, aiding Allies, etc...)  I'm addicted to this mode right now.  And, if your party dies too many times, you can actually fail the level, so there's some pressure on the team to work together.Training Mode:  5/10Not sure why this is in the game, but you can run obstacle courses, try things out, or battle AI enemies in arenas.  It's pretty simple and you get XP for playing.Vs Mode:  3/10This is not good.  There are a bunch of levels with a bunch of different objectives like:  Elimination, Team Elimination, Data Post Capture, Akrid Egg Capture, etc...  Unfortunately, the grenades in the game are WAAAY overpowered, so the action pretty much devolves into people throwing grenades over walls.  In the larger maps, you really have to know where the good weapons are or you will get owned.  (Pwned)  Also, this mode really could have been much better if the players were allowed to customize their gear like in Call of Duty.  Instead you normally spawn with a generic gun and random grenades.  It's too bad because the game really doesn't allow you to adopt a playstyle (Sniper, Support, Heavy Gunner, etc...)Levels:  7/10Aside from a few confusing spots, the levels are great looking, imaginative, and require some teamwork.  They're very epic and over the top, too!!!  Battles on trains, battles on flying warships, battles underground, battles in space, battles in the jungle...  They're GREAT!  The mission objectives are:  Kill Giant Monster, Control certain parts of the map, Vital Suit Battles, advance through hostile territory and kill everything along the way...Advancement:  5/10Whenever you play any mode, you earn points.  These points are used to unlock things via a slot machine mechanic.  Push the button and get something.  (There is no fail.)  You earn either a nickname like, \"Machine Gun Maniac\", \"Techromancer\", \"Shy around girls\", \"Need to do homework\", \"Outlaw\", the scores of names basically allow you to give a bit of personality to your character.  You can also unlock one of a hundred different emotes which range from useful, to fun, to hilarious.  There are communication emotes, \"Follow Me\", \"Over Here\" to dances \"The Nerd\", \"Hip Thrust\", \"Lizard Dance\", etc...  There are taunts, happy emotes, cooperative emotes, and group emotes.  They're all very well done and pretty fun.  And finally, you can unlock weapons.  Machine Gun II, Machine Gun III, Gun Sword, Plasma Grenade II, etc...  The game doesn't ever tell you the difference between them though, which is disappointing.  I'd love to see stats.  Actually, I'd love to see a gun, then be able to add parts to it like a longer clip, a scope, a flash suppressor, etc...  similar to Call of Duty.  That would have really helped this game quite a bit.Sound:  10+/10The soundtrack is an epic score worthy of a Hollywood Summer Blockbuster and the combat SFX are GREAT!!!Replay Value:  9/10If you enjoy the Coop Mode, you can really get a lot of enjoyment out of the game.  There are 4 different difficulty levels, too.  Oh, and there are 22 Unique Missions.Maturity:  TeenThere is some sci-fi violence, but nothing gory or over the top.  No sex.  And there are a few swear words for comic value.Overall:  7/10This is a pretty good single player game, a great co-op game, and a terrible Vs. game.  If you liked the combat of Lost Planet 1 and you have friends to play with, you can really have a lot of fun.  The game is pretty cheap now and definitely worth getting.Buy it if you will have an Xbox Live Gold Account and will use the Coop Feature.Rent it if you have about 10 hours to blow through the single player campaign.Avoid it if you love VS Multiplayer.  This is pretty weak and doesn't really stand up to the other shooters.If you enjoyed the Coop Feature here, you should have fun playing Gears of War 3 and Halo Reach.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2012"}

There's no New Game+ (like in Final Fantasy X-2) which means you have to learn abilities all over again. This is probably why the designers made huge levels with tons of enemies so you can collect lots of Xperience points necessary for leveling up your characters and see their Xtreme powers (although I finished the game without unlocking the other abilities so I don't know how they look in battle). You could, however, train in the Danger Room if you want more XP but it gets boring eventually. Some people say only the characters you use gain XP, but I think it's wrong. I found that characters which I rarely use in the game also gain XP so no one is left behind. The AI can be very stupid at times - characters fall off cliffs; and when you try to fly an ally and go back to pick up another one, the first one will follow you and fall down again (best thing is to use iceman or magma to make bridges). It's not always easy to change team since save points are not so frequent and this can get very annoying during timed missions. I don't mind the cel-shaded graphics as they work well during gameplay (no slowing down even when it gets very chaotic). Lastly, load times are quite long but at least you get to see some cool load screens.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2004"}

After finishing the campaign and some VR missions, this is how I would put it.******************************Pros**************************************-Satisfying Heck&Slash; Gameplay: This is the main reason you should buy this game. If you liked Devil May Cry, Bayonetta, Dante's Inferno or may be even God of War, this is the game for you. While heck&slash; action is not as great as say Devil May Cry 3, it is tons of fun. Plus, the Blade Mode is unique.-Unique Blade Mode: Yes this is what you see in trailers. Where time is frozen or very slow and Raiden is precision slicing through enemies, tanks, objects etc. At first I felt that it didn't go well with heck&slash; gameplay, but in half and hour I began to love it and I especially enjoyed the creative use of it during enemies and boss fight.-Boss Battles: I love games with good boss battles and Rising definitely has some really nice bosses. I like how each boss battle requires some strategy. You simply can't button mash your way out of it. I especially loved the high speed boss battles where you utilize combination of Raiden's ninja run, blade mode and combos. This is one reason I will be playing this game over and over and over again.-Last Boss: WOW I just loved it. They make this guy look like a joke in the beginning but it is only after you listen to his reasoning and fight him, you realize that he deserves to be final boss in every sense. Bravo to whoever came up with the idea. I was really surprised by this and truly enjoyed this fight.-Nicely designed unique enemies: This game surprisingly offers decent amount of different enemies ranging from weak cyborgs to large gekkos. Each requires a slightly different strategy making gameplay quite fun.-Ninja Run: I really like the concept of ninja run in this game.  Raiden running around the enemies (especially fast huge and heavily armed enemies), dodging and deflecting bullets, passing through the objects..... looks just so awesome.-Nice graphics and great scenic locations: Graphics were better than I expected and environment are nicely designed for the most stages.-Decent variety of upgradable weapons: The primary and secondary weapons (but not subweapons) are interesting. I especially liked the arm-poll. The fact that you can upgrade them adds RPG element to this game, making fights and gathering experience more fun.-Zandatsu and precision right hand chops: To replenish your health, energy you need to precision cut enemies at certain points (zandatsu) and to acquire certain new upgrades you need to collect right hands of certain enemies. Both of these require precision cutting. I didn't think I would, but I actually ended up liking this.-VR Missions and New game plus: The game itself is not that long, but you can unlock VR missions and play them adding longevity to the experience. Also new game plus mode allows you to keep weapons and experience so you can master all the weapons, acquire all the upgrades and techniques. Like it.******************************Cons**************************************-Identity Crisis: There was absolutely no need to keep stealth in this perfectly fine heck&slash; game but I guess having Metal Gear in the name the creators decided to do so. I see no reason why a kickas* cyborg needs to hide at all. Also hiding is not the reason I purchase this game. I purchased it because I wanted to toss metal gear in the air and chop it up into millions of pieces. They should have just made this is a pure heck&slash; game instead of keeping some missions stealth which are highly annoying.-Missed opportunities: This could have been a great game if they focused the story more on Raiden or the Metal gear universe. They could have made the story so much more personal to Raiden. But instead they decided to fill the cut scenes with cheesy and lame jokes and dialogues. Such a tragedy.-Subweapons: They are difficult to use in fast-paced combat and hurt the pace so badly. Also many of them don't make sense. A javelin does less damage to choppers than your blade. Simply remove them.******************************Conclusion**************************************Contrary to the cons I described the gameplay alone in this game makes it worth it. Not to mention the last boss who cracked me up. While short, it had variety of enemies and fun bosses. This really adds to replayability of this game and worth a purchase. If you like DMC, Ninja Gaiden, Bayonetta etc. do yourself a favor and give this a shot.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

Nevertheless, Nintendo has made the decision to expand their Classic Controller and improve it with the new Classic Controller Pro for the Wii. This new version of the classic controller has a easier grip that helps you control the games you play, whether it is a download of Super Mario 64, or playing certain Wii games that you buy that can be compatable with the controller like smashing your opponents during a match of Super Smash Brothers Brawl, or racing against others during a online race of Mario Kart Wii. While all the excitement is there, the only one major flaw Nintendo decided not to improve on is making the Classic Controller Pro compatable to the Nintendo Gamecube games that the Wii can play like The Legend Of Zelda: The Wind Waker.

{"product_name":"B000WQWPOQ","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Chaotic Neutral Never Felt So Chaotic Awesome!!!","reviewText":"Prototype allows you to grow organic body armor with blades sharp enough to cut 10 people in half, jump 50 yards, run up a skyscraper, karate kick a helicopter, grab onto it, force open the cockpit, throw the pilot to his death, fly the helicopter through the streets of New York unleashing guns and missiles on traffic, zombies, tanks, and soldiers, bail out of the helicopter - crashing it into a building, glide to the ground, grab an unsuspecting human, digest him, steal his appearance, and blame someone else for what you just did.  If that sounds awesome to you, buy Prototype!Concept:  10/10Take Spiderman's Symbiotic Suit (aka Venom & Carnage) push it to the limit, give it to a maniac, have him kill an army of zombies and a misguided military in, around, and above the streets of New York.  You get to be that maniac!Story:  9/10You are Alex Mercer, a very bad man who has inherited superhuman powers.  You're on a quest to stop a viral outbreak that turns people into mutant zombies and to stop a rogue general with the military at his disposal.  The story is told through cutscenes and missions.  Additional story detail can be obtained through \"Digesting\" key NPC's and stealing their memories.  It's exciting, compelling, and well acted.Gameplay:  9/10The abilities bestowed upon Alex Mercer are amazing!  You get an arsenal of military weapons.  You can hijack tanks on the ground and helicopters out of the air!  You can run up skyscrapers.  You can glide through New York.  Your body can morph into different types of weapons.  You can take the shape of any NPC, so stealth is also an option.  When you destroy things or complete missions, you get points that you can use to upgrade Alex.  Rampaging through New York is fun, but it does take time to learn how to use all of Alex's upgrades and there isn't much guidance on what you should upgrade.  There is a lot of depth in the game, and you won't fully understand it until you are about 90% of the way through.  Once you understand how to fully use all of the powers, the game becomes amazing!Graphics:  8/10The graphics are good, considering that the game has to draw all of New York from the ground and the air.  The character models are also pretty good.  You can expect to see 100 characters, tanks, cars, helicopters, zombies... on screen at once!Level Design:  7/10Some levels are better than others.  There's a good variety, showcasing all of Alex's Powers.  The difficulty differs between easy and you'll die before you can read the Mission Objective.  There is no 'right' way to complete a mission.  You can use speed, stealth, brute force, or hijack military vehicles.  If you fail a mission, you can always upgrade and try new tactics.Replay Value:  7/10The game is open ended, there are a ton of optional missions, and different difficulty settings.  Prototype's single player campaign is 11-20 hours long, depending on how many optional missions you do.  I would strongly suggest taking your time and learning how to use Alex's powers before attempting the later missions.  You'll have more fun that way.Maturity:The game is rated M for throwing people to their deaths, chopping them in half, blowing them up, crushing their skulls, impaling them, running them over, gunning them down, and splattering them against the ground... Oh, and there's some harsh language, too.Overall: 9/10Prototype is a very fun open world superhero game.  Trashing New York with super powers and military vehicles is a great way to blow off some steam.  Some of the gameplay could use a bit more polish, but the scope of this game is so huge any slight faults are forgiven.Buy it if you want New York as your playground and you're feeling destructive, if you've ever wanted to play a Venom game without Venom, or you loved Hulk:  Ultimate Destruction.Actually, this game could have been called \"Skinny Guy: Ultimate Destruction.\"Rent it if you like action games, have an extra 15 hours, and only play through games once.Avoid it if you like linear missions, playing good guys, or you don't like violence.If you like this game, I can recommend Red Faction Guerilla, Crackdown, or Infamous (if you own a PS3.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2009"}

The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance.

You probably heard about the customization & how cars handle from other people, but let me tell you some other points:1- There are no manual car transmission ( lost 1 star just because of that)2- Cars don't handle correctly( it's an arcade game, so don't expect anything like NFS Shift). Just double tap the brake button and you are drifting in no time.3- Soundtracks are really bad in my opinion( It's totally personal opinion, but I remember how I used to get high every time my favorite song ( Bullet for my valentine ) came up on the original most wanted.4- Don't buy new DLCs, they don't offer any good cars, except a very few.( Dodge charger from Movie pack & BMW from Hero pack+ Venom GT from ultimate speed pack are the best, don't spend $30 to get only these 3 cars)5- Multiplayer is childish, that's the best way I can describe it. Some challenges are really BS. Drifting in circular pattern & score, or there is this piece of wood; go jump over it and stay on the bridge as long as you can. Races are fun tho, but that's it. Everything else feel childish & stupid.Finally, get the game if it's like $20-27. Right now online is free, no more online passes. Go buy it and try it for yourself, u may enjoy it. I got the game only to see how they designed the new Dodge Charger and have fun with my fav BMW M3( original Most wanted edition).","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0050SVNP8","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"A Great Sequel","reviewText":"When Pokemon Black and White came out, I decided to be a part of my daughter's love for these games:  she wanted Black, so I bought White, and together we shared our adventures as we went through the game.  With Pokemon Black and White 2, we did the same thing, and I'm impressed with how much more fun they've made the sequel.  You don't have to have played the first Black or White to figure out the game, but if you have, it's interesting to see how very much the Unova Region (the game's setting) has changed.  You will see familiar places and new ones--even the starting city is totally different!  But also White 2 and Black 2 have added a lot more of the older Pokemon for you to find beyond the ones that were in the first Black or White games--and there is also  Therian Tornadus, Thundurus, and Landorus (I only found a Thundurus in the first Pokemon White, but it was fun to catch him!).If you're new to Pokemon, the shortest way I could explain it is that you are a young person in a land where many different kinds of creatures exist in the wild called 'Pokemon'. These creatures can be captured and cared for, and for many children this is a kind of rite of passage: you learn how to capture and train Pokemon, travel the land on your own, and have adventures. You use your Pokemon to have battles, against other trainers and against wild Pokemon. If it sounds a bit cruel, keep in mind that this is a game for young people and as such Game Freak goes out of their way to make the story a positive lesson: you have to take care of your Pokemon, they grow to like you, and no one ever dies--they just 'faint' and can be revived. Some creatures can 'evolve' into different forms, and that adds to your options and makes the possibilities even more diverse.If you're contemplating buying a Pok&eacute;mon game for a child in your family, there is educational value to be had here: I'm amazed at the huge and creative variety of creatures, and my daughter has coached me on strategies: type matching and analysis are important skills that require memorization, reasoning, and a bit of basic math. You have to manage money to buy things and plan your inventory before taking a trip out of town. And sometimes your character is asked questions to make them think.There are changes to the storyline that make the main story mode go by a bit quicker--but this is okay because finishing the main story is just the beginning with this game!  My daughter and I have both logged time wandering around the world of the original Black and White and we expect to do the same for the sequel.  Although the concept is still, \"Go to a place, explore it, find the gym leader and beat them to move on\", the people at Game Freak have tried to change it up a bit.  For example, in the third town you travel to there's a movie studio, and you can spend all the time you like \"making movies\".  The \"make a movie\" game play is the same as a Pokemon battle, but with a script, dialogue choices, and 'actors', and the battles (which take place on a green-screen sound stage/motion capture facility) get woven into the story.  You get to go watch your movies in the town's theater and see the audience's reaction.  Where the first game had stage shows and dress-up, this section was a more entertaining twist that offers a lot of movie types and variations in replay (and there are other add-ons to the core game as you go further).  There is also a Medal Box that keeps track of various 'achievements', such as completing so many steps in a day, etc.  This isn't required, but it's an entertaining add-on.  There is a \"Nearby\" feature that's designed to let you do certain things with other players who are close by...but to be honest, I can't imagine either of us having many opportunities to do that.  We just don't live somewhere that would be likely to have a lot of DSi/3DS players all playing Pokemon Black/White 2 with C-Gear enabled at the same time.If you liked Pokemon Black or White, you'll enjoy the sequel.  Some of it is familiar and some new, but overall it feels as if the game has been improved to not only give you more to do, but increase the variety (and frequency) of different Pokemon being available to you.  My daughter and I both love it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2012"}

I update my rating from 1 to 2.  In the end I had to get my fix so I bought it.  What other choice did I have.  I figured I should reflect that somehow.Lots of bad:1) requires high speed internet to play even if you only want to play single player (dial-up and you get lag and no-server problems).  This may be overstated. Recent posts in other places have suggested that it is possible to play without highspeed internet.2) single player campaign is only about eight or nine hours long3) need to spend 180$ over the comming years to get the entire package cause wings of liberty is only terran4) game's emphasis has been changed dramatically.  I was a beta player.  It changes the game particularly for the casual player such that unless you are a true expert playing a true expert, your game will be fast with mostly low level units, unlike the two hour games we used to have.  Every game with only rare exceptions is a rush, over in less than twenty minutes.  It is not clear how long it will take if ever for Blizzard to fix this.  They may not even see this as a problem that needs fixing.  Maybe it isn't a problem.  Maybe this is what most people want, but I don't.  I want a game that can offer me both short and long play.  It is no doubt that there are several good replays online and they show very intersting play but this is only the highest level of play.BUT YOU KNOW WHAT... I could have excused all of this.  I got high speed internet, and the strength of the game is supposed to be in its multi-player aspect, and given my love of the game I am actually willing to put out the 180$ over the next three years to support Blizzard in making more and better games, and I am staying positive that my skill would increase as I play, and that Blizzard will in fact make many \"balancing\" changes to address the playability of the game to eventually promote longer games.BUT I CANNOT EXCUSE THE LACK OF LAN PLAY.  The biggest and best part of this game was its LAN play.  I can't count the number of times I drove one, two, even three hours across four states to various friend's houses to spend the weekend eating pizza and grinders and dill pickles, drinking beer, and beating the crap out of my pal's zealots.  Nothing like a 36 hour StarCraft fest with your friends who have no life.IN STARCRAFT2 YOU CAN KISS ALL THAT GOODBYE.  There is no LAN play.  You can only play if you connect to the internet which means immediate limits on bandwidth.No longer will I be able to make wise cracks at Kerry's stupid sacrifice of his templars while he is sitting next to me only to be pwned by him five minutes later when I find out it was actually part of a real strategy he had been hatching (damn he stole my Science Vessal??? what did he want that for).  What was the bet again?  Oh Yeah, I have to buy the pizza tonight.  Fourty dollars?  What toppings did you guys put on these things?No longer can I roll over Kerry's girl friend with my massive ground units showing once again that it is still possible to win by brute force alone, cause if I can't beat Kerry I might as well shame his girl friend.  ...  Why is she in Kerry's natural expansion?  What did she just say?  OH crap.  More PWNING.  Sorry Joe you are on  your own now.  You guys keep going, I'll hit the packy, but I am not getting Bud, I hate Bud, it gives me a headache.  What?  She wants WHAAAT???  A MERLOT!  Mannn...Ah but as Monday morning daylight peeks through the shades a new game begins and this time I have a plan.  \"Nuclear Launch Detected\".  Look at them all run around trying to find my ghost hehehe.  Now for the big finish NUK,NUK,NUK, lear Lau,Lau,Launch DDDetected,ed,ed.  Yeah baby that's right, feel the wrath of my ghosts.  Say good bye to your Nexuses, Lairs, and Command Centers.  None of them can withstand my multi-nuke stikes.  Yes we win.  Vindication for Joe and me.  But did they let us win?  Hmmm... we will have to wait three weeks to find out, gotta get home.  Hope the wife isn't still pissed cause we are hosting next time.  Too bad she ain't a player.BUT NO MORE.  Lament that loss of LAN parties.  The pizza and beer does not taste the same when you can't share it.StarCraft was a social game where friends spent their vacations playing it together in each others company.  But you have taken that away from us.  Shame on you Blizzard and Activision.  You have taken StarCraft the way of all big businesses and destroyed those pieces of your product that mad it great because you could not help but try to squeeze a few more pennies out of it.  There was no need.  StarCraft2 was destined to be the biggest game release ever.  So why did you choose to do this to us?In the end Star Craft 2 is a telling product.  It shows the direction of the industry in several respects.  The industry has awakend to understand that the average computer game player is not a kid and never was, but rather is a 36 year old geek.  They expect these adults to have money to spend and they want it.  To that end the industry is taking steps to eliminate those aspects of the sales process that they believe inhibit their ability to make money.  That means stopping game resale, game swaps, and game gifting.  In short, killing the \"used game\" market.  After all, no game developer, promoter, or original distributor makes money on a \"resale/trade/gifting\" transaction.  We will see more of this in the comming years.  It will manifest itself as: ( limited installs, no disconnected game play, need to register a key which cannot be unregistered or transfered, multi-vendor game hosting services, region restrictions (often called LOCKDOWN), and pay-to-play instead of the traditional buy-and-play ).  It means the eventual end of our ability to transfer rights to play a game such that once you install it, only you can play it using an account somewhere.  The industry expects this to translate into more sales for them.  Indeed we have seen many games and/or vendors already implement at least one of these in the last three years.  I feel a backlash however.  I for one have only so much money for spending on games and it does not include money for a \"monthly fee\"; and any changes to gaming as a whole that restrict of otherwise make the social aspects of gaming harder to enjoy will reduce my desire to play computer games in favor of some other form of entertainment.  The direction the industry is heading in does not favor the game player.  It makes me sad.Hail Flavius!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0012N5MIO","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Control is the key!","reviewText":"A few weeks ago I reviewed the XBOX 360 version of this game. In that review I stated that while the game itself wasn't that bad, the poor controls with the XBOX 360 controller in addition to this playing the final boss, Seth, results in nothing but frustration. The PS3 version is basically the same with one major difference; better controls.For as long as I can remember, I have never really liked the style of the PlayStation controllers; they were kind of small for my taste and the shape was something I never could really get used to. However for this game, the PS3 controller is near perfect. The main reason for this is the positioning of the buttons. For starters, the analogue stick is in the perfect place to be used by your thumb; no need to move your thumb from its natural position to use the stick as on the 360 controller. In addition, the D-pad is made like it should be; four distinct directional buttons instead of the rounded conglomerated mess on the 360 controller's D-Pad. If you want to move forward, you press forward and your character moves forward. On the 360, pressing forward would all too often result in your character jumping forward resulting in a nice dragon punch or flash kick to the face. This also meant trying to execute even the most simple of moves on the first try very difficult. On the PS3, moves are able to be done almost at will making game play less frustrating. Moves I found nearly impossible to execute on the 360 I'm able to perform easily on the PS3. Precision is key; and the PS3 controller offers much more of that than the 360 controller. Because of the better control, it's much easier to counter the cheapness of CPU controlled AI. However Seth is STILL cheap and even with the better controls, you still may find your self wanting to slam your controller into the floor.Other than the big improvement in game control, the PS3's presentation of graphics/sound is virtually identical to that of the 360. I had no complaints on the 360 version in this department and none on the PS3 version either. Some say the 360 version's graphics look better but without having them side by side, I can't tell any difference. The only small difference I've noticed is that the loading times before the match starts are slightly longer on the PS3.Online play is also identical to the 360 version which is just fine as well. Of course one big advantage with the PSN network is that you can play other against people online without having to pay extra for a subscription as you have to do with XBOX Live Gold.After comparing the two versions of this game, I without hesitation recommend the PS3 version over the 360 version. That said however, even with Seth's extreme cheapness, I am still up in the air if I'm going to purchase this game, the overall game play on the PS3 a better than its 360 counterpart.  I spent four hours last night playing this game; something I wasn't able to do with the 360 version. While I still suggest a rental first, if you have both a PS3 and a XBOX 360 console, my recommendation is to go with the PS3 version. They are basically the exact same game, but the PS3's better controls make for a much more enjoyable gaming experience. My overall/fun rating of this game for the 360 was: Online: 4/5, Offline 3.5/3 and my rating of the PS3 version is Online 4.5/5, Offline: 4/4. While the cheap CPU AI of other characters is annoying, Seth is the MAJOR reason why I can't recommend a definite purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-25-2009"}

I think this is a great idea for the game console. I like Brain games and things like that but this one actually helps the user learn to draw and paint. The tips and art applications that are taught can actually be used in real life to utilize talents.This is a very different type of game. I really like the fact that it teaches beyond the game. There are 20 lessons varying in degree of difficulty and you learn to apply them by using the DS to draw, paint, shade, use color, etc. to make pictures with the stylus. You can do the lessons over again and you can save your art. You can't print your art however, you can apply what you learn to an artist pad and make your own actual paintings using the techniques that are taught in each lesson. You can even improve your drawing skills with tips and techniques.I enjoyed the little artist that helps you create and learn various types of artwork. He uses the techniques and then lets you try each step and the interface is very easy to use. We have also created some neat things using the Free Draw option. My daughter actually made really cool things on the Free Draw before she started the lessons. It's an easy program to understand and start using right away. It is amazing that you can use the DS or DSI to make such interesting works of art on the small screen using different sized brushes, different pencil leads, and you can mix the colors. These options make it fun and easy to make art with on the DS. You can transfer what you learn into your own art techniques.So many people would love to be able to create art and the Art Academy makes learning fun and interesting. There are wonderful tips and techniques that even children can really enjoy and apply in their own creative endeavors. Instead of a monotonous game that plays the same way throughout, you get art lessons to help you become more creative and grow in your knowledge of art. This is a Great use of the DS. I would love to see more like this game where kids and adults can actually learn a skill through the use of their time playing a game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2011"}

There's a fantastic variety of weapons from Sniper Rifles to alien Plasma Rifles. And much to the enjoymant of so many, there's finally a melee button. Tap it to smack an enemy in the back of the head and get an instant kill. Instant gratification. Yes, the story is just any generic Sci-Fi story for most gamers. But spend a few minutes at fan sites and learn about all the story going on behind the scenes... there's much more going on than is immediately obvious.There are also three interesting featured of gameplay that define Halo gameplay.-Shields: You have a rechargable shield that automatically recovers itself to save you. If you can keep the damage down, you are essentially invincible. The problems start when your shield hits 0 and won't recharge until you can get out of open fire.-Tactical combat: Unlike Quake, this is not a twitch game. The gameplay is a step faster than Counter-Strike. Action is a bit slower than most games, but in that it becomes much more intense. That extra moment when you're lining up a shot trying to get that last-moment kill make the experience so much more.-No magic pockets: You can only carry two guns (and your always-present melee ability). You'll spend tons of time thinking about the battles that lie ahead and what weapons to take. Ah... the Sniper or the Rocket... what to do... classic FPS gamers tend to complain until they set down and see the real strategy in the choices.But something sets Halo apart, and it's the attention to detail. Fire your assault rifle and listen closely, you can hear individual hammer clicks and the chambering of each bullett. On a big outdoor level, stop for a moment and you can hear the wind whistling through the terrain. You can hear birds chirping in the distance. Watch an alien run to get in position, and you'll hear feet/boots clacking and armor smacking as they move. And if you've ever played Bungie's previous series Marathon, you'll quickly notice a million tiny connections. The detail makes it great.Not to mention the detail in the physics engine. I don't want to spoil too much, but there are a LOT of interesting tricks that this engine is capable of. For example- putting explosives under a vehicle flips it over. Getting more gets it airborne. Pile up two dozen grenades, and you get something special...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2004"}

The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy.

This was the first game I played for the Super Nintendo, back in 1991 I think it was, and I could not be happier to play it again.You assume the role of Link, a young warrior who has a telepathic connection to Princess Zelda, who has been kidnapped by an evil Wizard who plans to plunge the land of Hyrule into darkness. You must go through many different stages, solve many different puzzles, and battle a wide array of monsters. This is as good as Zelda gets, and it hasn't been done better since. While \"Ocarina of Time\" was excellent, this is still by far the best in the series. Everything about it is perfect, the graphics and music are still great, and the role-playing elements keep the gamer hooked for hours. I rarely see a newer game that matches this one.Every inch of the original game is included here, with the addition of a 4-player game which requires each player to have a link-cable and an individual game cartridge. So if you and three friends all plan on buying this game, you can enjoy that little bonus. I haven't experienced yet, but then again, that's not why I bought this game. I bought it to play one of my favorite video games of all time again.Gamers who enjoyed this game over 10 years ago need no more motivation to buy this, but younger gamers are definitely in for a treat.

Played the crap out of it. I just feel like something's seriously lacking the entire time. Only noteworthy companions to me were Atton, Mira and maybe Bao-Dur. Mandalore was Canderous with armor, nothing new there. HK-47 was cool, but his old voice was better.Gameplay is a little more action-esque than KOTOR 1, but as been said, your goals are unclear, and by the end of the game I was still sort on confused. This is due to a lot of stuff being cut.To me, it also sort of cheapens the story of KOTOR 1, makes it seem like Malak was no big deal, Revan had something else on his mind as Lord of the Sith than conquering the galaxy. I also hate how they refer to it as \"The Jedi Civil War.\" The term \"Civil War\" has been abused so badly in the Star Wars. In KOTOR 1, it was referred to as \"The 2nd Sith War\", or \"Sith War 2\" or something like that.One final thing story-wise I didn't like was the \"motivation\" behind the Mandalorian Wars, by that I mean why the Jedi didn't want to go to war and why the Mandalorians WENT to war. This was already clear; Mandalorians seek domination and conquest and glory in war. The Jedi knew unprepared war would've corrupted the Jedi, as it did Revan and Malak. KOTOR II just adds an unnecessary layer of cryptic story over it that's not entirely clarified.Basically? It's a smudged, duller KOTOR, but still worth playing.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2012"}

I have played some of the Batman games out there but nothing close to being great. The only thing close was Lego Batman. Now when I heard about Arkham Asylum something about it intrigued me. Was it the plot? (dont know), the stealth element (probably not because I dont really care for that genre) or was it the fact that a lot of Batman villians appear in the game (very much likely).So the first chance I got, I reserved a copy at my Local Gamestop. Around a month and half later bought my copy.Now for the review. This game is amazing, the enviroment is so incredible, every single detail wasnt left out. Hell even Batman's suit has detail. As the game progresses he suit shows signs of ware. From bullet marks, to cuts and his cape looking ripped.They even brought in Kevin Conroy (Batman) and Mark Hammil (Joker) to reproise their roles from the cartoon from the 90s which was a perfect choice.As for the stealth part which I normally dont like the genre is actually very fun as you can attack from behind, above or below your enimies.Everytime you die there is a funny cutscene involving one of the villians from the game depending on what level you are on.Each villians, and character looks just as amazing as the enviroment, I mean have you seen Harley Quinn's new uniform? Or how creepy Scarecoew now looks?There is even some challenge maps that lets you practive or beat others online (score wise, no online play) that feature elements from the game.Also the Riddler makes an appearance bt not phyically. He has left riddles throughout the game, if you solve them you get rewarded, he also left trophies of characters, recordings of sessions with the villians and more.This game is just amazing, if you are thinking of buying it. Do that, renting is no good because you will have no time to fully enjoy the game as you might play this long after you beat it to collect the riddles you forgot the last time.This could be one of the besat games of all time and the best comic game ever.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-27-2009"}

With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Joey","summary":"Halo Sucks","reviewText":"Halo 2 is even worse than Halo 1.

While bearing the Final Fantasy name, it is not part of the main numbered series.  Final Fantasy Tactics brings a new style of gameplay to the Final Fantasy series: strategy.  This is a strategy game.  The goal of Tactics is not so much to explore the world, but rather to strategically win battles to advance the story.  The only exploration comes in finding where the best place on the battlefield is to put your characters in order to attack the most effectively.  This is a difficult game to get into at first, but given the chance the game becomes very addictive and soon may be one of your favorite games.  It is that good.The game begins slow and is a little confusing at first.  You are moved from location to location and given a lot of story (the story in Tactics is the deepest of any bearing the name Final Fantasy).  You must fight by moving your characters around the field of battle and placing them so that they can do the most damage while hopefully avoiding getting too injured.  Terrain is important. This game features a very well done job class system, so what job class your characters are affects what they can do.  Only a chemist can use healing items, only a mage can cast magic, Knights are very strong and can wear armor, and so on.  Mastering the job classes and learning what the best way to fight battles is very important and will determine how successful you will be.  It seems a little daunting at first, but putting the time and effort into this game is worth it.  It is often overlooked, but it is one of the best on the Playstation.  For RPG fans, Final Fantasy fans, strategy fans, or just someone looking for a great game and a new experience: Final Fantasy Tactics is the game to get.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Rebecca","summary":"My trigger finger is itchin' !","reviewText":"Definite 5 stars, this game is blast!

{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"An interesting, linear experience for movie lovers","reviewText":"&#34;Beyond&#34; is a fantastic, story-driven game that embraces its own genre of sorts, which could be called &#34;interactive movie&#34;. Foremost, the purpose of this game is to tell a story. Therefore, the options in how you play this game are very limited (almost like the old &#34;Dragon's Lair&#34;), but I have no problem at all with this. I like many different genres of games, including RPGs, adventure, platformer, stealth, puzzle, shooter, and sport. It's nice to see developer Quantic Dream try something new, and their production values and attention to detail in this title show that it was a true labor of love.The one thing that I am most let down by in this game (surprisingly) are the graphics. I was led to believe by the trailers and ads that this game would have the best visuals I've ever seen in my life, but that is far from the case. The reason for this is that most of what the trailers consist of are the cut scenes. It's true that the cut scenes look incredibly life like, and are among the best I've ever seen, but the actual in-game graphics are only so-so, for the most part. Graphics aren't everything, of course, but I just feel let down after the impeccable trailers were shown so much. Hopefully, developers can deliver the level of visual fidelity of the cut scenes for actual gameplay during the next console generation.Fortunately, the voice acting and motion capture of the game are superb, and this helps to propel the supernatural story in a convincing manner. Quantic Dream swung for the fences by hiring Willem Dafoe and Ellen Page, and it paid off. Their performances are outstanding, and they really help to sell the &#34;interactive movie&#34; vibe. At times, the scenes can go on for what might feel like a tad too long (particularly for players who want to jump into the action), almost like a Metal Gear game. However, the level of production is very impressive, and at least we are treated to top notch acting and presentation.Even though the game is EXTREMELY story driven, and it does not want you to fail (as this would disrupt the carefully laid out plot and set pieces), the game is presented in such a way that it still conveys a sense of tension and urgency throughout. Though there are slower parts, the excitement and intrigue are such that I was propelled along, desperately hoping I could guide Jodie to a successful conclusion. I assumed her role when playing, and I felt the danger she felt, despite the fact that the game is very, very easy to play. I'm not sure how they pulled this off, but the developers used a brilliant combination of effective acting, music, sound, visuals, and story that made me feel that I was in peril, even if I wasn't- just like the best movies do when you're watching them.As far as how the in-game action is handled, Aiden's movements are a bit wonky and clumsy, and his poltergeist effects are not as satisfying as I had hoped for. Jodie's, however, are handled uniquely and really well. Rather than using Quick Time Events, the player must correspond swipes of the analog stick with her movements. It takes a little getting used to, but I quickly realized that this is WAY more effective than QTEs, and it makes a lot more sense than just being prompted to push square/triangle in a Quick Time Event. It soon became intuitive and second nature, and a fantastic choice for complementing the &#34;interactive movie&#34; type of gameplay.To further address the linear nature of the game: Yes, it is very linear, so I suggest you avoid it, if you don't like linear games. You wouldn't go buy a bunch of Mexican food if you disliked Mexican food, would you? The same math applies here. I would not buy a Super Mario Bros. game, and then complain that it was a linear platformer, failing to provide the options of an open world game- to do so would be utter madness. Likewise, why would you play a game that is designed specifically to be a linear, story-driven, interactive movie, and then complain that it's linear? There is nothing at all wrong with offering consumers different types of games. Different people like different things (that's why there's more than one type of car, cereal, etc.). I really enjoy books and movies, which are story-driven, linear adventures, and &#34;Beyond&#34; follows that pattern, but adds an interactive element that makes me more readily empathize with the protagonist, and feel as though I am assuming her role. Instead of watching the movie, I feel like I'm in the movie- and that's pretty darned cool.Quantic Dream wanted to try something new, and I think that's cool, too!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2013"}

Some side quests are really hard, like the boss in the desert which has 300,000 HP, making it the most difficult and long(seriously you can be fighting it for like an hour) boss in the game. Also, the side quest of the mini-game Sphere break is kind of hard ,too.The dresspheres are very similar to that of character classes or jobs in previous games like Final Fantasy V, Final fantasy III, Final fantasy Tactics, and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles. The characters already have a default dresspheres, Yuna has the gunner , Rikku the thief, and Payne has the warrior dressphere. Every dressphere comes with certain abilites, like the chemist dressphere you can use it to mix potions like in final fantasy x through rikku, there's the white mage dressphere, which you can use it to heal. The black mage only uses black magic to fight in battles, and so forth.

Rhodes","summary":"Metroid Prime on the Go","reviewText":"After waiting for over a year, Metroid Prime Hunters finally makes it to the Nintendo DS. It's not as terrific as I thought it would be, but it isn't horrible, but it does suffer quite heavily in the gameplay.The game takes place between the two Metroid Prime games on the Gamecube. Samus is searching for eight octoliths in the alimbic system.  They're the key to ultimate power, and they're scattered throughout different planets and space stations.  Samus isn't the only one looking for this power, though, there are plenty of other bounty hunters searching for it too, and you'll end up having to fight them as well.Metroid's focus isn't usually story. It's always been about the gameplay.  Here, gameplay is still the focus, but the game is rather short.  For one, each area you go into is pretty much the same.  It's fairly linear, just you making your way in a straight forward path picking up energy tanks and missile expansions.  Then you'll fight a boss (well, a recycled boss).  Rinse and repeat.  If you're a Metroid veteran, nothing that happens in this game will be the least bit surprising.  Bosses repeat themselves, the ending is virtually the same as in every other Metroid game as well.  It's kind of sad that Metroid Prime Hunters is linear.  The previous Metroid games have all been about exploring.  Here, it's limited.Where the game really takes a hit is the controls.  If you're looking for a DS game where you'll really need to use the touch screen, Metroid Prime Hunters delivers.  Perhaps too well.  You use the D-Pad to make Samus go forward, or side step left or right.  However, you'll have to use the stylus to make her turn left or right, lock on to enemies and toggle on your morph ball, missiles, and other additions.  The style takes a long time to get used to.  At times it feels like a PC first person shooter come to the handheld.  I often had cramps from the default controls.  There is a setting for left-handed if you happen to be left handed, and if the stylus mode isn't working out for you, you can set it to a more standard mode where you rely more on the D-Pad and basic buttons.  Once you get used to the controls, though, they feel fluid at least.  The problem being there's a steep learning curve to them.Also, the gameplay department suffers from a lack of being able to save.  You'll have to run back to your ship in order to save, and that's a pain.  Even though the areas are pretty short, it still sucks to get so far, die and restart losing everything you obtained.  In Metroid Prime Hunters its difficulty makes it happen.Without a doubt, Metroid Prime's best feature is the multiplayer. It only takes one card to play. The others can easily jump in using DS download play. You can choose from an assortment of Bounty Hunters and play in a deathmatch mode. There are plenty of other modes too, like capture the flag. Up to four people can play multiplayer, and I really wish there could've been more to it than that. However, playing multiplayer is just a lot of fun, and it's highly addictive.If just playing via LAN isn't doing it for you, you can always hop online and create a rivals/friends list. It's great that the DS actually has an online first person shooter, but it's severely limited. For one, much like LAN, only four people can play. You CAN use the microphone to actually talk to people. No fancy headsets are needed. You can only \"talk\" to people who are registered friends, though. You can find rivals but you won't be able to talk to them.  Online is also limited to you playing the only basic mode: Deathmatch. I was actually expecting more from the online. More modes to play, more people to play with. But it does succeed in the online department, and it's easy to get set up.Graphically, Metroid Prime Hunters is perhaps the best looking DS game out there. While most of the Nintendo DS's best games have been 2D side-scrollers, Metroid Prime Hunters is fully 3D, and it looks fantastic. This out does most games on the Nintendo 64, and shows the full potential of the DS. There are times of slow down, but none that will be heavily noticed. The game also sounds really good. Metroid usually has good music, and Hunters is no exception.In the end, Metroid Prime Hunters is satisfactory. After waiting for a year and half, I expected more from this game.  The game delivers what it promised, but after such a long wait, there could've been so much more.The Good+Smooth Graphics+Great Sound+Metroid finally goes online!+Multiplayer is quite fun+It's a good challengeThe Bad-The Controls take a long time to get used to-A severe lack of places to save-Online Multiplayer is severely limited-There's a lot of backtracking","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2006"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"I Don't Even Think it's That Fun...","reviewText":"It's depressing when one of your most anticipated game releases leaves you wishing you had bought something else.  Sixty bucks is a lot of money to waste.The first Mercenaries title was - in my opinion - a major milestone.  Taking the Grand-Theft-Auto sandbox design and filling it with military vehicles, crazy gun fights and massive explosions.  The original game was not without its flaws, but I actually think this game has far more.The Cons:Oh goodness the graphics.  I think a lot of gamers feel that graphics are an aside - as much as graphics are touted by major reviewers, publications, etc, us gamers just don't really seem to care that much.  If a game is really, REALLY good, we'll look past some frame rate issues and bad aliasing.  But Mercs 2 - good God - did they port this off of a Gameboy??  When you're in a race and obstructions literally pop up in front of you around a corner - that's not good.  When an enemy is shooting at you from 50 yards away and yet the engine hasn't actually drawn him yet - that's not good.  The colors are extremely flat - trees, buildings, people - almost all look the same.Topography is another issue - many times I've watched my character get killed because I was literally stuck in a rut the depth of a curb.  I've also gotten stuck between rocks many, many times.  It is incredibly frustrating watching an action game turn into a platformer because you're trying to jump out from a few rocks.Fun...  The game just isn't that fun.  A lot of strategy has been compromised for action and explosions - neither of which are that good.  In the original mercs, you could subdue a \"high value target\" - referred to in that game as a \"deck of cards.\"  You could then take your subdued target, toss him into a vehicle (The Hummer H2 was my favorite) and drive out of an enemy base, camouflaged as a civilian.  This was one of my favorite things to do.  So imagine my surprise when I knocked out a HVT in Mercs 2, ran up to my truck, and couldn't load the target inside.  In the following explosion, my HVT was killed and I lost half of my bounty.  Why did they take that element out of the game?The air support has become bigger and in some ways, better.  There are a LOT of things you can call in this time, and you don't have to worry about keeping a faction happy to keep the supplies rolling in.  However, you have to stop moving, select what you want to call in, and throw your beacon for things like artillery support, fuel bombs, etc.  Of course, most of the time you'll catch a rocket in the face for your efforts because you're not moving!  Why you have to stop to throw an air support beacon is beyond me.  This was obviously never beta-tested.The story - if you can call it that - is pretty poor.  There's no indication as to when missions become available - you literally have to make your rounds among your increasing number of outposts and H.Q.'s and find out what is available to do.  The first couple times I found myself thinking, \"now what?\" only to realize that I had to go talk to someone to find out what was available.  I guess it's good that Fiona - your... ...boss?... ...keeps nagging you to return home so she can give you suggestions.Good Lord the voice acting...  I don't know if the same guy did Mattias as in the last game, but he obviously spent some time hanging out in suck city between projects.  He is without a doubt the worse voice-actor I've ever heard.  Was this guy trying to impersonate Shatner?  It is literally so bad, I've begun skipping the conversations simply because I can't stand it.So what's good?  The vehicles are okay - I really liked the combat ship I stumbled across - rocket launcher, two side-mounted turret guns and a butt-kicking front-mounted cannon.  The helicopters are more varied and capable - sorta...  My favorite part was using a helicopter to drop a gigantic gas tank onto the deck of a large tanker ship - the ship was a target I was asked to destroy.  The gas tank landed next to two additional gas tanks on the deck, and after a few seconds of bouncing around, the first tank exploded, igniting the other two.  As the ship exploded in a glorious fireball, I sat there laughing almost uncontrollably - it was just cool.  Too bad it took 6 hours of game play to find a good part.What else would you like to know?  No, the physics aren't any better.  Driving is a tiny bit easier, but cars slide like you're driving on teflon-coated ice...  They stop okay and such, but get out of a car while it's still just slightly moving, and you'll walk a half-mile to catch up to it - that is if it doesn't slide off a cliff or beach.Mercenaries 2 is... ...it's an insult to the engineers who made Mercs 1 such a great game.  Gone is the flair - no neat animations when you subdue a target.  Instead we get minute-long tank hijacking sequences.  For every item Mercs 2 tried to improve on the original, they slacked off on two items that Mercs 1 did great.  All in all it makes for a pretty lackluster game.  I'm sorely dissapointed.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-13-2008"}

{"product_name":"B006GHA8EE","description":"","reviewerName":"Mali","summary":"Don't get all of the hype...","reviewText":"This is by no means a bad game, but it's just not for everyone.The graphics are beautiful, and it's not your typical sword slashing RPG with a nameless, faceless hero that you can spend hours customizing.The story also features several choices outside of just typical the good and evil options, which I imagine makes for high replay value.However, I just couldn't get into the characters enough to keep my interest going long enough to get to that point where you're evolved far enough in battle. By far enough, I mean that it doesn't involve running in circles trying to pick off a crowd of opponents hit by hit. I have played countless other games where hour after hour was spent leveling up and fighting, so it's not that I'm lazy or simple. I just didn't find the characters to be likable.Another huge problem I had was all of the nudity and sex scenes. The first nude scene is a female prisoner, a snooty royal in a dungeon. Even if she hadn't had 2 twins with her older SON that she was passing off as King's children, she wouldn't be a sympathetic character. She also isn't dirty, and they don't really even lay a finger on her. She's immaculately clean and bad-tempered. This scene felt like a cheap tactic to get men interested in playing the game. Who would actually get excited about animated pixels you ask? See the trailer online and read the comments after it...The game continues on to have graphic sex scenes with prostitutes, the characters own (and let me say very very naive) girlfriend, and various other random woman who want to \"thank\" him. Does a game with amazing graphics, an in-depth story, magic and sword battle, and reasonable difficulty really need that? If I wanted to watch porn, I definitely know where to find it - or where to find the real thing instead of the fantasy thank you very much- I don't want to have to skip through it in my video games while trying to get into (or not) a story. At least in GTA, it was not graphic, more implied.I think I will stick to Dragon Age or Assassins Creed in the future.Players who love RPGs or anything with amazing graphics will probably love this by default, and it also seems like people are socially required to love this game. I found this more interesting than the Skyrim/Oblivion series- which bored me to tears- but I have met very few humans who didn't love that one as well...so if you liked that and don't object to some over-the-top nudity...this is for you.I gave this game an extra star for the gorgeous graphics.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2012"}

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Sonic truly does wonders, doesn't he?","reviewText":"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it: Sonic had sucked in his modern games throughout the middle of the 2000s. Actually, that was what the blue hedgehog was like on his CONSOLE games. His handheld offerings were way better, because they were just plain 2D. Sonic Rush is no exception.While Sonic Rush is, indeed, a 2D Sonic game, it isn't EXACTLY like the Sega Genesis games. In the Genesis titles, there was a mix of platforming and speed. Here, it's a video game equivalent to a roller-coaster ride, complete with some platforms and enemies to kill off. But you know what? It was fun. You also have the graphics and music to help make the game look even better.The graphics are gorgeous. You get a combination of good-looking 3D models of the characters and the 2D backgrounds and platforms. The result is way better than you may think it would be. The music is great, but it's also weird at the same time. Human vocals seem to be used as instruments to go with the music. I just don't know what to say about it, but the music is still nice to listen to.While I do love playing through the game, there are a few flaws that I've noticed. The one major problem is that there are a lot of places where you fall and die. I find myself ending up like that more than getting killed by enemies. The other flaws are pretty minor, but are just awkward. Knuckles makes an appearance in the game, but one line he says is \"I'm so angry I want to punch something!\" Let's be honest: It's ridiculous to say stuff like that, even if someone's mad. At least it isn't worse than \"I'm so mad that I can't see where I'm going\". A couple of the bosses can get annoying, too, especially since Tails keeps repeating these two lines: \"Alright, Sonic!\" (When you hit the boss) and \"Oh, no, Sonic!\" (When you get hit).Still, this is an overall amazing Sonic game. It's a must-have for the DS. Sorry PSP owners, but you got the wrong Sonic series.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2011"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

You shoot various forms of electricity.The game starts you (Cole) out with minimal powers after an explosion has decimated three city islands...The Neon District, The Warren District and The Historic District. You gain more powers by completing Story Missions, and you can gain more points with which you can upgrade your powers by completing Side Missions. The question is: Will you be a Hero or go down the path of Evil and become Infamous? The choice is yours right at the start of the game.You'll have to battle your way through obstacles, puzzles and worst of all hordes and hordes of mutated enemies. You can pretty much 'zap' your way right through most enemies, but others are pretty darn hard...especially during missions when they work together to keep you from completing a mission. Some missions you'll wonder if you're doing something wrong, because you'll die so much before figuring out a successful strategy.Some areas require you to clear the enemies out before you can get through, and some you're better off just running for the exit. You get a map that's very helpful. In fact you kind of get two maps: one's an HUD and the other is a more comprehensive map of all three islands. But even with the maps sometimes the only way to figure out which way is which is by trial and error. There are about 300 hidden 'blast shards' that you can collect to upgrade your Power Bar, and while the Shards are clearly marked on your HUD, they all aren't as easy to acquire as simply following the map to their location (same with the other collectable goodies called Dead Drops).You do get some pretty effective weapons that get you through the levels. Your standard weapon is a quick bolt of lightening (cool, right?) that you shoot from the palm of your hand. And you'll occasionally need to engage in hand-to-hand combat. But the \"big guns\" you acquire by completing Story Missions are the most fun to master. You'll need to navigate yourself through some treacherous territory and perform some death defying balancing acts (and you certainly won't defy death every time). Let's put it this way...if you're afraid of heights, this game will rattle your nerves like no other I've played.All around you during your island explorations you'll be presented with awesome scenery: expansive cityscapes, beautiful horizons, detailed architecture, and some really whacky structures and super-structures...you never get tired of looking at this game....Especially when you're looking at the scenery with some of your acquired powers...oh, say, like flying or grinding on power lines.PS3 owners that pass on inFamous may just be missing out on one of the best, most fun games of this year.

Thiel \"John P.

You do not have to memorize anything in the cut scenes to play the game well, and the story draws you in like a really great book.  For comparison, Metal Gear Solid IV was horribly frustrating, often seeming to feature more dramatic scene time than play time.My favorite thing about the game play is that--unlike God of War I and II--you need nearly every type of weapon to get through the entire game.  Some you can do without, but for the most part they're key to getting through the whole thing and finding all the secret and special items, whereas in prior games your choice of weapon was simply a matter of preference.  You go back to scenes that you were in earlier finding you can do things you were completely unable to do the first time you were in those areas because you since picked up a special weapon and that the timing was essential to the enjoyment of play and the storyline.On the easiest level--which is the only one I've played so far--it's not too easy but there are no sections where you've got to do some endless, difficult combination of moves to procede that will have you frustrated for hours or enemies so difficult to defeat that you will find yourself having wasted hours or even days dying over and over again, every three damn minutes, cursing the designers.  This game is fairly frustration free, with the exception of two puzzles that I found just a bit difficult--which I wont describe in line with my NO SPOILERS policy.  Two is enough, and like I wrote above, they don't involve fight quick/hard/well or die efforts--just a bit of brain teasing.Notably, I only looked up a walkthrough once, but I nearly had the solution anyway.Parents should be happy that the storyline and brainwork required of the player outshines the blood and gore, and the occassional nudity.  Unless your religious inclinations demand that you gouge your eyes out at the first sign of women's breasts outside of marriage, don't worry about it.  There's really only one risque/semi-nude scene anyway and no full-frontal nudity.I don't have any kids (that I know of), but my wife (who is from Japan) asked me if I found a kid playing during the risque bit that includes topless hotties--as did God of War I and II--would I prevent them from playing it.  I answered that just like when I play games with guns like Metal Gear Solid IV, which features many weapons that don't even exist, so long as the player (regardless of age) understands the difference between the story and real life that I would let them play it--sexy and violent scenes included.  I suppose if I had a daughter, that might make a difference, but the female characters are not innocent victims of sexual aggression, so probably not.BOTTOM LINE: If you enjoy a good storyline and challenging puzzles this game is a great choice without going over the top, especially if you like your puzzles mixed with great action and adventure.I would say this game would appeal to the blood and gore types as well, but a friend of mine who likes purely war games (kill or be killed) said he has absolutely no interest in games like God of War III, Metal Gear Solid IV, or the Tomb Raider series--so I guess this really does only appeal to people who like a good brain teaser and storyline with fictional violence.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2010"}

IT DOESN'T WORK!","reviewText":"If I didn't buy this on launch day, I would never consider buying it with review after review and article after article describing the game-breaking glitches on the PS3 version of the game. I can't believe this title -- the PS3 version -- is still in the top 100. Oh, how I loathe this game's glitches and how I now loathe Bethesda -- in the past, my favorite developer.Not only did my Skyrim saves all become corrupted after freezing a billion times -- my PS3's HDD was destroyed by Skyrim. Literally everything on the hard drive was corrupted and the HDD needed to be replaced. The guy at Sony said he never had calls for broken HDD's until Skyrim. He said that is now the # 1 reason people call tech support.If you buy this game for the PS3, you have my word it will not work. It may take 10 hours to break. It may take as many as 35. But it will break. And there's a chance it will corrupt your PS3's HDD as well -- because when it freezes you need to physically shut the PS3 off and do a hard reset (sometimes it freezes so bad even pressing the power button doesn't turn the console off and you have to unplug it with the game frozen and disc still spinning).If you buy the game this will happen:First, it will stutter and have frame-rate issues.Second, it will start freezing up and freezing your PS3.Third, it will start moving so slow you cannot play -- literally 5 or 6 frames a second (there are tons of videos on YouTube showing this).Fourth, you'll clear your cache and try again.Fifth, if you experience what I did, the game will finally freeze and corrupt ALL saves on your PS3.Skyrim felt like a fun game during the first 10 hours while it worked. There was definite potential. It was WAY too close to Oblivion for comfort and basically felt like a remake, but Oblivion was a great game and I didn't mind the fact there was nothing new -- outside of the occasional giant or dragon -- in Skyrim. I considered buying another copy for my 360, but I cannot bring myself to pay for this game again when it has damaged my PS3 and when I already paid sixty for it on launch day.Bethesda should be ashamed, should be apologizing publicly to all PS3 owners who spent their hard earned money on this title and should be issuing a RECALL. This game is NOT fit to be sold. Bethesda knowingly sold a broken game. I will never buy another Bethesda title again. I no longer trust them. If you've played this on a PS3, you no longer trust them. If you buy this and have all these things happen, you will stop trusting them, too. What this company did wasn't just unethical -- it was devious. They hire game testers. They obviously knew it was broken. Yet they claimed, time and again, that the PS3 and 360 versions were virtually \"identical.\" All that mattered to Bethesda was setting sales records. Not releasing a game that worked.Please, do yourself a favor and save your cash and your PS3. There is a 100% chance this game will eventually stop working. If anyone posts below saying they played for 300 hours without a glitch? They are lying (most likely Bethesda employees hoping to avoid a class action lawsuit). There is far more than anecdotal evidence that this game just doesn't work on the PS3.I am sick about this. It's inexcusable. Bethesda -- PLEASE do the right thing and recall this game and issue a full refund to those who want it or a credit for another game you publish for those who want something else.Here are a few tips that may help delay the game's breaking:1. Never play online. Ever. Make sure your Ethernet cable is unplugged and WiFi is disabled.2. Turn off ALL auto-saving (which is a huge headache, as it's hard to remember to save constantly on your own and you may end up finding yourself an hour or two back if you are killed in the game or if the game freezes without being saved). Turning off ALL auto-saving (it auto-saves on fast travel, on rest and on sleeping) reduces the freezing by about 50%.3. Take the game out of your PS3 and use it as a coaster for drinks as you play RELIABLE games released by COMPETENT and ETHICAL companies.If this review saves even one person from buying this broken game, I've been of help. There are a TON of great games right now for all 3 major consoles and for the PC. More than you could play in the next year. Why even flirt with buying the one that was released broken? There are too many good developers who took the time to make sure their games WORKED out of the box. Bethesda hasn't even fixed the game with a patch (the patch they did release actually broke it further). I doubt they ever will. Shame.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2012"}

I spent over 60 hours traveling about fighting monsters and having a great time. The system and menu's performed extremely well for me. So I knew I would love this game!I actually prefer DQIV but this one is no slouch. It is good enough for my 5 stars. I love the graphics and the art as it has a very unique style. The gameplay is engaging and provides a nice balance between easy and difficult. The story is a bit more developed than in DQIV but not quite as engaging. Don't get me wrong I still loved it but I did find recruiting monsters took some adjusting. I am just more used to fighting them than having them on my team! Also I did find that monsters do not really provide personality for your party - non monsters do that better. I thought the storyline of getting married was very cute and quite fun to play.The Dragon Quest series are some of the best RPG's out there if you like traditional JRPG. Although very different than Final Fantasy I must confess that these two series hold a special place in my heart. Consistent quality is also a bonus as there were no issues at all with the technical side of things.A highly recommended purchase!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2010"}

Sorry to say the gameplay of Armageddon is quite bland. Sure there are some neat weapons, but the lame repetition of the game just does not allow for any creativity in my opinion. You shoot the same aliens over and over and you dont feel any sense of accomplishment when you complete certain objectives. In Red Faction Guerilla it was fun to plan out how you were going to take down your enemies and their buildings and you really felt like a hero when you watched the enemy bases crumble with your well placed demo charges. All that magic is lost in Armageddon. You just keep moving from point A to point B and are constantly shooting with little to no strategy involved. Some people may like this, but I was pretty disappointed. Im just glad i rented the game and didn't waste $60 on it. I would say rent it first if you are curious.

{"product_name":"B000U34SYQ","reviewerName":"SirWilliam \"White Lake\"","summary":"Great Game, but Lacking Compared to the Game Before it","reviewText":"Fire Emblem is a game in the category of video games known as \"strategy role-playing-games\". This particular game has you play with your characters chess style in many fun ways on intricate maps with many obstacles and opposing forces. When you attack, you go to a cutscene-style battle where the two characters do a quick hit on the other.The gameplay is solid as ever, like all Fire Emblem games, with solid strategical elements while keeping the gameplay fresh and fun every time you push a button. War, simply put, is the strategy. You spend around 30 or so hours to play the game, but if you go at it recklessly you might lose a unit, and if you lose a unit, it's gone for ever, so it makes you want to restart the level and get that character back, or if you miss an item, you wanna go get it back, so it makes for a game that will spend most of your free-time, like all of the Fire Emblems.Fire Emblem, like many RPGs (role-playing-games) has a wonderful storyline. Some say that the story is not well written, but myself and many others whom I represent in this review thing otherwise. True, is some of the dialogue cheesy or juvenile? Yes, but it goes by without any notice for anyone actually interested in the story (as you will be) or in the game.Some people complain that this game makes you read too much, not enough cut-scenes etc. They think they should get to watch most of, or a lot of, the story like many RPGS. But what better way to immerse yourself in the storyline than to create your own voices in your head, and to read it on your own? Is reading a book any different? Or have all teenagers besides myself not like reading anymore whatsoever? *Difficulty settings are very good. Lots of variation in the levels between the difficulties, but in Radiant Dawn, it seems the computer player will not play fair. For instance, an enemy archer comes up to your soldier. The soldier can't hit back right now. The archer has a 1% critical chance (a critical is where you deal 3x damage than a normal strike). The archer pulls back his bow, and criticals your unit, killing it. And this can happen multiple times. Or, in an area that was or should be secure, reinforcements will show up, therefore killing important units and destroying your current strategy. I wish the computer would play more fair, and many people complain of this. (game loses half of a star point)Though this is a really good game, it stands sub-par to the game before it. Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance, that started the storyline for Radiant Dawn, makes Radiant Dawn look lackluster, poorly made, and not nearly as compelling. (Radiant Dawn loses other half of point) Radiant Dawn is a five star game, don't get me wrong, but it seems four star compared to Path of Radiance. Get Path of Radiance, then Radiant Dawn, so that you can experience the storyline correctly, and play another great game.But please, to anyone who reads this, GET BOTH! THEY'RE BOTH AMAZING!!* This little star is for those of you who have complained about Fire Emblem having too few cutscenes. Well, I've got one reason for ya why they don't have more than they do. Characters. It is optional for almost every single character to live, so imagine all the voices they would have to record, all the sprites they would have to make, and how many different versions of the cut-scenes they would have to make to accommodate for this fact! Personally, cut-scenes don't make a story anyway.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2009"}

It's a gripping tale unlike any other in the video game format.I could go deeper into the graphics, which are fantastic overall, but it's not necessary. I can tell you that the gameplay is totally competent and fun, but it's not what this game's ultimately about in the end. This game's biggest strength is its narrative and what it makes you, the player, feel when you reach the story's conclusion. This isn't a military shooter about dudebro stuff, online frag fests, etc. Spec Ops: The Line is a smartly written, extremely compelling, and often dark and depressing tale of conflict, and how one can often lose his sanity amidst the hell that is war.I cannot recommend this game enough.

{"product_name":"B004FYJFNA","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A masterful, emotionally gripping finale","reviewText":"The Mass Effect series is arguably THE defining franchise of this generation of consoles, and the trilogy concludes in Mass Effect 3, one of the most epic video games I've ever played.  In this installment, the Reapers have finally arrived and are attacking key homeworlds of the galaxy's inhabitants, including Earth, and it's up to Command Shepard to raise an army to fight back.  Much of the most intriguing material here has to do with Shepard's efforts to unite races of beings that have feuds going back thousands of years, such as the Geth and the Quarians, and the Turians with the Krogans.  Like in the previous installments, Shepard will have to accomplish his goals not only with force, but with his mind as well.  Given that this is a turning point in the history of the galaxy, the experiences Shepard has and the decisions he makes will be more far reaching and impactful than ever before, making this an unforgettable event to behold.The game's story reaches some moments of poignancy that are so thrilling, intense, and emotional, that Mass Effect 3 will surely be remembered as a watershed moment in video game storytelling.  Drama, political intrigue, treachery, mystery, and intense suspense all await the player as they work their way across the galaxy.  I remember back when Final Fantasy IV first released here in America (known as Final Fantasy II on the SNES), and I was exposed to real emotion in a video game for the first time.  It was a moment that changed the way I looked at video games and expanded their possibilities in my mind.  Mass Effect 3 is another key moment like that for me, as I feel the possibilities for storytelling have been expanded further than ever with this release.  The writers at Bioware who worked on this game deserve all the praise in the world for envisioning their huge ideas, and making them come to life with sharp dialogue that perfectly supports it.Gameplay also takes a step forward.  While still having something of a ways to go, the combat has been improved significantly, with an improved, yet somewhat twitchy, cover system, an excellent upgrade of the melee system, and weapons that just have a better overall feel than before.  With regards to the weapons, they can now not only be upgraded, but also modified with special add-on attachments, which adds a huge layer of depth to the gameplay and will have gamers tinkering constantly with their arsenal in between missions.  The tedious process of mining minerals has been replaced with a much better minigame where you can quickly scan entire sections of the star system for resources and items, yet must always be careful not to attract the attention of the Reapers.  One flaw this time around is a confusing mission journal that for some reason doesn't update itself as you work through sidequests, leaving you in the dark on your progress and keeping you wondering whether you've obtained a particular item or not.From a presentation standpoint, it's all simply mind-blowing.  This is one of the absolute best looking games out there.  Environments look photorealistic at times, and the backdrops to the levels, as well as the cutscenes, are downright stunning.  The game looks like it's an entire console generation ahead of Mass Effect 2, and again, the developers deserve praise for so effectively utilizing the full potential of these aging consoles to create such stunning visuals and effects.  On the audio side, the game is no different....I don't know if I've heard a better sounding game, with its incredible sound effects constantly utilizing the full rage of my surround sound system and subwoofer.  The game is a technical masterpiece.In the end, it's the story of this incredible saga that will stick with me the longest.  These characters that I've grown to love, and their heroism and their sacrifices.  And at the center of it all, is Commander Shepard, one of the great heroes of not only the gaming universe, but of all science fiction.  Mass Effect 3 does a superb job of bringing this epic saga to a close in the best way possible, while still leaving open the possibility for future tales to be told in this amazing universe.  Mass Effect 3 is an unforgettable epic, and that rare game that not only thrills you at every turn, but tugs at your heartstrings as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2012"}

Jesper Kyd's gloomy music is gone (a shame, since I rather liked it), the camera system is radically different, and the partner system has also been done away with. This time you play as crazed psychopath Lynch, a man so anti-social he'd make Al Capone run and hide. Or at least he used to be. In this game Lynch is on his meds, and his edge is blunt. So he's basically just a generic run and gun anti-hero. What a wasted opportunity.The story opens in Shanghai where Kane arrives to help Lynch with a lucrative opportunity. Before we can make sense of anything further two important people are dead and the anti-heroes are getting the blame. A battle rages across several locations as Kane and Lynch desperately try to escape the city. That's it as far as plot goes. No big twists, no innovative narrative techniques. Just kill, kill, kill. You get to play as Kane in the last level, but for the bulk of the game he's just a background character helping you blast away at the legions of bad guys filling the screen.The story mode can be completed in about four hours. The game gives away trophies like there was no tomorrow, but...the majority of them are for online play. I have to be honest, most of the game's lasting appeal and scope comes from the various online modes (which I have no interest in). It's primarily an online game with a story mode shoehorned in as an afterthought.I have faith the franchise, Kane and Lynch are terrific characters, but for their third outing the developers really do have to deliver an EPIC game for the ages and not a cheap quickie trading off a mediocre brand name.Graphics ASound AGameplay BLasting Appeal D+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2011"}

Treyarch has shown that they were not prepared to pick up the torch left behind by Infinity Ward - they simply \"couldn't see the forest for the trees,\" so to speak; I applaud the level of detail achieved in the individual characters, achieved via facial mapping, motion tracking, etc., yet they completely neglected more worldly details that detract from the overall experience. Firstly, the general movements of the characters are choppy and sluggish, rather than organic and smooth - character's physical reactions to things such as slippey wurfaces, or bullet hits are repetitive and mechanical. The absence of \"the little details,\" as well as repetitive use of models in level environments make for a bland and unrealistic experience. The audio is atrocious; the sounds of gunfire , explosions, etc. are pathetically weak. Furthermore, it seems to be a rather unstable, inefficient engine - unless you are playing on XBox or Playstation, which are platform-optimized and lacking in quality, you'll need a fairly high-end, new system to run it on to experience it in \"all of its glory.\"But my biggest grievance is the absence of gritty, epic moments found in MW2, which I consider to be the pinnacle of the franchise. Instead, it seems to have regressed to an storyline experience on par with the earliest series' in the franchise.Like them or not, Infinity Ward was innovative - Treyarch simply lifted and copied bits and pieces of what Infinity Ward mastered.Nevertheless, dedicated fans of the franchise will still find the game to be generally enjoyable","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2010"}

I later on got Gears of War from Circuit City.The Xbox 360 Pro System is by far the best console system out there no matter what anybody says for the money. Yes the Sony PlayStation 3 has the Blu-Ray disc media format and the Nintendo Wii system has the new remote controller for 3-D movement. But both the PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii console systems just came out and both systems already have major bugs in them.  There are already alot of people out there who regret buying one of those systems.If your smart, you'll wait a year until all the bugs are fix in both those console systems and then think about purchasing one of those systems.  That is what I did with the Xbox 360.  Yes there were major problems with the Xbox 360 when it first came out just like there are major problems now with the PlayStation 3 and the Nintendo Wii console systems.  I waited a year until Microsoft fixed all the bugs in the Xbox 360 and then I went out and purchased it.Right now the Xbox 360 has the best selection of games out there. The Xbox Live Marketplace is the best online service out there.  Go read the reviews for the few games that are out for the PlayStation 3 and you will see what I mean about which system has better games to play.  There are already a huge selection of games to play on the Xbox 360 with a whole bunch of new games for the Xbox 360 coming out next year.  Unfortunately, there are not too many new games coming out for the PlayStation 3 or the Nintendo Wii next year.Also, the Nintendo Wii has very poor graphics and you can't play DVD movies on it and the PlayStation 3 has very few games to choose from to play and it also has poor online service.  The Xbox 360 is already one year ahead of the other two systems on being out in the retail market and that, my friend, will make a huge difference on which system to choose from to go out to buy and play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00432O4VM","description":"","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"B-Movie Goodness","reviewText":"Shadows of the Damned is the latest title from the gaming gods at Grasshopper Manufacture; known for their creative work on the No More Heroes franchise, the crew is back to deliver an even more absurd, more compelling, and more technically competent, crazy game. If you're a fan of Quentin Tarantino and/or Robert Rodriguez, you own it to yourself to buy and play this game immediately. Shadows of the Damned is so absurd, over-the-top, and absolutely creative, that you can't help but fall in love with this gem.Positives:- All-Star Development Cast - Shadows of the Damned is the work of Suda 51 (Killer 7, No More Heroes, etc.) and the rest of Grasshopper Manufacture, Shinji Mikami (Resident Evil 4, Vanquish, etc.), and the music is composed by none other than Akira Yamaoka (Silent Hill composer). With all of this talent on board, it's no surprise that Suda's crazy artistic style and humor is present, Mikami's solid gameplay mechanics are present, and Yamaoka's superb music is present. This game is a pleasure on the eyes, ears, and even in terms of satisfying gameplay.- A Hilarious Ride - Shadows of the Damned is full of cheese. While it may seem slightly scary, it's very much a b-movie style of game. This is a game absolutely packed with sexual innuendos. The banter between the lead character, Garcia Hotspur, and his skeleton head on a stick sidekick, Johnson, is well worth the price of admission alone.- Crazy Boss Battles - This game offers super satisfying, set piece moment boss battles that are both well thought out and fun to play.- Solid Gameplay - At its heart, the aiming and such feels very similar to that of Resident Evil 4 or 5, but unlike those two games, you can move and shoot at the same time in Shadows of the Damned. It works well and it's completely competent.- Magnificent Soundtrack - I can't praise the soundtrack enough; Akira Yamaoka has taken his musical background and really attached a stellar soundtrack to Shadows of the Damned. It immerses you in the experience like no other soundtrack could.Negatives:- A Few Issues Here & There - It's not a super long game, clocking in at around 8 hours. There is also some texture pop-in and screen tear at times.Shadows of the Damned is an entirely fresh and original game that was desperately needed. We get too many games that are so similar these days, but Shadows of the Damned is a satisfying and creative walk on the wild side. If you're willing to try something bizarre, fun, and odd, you have nothing to lose with Shadows of the Damned.Happy gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2011"}

Now it would be really cool if you could just go around exploring these different worlds trying to find these different pieces of the ship and then trying to figure out how to get them back to your ship using the different PIKMIN but, rather than that every 10 min you have to start rounding up your PIKMIN so that you can get them back to your landing site before dark because any PIKMIN that get left behind will be lost.

After MKII and MK3 things got pretty rocky in the \"quality/fun\" department of the Mortal Kombat series. I played many of the games, but the last 3 offerings I haven't bothered more than a few minutes playing.THIS GAME however has changed ALL of that!!This my friends is THE Mortal Kombat game that fans have been wanting and missing all these years. This is an absolute, all out feature fest of fighting modes and options. The challenge mode alone has over 300 options to play through and the customized modes have literally an endless supply of options to tweak the game as you see fit.All the classic characters and favorites included in the game are well represented. All of the costumes are here too...from the 90's style uniforms to unlock-able classics and sweet special outfits. No one will regret this purchase. If you want THE BEST fighting game of recent memory (and yes I play them all) along with the most diverse set of options and FUN modes, then this is your ticket.The extreme and even \"offensive\" (haha) violence, awesome sound, and immense fun is finally back with a wonderful new fighting engine and all the things that made a 10 year old boy spend hundreds of quarters at the arcade all those years ago. Mortal Kombat has FINALLY returned!!!Note: Ignore the one star review. If it doesn't get deleted by Amazon in the first place, the guy has no clue what he's talking about...which is obvious. The Xbox 360 version actually has slightly sharper textures, and a Cleaner and Darker look to it..not to mention better lighting/shadow casting.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"J. Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"GTA IV Starts Strong Then Stalls","reviewText":"I just finished GTA IV and have to say it was an instant classic, as most would agree. I took my time by doing side missions and just messing around so my overall time was 69 hours. (To get 69 hours out of any non-RPG game is saying a lot and definitely makes the came worth the $59 investment--which most games can't say.)The story and characters start strong, but the story goes into too many directions and introduces too many sub-plots. The underlying theme is Nico comes to the U.S. to find the American dream with his cousin, Roman--in the course, encountering Russian and Italian mobsters, gangs, and a variety of weird Liberty City inhabitants.The game play is good, though the controls for vehicles leave something to be desired. I can't count the number of light poles I have knocked down when going around corners or making turns. (Now that would have been a stat to keep track of--the game keeps up with numerous stats, including some outrageous ones as \"how many times you scored\"--and we are not talking about bowling.) Speaking of mini-games or the date games, they are varied, but I found myself liking bowling over everything else. (Try going to a bar, then bowling. That's fun bowling while intoxicating or at least the drive there is.)The newly-introduced concept of building and maintaining friendships, while on its face seems innovative and interesting, becomes a downright nuisance. Nothing more annoying than being in the middle of a mission and getting Roman or someone else calling your cell to ask if you want to get something to eat or go to a strip club, then you reject it, and you see a \"thumbs-down\" icon, knowing that your \"like\" rating just went down with that character. (It takes a while to build up these respect and like ratings too. Even more annoying is calling one of your friends to do one of the handful of activities to boost their like and respect ratings towards you, to find out you called them too late or too early and then you get a thumbs down and have to go out with them again later just to get back where you were.) Like I said, interesting concept, but I felt that at least they shouldn't interrupt missions.The vehicles are varied and most modeled after a real-life equivalent. It takes awhile before you get access to the really good handling vehicles. The motorcycles are okay, but they leave you a sitting target for vehicle hitting you or gunfire. (I like how if Nico hits a solid wall or post in a car, that he goes head first through the windshield. Nice little touch.)The city is made up of three major islands and some minor ones--the middle one being modeled after Manhattan with all of the bright flashing signs. It is awe-inspiring, when in a helicopter, to see just how large the city is. Even after beating it, there are so many areas I haven't explored.There are many other new features that I won't go into as they are fun to experience for the first time.POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:The problem with the game, so expertly crafted, is that the story missions end at about 60% of your overall mission progress percentage. This left me feeling cheated as there are now only side missions, packages, etc. I honestly found myself shocked it would just end like that. I even played the two ending paths and was frankly disappointed that they were basically the same, though involved slightly different outcomes and characters. They could have carried on the story at least until 80% mission progress and leave the last 20% for those who want to explore every nook and cranny after beating the story mode.The game now has little appeal to me to go back to, especially with MGS4 to play.END OF POSSIBLE SPOILERS:The game truly is a masterpiece, except for the issue mentioned above. The graphics are top-notch and unlike some, I think they are far better than the others. Like I have said before on other PS3 reviews--in dark areas, the developers \"cheat\" by lowering the texture detail and resolution, so it can give the appearance of lower quality graphics, but I challenge anyone to say the sunny scenes are anything less than pure next-gen. There are some frame-rate problems, but so few, they didn't ruin the game--like with Assassin's Creed.I truly recommend this game to the mature gamer as the subject matter, situations, and language are all adult content. It was a blast to play and once I get through MGS4, I probably will make a trek back to Liberty City for some side mission fun. Great job, Rockstar!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2008"}

Actually, you can even do more in this game, than you can in real life. Where else than GTA could you wreak havoc and get away with it. Where else than GTA could you spawn a police helicopter, then jump out of it at 1000 feet, land in (what seems to be) Hudson River and walk away like nothing happened. Or you can just buy some new clothes and go bowling if you like.

{"product_name":"B0088MVPFQ","description":"","summary":"New Super Mario Bros. 2 is a fine addition to the Mario lineup!","reviewText":"Honestly, if you're expecting anything more than a simple, fun, and riotous romp through classic-style Super Mario gameplay... of course you're gonna be disappointed!  New Super Mario Bros. 2 is plain, simple fun--with a new twist.  Unlike other Mario games, NSMB2 empasizes and focuses on the coin-collecting aspect of Mario's journey.  After each level the total amount of coins you've collected in the game thus far is tallied up in the corner of the screen.I haven't had the chance to do 2-player, but so far from what I've seen there is no real reason to complain about the game.  Maybe avoid it if you're not a platformer-type of gamer or if you're not a fan of Mario in general.  Otherwise, give this game a chance!  It's really fun, therefore it gets the job done.EDIT:  Now that I've played Coin Rush Mode, I can tell you it's a really solid addition to the game.  In summary, Coin Rush is a selection from two random stages from two worlds and a castle stage (example--W1-4, W2-2, W2-Castle 1) where the time is drastically limited but challenges you to survive while collecting as many coins as possible.  Depending on how you play the levels you can double the amount of coins you've earned.  Whether you win or lose, the coins get tallied up in the total coin count for the game.Also, as other reviewers have noted the main story is quite short, and me having it beat within 24 hours is proof.  However, that doesn't change my final review score at all. New Super Mario Bros. 2 may be a bit short, but it's still as fun and addicting as ever, and will keep any hardcore Mario fan busy for quite some time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2012"}

I just think there were somethings that caused frustration.  They even caused me to go on-line to see what was I missing!!  I NEVER do this with a game unless I beat it ligitamitely.Pros:1)Music is wonderful.  Some of the tracks were somber and fit the mood of that level.  Very, very good.  I'd even buy the soundtrack if they have one.2)Missions are pretty good in variety.3)Graphics are nicely done.4)Sound Effects are great.5)Load times are quick and very painless!!!6)Variety in nazi death animation.Cons:1)When you complete levels and you only get a bronze star even though you cleared the level of all nazis.  Only to find out you had to climb a windmill to spawn the last wave of nazis needed.  This was very annoying in the \"Rough Landing\" level.  Other levels keep spawning nazis even though you clear that area out.  It seems when you turn your back more just pop up.  This was the #1 gripe I have with this game.2)The BAR weapon is useless.  For being a big gun and looks like it'd be powerful, it isn't.  I have to shoot multiple shots to kill nazis with that gun than others.  I get better results with the handgun, or the automatic machine gun.  Even grenades are better.3)Enemies shoot through walls and other solid objects.4)Enemies are alerted to you even though you move at a snail's pace and are behind them.I think that's about all I have a problem with.  If you're like me where you go in and just try to get a gold star on every level to see what bonuses you get, well it's going to be very long and frustrating.  If you are one of those that just go through the game to finish it, well, you'll be pretty happy with this game.Okay, have fun.  For the price of this game it's a good deal.

With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story.

{"product_name":"B004FSE52C","description":"","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"Lara Croft Gets Mature-In More Than One Way","reviewText":"I played a few of the Tomb Raider games and really didn't get into them much, i'm not sure if it's because I was playing as a girl? Not to sound sexist, or i just preferred Indiana Jones, and Drakes Fortune over her. I really enjoyed the Uncharted games and could probably go through them again. I think this game is actually better in different ways. Graphically I do find it to be better, and Square Enix have always been known for great graphics and atmosphere. One of my favorites being Just Cause 2. The game mechanics are smooth as silk, the aiming and shooting accuracy are much better than Drakes Fortune, along with the controls. Not to discredit those games, but this game seems more plausible (for a game), and has more of a humanistic side to it. You really feel what Lara is going through, and it has a lot more emotional in a survival sense. This game is more staying alive then just searching for things and shooting people. Although there is a lot of that as well. The hunting is great, even when your just doing nothing you can simply shoot rabbits, deer, birds and wolves to gain skill points. And find salvage to upgrade simple things like a knife or axe. Even though i'm somewhere in the middle of the game, i don't see my opinion going anywhere but up, but it's already as far as it can go.This game, much like Drake, Resident Evil, Dead Space etc. is \"extremely\" engrossing, and just a joy to play. Without having some of the tedious tasks that the for mentioned games have. Yes there are many quick time events, but they are easy, and not nearly as frequently annoying as say Resident Evil 6. Save points are all over the place, and the autosave does more than enough so that you don't have to continuously repeat a task over and over. And the game is \"fairly\" easy. On another note when i say Mature i mean it, this isn't the innocent Lara portrayed in the other games, or even the movies. The is the rated R version. There is LOTS of violence, cursing, and other elements that make the game for adults. Which is great. It's about time we have an adult platforming adventure game, without going so overboard it's not enjoyable. Well this is the game. The graphics as i said are just amazing, i have it on PC, so i could test out my rig, then got it for 360, to enjoy sitting on the couch in front of the big screen with surround sound. Both look amazing, but of course the PC has higher resolution, and the detailing while amazing, can make it, well, almost unrealistic looking. Also platformers are much more fun on consoles IMO. I use my rig for FPS mostly. So pick this game up, there is plenty of gameplay time, and even downloadable content to keep you busy for many hours. I rarely buy \"new\" games, i always get used or wait till the price comes down. But Tomb Raider is definitely worth it. The only other game i plan on purchasing \"new\" is Bioshock Infinite, which looks also to be amazing.Other perksUsing the bow, climbing, scaling cliffs, weapon upgrades, the thrill of the kill, the will to survive, and oh yeah. This is one of the hottest versions of Lara to date. You're just wanting a scene to watch her bathe, even though she's a bunch of pixels and polygons. HA. Maybe that will come later, or we'll have the Naked Raider DLC. Either way, incredible game, which i'll probably go through again, sometime in the summer. ;o) Play on!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

For the minimal investment, your kid will get a good workout, which is the main reason why I like these games. Their is also a sweat mode that I have yet to see my wife try out, but I am sure its a good workout. The CO-OP dance modes this game has is really nice. My daughter and her two friends battle it out to see who scores the most points during a song. Yes, you need some space to have 3 kids dancing around to one song at the same time, buts its well well worth it. Kinect is funky as usual, but you can use the joystick to navigate the menus so that is a big bonus. Hopefully the Xbox One's Kinect 2 camera makes menu navigation a much more pain free experience.

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement.

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay.

So you ask why my 3 & 4 stars well it's simply because I'm not an ace shooter and the fact that there weren't options for easy/normal/hard mode for this game made me feel as if I'd lost IQ points because I stank at it.  This game was amazing as far as changing the resident evil formula making the bad guys more challenging, etc.  But if you aren't an expert gamer this game is going to be more frustrating than the scary stay up for hours game play of old.  After 3 or 4 deaths I was ready to throw in the towel for this game it simply was too hard for me.  I'm sure other reviewers will get a good laugh about that, but I like choices with my game.  I want to be able to play on the Easy version before kicking up to speed demon mode.As I said though I think they made amazing strides with RE4 although the story really has nothing to do with RE's umbrella corp storyline, the horror aspect was still there.  Now instead of just having zombies that can bite you you have actual enemies who come at you with weapons and don't stay down once you've shot them.I love the fact that the Gamecube gives them more opportunity for amazing graphics.  I hate to admit I hope this is available on PS2 with a few options that I can choose from like Easy/Normal/Or Crazy mode and even better cheat options so players like me can actually enjoy the game all the way through even though we stink at it.For gamers with the skill this is a great adventure and challenging shooter, but if you aren't that quick on the draw you might want to wait and see if they come out with a PS2 version with some options.

Add to that, original footage from the Mega Man TV series, more than 30 original artwork selections and remixed music tracks that were inspired by the series.","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Classic old-school at it's finest","reviewText":"Mega Man might be old, but he's one tough little midget. Back in his heyday, he ran through a gauntlet of action platformers, foiling the ever-nefarious Dr. Wily and his band of unique henchmen over and over again. Unfortunately, there was one recurring frustration with Mega Man: his adventures had become too repetitive, each new game simply a mirror of the last.In an ironic effort to keep the fading series fresh, Mega Man is constantly being re-imagined. Over the past few years, we've seen Mega Man X, Mega Man Legends, Mega Man EXE, Mega Man Zero, Mega Man Soccer, and coming soon, a Mega Man RPG. Cripes! All this for a robot-kid who didn't learn how to duck until Mega Man X5, some 20 games into the series? Rather than keep us interested, this overbearing diversity is enough to make us long for the simple action of the original games.But have heart, young gunners - Mega Man Anniversary Collection hops aboard the time travel express and offers a nostalgic trip back to the classic Mega Man games. Newcomers might not get misty-eyed, but even they can't argue with the value-minded price. The collection includes all the classic games, Mega Man 1 through Mega Man 8, plus two average fighting games never before released in the U.S.For newbies who don't know much about the series, Mega Man is a blue robot with a heart of gold. In Japan, his name was Rock Man. His sister robot was named Roll. Rock and Roll. Oh, the wit.Anyway, Mega Man repeatedly fights against Dr. Wily, a crazed inventor who fashions eight evil robots of various talents. By beating these robots, Mega Man earns their weaponry, each of which is effective against some other major baddie. Eventually, Mega Man throws down against Wily in the evil scientist's skull fortress. Wily gets whooped, promises to always be good, brush his teeth, and never again wrong the world'and five seconds later, he does it again.The good news is that there are no emulation problems in this collection - expect perfect 8-, 16- and 32-bit recreations all the way. You jump, you shoot, you gain new abilities, you jump and shoot some more. The games play just as they did originally, which means they're still hard, fun and classic.That being said, some of the games are better than others. The original Mega Man was difficult and not particularly fun, and the same holds true today. Things pick up in Mega Man 2, 3 and 4, where the series truly found its groove and defined itself as a top-notch platformer.Much of that has to do with the robots. Some of them look sharp, like the wicked Pharaoh Man and Snake Man, while others look improbably ridiculous, like the moronic Clown Man. As is usually the case with a series that has stuck around a little too long, the designs get less original and more far fetched as the years pass. The best robot designs, unsurprisingly, are in Mega Man 2, 3, and 4. With each new iteration, you can see Dr. Wily losing it more and more. Flower Man? Top Man? Wily, please.Really only a few changes have been made to the games and they're very minor. The Navi remix mode that first appeared in Mega Man 8 is now in every game, which overlays intermittent, non-invasive directional arrows to help keep you from going the wrong way. Navi mode also replaces the original 8-bit midi tracks with actual instruments. The 8-bit versions still sound more fitting, but the remixes certainly aren't a problem.A new quicksave memory card system has been grafted over the old password system, allowing easy automatic saves instead of the tedium of writing down all the grid information. Purists can still enter in the old passwords or start over if they die, however.The interface wrapping everything together is kind of neat as well; instead of a normal menu, Mega Man runs through doors marked with the various games and options. While superficially clever, much more could have been done with this. Why not a museum for Mega Man to wander through?It's a little hard to quibble about \"extras' in a collection of this size, however. Mega Man Anniversary Collection does include plenty of art and audio to unlock as well as the two unreleased fighting games, both of which are pretty bad. The PS2 also enjoys a Mega Man cartoon episode.For $30, there's no cheaper way to re-experience Capcom's mega-past. Though the series is pretty much stale these days, that wasn't always the case, and the Mega Man Anniversary Collection serves as a reminder that while the games might feel a little dated, the Blue Bomber still has some fight left.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2006"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E800","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Perfection Refined","reviewText":"In the field of motion pictures, a generally accepted norm for \"greatest film ever made\" seems to be Orson Welles' classic\"Citizen Kane.\" Because games are a relatively young medium compared to cinema, it was only until about 14 years ago thata contender for \"greatest game ever made\" stepped forth. To this day, many consider it to be the birthing place of 3D conventionsthat are still used quite frequently. That game is \"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time\", and on the 25'th anniversary of theZelda franchise, Nintendo has given it a facelift on it's newest handheld, the 3DS. Diehard fans of the original (raises hand)and newcomers alike are about to astounded by the results.For the virgins in the audience, \"Ocarina of Time\" follows Link, a young boy who lives in the Kokiri Forest, a place where children frolic about with fairy companions. But a peaceful game this is not, for the patriarch of the forest, The Great Deku Tree, summons the boy before him and reveals that he has a much bigger life ahead of him than previously expected. Before he passes on, the tree sends Link on a quest that will span vast distances, and transcend the very fabric of time itself. This quest will determine the future of Hyrule, for if the young warrior fails, the land which is home to thousands will be plunged into an eternity of nightmares by Ganondorf, known by many as the King of Evil.With this plot, the stage is set for a journey of epic proportions. Back in the Nintendo 64 era, a game of this scope was unheard of, and revolutionized what we expected from interactive entertainment forever. But does it hold up by today's harsh standards? With what Nintendo has done, it not only holds up, but still exceeds a good 90% of what we see on the market in 2011. For a game made over a decade ago, that's no easy feat.Of course, to do this, the developers had to perform cosmetic surgery on the whole experience. The first, most noticeable change is the fact that the graphics have been rebuilt entirely. Gone are the blocky sprites we saw so many years ago; every character, even the vast multitude of NPCs, are positively teeming with life, moving with fluid gestures we never thought capable from the game. That attention has also been given to the many locales the player will be visiting, with every town, dungeon and field popping off of the screen. These are the most impressive graphics out there on the 3DS right now, and without a doubt the most novel use of it's 3D capabilities. When plugged into a wall, playing with the 3D turned on is highly recommended, for it will provide an experience that simply must be seen to be appreciated.But a simple graphical overhaul just wouldn't be enough for a game with admittedly antiquated mechanics, which is why \"OoT 3D\" makes brilliant use of the system's dual screens. The new gameplay eliminates having to shift through four different menus on one pause screen, allocating all item and equipment management to the bottom touch screen. The abilities to equip four items at once, to shuffle through equipment at a breakneck pace, and no longer having to equip the Ocarina are all welcome changes to the game. Also welcome is the gyroscope in the 3DS, meaning that you can now aim items such as the hookshot and bow with your own hands. This kind of interactivity beats even the Wii Remote aiming present in \"Twilight Princess\", and after engaging in it, you'll find it hard going back to the old method.Some things shouldn't be touched when modifying the classics, though; just look at what Spielberg did to \"E.T.\" One of the most beloved things about \"OoT\" is Koji Kondo's chill-inducing soundtrack, and diehards will pleased to know that it remains entirely intact in this remake. While it would've been nice to see some kind of orchestral rearrangement of the score, the nostalgia nerd in all of us will feel right at home with these tunes.Extras, like the Master Quest and boss gauntlet, are really just icing on the cake. This is a killer version of a killer game, and perhaps now the strongest reason to own a 3DS. This writer cannot emphasize enough on how absolutely phenomenal this game is, and in the end, it's up to you to take the first step on your journey to save Hyrule, whether it's your first or five-hundreth.Do you have what it takes?Plot: A+Gameplay: A+Graphics: A+Music: A+Overall: A+ (Superb)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2011"}

Following the events of the previous game, Kazuma and Haruka (his adopted daughter) have left Kamurochoto to seek a new life in Okinawa where they manage an orphanage for children. However, their peaceful life is soon interrupted when a series of events unfold pulling Kazuma back into the shadowy past he thought he had left behind. Making its first appearance exclusively on the PlayStation 3 platform, the rich story and vibrant world of Yakuza 3 lets players engage in intense brutal clashes within the streets of Okinawa, and the pulsating and often dangerous city of Tokyo where only the strongest will survive.","reviewerName":"NeoTristan","summary":"Finally 'Shenmue' Reincarnated","reviewText":"Back in 2000, there was a little unknown gem on Sega Dreamcast called 'Shenmue', which became a huge financial flop despite the universal critical praises.  Its sequel only showed up in Japan and later ported to the original X-Box after Dreamcast's demise.  Shenmue was the game that invented QTE (Quick Time Event) that are so frequently used by many games like Resident Evil 4, Heavy Rain and God of War series.Yakuza 3 is the third installment of the popular Japanese action adventure game series by Sega that inherit all the characteristics of Shenmue series.  But it is this installment that finally exceeds everything Shenmue tried to be in spades with so much more contents and depths.  Yakuza series was understandably not well-known outside Japan at all due to its quirky and idiosyncratic eccentricity stemming from distictively Japanese culture.  Make no mistake, this is one of the most popular game in Japan.  With population half as big as the U.S. but so much diversities in different genres of video games (each game is targeted speficically for intended demographic rather than potential demographic as here in the U.S.), half-million copies sold is viewed as bona-fide success.  With sensible budget and half-million copies means good profits and the next sequel.  The fourth one has just been released in Japan.  There have been tons and tons of games on PS and Nintendo consoles that never make outside Japan, and Yakuza series are one of the rare ones that are available here in the U.S.Warning to fans of GTA or the likes and JRPG; Yakuza 3 is not a console RPG or GTA-clone, as many would describe it.  It's a grand style action adventure game that indeed plays very much like JRPG but so jam-packed with contents that it put arguably all console RPG to shame and gives even the longest CRPG like 'Oblivion' or 'Fallout 3' some serious run for its money.  Don't be surprise to clock in over 100 hours to unlock 100 percent completion percentage.  Beside the main story, which gives you good 20-25 hours, the game is overflowing with substories and side activities.  Plus you can always engage in street fight at certain points.  On and all, if you ever played either of Shenmue, you'll know exactly what you're getting into.  This really is 'Shenmue' reincarnated, so if you ever moaned about the demise of the series, pick this up without any hesitation.Its fighting mechanics is Sega's own 'Streets of Rage' style beat-them-up brawler with some depth.  Just don't expect more complicated fighting game like Sega's own 'Virtua Fighter'.  But the actual fighting is much more brutal, violent, bone-crunching and over the top than the unrealistic arcady fighting games that let you shoot fireball from your eyes so you will have a heck of a time engaging in combat.  It's really fun.The story is thoroughly Japanese and also very realistic and real-life related like actual Japanese TV drama.  The plot progresses via dynamic cutscenes and static dialogues.  While each literation in the series offers a self-contain story arc but you would have much more emotional resonance if you've already played the first two on PS2. It also have many recurring themes overlapping from the first two.  Luckily, the game gives you full rundown of the story of the first two games with cutscenes directly lifted from the PS2 games.However, the game only offers Japanese soundtrack with English subtitle, due to huge cultural differences between Japanese and western nations, the game will be difficult to get into for a lot of people.  Don't be surprised if you don't understand many of customs, references and logics.  Pacing would also make things difficult for more casual gamers who are used to quick access and fast-paced run-of-the-mill action game.  This is an action adventure game that heavily focuses on human drama.  Episodic and sometimes brutal, sometimes poignant, but always humane and realistic, it requires you to read and reminisce a lot as a main character on the way.Visual is indeed very impressive.  Facial model is the most impressive aspect and on par with 'Heavy Rain'.  The graphical style opts for photo-realism so everything is very real-life like.  But the jagged character models and color imperfection signal that this is still a video game.  While not exactly 'Uncharted 2' or 'God of War 3', this is one fine looking game.Controversy surrounding the contents cut from the original Japanese version are indeed true.Cut content from the western version of Yakuza 3 includes:-\"Loser\" (Japanese theme song by Eikichi Yazawa)-Wooing women in hostess clubs-Managing a hostess club-Mahjong mini-game-Shogi mini-game-Massage parlor mini-game-Answer X Answer trivia game-Convenience store magazine browsing (you can only see the covers)-A handful of sub-missions all related to aforementioned cut contents (26 out of 126 substories to be precise)The official explanation of the cut is due to the cultural gap between Japanese and westerners, Sega worried that it would not resonate as much with western gamers with the axed contents.  I personally call this a load of crap for Yakuza 1 and 2 previously had massage parlor, casino, hostess club mini games.  I assure you that the omitted contents really don't change the game at all.  Only some of the extra side activities are cut and the game is already jam-packed with side activities.  But it would be much nicer to maintain the integrity of the original work.It's been a crazy couple of months for me.  From belated port of 'Star Ocean: The Last Hope', revolutionary 3D adventure game called 'Heavy Rain' to highly controversial yet solid 'Final Fantasy XIII' and the return of the king in 'God of War 3', it really has been taxing on my budget.  Now 'Yakuza 3' is another excellent addition to already impressive Playstation library filled with diversified entries, variaties and quality.  With 'Fallout: New Vegas', 'Two Worlds II', 'Arcania: A Gothic Tale', 'God of War III', 'MGS: Peace Walker', 'Metroid: Other M', and possibly another Zelda, my urges and passion for CRPG and action adventure games will be thoroughly satisfied in the year 2010.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"A new evolutionary step in Third Person Shooters, and video games in general","reviewText":"I do not understand why some people are bashing Gears of War.  Sure, its another Third Person Shooter, and we all know that we have hundreds of Third Person Shooters(TPS) to choose from on the market.But, Gears of War is to TPS as Miles Davis was to Jazz. Gears of War re-defines the FPS genre in ways that are innovative and generate massive amounts of fun in the process.Lets take some innovations from the game and see where they stack up in our already swarming world of TPS games.The Roadie Run: This is a very unique run. When you enter the run mode, the camera drops down to about knee level and gets very shaky a la wartime movie style. You cannot shoot while running and vision is limited, but you can evade enemies and escape incoming fire.The Active Reload: Ok, I have never ever played another game where if you time your reloading perfectly you can get a damage boost. Maybe there is another game out there that has this, but I haven't played it. This adds so much to multiplayer and even the campaign game.\"Bleed out\" time: In execution mode in a multiplayer match, if you take sufficient enough damage, you will fall to your knees, leaving you vulnerable to attacks. If you rapidly tap A button you can slowly revive yourself before your character dies from blood loss, however usually an opposing player will have already stomped on your head or blown your head to bits.Ammo situation: Unlike shooter games, Gears of War does not shower you with ammo. Instead you either have to grab what is available(which is not much), aim carefully(!), and grab whatever your kill leaves behind. Even in campaign mode, it is very possible to run out of ammo.Tactical movements: In both modes of Gears of War (Campaign and Multiplayer), taking cover and being evasive has many advantages. You certainly can go all out and charge the enemy, but that will most likely render you on your knees, ready to be curb-stomped by your adversary. You can hide behind virtually everything, and you also have a run move where your character runs in a sort of crouching position, making you harder to hit and see. Utilizing tactical movements, and your team increases your chances of winning.Curb-stomp: If you get your opponent to their knees, in campaign or multiplayer(execution mode), you can curb stomp them, which involves smashing their head under your foot. Its a great way to finish off an enemy.Life gauge: There is no on screen life gauge like in most other TPS'. Instead when you take damage, a red cog appears on the screen indicating your status. The more defined and the more red your cog is, the closer you are to death. However, if you manage to escape a battle and hide away, you will automatically heal.And, not so original is the behind-the-character point of view. However, this only enhances the game, as everything seems more fluid. I am guessing that the designers did this on purpose, to show off the amazing character models that they created. Another not so original addition, though very awesome and certainly enhancing the game, is impact of bullets to the characters bodies. If you shoot an enemy in the arm or leg, it doesn't really do much to hurt or hinder them. Shoot them in the torso and it takes more damage off. Shoot them in the head, and they are a goner (depending on how far/close you are and what weapon you are wielding).Ok, now onto the graphics.The graphics are by far the best achievement in graphical enhancement that I have ever seen in a video game, period!They got so detailed in this games graphic design, that you can see individual hairs on the human characters heads, their neck and arm muscles, the deep detail in their body armor (the body armor looks truly amazing and very cool), and amazingly detailed environments. Glass reflects light in a very realistic way, as do characters. Brick walls look like, brick walls! Even up close! There ain't no trickery here, everything looks amazing up close as it does far away. Buildings look very realistic, as do each character model. There are even facial expressions!Gears of War is THE most realistic looking game I have ever played!A lot of detail and time went into the graphics, and it shows. You will be hard pressed to find a game with better graphics (maybe Halo 3). Everytime I play this game I am amazed and astounded at the graphics. EVERY TIME!Character models move very smooth-like, and their animations are incredible, especially reloading. Shooters have been around for a long time, but killing enemies has NEVER looked this good!The sound is very realistic as well. From reloading, buildings being blown apart, to the sound of a characters head or body parts being blown to bits, it all sounds amazingly real, or at least what I imagine it would sound like. When you run over body parts scattered across the ground, you are treated to a squishy sound that is really cool sounding. Reloading a weapon sounds really, really cool. Especially the sniper rifle. Bullet casings ting when they hit the ground. When a member of the COG team runs, you can hear their armor shaking around. Characters breath hard when they run too. When a character makes an active reload, they say a particular saying. The sayings vary with each character. When you kill someone your character may make a comment as well. When frag grenades go off, or when the unique Torque Bow arrows explode, you are treated to the sound of rubble flying against the environment. Overall, the sound does very, very well with immersion and you really feel like you are in the middle of an intense war.The only gripe that I could find with this game, is that the campaign mode is short. However playing it on Hardcore and Insane really draws the firefights out considerably.But what you have to realize, is that Gears of War was always meant to be enjoyed as a multiplayer game. The campaign mode is merely practice for what lies ahead on XBOX Live (the real meat of this game). Playing against other real players makes the game so much better, and more challenging. Death Matches get pretty hardcore. The coolest thing about it, is the team deathmatch aspect. You can work together with up to three other people to co-ordinate attacks and bail eachother out of trouble.There are a few varying modes of LIVE play, and they are all fun, though they all basically boil down to being \"shoot the other team and survive\" mentality.One annoying thing about the LIVE aspect of this game, is the competition that arises due to the fact that kills and wins toss you up onto the leaderboard and you can even get achievements for certain weapons. This leads to rather selfish behavior and playing with people who get really angry and upset when they don't win, not to mention those that play the game strictly for achievement hunting. Thanfully Epic added a Ranked version of Online and a Causal version of online. In Ranked mode, kills, wins and losses are tracked (this is where the aggressive and annoying players are), in the casual matches, called (player modes), kills don't amount to anything but its all about fun.Despite the negative things about this game, the live playing is TOP NOTCH and very addicting, especially if you end up playing with a team that actually works as a team.Gears of War has literally changed the way games will be looked at for all future releases. It has set the bar very high, almost too high for shooters across all platforms. I've played the Halo 3 Beta, I've rocked Shadowrun (which is very fun by the way), I've played Prey and Perfect Dark Zero, and I have to say that NONE of these games bring to the table what Gears of War does. In terms of graphics - Gears is top of the line, in terms of game play (at least online) - Gears of War is the top of the ladder. In terms of an all around amazing product - you guessed it, Gears of War comes out on top.The cover system and the roadie run add so much to your strategy that it is really hard to play shooters that do not offer this. Being able to hug concrete and walls galore adds stealth and the roadie run adds evasion. The Third person view is also much better than the common First Person view. I prefer the Third Person View personally, you have a better field of vision.Seriously, if you own an XBOX but are unsure about this game, stop being unsure! Pick it up! You will not regret it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2007"}

Set in a universe somewhere between Lord of the Rings and Spinal Tap, it&rsquo;s a fresh take on the action/driving genre, which in this case is full of imitation cover bands, demons intent on enslaving humanity and Heavy metal tunes. Featuring the talents of comedian, actor and musician, Jack Black as super roadie Eddie Riggs, as well as cameos by some of the biggest names in metal music it's a wild ride in the belly of the beast that is not to be missed by gamers and Metalheads alike..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"For those about to play, we salute you","reviewText":"If you're a gamer and love rock (specifically metal it seems), than you're going to love Brutal Legend. Well that's a stretch really but that's what the game feels like: combines 2 loves into one big package and lets you enjoy a huge free-roaming game with lots of sidequests and extra stuff to do while listening to heavy metal songs. The game also comes courtesy of Tim Shaffer, the man behind \"Grim Fandango\" and \"Psychonauts\", and who is considered one of the top game designers we have today. Yet why does Brutal Legend not feel like a perfect game? I guess in a way because Double Fine tried to fit as much \"game\" into the game as possible yet not iron out the kinks or rather the weird troubles as it were. There's a lot of stuff to do in Brutal Legend but the pieces don't feel as fleshed out as a whole.Story: You play as Eddie Riggs, the best roadie ever who can \"build anything and fix anything\" who is unfortunately touring with a really awful poser band so when an accident gets Eddie's blood on his possessed belt buckle, an ancient and powerful demon transports Eddie to a land inspired by heavy metal album covers and where humanity has been enslaved by the evil Lord Doviculus and his right-hand man, General Lionwhite. So it's up to Eddie, a girl he meets named Ophelia and some familiar sounding characters to save the world.Graphics: Brutal Legend is the kind of game where it doesn't look technically astounding but it does look \"cool\". From the dragons and fire-breathing things to mountains of skulls and I could've swore I saw the Van Halen logo somewhere, nearly everything in the game has some ties to metal and even motorcycles. Know how in games, a lowly runt enemy might be a pig? Well now the \"hog\" as it were as literally a motorcycle pig but we also have spiders that spin bass strings instead of webbing. And the character's faces are quite expressive and more than once the game will provide laughs just on one of these things. However, aside from the occasional pause in the framerate, the game doesn't exactly look next-gen and it's got more or less an acceptable look to it.Sound/Music: Soundtrack of the year and most of it isn't actually made by the game creators, heh. Instead your car will function as a stereo where you're going to get a cavalcade of music from Def Leppard, Ratt, Black Sabbath, Slayer and Megadeth (though I can understand the money involved, feels empty knowing Metallica or Iron Maiden's not in this) and the good side is that you can actually take songs off so if you can't stand one particular song than just take it off the radio and it'll never again pop up. But then again, your trips from here to there might be so short you probably won't even listen to the whole thing and more than once I never actually made it to the second verse before I had to get out of my car. Voice acting is also great with Jack Black actually doing a rather tamer performance...for the most part and we also get great turns from Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Halford of Judas Priest, Tim Curry and Lemmy Kilmister. But some voice clips do repeat for the side missions so Eddie's cry of \"bring on the s'mores!\" will bore into your brain eventually.Gameplay: Brutal Legend boiled down is basically 3 game concepts in one but neither one is as refined as they should be. Let's get the first out, the hack-n-slash. Eddie has combos that he can use from setting enemies ablaze with his guitar, slashing with his literal axe or my favorite, doing a baseball swing which sends the enemy flying. But the combos aren't that in-depth and I found combat to be slightly clunky and trying to target a specific enemy on the map was pretty trying. The 2nd game is open-world, a world where you can go anywhere and find anything but the problem here is two-fold: one is that the bulk of these are collectibles from guitar solos you can add to your special moves which range from squad commands to the awesome Facemelter which literally melts the faces off enemies. One solo I had to find myself was to set up a rally point for the 3rd game I'll talk about later and you'd think, gee, wouldn't that be handy to know in battle? Or that you can do special attacks from your stage? Or maybe, I don't know, a radar or map of some sort? In Assassin's Creed II, they'll not only tell you what city you're missing feathers in but the specific DISTRICT, sure you have to actually find the thing but at least you know the general area. Hell in Infamous, you press the L3 button that specifically tells you where it is but in Brutal Legend? You're on your own. The other part of the two-fold deal is that the side missions can repetitive fast from ambushing enemies to fending off attackers to races or Warcraft-style \"kill x number of y for person z\" quests. Even the collectibles get old as they not only tell you how to access it but it's the same action for each one over and over.Then we have the 3rd game concept, the one that tends to bug people the most: RTS. While I don't mind Starcraft and somewhat liked Halo Wars, having an action game combined with an RTS doesn't function as well as it sounds. While it is cool to transition between the \"God view\" in the air to actually on the ground battling with the troops, the lack of a mini-map, ways to distinguish who's who on the battlefield or even who's dead can grate on your nerves. There's nothing \"wrong\" with the RTS gameplay but for those who don't play RTS you might find there's instructions you've never been told to make it accessible and for the hardcore you'll miss the mini-map or picking specific unit types or knowing where all your units are. And of course the multiplayer is based entirely around this, however because they have different factions than what you command in single-player they're really isn't a tutorial per se unless you play against the AI and test the waters. Not to mention the game's quite short so by the way you've finally gotten the hang out of the RTS, game's over. Oh and there's also one minor thing that applies to the whole game: there's no jump button. And having to go all the around one ankle high ledge is kind of stupid. Know how the evil demon could've won and beat our heroes? Build his lair atop a big staircase.Brutal Legend in a way seems like the perfect game for the casual who likes their stuff hardcore. The gore is outlandish but cartoony, the sidequests are short, upgrades don't cost all that much and your fire tributes (money) can be acquired easily and the game's easy enough to control. But after the excellent opening, which basically comprises the demo, the laughs somewhat die a little, the RTS elements rear their ugly head and sidequests while thankfully short, are like Assassin's Creed missions where you'll be doing the same one too many times. Maybe I'm just nitpicky but it's easy to love the spirit of Brutal Legend but maybe not so much some of its actual game components.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Not what I expected.","reviewText":"The Grand Theft Auto series has always been a mixed bag for me.  I really enjoyed GTA3, and played it nonstop until I finished it.  I then moved to Vice City and couldn't have been more disappointed by a sequel; I only played it for a couple of days before I moved on to other games.  Then GTA San Andreas came out and I again was hooked again.  My only issues with GTA: San Andreas was that it was entirely too long, I spent A LOT of time playing it, but it just seemed like the amount of missions were endless. After a while I got an XBOX 360, so eventually I stopped playing the XBOX altogether, leaving San Andreas unfinished.  Fast forward a few years and now we are at one of the most anticipated games for quite a while.  GTA IV.  While the game is not really that bad, not nearly as bad as Vice City, it still is not as good as San Andreas or even GTA 3.Without boring you with the storyline behind the game, I will just say that in this edition of the series, you are Niko Bellic a Russian immigrant now living in Liberty City (New York City).Game play is very similar to previous installments, so if you are familiar with the other games in the series, then you will be able to pick this one up right away.  In addition to what you already know about the game there are some additions.You have a Cell Phone, in which you can actually call your in game buddies and girlfriends to go on dates and/or to the bowling, strip clubs, etc.  They will also call you if you ignore them for too long.Instead of being able to just walk up to a parked car open the door and drive away, this time around you actually have to break the window first, then hot wire it before you are able to drive away.  This stuff is done automatically by the game, but it takes time, and with the very high police presence in this game, you really have to pick the cars you want to take to avoid an annoying police chase.Another addition is that you can actually watch TV while you're in your safe house.  There are about 4 or 5 different channels, and there are actually different shows that you watch, it starts to repeat after a while, but it is still a cool addition if you really just want to waste time without having to do something all the time.Finally, you can also go to an internet caf&eacute; and surf the internet, receive emails (including SPAM) and read hilarious news stories.The graphics in the game are ok, but it seems like one is looking through a brownish film.  The graphics are comparatively much better than San Andreas, but not as good as I have seen in other games.  I can easily look past this however, considering the fact that there are always a lot of things going on the screen at one time.My biggest complaint about the game are the absurdly poor controls and slow character movement.  Game play to me is what makes a game and sadly GTA IV's controls are not very good.  As another reviewer already stated, one of the most annoying type of mission are missions in which you have to kill 23,478 guys by yourself.  Just the simple task of killing one person is more difficult than it really has to be.  First of all the buttons are very difficult to use during intense fire fights.  By the time you get the cover button to work properly, you would have already lost 25% of your energy, and by the time you are able to move to another place, another 10 - 15% of your energy is gone.  All of this and you haven't even begun shooting yet!  If you are lucky enough to have enough energy left to put up a good fire fight, you then have to worry about your bullets not even hitting the guy you are shooting at.  I have been in situations where I was literally two feet away from a guy, and my gun shots did NOTHING to him.  Yet he turns around and kills me with 3 shots.  After I died I was given the option to start the mission over, but then I had to go through the tedious process of driving there first.  I seem to remember San Andreas allowing you to skip the driving part if you have already done it, but I don't see any kind of option like this in GTAIV.Another annoying type of mission are the car chase missions.  There are three levels when it comes to car handling cars in GTA IV:  bad, worse, and terrible.  NONE of the cars handle great and a simple left or right turns sends your car sliding and spinning out of control giving the guy you are chasing ample time to get away.  You can always turn slower but then the enemy will still get away because you are not moving fast enough.  In addition to this, I have noticed some car chase missions are completely scripted in which the same type of road hazards occur every single time.  For example I had to chase down and kill this guy and while I was chasing him he causes a truck to spill pipes all over the road, then later on causing a taxi to spin out of control heading straight towards me.  I failed the mission the first time, so when I tried again, the EXACT same things happened again!The game controls alone are enough to make me not want to play the game anymore or at least not as much as I played GTA3, or San Andreas, but then I run into the problem of the new features of the game become more annoying than enjoyable.  A prime example is your cell phone.  If you are like me and just spent an hour or so beating a couple of missions, all you want to do is save the game, but while you are going to your safe house to save, you get a call from one of your many friends asking to do something.  You can always ignore them or say no, but then that hurts your friendship rating.  So either you lose your friendship rating or reluctantly do something, spending more time playing the game.  You can always turn stealth mode on, to stop people from calling, you but it seems to turn off by itself and you have to set it back to stealth mode again every time you load a game.I haven't played this game in about a month.  There are a good number of other games that I have that are more enjoyable than GTAIV and I probably won't ever beat it if it turns out to be very long. I give it 3 stars overall and 3 stars for fun. It's not as bad as Vice City, it just SHOULD have been much better, considering all the hype surrounding it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2008"}

This game is packed with so much content, it's crazy! Beyond the campaign (which takes a few hours longer to complete than most other AC titles) there is so much extra content to explore in New York, Boston, and the wilderness. This includes side quests, assassination contracts, hunting, and so much more. If you haven't played any AC games yet, I would highly recommend starting from the beginning and playing through the earlier games first- this story line might be confusing.This game is pretty similar to other AC titles in terms of controlling the character and taking on missions. The biggest differences you will notice is probably the menu GUI and the more open-world play. The menu takes some getting used to, but it turns out to be pretty intuitive. The open-world element is a huge improvement- you no longer feel restricted to just one or two cities to play around in- you now have truly massive maps filled with things to discover at your own pace. Overall, this game provides a massive amount of open-world gameplay, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has already played these games. If you haven't yet, I would recommend starting with Assassin's Creed 1 and playing through the rest of the games first.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"M. MacMahon","summary":"Shadow Fall Singleplayer Campaign Review","reviewText":"Shadow Fall has an interesting campaign. Across ten long levels you have a variety of different gameplay styles from shooter history all sort of bundled together into a strange beast that never stops changing things up. One level will be a super linear cinematic fest, then the next will be a wide open Crysis style special operations mission with multiple objectives. After that you'll have a spooky puzzle filled trek through an abandoned station, then a flying section, then an endless wave based survival section, and so on. There's even a pure stealth level with a cloaking mechanic, and a section where you spot for a sniper while being armed only with a pistol.In short Shadow Fall has variety, and very little of it feels awkward. Some later sections feel a bit too hard as they throw endless enemies at you, and the stealth sections can feel a little unforgiving at times with how quickly you're noticed, but overall each level felt different and satisfying to me, rather than scattered or awkward, with very rare exception.The OWL mechanic adds some interesting gameplay. By the end of the game you'll really have to balance using it's overcharge ability to stun tough enemies, shielding yourself and distracting mobs with an attack command. It doesn't turn Shadow Fall into Rainbow Six levels of tactics by any means, but it's a solid mechanic that separates Shadow Fall in yet another way from your everyday linear shooting console FPS. The weapons all feel heavy and solid, a Killzone staple, and your main weapon can act as both a rifle and a sniper, leaving you feeling more free to carry a shotgun or RPG in slot two without hampering yourself.Graphics for the game can be a bit uneven at times, with some levels looking absolutely stunning and welcoming you to next-gen while others look a bit plain. Overall though when you're cruising above a massive city, land, then become surprised that you can walk around and look freely because you thought sure it was a cutscene, you're going to pretty happy with the visuals. On top of tech stuff it's just interesting sci-fi design at its core, which appeals to many people like myself. There's not enough sci-fi in the world.The story is decent, but probably a weak point. It sets up a nice cold war style narrative but by the end it all kind of falls apart in a muddled &#34;what am I doing again?&#34; kind of way. Weapon of mass destruction, changing allegiances, crazy politicians, etc... all the standard stuff is here. What I will say is the game ends on a satisfying set up for another title, if Sony decides to do one. I hope that promise is fulfilled, because I loved the idea of that final moment being made into a whole game.Overall Shadow Fall's campaign is good for an FPS campaign in 2013, no doubt. If the PS4 sticks around 8 years like the PS3 I wouldn't be surprised if this game is considered archaic by the end of that time, but for right now I think it's a good experience that feels improved due to the hardware and interesting compared to its peers. If you're an FPS fan with a PS4 in the next couple years I would call this a must play.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

Dark Souls is a PURE action/adventure Hack-n-Slash game.  Compared to Skyrim, which is a PURE RPG, Dark Souls falls short in this aspect.  Dark Souls has a touch of an RPG game in that it will let you Level your character.  THATS IT.  There is NO story.  No connection between any NPC's.  NPC's do not send you on any Quest.  You start off in this cell and from there you basically fight your way thru the entire game.  You walk into any area and you are attack for whatever reason by enemies.A PURE Rpg will give you the feel or a REASON of WHY you are in that area to begin with.  You cant pull up a MAP and look to see where the HECK are you going you just go from area to area fighting and killing.  Now, im not bashing this aspect.  Dark Souls is a very interesting game in what it offers but to call it an RPG its not.  Its a good action Hackem-up game if thats your thing.  The dying part of the game dont bother me nor the grinding.  Grinding is part of Leveling your character so i guess thats why people call this an RPG but a PURE RPG is much more than Grinding.****EDIT****I just dont understand how can an ENEMY be harder to kill than a BOSS or mini BOSS????  There is an enemy thats in the add-on chasm of abyss.  sometime he appears as a demon and this enemy is 10x harder to kill than any BOSS in the GAME.

Lerch","summary":"An OK game. Can be boring","reviewText":"For anyone who is a hardcore fan of the Ghostbusters, you don't need a review; just buy the game. You'll enjoy it regardless of any faults it may or may not have.For everyone else, approach this one with some caution.I've found the game play can be tedious and boring at times. Load time is kind of slow when you have to reload a checkpoint. And you will be reloading checkpoints given how difficult it can be to track some of the ghosts.I can't tell you how many times I've had my proton beam trained on a ghost, only to have one of the other members of the team yell at ME for crossing streams, when in reality they began firing on the enemy AFTER I did.There is no co-op option for the campaign. The only co-op options are to play in the multiplayer part of the game and it's not a complete campaign. You play one off missions with no story to them per say.Graphics are good. Some of the lip synching, both in game and in cut scenes, is off.Bringing back the original actors for voice overs? Great idea in theory. In practice, most of these people are real actors and seem to struggle to find an emotional range when simply reading lines. And yes, there are times when it feels like all they are doing is reading off of the script with little to no emotion involved. They do an OK job, but not what I had been hoping for.I find constantly switching beams for the proton pack, while novel in the beginning, also very tedious. Having to scan ghosts for the Tobin Spirit Guide? Again, a nice touch to include the guide, but the actual implementation is obnoxious. You will find that instead of playing the game in real color, you will instead spend most of your time using the PKE meter where everything appears more like one of those silly ghost shows where they have night vision setup. I don't want to play a game with a sort of creepy atmosphere not immersed in said atmosphere. What the developers strove for, a convincing and scary environment in certain situations, is rendered meaningless when you're playing the game with night vision.The game has its moments. It is definitely the best Ghostbusters video game ever released. Of course, when you look back on the video game history of the series, that isn't really all that great of an accomplishment.If you can get the game for $20 it is worth the money. If you're a fan of the franchise, just buy it no matter the price.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed.

McBeth \"PSN/XLive/Steam: DirkPittSpawn\"","summary":"Alright chums, Let's Do This","reviewText":"So it finally came out and I have to say it's a great continuation of an interesting story and more, much more.Overview:There's something for everyone in this package. The single campaign looks and plays great with quite the challenge. There are just immense areas and even enemies that you have to deal with. The coop play is very reliant upon teamwork and does it very well. The competitive even has several different options to explore, whether it be just team vs. team or team objective play, etc. The similar \"squad\"-based teams are also present.Gameplay:In addition to just MASSIVE enemies, there is also an infestion of numerous enemies all at once. It can be very overwhelming when tons of these creepy Grims burst out of pods and do a full sprint towards you. While playing you'll also notice some great cutscenes that help move the story along well in the campaign.One very positive note is that it doesn't slow down/lag during gameplay. And I will say that even though the gameplay in general is tense and quick-paced, there are moments where you're walking along alone just waiting for something to pop out at you. Or in the case of the chameleon, you'll feel it coming towards you before it appears out of no-where thanks to its \"Predator\"-like optic-camouflage.Weapons:Can't leave this one out, especially since it's an Insomniac game!There are some changes from the last game, instead of a full arsenal always at your disposal, you have two weapons only. This is preferable but can be a little nerve racking if you're running out of ammo or need extra firepower for a particular big enemy.And firepower is just at your fingertips with all the assortment of different weapons and their unique secondary fires. The handgun isn't just a handgun when using the secondary fire, even after you kill one enemy, the shot that's embedded in them can be detonated with R2, causing even more fun. Need a pulse rifle that can send out concussion blasts? You Got It. Just make sure you listen for the tone to let you know that the rifle is charged for the next fire.Sound:Speaking of tones.... The music is great; always seems to punctuate the action (suspenseful, dark/omnious). The weapons all have their original sounds in addition to some new weapons with their unique sounds.Online:There's a new feature that's nice to have. An \"Allies\" pop-up allows for you to set up clans, invite friends to your \"Party\" so that you can all be on the same team for coop or competitive play.And I have to say that the coop play is definitely my favorite. Very challenging while requiring teammates to work together as a unit to overcome objectives. There are 3 classes: soldier, medic, and spec ops (basically support/ammo). Each has their strengths and each have their unique \"Beserks\" which are like bonuses that you can activate (increased weapon damage, increased healing, decreased damaged taken) after a certain amount of experience has been gained. XP gained goes toward your individual class as well as your over-all rank (which is a combination of your single campaign, coop, and competitive play).Also, the comms work very well and are very clear.Summary:Overall this is a great title just packed with hours of gameplay. Definitely going to be enjoying this on and off line for a while, and I can already tell that each mission in the coop gameplay is going to take a while to be successful at.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2008"}

Even on easy, the designers seem to have decided tdhat you will die multiple times on each level no matter what you do, which I think is lame.Positives+ Nicely crafted environments.+ Realistic animation.+ Dark, mature story.+ Deteriorating cover keeps you moving.Negatives- Limited number of weapons.- Gameplay becomes repetitive very fast; goal for each level is pretty much the same: kill everyone.- Screen flashing effect gets annoying after awhile.- Load times are very long; up to 1 full minute at times.- Enemy shot accuracy is ridiculous.- Having to repeat each level many times (especially towards the end) can become frustrating.Overall, a good rental but you might get stuck towards the end.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0022TNO7I","description":"","reviewerName":"P. Taegel","summary":"A thrilling, violent, opera of death!","reviewText":"Uber-fun, fantastic game. Max Payne 3 is a story-driven 3rd person shooter that really focuses on the shooting. You can't scale walls or do anything fancy with the melee, but this focus is what makes the game so good.  Too often games try to bite off more than they can chew, and the result is that none of the mechanics fire on all cylinders.  Not so with MP3. You can slow down time (a la Red Dead Redemption) to make an easier time blowing guys away.  You can also dive and slow down time and shoot a bunch of people.  What results are satisfying gaming mechanics and some wicked cinematics that make you feel cooler than you probably are in reality.The multiplayer is great fun.  The bullet time in multiplayer takes some getting used to, but it's fast-paced and you get to play around in \"rookie\" levels for the first 1000 kills.  Hence, it's pretty easy to get decent kills and have fun without being crushed by all the 12-14 year olds who really ought to be scouted as drone pilots for the US Military instead of humiliating guys like me who only have a couple hours in a typical week to jump online and shoot stuff.Now for my gripes, which are few.  The AI seems instantly aware of you once you enter the room.  You can't stealth around at all.  Since MP3 isn't a stealth game, I can forgive this, but it would be better if there were some line of sight stealth mechanics built into the game.  Second, you can't blow off limbs.  Now, the game is pretty gory, but blasting off someone's head or arm or leg with a shotgun is always good for a laugh in games like this.  Third, the narrative could have been a little cleaner.  Who really needs to see another video game hard-boiled alcoholic waxing self-deprecation in an inner monologue?  Not only is it cliche, but this convention doesn't really introduce conflict or push along the story.  Hence, I found myself fruitlessly pressing the X button to skip some of the long cutscenes.  Personally, I'd like to have seen a love story.  But no one asked my opinion, oddly enough.That being said, Max Payne 3 is a must-own title for your Playstation 3.  If you're on the fence, I highly recommend you go buy it now.  Just make sure you have a few hours free, because it's really shamelessly addictive.  If you follow my advice and buy it, but decide you think the game sucks, you can write nasty comments in the space provided below.  Do not fear that your biting criticism will strike deep, throw me into hopeless despair and cause me to take it out on members of my family. In truth, I'll laugh with contempt at how lame you are not to like this game as I do.  After all, my opinion represents objective truth. However, perhaps the vitriole you write in your response may give you some measure of comfort.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2012"}

One of the characteristics of this game is that it adds even more styles of action, besides firearms and swords, to the mix. Players are free to choose your own fighting style by customizing Dante to your advantage.","reviewerName":"ps2 gamer \"star wars\"","summary":"Awesome game ,the hardest one i've ever seen !","reviewText":"At first , I wasn't sure about wether I should buy this game , because I thought it's just a boring hack n' slash game. But this game is nothing like that. It has lots of amazing action, and enough exploring and puzzle elements that render it an action adventure game , rather than a hack n' slash game.The storyline in this game is based around Dante trying to kill his evil twin brother , Vergil. A gigantic dark tower appears right near Dante's house , and Vergil is on top of it. He has some sort of sinister plan that has to do with the tower and Dante must stop him , but I won't say what it is so I won't spoil it for you.The game itself has some really amazing cutscenes .....in fact , they're probably the best cutscenes I have ever seen in a video game. They have great graphics, and they contain lots of action. you'd think that you're watching a movie !Now on to the gameplay itself . This game is the hardest game I have ever played. I'm not exaggerating. Once you lose , you have to start from the beginning of the level , unless you buy a certain item in the game that prevents that, and once you use it , you have to buy a new one , since it's not permanent. Also , the enemies and bosses in this game are EXTREMELY hard. They're all very cool , but also extremely tough , especially the bosses (which are, by the way , some of the greatest bosses i've seen in a videogame.) You'll probably break your controller more than a few times out of anger as you keep losing. I , personally , really loved the hardness in this game , as i really like tough games. However , some people might see it as a problem, so it's not very recommended to those type of people. But when you finish these hard parts in the game , it gives you a great sense of completion, and not all games do that.The combat system in this game is also great. You have 4 fighting styles in this game(you can also get 2 extra ones later) , that give much variety to the combat in the game,and every one of them grants you some special abilities. They are :1.Trickster- this style lets you dodge enemy attacks much easier than you normally do. You can do things like running on walls , dashing to the sides , etc.2.swordmaster- this enhances your ability to use melee weapons. You can do things like throw your sword at enemies, stab them with it in lightening-fast speeds, and so on. This is also my favorite style.3.Gunslinger-enhances your ability to use guns . You can do things like shoot your guns in two different directions, spin your shotgun around like a nunchuk an dfire it , etc.4.Royalguard-lets you block enemy attacks , and then release them back at them by punching them with all the energy you build up in you from their attacks.So as you can see, there is much variety to the fighting. You can pull off some amazing combos, not to mention you have many weapons , melee and long ranged alike. some of your melee weapons are a regular sword that you start out with , a pair of nunchuks with ice-powers, an electric guitar that lets you summon bats and electricity, and more. your ranged weapons will include a pair of handguns with a rapid rate of fire , a shotgun , a bazooka , and two others. Also , if you keep using a certain style , it'll eventually level up, giving you access to even more coll combos. Not to mention that you get red orbs from enemies that defeat, which can be used as money , and you can buy different items with it , enhance your guns , and buy new attacks for your weapons.All of these attributes combine to form an awesome game , that should not be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2006"}

The game isn't perfect and I have some serious gripes about the game yet it does so many cool things and it does have the labor-of-love feeling coming through but with the game getting so many high reviews and everyone ready to give it their Game of the Year awards for 2010, I'm sure my review will have some unhelpful votes thrown at me but keep in mind I really like this game and I prefer this a hell of a lot more than GTA 4 but at the same time there's some things that absolutely bug the **** out of me. If I was to base this completely on single player, I'd think it was an excellent single player and great game, but kind of familiar but if I take in the multiplayer as well my reception of the game as a whole is slightly tainted. This is one of the better games of the year for sure but I'm hoping this is a balanced review and I won't get blasted cause I won't call it anything less than perfect.Story: You take the role of John Marston, a former outlaw trying to make a better life for himself and his family. However one thing that has to change is the life of Bill Williamson who needs to be dead, pronto. Arriving off the train, John gets mortally wounded but nursed back to health by a ranch owner named Bonnie MacFarlane and from there John meets a whole host of crazy and memorable characters as he tries to bring Williamson to justice.Pretty small paragraph, no? Well that's all your getting cause the narrative is definately one of the better things of the game and the ending is really quite balls-y and really powerful. But then there's one thing that RDR does that bugs me...well two things: the first is that the story does have a good/evil dynamic where the more good natured stuff you do, the better attitudes you deal with and if you shoot random people well, imagine that reception. The problem is the cinematics and the dialogue doesn't change so if you play the most evil son-of-a-bitch the Old West has seen, you all of a sudden turn into a guy people walk over and characters that are clearly toying with you or jerking you around John still accepts it and goes along with it. The other is that the structure feels remarkably similar to GTA 4: you get on your horse/car, drive/ride to your destination while you have a conversation with your passenger/fellow rider(s), get somewhere and leave either being chased or eventually being chased and you have to fight them off. In a way, it starts to get a bit too noticeable and despite some occasional missions, it feels a bit too familiar if you've played GTA 4.Graphics: From a looks point of view, this thing's gorgeous and when you see sunsets on the horizon as you're riding slowly on your horse down the path, it's hard not to think anything but it looks almost painter-ly. Character details is really impressive, especially on faces and there's barely any load screens. However, Rockstar does do what tends to be Bethesda's problem is that making big massive games with lots of areas, detail and characters is that the performance suffers and the glitches pop up. Seeing a horse carriage literally bounce on the ground making a rumble, seeing a guy literally twirling like a tornado as he runs to cover during a shootout and it can weigh down the game. Multiplayer is also no stranger to this as I saw boxes floating in midair with whatever was on the bottom of it completely see through (and can even be shot through) and a bit of lag. From the looks you'd think the game's gorgeous but the seam's show and they're noticeable but they're not that bad.Sound/Music: Can't fault Rockstar on the audio side and the voice acting is excellent. If you can forgive Marston's frequent \"mister\"'s and \"Miss MacFarlane\"'s, everyone is really superb in their roles and there's never anyone that stands out as being outright bad. The music also has a great sound with whistling, acoustic guitar and one point I literally heard a song with words. This is a great soundtrack and worth listening to outside of the gang. Same thing with the sound design as it brings in the ambiance of what it would feel like to be on your own in the countryside from bird calls, animal sounds and distant gunfire really makes you feel you're in the environment.Gameplay: If Fallout 3 was \"Oblivion with guns\", it wouldn't be too crazy to say Red Dead Redemption is \"Grand Theft Auto in the Old West\" or \"Grand Theft Horse\". The mini-map, icons for quests (which inexplicably jump to the next quest on the other side of the map even though he just walked away from me 4 seconds ago) and the cover system makes the game feel similar to GTA but the one thing that RDR does better is a willingness to actually explore the world. I felt Liberty City disappointed me in that it wasn't like San Andreas or Vice City where I wanted to just screw around and do random stuff but GTA 4 I felt like aside from doing it for achievements, I never felt like I actually wanted to explore the city, sure I could but I never felt the urge to. Red Dead changes that and half the time I was actually searching for things I normally ignore, find places to explore and do challenges which I quite liked. It might be a bit too open country with more sand and rock than side quests but the exploration felt a lot more pronounced here.Gameplay wise there's nothing completely different than GTA aside from the better cover and shooting mechanics but the main difference is the Dead Eye which is similar to Fallout 3's VATS where pressing the Right analog slows down time allowing you for more accurate and more numerable shots where normally you couldn't. It actually works really cool but occasionally there's a couple \"shoot the hostage taker\" random events but in daytime they're fine...but at night and potentially in a thunderstorm? It's hard not to feel you'll shoot the hostage because of the darker, almost yellow-ish tint to the screen. There's also lots of challenges to complete which you can rank up, card and mini-games you can take part in such as Poker, Horseshoe and Five-Finger-Filet (the knife missing the fingers game). One thing I will lament on the game as a whole is that there's a couple of things that don't feel explained and even though the tutorial shows up, at times it feels too brief and it's hard to re-access them and on occasion it's hard to tell what certain things are required for your playthrough. For example, guy decided to go crazy in a saloon and started to shoot me and my horse yet shooting back at his buddies I get \"evil points\"...wait, what? Or when you notice a random event where 2 guys are shooting at someone running away which to me I kept thinking of one thing: is the pursuers lawmen trying to stop an escapee or 2 jerks who are harassing a civilian? Turns out it's the former which gives me evil points. Poo.Then we get down to the multiplayer in which I kept thinking of one thing: it's \"fine\", it's \"decent\" but it's not something I'd spend so much time in ranking up to. Your first trip is an automatic visit to Free Roam in which most of the time you deal with spawn campers. You can't change where you spawn, you literally spawn within a good 50 feet from where you were last killed and your icon constantly tells you you're on the map so as soon as you're dead, they ride over and shoot you, spawn, find where you are, ride over and shoot. I can understand Rockstar's idea: join some players, group up and play competitive matches online but fat chance that happening with randoms who don't shoot you on sight since you get XP if you kill a player. The gang hideouts are really fun and having the option to replay them is welcome. But then there's the competitive multiplayer which feels imbalanced and just a bit unexceptional. Spawns are laughable (I literally spawned below the stairs of the guy who just killed me, drew my gun and blew his head off), 4 shots to the face with your rank 9 gun apparently does nothing since a rank 32 gun blows your head clean off in one shot and the lack of many game modes makes this an okay multiplayer but it's not the reason why you should buy Red Dead. It's nice that it's here but I could live if it wasn't included.Red Dead Redemption is a really well-made game, glitches aside, and despite my gripes about the familiarity to Grand Theft Auto 4, the single player is really excellent but then in comes the multiplayer which completely frustrates me and I wouldn't bother with it though getting top rank for achievement makes me either suck it up and keep playing or say screw it. But the setting, story and gameplay in the single player is easily worth a playthrough. Don't know if it's my Game of the Year but it's impressive for sure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2010"}

These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough.

My husband and I spent countless hours playing this game when it first came out and still play even though it's almost a year old.First, the graphics and sound on this game are fantastic. There's so much detail. Particularly in the scene while you're riding on the gas barges and you look out on the horizon. Kind of stunning!

The trilogy couldn't have ended better.As far as game play goes, as with the first two I LOVE the co-op campaign. This is something that is sorely lacking in many games these days as most focus on multiplayer. As far as multiplayer goes, I was impressed with that as well, especially beast and horde modes. I love those two in particular because not only are they fun with one or two other friends, but they are fun with strangers as well. My husband and I were actually able to play through all 50 waves of horde with two other people online one night!The game was difficult, enough so that we actually had to get a third person to join us for a couple of chapters to beat it on insane.

Would recommend without a doubt.EDIT: I've been achievement hunting and gave this game a thorough second look. I'm changing my rating to a 5 from a 4. Between arcade, versus, and horde this game really does set itself apart from the other games in the series. It never ceases to be a challenge, and maintains form as something I really enjoy plodding through.First, I tried the campaign on insane after finally trying the end all be all gears difficulty on gears: judgement, which was honestly a lot cheaper in how it kills you when it does (A LOT of frags). The story is still engaging to me, the game play is every bit as polished as any you could mention, and beating it was honestly satisfying. It wasn't miserable, and it wasn't easy. It was a firm lesson in strategy and pacing yourself. Great campaign, and arcade mode gives that little bit of competitive edge when playing with friends to really push it over the edge into my top 5 all time favorites.Next thing I tried was versus, where the pace is obviously a bit faster. Granted, there is a firm belief that cheap shotgun blasts to unaware opponents is a skill move, and I'm going to find that to be ridiculous in any game that has that dimension, but it isn't impossible to combat. Otherwise, the versus is engaging and it does seem fairly well balanced. There's not a lot of excessive explosives, there's always a chance of surviving your encounter. It's just a matter of figuring out what it is and if you can come away with a kill in the process. Good stuff.Then I tried horde, which I can only compare to firefight from halo. Waves of enemies that become increasingly difficult through rounds. The only thing about this that I find annoying is leveling up your ability to do things like building barriers  or turrets. Obviously this is overcome with a bit of time, but I'm not a fan of giving advantages to players because they played a lot. Even playing fields are the basis of competition. It's a bit ridiculous when you're in a game with someone who pulls out a rocket baring silverback when you're in there trying to lancer a platoon of heavily health boosted grenadiers. Really cod, and not a fan.Last I tried beast mode, which is honestly just tacked on in my opinion. It can be fun to run around as a berserker or corpser, but for the most part, if I play much more of this variant, it'll be for instagib melee mutator and medals if I wind up caring to go for seriously 3.0.All in all, this game is awesome, and if you're into aggressive shooters this is one you shouldn't miss out on. If you're finding it too hard, give it some time, because it's worth it to pick up a little skill in this game. It's made me stronger in the other shooters I play between the recoil and strategy involved. Don't pass on the retro, and learn to play tag.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}

McKenzie","summary":"Go For The Game-of-the-Year","reviewText":"There's really not more I can say about the overall \"Batman: Arkham Asylum\" experience that hasn't been said before.  Instead, I'll do some easy Q&A; points for this \"Game-of-the-Year\" release.IS THE GAME-OF-THE-YEAR RELEASE BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL?---Absolutely, no question about it!  You get extra content, and nothing is removed or changed from the original Story, Challenges, or Trophies.HOW'S THE JOKER IN THE CHALLENGES (PS3 EXCLUSIVE)?---The Joker is a downloadable from PSN, and honestly, I think this is reason enough to choose the PS3 version before the 360 or PC releases.  Even if those versions have better graphics or audio (which I don't think they do), The Joker is very fun to use in the Challenges.  The Freeflow Combat Challenges are pretty much the same (same controls, different-looking moves), but the Invisible Predator ones really play differently.  Instead of having Batman's gadgets, you're forced to complete these Challenges with a different mindset of how to win.  Simply put, they're really fun if you dig the core gameplay from the Story.HOW ARE THE EXTRA CHALLENGES FROM THIS \"GAME-OF-THE-YEAR\" DISC?---The disc only gives you 4 new ones, but they're still very fun:* 1 more Invisible Predator* 1 more Freeflow Combat.* An endless Challenge against Arkham inmates* A gauntlet against Scarecrow's skeletons where ONE HIT ends the skirmish.There are a few more to download from the PSN Store.  Basically, if you loved the Challenges in the original disc, these are some extra good ones.  One word of caution, the medals you earn from these Extras doesn't assist you with Trophies, in case you're into those.HOW WILL TROPHIES BE AFFECTED?---I'm not sure if the Extra Content affects the 100% Completion Trophy, but it doesn't seem to help you with the challenge medal Trophies, though.  The Joker's Challenges don't have medals or Trophies, either.  Basically, the list of Trophies is the exact same as the 2009 disc, and all can be completed without going online.HOW'S THE 3D?---Before I get into this topic, let me emphasize this more than anything else: As of this review, the \"Game-of-the-Year\" disc costs the same as the original 2009 disc.  The 3D is 100% optional, and you're not paying extra for it, anyway.  That being said, I didn't think it's anything special.  Maybe it's my television (I use a Vizio HD), maybe it was the lighting in my room (I kept it dim), maybe it was my eyes (I tried prescription glasses on AND off)...I don't know why I didn't like it.  I enjoy 3D movies in the theatre, so I'm not sure what to tell you.  Bottom Line: Don't buy this for the 3D.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION?---If you already own this game, I would try to get this disc for a very cheap price.  It's not that huge of an upgrade.  But if you haven't adventured through \"Arkham Asylum\" yet, then what the heck are you waiting for?  Batman fans should own this!  Comic book fans should own this!  Every video gamer needs to try this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00004TSXC","reviewerName":"Andrew C.","summary":"Surprisingly mediocre single-player campaign","reviewText":"This review is based solely on my experience with the single-player campaign of Neverwinter Nights.  Thus, I can't comment on the on-line capacity of the game.  I bought this game thinking that it was the successor of Bioware's excellent Baldur's Gate series, which are among my all-time favorite video games.  In a few ways it does improve upon these earlier masterpieces, but in many more ways it proved to be an inferior gaming experience.  Unless you have the time and patience to explore this game's on-line side, don't bother getting it.  There are many better computer roleplaying games out there (e.g., Morrowind, Baldur's Gate, Diablo 2, etc.).Gameplay: This is a D&D-style; fantasy adventure that Bioware has made a reputation for presenting well.  You create a character at the beginning and build him/her up with experience points during a 70-80 hour main quest.  The basic idea is similar to other such games, but the implementation here is unexciting.  First, this is a single-character game in which you don't have a party.  You can hire a mercenary, but for the most part you are on your own.  It makes for a rather uninteresting experience, since your hired hand does not have much of a personality and specializes primarily in poor pathfinding and suicidal behavior while in combat.  Unlike great games by Bioware such as Baldur's Gate and Knights of the Old Republic, you virtually have no control over your mercenary, who is often a liability.Another problem with the game is its structure.  It is largely comprised of dungeon crawl after dungeon crawl after dungeon crawl.  A few of the dungeons are well done and memorable, and the game does pack in an awful lot of monsters.  But the experience is rather claustrophobic insofar as your adventures are boxed into four chapters in which you simply explore a town, its countryside, and underground areas.  Unlike Baldur's Gate, you can't revisit towns that were in previous chapters, and there is really no reason to since they are rather generic in feel.The story itself is not a bad one, but is full of cliches and rather predictable.  You can take the noble good-guy route or be an outright villain, but the main story will unfold in the same way.  The main deficiency with the single-player campaign is the almost utter lack of connection that you feel with your character and the other NPCs you'll encounter.  There is none of the banter, bickering, and cameraderie that made the characters so memorable in Baldur's Gate.  Here, your mercenary has no stories to tell and even main characters like Aribeth and Aarin Gend are just there to push the story alone.Perhaps even more distressing is how unstable this game was on my computer.  I had the 1.23 patch and it crashed to desktop about every 30 minutes.  The current patch (1.65) is available at Bioware's website, but it's 66MB!  If you have a dial-up internet connection like me, you know what that means (hours of waiting to download).  It's really a shame that Bioware has fallen into the pattern of other developers and has begun releasing games that still have technical issues (I had similar crash problems with Knights of the Old Republic, but the Baldur's Gate games were models of stability).  I hope that they avoid this with Neverwinter Nights 2.Graphics: The game looks good, but not great.  Graphics are largely an evolutionary improvement over Baldur's Gate.  There are a few interesting changes, such as more combat moves, spell effects, and so forth. You can zoom the camera in close to the action, but things get blocky looking.  Those who do use the Aurora toolset that comes with the game should have a lot to choose from, though this game is not the best looking RPG available.Sounds: The music was good and set the atmosphere.  Voice acting was hit-and-miss, with the whiny main character, Aribeth, being the worst offender.  Overall, the sounds in the game served their purpose, but didn't rescue the otherwise mediocre plot or excuse the lack of real character development.Replay/value: Since I don't play games on-line or have an interest in downloading mods by others, Neverwinter Nights had a short shelf-life for me.  Due to the ho-hum story, bland characters, and crashing, I won't be rushing out to buy Neverwinter Nights 2.  If you like dungeon crawling for dungeon crawling's sake and haven't played some truly extraordinary games like Morrowind or Baldur's Gate, then this game might be worth a try (be sure to get the latest patch).  Otherwise, skip this one, since it doesn't begin to measure up to the high standards previously set by Bioware.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2005"}

So, to keep it short, I am going to describe in a short manner why NWN is an excellent game.First off, any fan of D&D; will be familiar with the rules of this game and how HP and attacks and ect. are affected in this game. The rules are based off of the tabletop D&D; games. It gives the game a life of its own.Secondly, the graphics in this game are stunning. The game is created in a completely interactive, 3d environment, where you can go almost anywhere (and who knows how many more things you can explore in areas of the past when you level up), you can talk to ANYONE, and never does the same thing happen twice! I also think its excellent how you can be a theif and steal things and be a criminal, while fighting bad dudes. It gives you such realistic characters. Now you can feel like you are living the life of the dwarf, half orc, ect. (i will get into detail about character customization next).Characters are extremely customizable and you are able to get as close as to changing the type of beard your person may wear. You can choose to have a male or female, choose Human, dwarf, elf, half orc, ect., and as classes you can choose many, including fighter, magician, paladin, archer, ect.There are MANY items you can buy and pickup throughout the game. The armor can cover your face, shoulders, body, hands, legs, and feet. There are many different potions for all types of uses, including healing. Gems, stones, jewels, whatever you want to call them, there are lots of them out there to optimize your weapons and armor.The story is superb in NWN. The town of Neverwinter holds many mystical creatures within its training center within the core of the city. Unknown enemies attack the academy, slaying everything and everyone in its path, until the creatures are stolen. These creatures are very important to the city of Neverwinter, and you, being a highly and unusually tallented trainee at the academy are chosen to protcect the city of Neverwinter, get back the creatures at all costs, and find out who has done this attack. After that, twists and turns in the story foreshadow the very incredible and unexpecting ending.The level editor is also convenient, alowing you to make complex levels and edit them without having any knowledge in programming, or even how levels are supposed to work. If you know how to basically work Windows, can type in Word, Copy and Paste things from Paint to a Microsoft Front Page document, then you can definetely make a work of art without struggling to figure anything out. Everything is simple and that is how I like it!To close, this game is the one of my favorite RPGs ever, and it kicks all other games' butts from this year or last year. Good bye Mr. Tedium in Diablo 2! Cya Mrs. Simplicity from Dungeon Siege! Here comes King Awesome from NEVERWINTER NIGHTS!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00GV4V8XC","description":"","reviewerName":"ChibiNeko \"Sooo many books, so little time!\"","summary":"Pretty fun, playable by a wide variety of gamers","reviewText":"Part of the reason I love turn based games is because my reflexes stink. I can play well up to a certain level in many fighting games, but often have to get someone to beat the game for me when it comes to the final boss, as is usually the case with the 3DS Zelda game that came out recently. What I'm happy to say is that Bravely Default has three settings, one of which is easy- so easy that you could probably set a very inexperienced gamer on this and they'd be able to complete this with little problem.The story of this game is rather nice, but I'll admit that it's not sitting at the top of my \"best storyline ever\" list. It's high up there, partially because the voice acting is rather nice, but those spots tend to be held by the first two Golden Sun games and the Zelda games. Still, it's pretty fun and I can find myself getting rather drawn up into the suspense. I've cheated a little and looked up the game's final story so I knew one of the big twists early on. However looking the story up also freed me up to find some of the little details people have pointed out that I would have otherwise missed, such as Airy's wings supposedly changing depending on which world you're in. It's the little details like this that really impressed me.Game play is nice, although I'll warn you that if you're going to play on easy and want to be the type of completionist that maxes out each job, that's going to take a pretty long time. I haven't played on the more difficult levels yet, but I imagine that it'd take a fairly long time regardless of which level you're playing at. It's not a necessity to do this, but it does pay off if you max out all of the jobs and move into freelancer mode, where you get a boost for each mastered job. Controls are fairly easy to learn and navigate, although it did take me a little while to get my bearings in all of the sub menus.Now as far as the infamous sleep points go... I will say that I hate that they exist because I dislike the idea of these types of microtransactions in a game people have already paid for. I have no problem with buying extra levels ala Fire Emblem, as they expand the gameplay. These? They do nothing except give you an extra attack. They're handy, but not necessary to really beat or win the game. You can collect them for each 8 hours of time that you leave the game running on your DS in sleep mode. You'll probably want to do this often, as you'll have to leave the game running to get the Norende shops built. They won't build if your game isn't running, which I view as a pretty irritating aspect. This means that you either have to tag a lot of people who have played the game or the demo (it's been slow going for me) and try to level the shops up as quickly as possible or you have to turn the game off and have it take a lot longer to level up the shops. Upgrading the village isn't necessary, but it does give you a lot of bonuses. It's just a little irritating in what's otherwise a fairly good game.Overall I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes turn based RPGs or Final Fantasy in general. (Oh yes, this is a FF game, although it doesn't outright state that it is.) An extra bonus is that the game comes subtitled in various different languages, which will undoubtedly be fairly handy for all of our non-Japanese or English speaking fellow gamers.UPDATE:I'm almost finished with the game and I have to say that my overall opinion is the same. I do think that the game is fun, but the issues with this are still pretty clear. I grinded pretty hard and managed to level up all of my characters' jobs, but I'll be honest in that at times it wasn't very fun. A good way around this is to level up Norende as quickly as possible and buy one of the accessories that allows you to get double EXP and JP- but at the expense of gaining any money. Of course there's an accessory that will allow you to do the opposite. Pairing them together will not give you anything, unfortunately.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2014"}

When I heard it was an rpg I laughed at the thought of Capcom attempting one. Then I saw footage of characters scaling dragons in-flight and made a beeline to Amazon.Although the story and characters aren't particularly interesting, the game is truly amazing. The combat is extremely exhilarating and rivals/surpasses the greatest of 3rd person action games. There are 9 classes to choose from and switching them is extremely easy should you decide that sorcery, swordplay, etc. is not for you. There is also a pawn system that has you creating and raising a companion who can also be used and rated by other players online.Best of all (for me) is the customization. This game has one of the best, most extensive and satisfying character creation system I've ever used in a game. I know this will sound alarming to some and may even warrant a friendly visit from the FBI, but my character was a 12 year old girl. Scaling 20 foot cyclops to stab them in their eye, clinging to dragons mid-flight Beowulf style, skillfully dispatching an entire clan of bandits with string hooks and firecrackers, drop kicking orcs in the face, all as a 12 year old girl is as ridiculous as it is fun.I highly recommend this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000R0URCE","reviewerName":"Morgan Cahall \"so many books so little time\"","summary":"The force is occasionally unleashed, other than that just hit things a lot","reviewText":"Story: The story in this game is actually entertaining and about the only reason I found to keep wanting to play through all the nonsense levels. The player takes on the role of Star Killer. A \"secret\" assassin that Darth Vader kidnapped (after killing his father) as a young child and trained him in the ways of the force to help Vader overthrow the emperor.  Of course since this is a star wars cannon (its part of the actual star wars universe i.e. George Lucas approved.) story our plucky anti-hero eventually starts to think for himself and that's when things start to kick into high gear. Story wise anyway. I'm not going to spoil the story for those who play the game or read the book (I'd say read the book even though I haven't had a chance yet.). Suffice to say that it does fill in some gaps and there are some \"so that's why that was like that moments\" along with some of the star wars twist and turns that are expected. Now on to the actual (when are the going to stop beating poor star wars to death) game play.-----------------------------(some spoilers)To start off any level that generally lets you run around and hit things, smash  things, fry things or some combination of the above is fun. What is not fun is having the above interrupted by annoying button sequences and go break /move that thing  to open this door so I can go fight another annoying boss that involves more button sequences.  In my opinion if they could go back and rewrite this game as a open world /sand box game (ala mercenaries 1 or along the lines of mass effect) and give me the option of figuring out how to recruit forces against the emperor and cause merry havoc along the way this would have been a much better game . Or on the other hand make it so I could play like a actual assassin and I don't know, be able to do things like the mind trick or make myself invisible or make the bad guys shoot each other. Instead the developer came up with this half polished hack and bash game that showed me occasional glimpses of what could have been.  I guess the reason I'm irritated with this game is because while I was playing it there were points where everything clicked and I actually felt like I was playing a scene out of a Star Wars movie about a conflicted dark side assassin and then I would run into one of the many bugs or game play issues and go \"why?\". On the bug front, there are many. I only ran into a few show stoppers that made me get up and restart my console. The majority are what a good QA run would have caught and are generally along the lines of clunky controls and bad hit detection. The clunky controls were obvious in the first level. Trying to actually pickup anything and aim it and throw it while dodging laser fire is darn near impossible. For some reason it was decided that the camera should lock onto what your throwing and not what you are throwing it at. In my experience that translated into forgetting about aiming and just turning yourself into a force powered tornado. Throw enough stuff and you'll hit something. Most of the bugs I ran into were the ones where the game forgot you should have died (fell off the bridge on the way to rescue Juno and the silly game just let me walk around in the flames for two minutes before I restarted the level) and the ones where for some reason I just lost control of the character and stood there until a enemy got done killing me. Also there are a lot of unnecessary (imo)button sequences in just about every mini boss and end level boss and a really *special* one on the bring down the star destroyer level. Other than that if you can slog through all the nonsense and power up your character the game does warrant a play through (or two) just to find the collectibles and unlock everything. Too sum up this is one of those games that could have been great if it hadn't been rushed out the door. There is a good game under all of the problems that came from the rush job that was done. It just takes till the second play through to see what could have been (unfortunately the second play through doesn't magically get rid of all the bugs) and hopefully if Mr. StarKiller makes it to a second game Lucas arts might skip the doughnuts and coffee instead of skipping the  QA. Would recommend to anyone who likes Star wars and action/hack an slash games with the warning that it does take at least till the second play through to really get to the meat of the combat system. M.a.cStory: A great (if a little predictable) story set before the original story begins.Graphics: Good. A little choppy hear and there. Nothing major that I came acrossGamePlay: Above average. It is entertaining while you can run around and cause chaos, but some levels are broken up with annoying puzzles and button sequences.Camera/control: Control can be a bit wonky. Aiming is an after thought and the auto target doesn't always work. The camera didn't cause me any problems.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2009"}
{"product_name":"B004CD9X2C","description":"","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"One of the better adventure platformers out of this generation!","reviewText":"There's a movement in gaming recently that tries to push \"disturbing subject matter\" with a bland array of dull colors and graphics meant to incite a sense of gritty realism. This has gone on so long we may have forgotten a game can have bright lush surroundings and  flamboyant cartoon-like characters while still addressing deeper mature issues.First an foremost Alice: Madness returns is an old school plat former. In the vein of titles such as Mario 64, and  Kameo you will do a lot of jumping, sliding, lever pulling, and even shrinking to traverse areas that are a little larger than those found in more straightforward action romps such as Lollipop Chainsaw. If you get queasy  around pitfalls and high  heights Alice: Madness returns will definitely pour on the pressure and elevate your pulse!  The game's effortless ability to induce a sense of panicky vertigo is admirable though there were moments I thought certain scenarios with their unforgiving relentless barrage of fast moving and disappearing floating foot-rests dragged on to the point of excess tedium.The enemies in A:MR are not pushovers either. Running in hacking & slashing will get you killed often. Whether you are fighting giant cannon totting crabs, armored zombie card solders, samurai wasps, spectral sailors, giant dollies, or hulking fireball tossing gooey tar abominations adorned with multiple porcelain baby heads , chances are you will have to stun them or knock them over with one weapon before finishing them off with another.Luckily A:MR gives you plenty of destructive implements. The hobby horse is akin to a heavy mace. It can stun enemies and break through weakened obstructions. The pepper grinder is a machine gun. \"Rabbit bombs\" explode when prompted to by a stop watch. Likewise they can temporarily be applied on weight sensitive tiles to buy Alice precious seconds to traverse her terrain. The vorpal blade is a fast moving knife and the tea kettle packs the punch of a makeshift grenade launcher. All these can be upgraded with teeth you find throughout your journey.It's true the first Alice game had more weapons but the sequel makes up for it with a few nice added incentives. Alice can now break down into butterflies and blur in any direction to evade attacks. She can shrink in order to travel through small key-holes or to see details her big-self would otherwise miss. Additionally Alice has nice double jump and float maneuvers to make the plat forming just a tad less hectic. If you're still not \"sold\" there's also \"hysteria mode\" that transforms Alice into a creepier version of the white-queen when her health is low. Attacks do more damage during this burst of adrenaline and psychotic rage but Alice's hysteria gauge will tick down swiftly to prevent confrontations from becoming a complete cakewalk.Of course next up are the graphics. Let me get something off my chest right now. A little abrupt pop in texturing never bothered me much.  It's no secret the Unreal 3 engine has issues with this sort of thing but when everything is so beautiful to look at as it is in A: MR I could care less. Each area has a theme and they all \"shift\" between whimsical and nostalgic to macabre and psychologically twisted. It's ironic A:MR surprised me more with its' environmental transitions than the latest Silent Hill games. I could rarely predict \"when\" the world around me would suddenly flip upside down. Whoever scripted these events that gradually descended into complete insanity and pandemonium should be applauded!A gripe some people may have is a lack of boss battles up until the very end of the game. However, for me the problem is we \"expect\" these over-the-top encounters and because of this it breaks the immersion. At least for me each place in wonderland  was more unpredictable and more suspenseful because it lacked the usual hulking monstrosities guarding each exit point to the next stage. The only certainties we have are there will be more monsters to fight and more puzzles to solve. Beyond that we're very much left in the dark and we are completely clueless as to \"when\" a chapter will officially wrap itself up. This lent itself to the \"horror atmosphere\" of A:MR quite nicely. Whether or not it was a deliberate design choice or was due to lack of funding is anyone's guess.The music is fantastic! Each track varies to fit the mood of each place ant there's a nice range amongst creepy industrial compositions, melancholy oriental tunes, and fittingly sinister violin pieces. The composer reminds me a bit of Akira Yamaoka and I mean that in the most flattering way imaginable!However, there are a few qualms that pop up. First of all, A:MR is rife with puzzles and mini games. While most of these can be skipped there are certain ones that cannot. In truth many of these diversions are refreshingly artistic with old-school arcade conventions! The problem is not that they exist but rather how often certain ones are repeated. It gets to the point they feel like padding as opposed to well thought out side quests.Secondly, both the camera and some extra tough plat-forming segments will conspire against the fun you're having. Neither quibble is so blatantly bad it leaves the game broken but they are noticeable all the same.In the end I found Alice's return to wonderland to be an adventure worth undertaking. Much of the story continues the events of its' predecessor but because it's supposed to be a mystery my lips are sealed! If you're tired of military fpses, macho brochismo derp-a-herping, and soulless dungeon loot acquisition, A:MR may refresh that retro-gamer part of your inner psyche which has been neglected far too long!Pros+ Many secrets to find+ Game plus mode+Compelling story with a mystery thriller slant to it+ Adult material handled with tasteful subtlety+ Gorgeous sprawling areas with imaginative scenery+ Fantastic sound track+ Enemies require strategy to beat+ Challenging enough to give you a sense of accomplishment after you see the credits roll+ First Alice game included as a free download if you buy Maness Returns brand new.+ Inexpensive dlc that's actually helpful+Alice has good motivations as a protagonist and her cause is a noble one worth fighting for+It's delightful to stomp around the Red Queen's domain as \"Godzilla Alice\".Cons-Certain mini games are repeated too many times-Sometimes the camera goes wonky and makes a few platforming segments and a few battles more frustrating than they should be- Other gamers maybe distraught there's only one actual boss in the whole game-Play each chapter after an extensive cool-down break lest you end up punching your controller and shouting obscenities at your television screen-Texture blur and texture pop-in issues rear their ugly heads- The lock-on targeting feature is easy to understand but difficult to masterFor you if: If you're a psychology buff who loves things laid out to you in fanciful metaphor you'll adore A:MR. Likewise if you count Psychonauts, Kameo, Mario 64, and Silent Hill amongst your favorite games then A:MR should find its' way to your collection as soon as possible! A:MR is also for the old-school-fools  who yearn for a challenge and who like to be rewarded for exploring off the beaten path!Not for you if: If you're afraid of heights, prefer slaying enemies over jumping around on moving platforms,  get nauseated upon being exposed to re-imaginings of famous literature, and think Lewis Carroll was a talentless hack you should steer clear of this one! Admittedly A:MR is also on the grim and serious side so if you want a gaming experience with a sense of humor you will not find any \"comedy gold\" here. Certain people may also be offended by the content in A:MR. There are suggestive themes centered around brainwashing, prostitution, rape, and child slave labor.Closing thoughtsAt a further date I'd like to research on why we are so enamored with completely vilifying the Victorian era. Even self professed fans of this era always portray it as a grim hopeless place rife with classicism, misogyny, dirty back allies, serial killers, rapists, pedophiles, children slave labor, witch hunts, repressed sexuality, courtroom corruption, and billowing dark smoke spewing forth from monstrous trains and industrial factories.  While I'm sure Victorian England had these problems to some degree it seems to be we only focus on that negative side of the equation. Heck, if I were to dwell only on modern society's \"bad qualities\" we'd be very much \"Neo-Victorian\" according to the works of Tim Burton and Zack Snyder.However, one thing I like about Alice:MR is it's not steeped in complete pessimism, cynicism, and nihilism. Unlike say \"Sucker Punch\" that tries to pass itself off as female empowerment yet has a \"wtf ending\" that completely contradicts with its` initially positive message, Alice's conclusion is one that is satisfactory where true justice prevails. Unlike Tim Burton's recent tamer-than-expected trip back to Wonderland McGee's version isn't afraid to hold back nor does it pull any punches. (Though admittedly I enjoyed Burton's Through The Looking Glass adaptation for what it was. We all knew going into the theatres Disney wasn't going to let the man make it rated \"R\". )It's also refreshing Alice can lay down the hurt in attire that's a touch more modest and befitting than a string bikini or a burlesque gothic Lolita outfit that`s two sizes too small. While I'm not against sexy titillation and I do not get morally outraged by its' presence , I do respect game developers who manage to make their leading heroine \"pretty\" without showing off excess amounts of her skin.When it comes to steam-punk Victorian fiction American McGee and Spicy horse really nailed it for me. I'd love to see Alice get a third game in her series! Hopefully the sales figures for A:MR were not completely abysmal!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-05-2012"}

To give you an idea of some of my other favorites (because &#34;good&#34; is subjective) they are Diablo 2 with Lord of Destruction expansion pack, the entire Half-life series including Episodes and side games such as Blue Shift, the entire Quake series, now Borderlands. I've played through once now with the Roland character and it was such a blast, I can't wait to get a second character started.

Aside from the Start and Select buttons, all of the functions are analog for greater control, a wider variety of operations, and a more compelling interactive experience.

{"product_name":"B000A0EFJC","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Great rental","reviewText":"As has been discussed since the game King Kong was announced, Peter Jackson approached Michel Ancel to create this game due to his work on one of my favorite games, Beyond Good and Evil.  When I heard the Michel Ancel was working on a high profile game, I jumped at the chance to play it.  This was one of the first Xbox 360 games I purchased and the second I beat.One thing Michel Ancel is extraodinarily good at doing is creating a living world, populated with rich characters and terrific scenery.  He proved this in Beyond Good and Evil, giving various different gameplay functions to mess around with, as well as terrific characters that could bring a smile to your face.  King Kong continues this and gives us a fully realized Skull Island as our playground.  Ancel took away any hint of an interface.  There's no life, ammo, or aiming device.  Its all natural and you have to rely on vocal cues about the ammo, realize that one or two bites from a T-rex is going to kill you and estimate on how you throw your spears.At first I was worried about the lack of aiming target, but the game compensates for this by being pretty open.  Hitting a target really isn't too difficult as long as you are aiming in the general area.  Playing in first person really helps get you in the shoes of the protagonist, and hearing the terrifying roar of a T-rex (or V-Rex as they are called in this game, to which I say, WTF?) behind you and knowing that he's there but knowing also that if you stop to look you will be dead really helps sink in this feeling.  Its a survival of the fittest and you had better keep your wits about you.Graphically, the game is beautiful.  The textures in the land really help present an island teeming with life.  The enemies are done pretty well over-all.  One of the problems with the current form of normal mapping is that sometimes things can look shiny or slimy.  This is duly noticeable in the hair of people.  Naomi Watt's character's hair looks shiny and slimy instead of natural.  The art direction is stunning too which helps cover-up any graphical short-comings there maybe.The audio is stunning as well.  The voice actors from the movie reprise their roles and unlike some movie video games, it doesn't sound like the actors are just talking into a mic to get paid.  The screams, the bit of dialogue there is, it all fits into a nice package surrounded by terrific dinosaur sounds, ambient music and a terrific score.  The only part of the audio that became annoying to me was when you are seriously injured.  Hearing the angels choir became annoying after awhile.Playing as Kong is a delight, mostly.  Instead of making it difficult, the game-developers wanted to give players a sense of strength and reckless abandon that you don't have playing as a human.  And they succeed.  Kong is vicious, you don't have to worry about timing anything or about hiding.  Charge in there, destroy things, climb on walls, jump from ledge to ledge, break T-Rex's mouths open.  Its all there, easy to pull off, and makes playing as Kong a joy instead of a chore.Once you get off Skull Island is where the game lost a little.  It felt as if New York wasn't as developed as it could be and it was over in about 10 minutes.  Pretty much a let down but I'm sure that it was done this way to keep any surprises from the movie leaking out.Now, as great as this game is, there is a major problem.  Its damn short.  It took me about 5-6 hours to play it.  Since its an incredibly linear video game with no room for exploration, you pretty much have no choice but play it quickly.  It is a visually stimulating and exciting journey, but a very quick one.  In fact, I don't know if I can justify the $60 price tag.  Its a game that begs to be played and you can get it down in one weekend without realizing it.Michel Ancel succeeds in creating another exciting game.  If it weren't in such a hurry to get out before the movie, maybe it could have been a bit more flushed out.  As it is, the game is a terrific way to spend 6 hours of your life.  But, as to the $60 out of your pocket, that's debatable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2005"}

Having said that, Dead Space (the first one) is pretty much a perfect game.  What made it so awesome is also what makes DS2 not quite as fun.  The original scared the crap out of you because you never knew what was going to jump out at you, or what kind of bad guys were just around the corner.  In this sequel, the surprise factor is lacking a bit because you kind of know what to expect.  There aren't many new monsters or new scenarios that really impressed me.  I also agree with the other people who said that it was frustrating at times when the enemies just seemed to keep coming without end.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a very good game (I did give it 4 stars), but I wish I would have waited a couple of months for the price to come down.  It's just not nearly as good as the original, and I expected it to be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2011"}

Bakehorn","summary":"The Saints come marching onto Xbox 360","reviewText":"Grand Theft Auto, like it or not, should be credited as one of the most important video games in the last decade. It created a genre, reinvented several others, and for better and worse put video games out in front of a bigger audience than ever before. Not the first developer to attempt to imitate this formula, the Champaign, Illinois-based Volition has created Saint's Row, another game with high hopes of giving Rockstar's bad-mouthed baby a run for its money. It does this better than any game before it and ends up as one of the best titles on the Xbox 360.So many sandbox games have been done before and one might wonder just what Saint's Row does to be unique. What's new here that wasn't in Grand Theft Auto, True Crime, Driver or The Godfather? Well, fundamentally, nothing. You've driven cars, done drive-bys, taken out gangs, run over pedestrians, and rode shotgun-why do it all again in a $60 Xbox 360 game? Well, despite the fact that Saint's Row takes you down several familiar roads, it does everything Grand Theft Auto and its imitators did, but a lot better.Saint's Row throws you into a city called Stilwater. In the wrong place at the wrong time, you're the sole survivor of a brutal gang scuffle. You're rescued by Julius, the leader of the Saints, a lesser-known gang in Stilwater. With nothing else to do, you embark on a bloody journey with the Saints to claim Stilwater as their own. It's an all-out territory war between the business-savvy Vice Kings, the gearhead Westside Rollerz, and the drug-dealing Carnales.Saint's Row has a story that's worth listening to. The different lieutenants of the Saints are all colorful characters indeed, and their enemies for each gang are equally interesting. The story isn't an all-out win for anyone, with tragic losses, betrayals, and more for each warring faction. An interesting choice was to keep the main character silent except for a few interesting times throughout the violent campaign-and when the man finally talks, it's always something that'll catch you off-guard. I especially enjoyed his quip during the final Vice Kings mission.Before I get to the open-world things you can find in Saint's Row, I'll explain the mission structure. Unlike other games, where completing story-based missions allows you to continue onto more missions, Saint's Row forces you to earn respect points. These points are a reward earned by \"spreading the word\" and causing havoc throughout Stilwater in the name of the Saints. This is done by taking part in various Activities, like playing the pimp in \"Snatch,\" the chauffeur in \"Escort,\" shooting everything in sight in \"Mayhem,\" or slowly taking out targets in \"Hitman.\" Once enough respect points are earned, the player can continue through the story. Not only does this system nudge the player to explore Stilwater and play the game at a less-focused, slower pace, it allows the player to see all of the different gameplay concepts found in the game.As I mentioned, Saint's Row is a story about a territory war, so a large percentage of your time will be devoted to earning 36 different sectors in Stilwater and defending them from the three opposing gangs. These territories are unlocked naturally throughout each gang's storyline, so you'll take over the west side of Stilwater before you're done with the Rollerz, win the south while fighting the Carnales, and raise your flags in the downtown area during your conquest against the Vice Kings. After winning territories, you'll occasionally have to defend them against the old owners. This is done in a way that seems random, so sometimes you'll be cruising along and receive an in-game message that your territory is being attacked. It's not mandatory to fight back for the territory, but it helps greatly when you have to drive through that territory and you don't have to worry about being shot at.On top of the game's 36 story-based missions and the 36 territories, there are Stronghold missions that also help in the territory take-over. When you've earned additional respect points, you'll sometimes be able to take over an enemy Stronghold. Stronghold missions, alongside the Activities, are my favorite part of Saint's Row. These are generally all-out assaults on an enemy base that is filled to the brim with angry defenders armed with bigger guns. There are some Stronghold missions that play things differently. For example, while taking over one Carnales Stronghold, you'll do a little demolition by planting bombs throughout a factory. Sadly, Stronghold missions don't come around as often as I'd have hoped-I would have loved to see a Stronghold in every single sector of the city.I can't go much longer without crediting Volition for giving Saint's Row a typical first-person shooter control scheme. Unlike the abysmal \"lock-on and shoot\" style of Grand Theft Auto, Saint's Row plays very smoothly in every way. Running around and aiming your weapons are both controlled by the analog sticks, and there isn't even a lock-on button to be found. If you're a fan of first-person shooters (if you've got an Xbox 360, you probably are), you'll feel right at home with this style. Fortunately, shooting isn't the only thing that's really easy to do. The cars in Saint's Row all feel very stable and controllable, which I strongly prefer to the buck-wild vehicles found in Grand Theft Auto. It doesn't matter if you're driving an old beater, a high-end sports car, or a delivery truck, the controls never become a frustrating issue. That's more than Grand Theft Auto could ever claim.There are some gameplay touches that fans of this genre should be very happy with. Volition made this a peoples' game by toning down the backtracking and retracing of the steps-if you're taken out in a mission, you have the option to restart the mission from its beginning with everything you had prior to the mission. This is a simple and small touch, but it's one that I'm personally very fond of when I think back to Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and I remember driving for several combined hours to retry missions at their starting point. Also, throughout the game, there are a ton of save points. Capturing an enemy stronghold or crib will spawn another save point location, so by the end of the game, there will be more than two dozen save points across the city. Add the ability to save anywhere on the fly, and you've got a very easily accessible game.Saint's Row runs on all four cylinders in terms of presentation. The visuals are fantastic, spare for a few genre-familiar problems (pop-up, bad draw distance, etc.). The overall look of the game is very bright and colorful, giving a rather comical appearance to a very brutal game. There are so many little touches that make this game look smooth. For example, your characters will hop into the seats of a convertible rather than open the doors to slowly get in. The particle effects and physics engine are definitely the highlights, though. After blowing up cars, you're treated to some of the best explosions ever seen in video games. Don't gawk too long, though, because the debris will eventually come crashing down, crush your body, and then burn it to a crisp if you manage to survive!The sound is fantastic in every way. The radio stations don't rival those of Grand Theft Auto but they're still entertaining. The sound effects are great as well. But what has to be credited the most is the dialogue. Saint's Row features the most ridiculous but excellent dialogue I've seen from a game like this. There are a few too many f- and n-bombs for my taste, but in the actual story scenes, the dialogue is believable and well-done. Some of the other dialogue is so raunchy that you'll definitely want to keep any kids away. During some of the Escort Activity missions, I heard the most perverse sexual things I think I've ever heard in my life. Still, this is a game you'll want to listen to-keep that Xbox 360 Soundtrack turned off!The raunchy dialogue is accompanied by a generally sick sense of humor that mimics that of Rockstar very well. Volition pokes fun at several different things in this game, and you'll catch a lot of them in no time. For example, a common one is the \"grown-up, mature\" version of the late Dave Thomas's Midwest-based food chain, Wendy's. The commercials heard in the game are pretty ridiculous. Friendly Fire, Stilwater's firearm store, is a complete rip-off of Ammu-Nation, Grand Theft Auto's equivalent. The commercials make this especially noticeable.Saint's Row's online gameplay is something that has never been attempted before in the sandbox genre. Online, you can choose from several gameplay modes. The online gameplay modes are all a lot of fun when the connection isn't awful, but in my experience, the connection was almost always awful, so I didn't have the most fun on Xbox Live with this game. There was severe lag, a ton of disconnecting, and a lot of quitters. Also, I felt like the characters died and ran out of stamina far too quickly. Rather than being a fast-paced game where players were free to run around, the lack of stamina made everything a much slower affair. Still, there's a lot of potential whenever the servers are more stable. The Gang setup (basically the exact same concept as Halo 2's clans) is great, and the lobbies are fun, letting you cap and chat with your buddies while waiting on the game to load.Overall, Saint's Row isn't without its problems-frustrating missions, choppy online play, and a few graphical glitches show that Saint's Row is human. Add those to the familiar ground tread in the game's storyline, and the lack of some of GTA's newer features, and you've got a game that is a few years behind the competition. But does that mean that Saint's Row is bad? No! Far from it! Saint's Row is a fantastic game that had me glued to my seat. I was so glued, in fact, that I played it for more than ten hours after putting it into my Xbox 360 for the first time, completing more than 30% of the game in a single sitting. Then the next day came and went. And the next day. And the next day. Saint's Row's got the great graphics, excellent presentation, control style, online gameplay, and entertainment value to make it more than worthy of your $60.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2006"}

And that's it. It can be frustrating, but it is the the kind of frustration that makes you want to come back for more.The Japanese-style animation is ok, but not worth all of the raves given to it. This is just a game, and there is only so much they can put on a chip. You want animation, see Ghost In The Shell.The unforgivable thing about this game is, surprisingly, some of the music. Considering that this game is being played mostly by kids who probably never heard the original versions of Deep Purple's \"Highway Star\" or Stray Cats' \"Rock This Town\", it's a crime. Nintendo botched \"Highway Star\", but they murdered \"Rock This Town\". I wonder what Brian Setzer thinks of it.I'm only about halfway through the game, and I think that so far, the only actual real music artist on here was the guy from Jamaroqui, and it doesn't look like he even got a credit...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-17-2007"}
{"product_name":"B003O6G5TW","description":"","reviewerName":"A. D. Anderson \"Flying Gamer\"","summary":"Frustrating at first, takes some getting used to.","reviewText":"I've only played the multiplayer so far, and unfortunately my worst fears from the beta have come true.  This game is a camper's paradise.  All fun is sucked out of this game as time and time again you will be killed by some sniper you can't see.  With maps scaling many city blocks, someone could be hiding anywhere, and you will be totally screwed when you try to make your way towards any objective.  The only way to have any sort of advantage is to use a tank, unless you plan on tackling the awful helicopter controls (you would probably be able to apply for a commercial license if you mastered them.  Unfortunately the controls are unrealistic and just plain frustrating).  Flying a jet is fun, if you don't mind spinning circles in the sky for 10 minutes as you try to catch a glimpse of your enemy.  There is no way of knowing which direction an enemy jet is from you, as the airplane icon from Battlefield 1943 is gone (EDIT:  you unlock the proximity sensor after several level-ups).  This simple omission saps the enjoyment out of the one positive I have found in this game so far.  It's as if everything about this game is designed to make your life miserable.  Isn't this supposed to be a video game?  Isn't it supposed to be FUN?  It is, I suppose, if your idea of fun is hiding in a corner, or in some bushes, or on a roof, waiting for someone to happen across your location so you can shoot them in the back.  Maybe I'm old-school, but this type of gameplay was highly discouraged back in the day.  Camping was for noobs and people who couldn't play.  This game encourages and rewards it in bounds.  I turned it off after three hours of gameplay after picking up on the midnight release.  I'm just mad.  Bad Company 2 was much better.  I really think that this franchise has had an \"on accident\" success to it.  People picked up Bad Company 2 because they were sick of the dirty gameplay on MW2 (at least that's why I started playing it).  So EA decides to release a sequel that is nothing but dirty gameplay.  Forget having any skill, just find the best hiding spot and wait.  It feels like they built this world and put a bunch of tanks and planes in it and said, \"here you go.\"  There's no real thought put into level design, it's just sort of there.  Half of the buildings are copied straight out of Bad Company 2!  I'm sure plenty of gamers will sing this song praises.  Their KDR is sky-high and they were able to text their broseph while playing.  \"Oh, hold on, someone just ran in front of me.\"  This, along with the expected-to-be disappointing MW3, is removing a lot of my excitement for the fall lineup.  At least Batman and Forza 4 are awesome.EDIT 10/30/11:  After spending around 15 hours in the multiplayer I've added another star to my review.  I still have only played multiplayer, as everything I've read/heard is saying the single player isn't worth it.  Alright, so for the added star...  I've gotten the hang of survival in multiplayer, it relies a lot on moving with your squad and teammates, something that I appreciate about the game.  Coordinated movements are key and I would highly recommend that you play with friends since you never know what you're going to get with random team-mates.  I hate to sound mean, but people suck at everything.  I'm amazed at how many people can't figure out how to drive a tank, and be very wary of getting into a helicopter with someone if you're not flying.  You have about a 50/50 chance of getting killed 2 seconds after the skids leave the ground (they will crash it).  On the helicopter controls, I've gotten used to them and am having a blast with them now.  The Little Bird is my favorite as it's very maneuverable.  The only way to get good at this is to practice, but if you can't figure it out, do everyone else a favor and keep it on the ground.  As for surviving on the ground, my thoughts from above remain true.  This game is very much about camping.  I've accepted that there are no dirty kills in this game and will stay prone with my M249 guarding doors near objectives.  I unlocked the IR scope and bipod, so it's pretty unfair for anyone who happens in my direction.  It would feel bad if I wasn't killed the exact same way all of the time.  If you're still on the fence about this game, I would reluctantly recommend it.  It has a STEEP learning curve and things are going to be frustrating at first, especially if you're used to the CoD/Halo type gameplay.  Once you start getting the hang of it the game becomes quite rewarding.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2011"}

After many searches I finally found it.  However after three hours and many deaths I was done.  The game was beat.  3 hours.  For an RPG that is to short, [heck] it takes me longer to beat something Legends of Wrestling or Contra.This particular game starts off with one [heck] of a bang.  When you are first loading up they included (granted a little grainy and not with the origional music) the intro to Dragon Ball Z.  From there you jump right into the game.THe game starts at the beggining of Raditz and goes all the way through Frieza.  YOu start off tehnically at level 2 (After the first meaningless task) before you do any fighting.  After Raditz shows up and kidnapps Gohan you are off to save him.  However you arrive at your house and walk all the way there.  YOu help out people and eventually learn the Solar Flare attack when you finally face off against Raditz.  From there on it's just a matter of winning and than going to the afterlife.I won't continue that because people who play this probably know the story line.  However I don't remember GOku on his way to Raditz picking flowers for a little girl, or getting a Dinosaurs Egg back.The tasks are fairly meaningles but they get you EXP and sometimes increase your speed (which is needed). You collect flight charges in order to fly.  Also many characters make cameo appearences and just tlaking to them gets you 500 exp.Boss battles are the most disapointing.  They are all the same.  Once you learn Solar Flare (and that is just before facing Raditz) all boss battles are cake walks.  Charge up SOlar flare slightly than charge up Ki Blast or Kamahmaha to at least 50% than release.  Keep up that pattern and move around objects and you are guarenteed to win every time.  SOme times they shoot at you but most times they wait to get in close range and than punch you.WHich brings me to the next point, Damage control.  There is no way to tell how badly you are damaging your foes.  Granted small things like snakes and squirles goe down in a single shot but from the crab on you have no way of knowing how badly you are damaging your foe.  YOu may kill a foe in single punch one time than the next it takes 12 hits.  I am seriouse that is the way it is.However the game does very closly follow the key points of the story.  The only change was at the end with Frieza (in the show he faces frieza level 4 in the game you face all 4 forms).  Beyond that you do get little clips at certain moments (like arriving on King Kais place or off to face Raditz).  The music is also well done and they even included GOku yelling out KAmahamaha when he does the attack at least 50%.  For a die hard Dragon Ball Z Fan this is a god send however for the average gamer this is a renter, to easy for novices but to hard for little ones.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2002"}

It's worth owning for every FPS fan, now that it's been out a while and the price has halved.As far as gameplay goes, there's really nothing new or revolutionary here. It plays like every other FPS on the market, including Halo, COD, and Gears of War. For certain tasks like arming explosives and turning valves, you have to rotate the controller, but this is really just a gimmick.The single-player levels are varied, if not terribly inspired. They're well-done and great looking, but they're the same kind of stock locations you see in every sci-fi FPS, including base interiors, inside your fleet's flagship cruiser, a refinery, a rocky wasteland local, etc. Some levels are easier than others, with the last one being insanely difficult. It took me more than 5 hours to beat on Veteran. Now, on to the annoyances:- You can only carry 2 weapons (not counting the combat knife): a large gun and a pistol, which has infinite ammo. Every game I can remember, if it restricts you to 2, you can toss the pistol and pick up another large guns. Not here. You cannot toss your revolver and have 2 large guns, so really, you only have 1 choice of weapons at any given time. This feels like a step backwards in the evolution of the genre. The weapons are mostly variations of real-world guns found in military shooters like Modern Warfare and others: assault rifles, a shotgun, SMG, LMG, grenade launcher. Some weapons, like the shotgun, only allow you to carry a ridiculously low amount of ammo: 24 shells. Coupled with the slow rate of fire, it's usually more trouble than it's worth. The grenade launcher is also pretty useless. It doesn't detonate unless you score a direct hit, giving enemies the chance to run away from the time-delayed projectile when it lands. There are some really fun ones like the electricity gun (unlimited ammo), but you only get it for 1 level late in the game. When a new level starts, you revert to whatever the level starts you on, so if there's a gun you like, you can't keep it between levels.As a major plus, though, the guns feel and sound powerful. The amount of muzzle climb and spread feels right.- Next is the immature and cliched dialog. Your squad is by far the most annoying thing about KZ2. They just don't shut up. The endless cursing, constant trash talk, and childish banter is similar to the cornball scripting in Gears of War 2. Soldiers don't have to talk and act like testosterone-fueled meat heads.- Idiotic squad AI that's often a hindrance than a help. Your squad members will sometimes just stand right in front of you, blocking your path. Rico is nearly useless. He runs into gunfire and needs constant reviving. During many of the later levels, I found myself cursing at the idiotic AI. Enemy AI is passable. Nothing spectacular.- Lack of unlockable items and bonus content is really a sore point. No weapons gallery, character profiles, rotatable models, or other features that we've come to expect from today's games. There are hidden medallions to shoot and intel to collect, but these are just for trophies. They don't unlock any hidden content (because there isn't any).Overall, KZ2 is fun for a quick fix. Campaign mode is rather short, but entertaining. The graphics are certainly very polished and pushes the PS3 hardware, but it feels rushed. There's no co-op mode or local multi-player if you want to have friends over and play split-screen.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2010"}

Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.","reviewerName":"Brendan L. Agnew \"rothwyn\"","summary":"A God among action games. . .","reviewText":"God of War has the distinction of being one of the (many) early contenders for Game of the Year. Even being released at a time packed with other fantastic games (Devil May Cry 3, Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory, Resident Evil 4, Jade Empire), God of War manages to make a lasting mark on the action/adventure genre.The story of God of War is one pieced together from and inspired by Greek mythology. Olympus, the home of the gods, is in chaos. Ares, the god of war, has declared. . . well, war on his bretheren, wreaking havoc against his sister, Athena's, capital city. With Athens burning and a decree from Zeus himself that the gods cannot take direct action against Ares, his brothers and sisters turn to a fallen hero, a tortured soul who wants nothing more than to destroy Ares for his own reasons.Stepping into the sandals of a half-god Spartan general named Kratos, the player is immediately introduced to some of the most fluid, brutal, cinematic, and rewarding combat of any game this generation. Instead of the \"dial-a-combo\" style of combat used in action games like Ninja Gaiden, God of War offers the players a set of fairly simple moves, and the ability to string them together in a myriad of ways for near-endless strings of combos. The blades that Kratos uses (gruesome swords literally chained to his arms) whirl through the air to slice into enemies, plunge through flesh, or hurl them into the air.In fact, the over-the-top violence of God of War is something to note; it doesn't share the comical/sattirical nature of the mayhem in the Grand Theft Auto games, and it pulls NO punches; there are even scenes of nudity and suggested (well, more like heard-but-not-seen) sexual content. However, the game is one of a brutal story set in a brutal world about a VERY brutal main character, so it fits the mood and themes.The game also strives to create a very visceral and cinematic experience for every minute that the player is in control, allowing the player brutal finishing moves to decapitale, eviscerate, and dismember his enemies. Likewise, through properly-timed button presses, Kratos can scale enormous bosses and deliver crushing and stylized blows to specific body parts to bring them down. One particularly memorably moment is the fight against the three-headed dragon from Greek mythology, the Hydra, who the players must destroy using an etire ship as a weapon.Along with the compelling story (told through the excellent in-game engine as well as through stunning Full Motion Video scenes) and the brutal and easily adaptable combat, the game features some solid puzzles when it switches from burning city battlefields to ancient dunegons and temples. For the most part, these challenges will be very familiar to anyone who has played the Legend of Zelda series, but God of War adds its signature dark twist to these (you'll find yourself using Medusa's head to turn enemies to stone and place them on pressure switches).However, it's also in these dungeons that the game shows it's one (very minor) Achille's heel. The fact that Kratos, a half-god with the power to bring down a Titan, can be easily killed by a simple swinging blade is fairly annoying; and the platforming (involving said blades), is the game's weakest part. It's not horrible, but it doesn't quite show the same level of polish and quality as the rest of the title. Platforming is also the only time you'll see the graphics falter. Easily one of the best-looking games on the PS2, GoW's only problem is a slight awkard animation when Kratos jumps (especially when compared to the animation in titles like the recent Prince of Persia games).However, these are VERY small faults in a VERY good game. The title has excellent replay value, with multiple difficulty levels, unlockables, special \"making the game\" features, and a quest that will take at least 10-15 hours for even hardcore gamers to play through once (and you'll want to play this one multiple times).Overall, if you're looking for a magnificent and hard-hitting action game experience with a good share of head-scratching bits as well, you can't go wrong with God of War. Just keep this one away from the kids.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2005"}

Thanks to the power of Nintendo DS, all of the lush vistas and perilous paths of Yoshi's Island span two screens.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Sequel to a Great SNES Game","reviewText":"Over a decade ago, Yoshi's Island on the Super Nintendo was a blast that at the time took the gaming world by storm.  It didn't quite have the same impact when it was released for the GBA in 2002, but it still managed to sport some of its originality.  We finally get a sequel, and its actually pretty good.  It keeps all the good stuff from the previous game and adds in some new quirks.  So it isn't exactly the same game.  There are indeed some key differences.In the first Yoshi's Island, Kamek kidnapped Baby Luigi while Baby Mario fell to Yoshi's Island.  The Yoshi's rallied together to reunite Mario with his brother.  The adventure was long, satisfying and quite a challenge.  In the sequel on DS, Kamek is up to his dirty tricks again, but the key difference is that now the Yoshi's are taking care of more than one baby.A lot of gameplay mechanics from the first one return.  As you go through levels Yoshi does pretty much all that he did in the first one.  That is to say you can jump and hover briefly, ground pound, make enemies into eggs and throw those eggs, as well as spitting your enemies back out at others.  In this aspect Yoshi's Island has not changed at all.  In addition to all this, keeping track of the baby on your back is also the same.  If Yoshi ever touches an enemy he'll lose the baby off his back and a timer starts to countdown.  You have to recover the baby before the timer runs out or else you lose a life.  Also like in the first one, stars refill the counter.There's more that returns.  The completion of the game is a spot on match to the first one.  As you go through levels you'll see flowers, red coins among the normal ones, and stars that need collecting.  Upon completing a level you'll be given a score out of 100.  The only way to get 100 is if you collect all the flowers, red coins, and manage to keep your counter completely full by collecting stars.  There are always 100 points, and if you manage to score 100 points in every level of a world, you'll unlock a bonus stage... just like in the original.There is one difference in the gameplay in particular that separates Yoshi's Island DS from the original Super Nintendo version.  The fact that there is more than one baby that Yoshi can carry on his back.  At first this doesn't sound like much, but it makes a difference in some of Yoshi's abilities.  You'll begin the game with Baby Mario and Baby Peach.  As you progress however, you'll get more babies--DK, Wario and Boswer.  They each allow you to do something different.  Mario, for example, let's Yoshi dash while Peach has a parasol. In the end, if you actually want to do everything Yoshi's Island has to offer, you'll have to use all the babies.  Some levels cannot be completed unless you've got the right baby to do it.  So if you're having trouble getting some items, or you can't access a certain part of the level, it might be because you're not using the right baby.The best part about Yoshi's Island is that the game as a whole is a challenge.  More so than the original.  The mechanic of having to switch babies to progress through levels adds a lot of variety to the levels.  Having to score 100 points on every level also adds a lot of variety and challenge.  Yoshi's Island DS is also fun to play because it doesn't do away with the mechanics that made the first one so good.  The boss fights are just as memorable here as they were in the SNES installment.Its the graphics where Yoshi's Island DS misses a little bit.  In all honesty, it doesn't look all that different from the first one on the Super Nintendo.  This isn't bad seeing as how the art style is still unique, but it doesn't look that much better than the game we got over ten years ago.  It's pretty and all, but if you played the first one to death, you're not really seeing anything new.  Most of the enemies look the same as they did before.  Along those lines, the game doesn't sound as good as the SNES original.  Most of it is actually quite forgettable.  The tunes aren't bad or anything.  They're just not catchy.The game also doesn't use the touch screen.  All the top screen is used for is so that you can see more of the level.  So if you were expecting it to take full advantage of the DS's capabilities, you'll be disappointed.  This in no way detracts from the game's value, though.In the end, Yoshi's Island DS isn't so bad.  The game keeps all the aspects of the original game in tact while adding in some new features that make it unique.  It's a satisfying game experience overall, even if it does bring back a little too much from the original.On the positive side+The gameplay mechanics that worked in the previous game are back+New additions to the gameplay are welcome; there's quite a bit of variety+The art style still works for the game...+The game sounds good+The levels are great+The game is a challenge+It's a lot of fun with a lot of replay value+Tons of secrets to unlockOn the negative side-For some gamers it's too much of the same thing-Forgettable Soundtrack-Not that much better looking than the original SNES title","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001UWGBC8","reviewerName":"Dredded Deuce \"Dredded Panthyr\"","summary":"No brainer for comic fans but still feels the same","reviewText":"I really wanted to love this game. After playing Batman, I really really wanted to love this game. But...after putting about 6 hrs worth of work, I like it. MUA II is pretty much the same game we have played since X Men Legends for PS2. That's not to say that it's a bad thing but after 6 years and four games, the formula hasn't changed all that much. So this time around for all of you Marvel-heads that have kept up, teh Civil War story line gets played out in this game and so far with very little deviation it plays pretty closely to the storyline and that is a big plus for this game so no worries there.What I would really advise (and the game does this as well) is once you reach the point where you have to choose sides, save your game because for those of you who choose to go back and play as the opposing side of your choice would probably not want to go back and grind out from the beginning to reach that point.For many of you that already know about the split and other minutiae of the game I won't bore you with what you all already know. But, how does it play? Well, if you played the other 3 then it's pretty much the same fare. Choose your teams and go for broke. Most of you already know about the cusomizations that you can do for your characters but what about the Fusions? it's really the only new thing that Activision added in this year and some are pretty cool and some are forgettable. So far, I have seen 3 different types of fusions and they work as follows:Guided - means you guide your Fusion to the target(s)Clear - A wide angle fusion which clears out an area of baddiesTargeted - a fusion that hits a target that you specify.What I did notice is that while some are indeed unique, there are some that are the same no matter which combos you use. Example: Gambit fused with either Juggernaut, Luke Cage or the Thing give the same fusions.  Beyond that however, at least you don't have to learn an impossible button combo to execute. Just make sure you are using the right ones for the job especially boss fights.The boss fights are a bit more fun this time around as  in some cases you have to really use your head instead of jumping straight in pounding away and getting beaten in the process. I would say out of the four bosses I have encounted (I chose Anti Reg BTW) von Bardas and Bishop's fights were satisfying.One more upside is that the graphics have improved quite a bit BUT...camera angles still suck and it's quite easy to lose sight of where you are in a mob. This is something I was hoping addressed from the last version. One small item I did note was how they used the fonts from the comic which really added to the attactiveness to playing a game based on a comic story.Another downside is that the voice acting is not great at all altho the lip synching has been fixed and some of the CGI cutscenes could have used a little more life to it. Not to mention there is one somewhat corny cameo by Stan Lee I think we could have done without. I am really waiting for the day they could take the CGI work from those scenes and use it IN the game...heh!Also you would think that now games are doing full on voicework (like Mass Effect) with a lot of RPGs now, having simple boxes to pick from and no dialogue to accompany it is so last gen.As far as sound effects, the game sounds really good and on a good surround system it's incredible especially when you have characters like Juggernaut stomping around on screen.Also this time around, the alternate costumes are mostly gone and you only get  (so far as I have seen) one for each character and they don't augment their ability like they did in the last game.  I think this was a bad move and I hope Microsoft and Activision don't try to nickel and dime fans by making it a paid ietm via DLC.There is a lot of replayability to be had because of course you have 2 sides to play and also a lot of unlockable content so fans of this game will have many hours of play before they find everything and then of course multiplayer is included (something I plan on trying over the weekend) and is pretty much lag free and also allows players to jump in and out of games with ease.Lastly, the big question: Is it better than Batman? No for 2 reasons.For one, most of us know the story of the Civil War whereas the Batman story was an original creation.Secondly, MUA II is a mostly been there and done that whereas Batman altho taking cues from Bioshock is a somewhat fresh concept on how the Batman game should be made, so IMO, it's kind of hard to take a game with 4 iterations to date and rank it over a game that finally got the overhaul and new feel that it needed.In the end, this is a no brainer for comic fans, Marvel fans specifically, but you may find yourselves really wanting more out of this and praying that if there is a Secret Invasion or Dark Reign game in the next few years, Activision simply won't rehash this game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2009"}

There are all new guns, and worst of all... There are uninspired new maps. The new 2-fort is a sand like level that doesn't have the same feeling. The other maps just don't have anything to be talked about. The all new guns I mentioned? Crap. They all blow except the redeemer. The new sniper rifle(lighting gun!) is retarded. The new pistol is pretty stupid. There's also a gun now which instead of doing damage, it pushes the opponent. This is rather useless in pretty much any situation.

{"product_name":"B000K8YAKI","reviewerName":"S. Chang \"Steven Chang\"","summary":"I BELIEVE!","reviewText":"Since the days of Halo 1 & 2 on the original Xbox, I have found the Halo series slightly over hyped and somewhat boring. Especially when compared to other online FPS's such as Counter-Strike / Quake / Unreal. So you can rest assured, this review was not written by a Halo \"fanboy\" or fanatic.Now in 2007, Halo 3 is finally upon us and all I can say is I now do \"believe\" this is the best in the Halo series and will live up to its hype.Pros:I think the absolute number one feature for Halo 3 is the online play A SOLID 10/10. It is incredibly stable, easy to use and it just plain works! Within 10 minutes of inserting the game disc, my buddy and I were squaring off in battle over XBOX live along with nearly half a million other players! Voice over IP is loud and clear with an occasional echo, no lagging or stalling even on release day! The interface is absolutely beautiful. I'm sure things will be even further improved over time by online patches and updates.The graphics are a 9/10. I have seen better effects & textures (BioShock, BF 2142, etc.) but all in all, I am very pleased. (Note: I am running an Xbox 360 elite w/ HDMI on a LG 32\" 1080i display)I give the sounds effects and music a 8/10, nothing really mindblowing.Fun factor is a perfect 10/10! It really is addicting.Single player story mode works great too. Although it is not the true \"focus\" of the game, single player mode will provide great entertainment when you're seeking a change of pace. It's somewhat short, but has excellent replay value. And YES you can play to story mode online with friends!Cons:I honestly haven't yet found many flaws in the GAME itself. If I were to be picky, I would say the graphics and sound effects \"could\" be improved further. Also, due to numerous reports of scratched discs in the Limited Editions, Microsoft was careless in its packaging method. I would say 95% of all the LE versions have loose discs and are scratched. (my copy was perfect though because I purchased it locally at Be$t buy and gently shook all the cases to listen for loose discs.)Halo 3 is a true winner for noobies and veterans of the Halo series period. I think this game will offer endless entertainment for quite some time and the Limited Edition is $70 well spent. You get quite a few extra goodies with the LE, such as a metal case, mini-hard cover book, and lots of extras on the bonus disc. For a mere $10 additional dollars, it is well worth it.Just remember, you may want to purchase the Limited Edition in a retail store so you can listen for loose discs. With some careful searching, you can find one that does Not contain scratched discs.Goodluck everyone and game on!5 stars!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2007"}

Rhodes","summary":"Very Stylish","reviewText":"Pros:+Very stylish and fun gameplay+Incredible looking cutscenes+Beautiful graphics and environments+Top Notch Boss BattlesCons:-Forgettable soundtrack-A lot of backtracking-The series still has a few camera issues-Annoying voice overs and bad dialogThe Devil May Cry games have always been fun, stylish and beautiful.  Devil May Cry 4 easily delivers in those three areas.  The game is a lot of fun to play, and that's good enough to distract from the game's short comings.Devil May Cry has never really been much for story.  It has always been about style and being cool all around.  Devil May Cry 4 definitely succeeds.  The cutscenes are beautiful and stylish.  Easily some of the best you'll see on the XBOX360.  Unfortunately, it's hard to get passed the shortcomings of the production values, though.  The voice acting isn't all that great.  The one-liners and such get annoying.  Some of the dialog is even laughable.  Devil May Cry has always been cheesy with its dialog, but here it's more annoying than anything else.  But the action is solid, especially in the gameplay.The Devil May Cry series has been known for two things.  Insane difficulty and its combat system.  There are two difficulty levels to choose from.  Devil May Cry 4 isn't nearly as hard as Devil May Cry 3, though, and for that, those who mastered the third installment will have no trouble plowing through this one in two or three days.You'll spend most of the game playing as Nero.  The new character in this game.  You won't be able to play as Dante for a long time but Nero is likable at least.  He has a Devil Bringer which he can use to perform combos on some of the demons you'll face throughout the game.  But he also has a gun and sword.  If you're familiar with the other Devil May Cry games, then the combat system here is similar.  You can pull off some great looking combos, juggle enemies, slam them down to the ground and much more.  When you kill enemies you'll collect orbs which will allow you to do things like power up your weapons, health and learn better combat abilities.  You'll also be able to go into Devil Trigger mode which will enhance your abilities.  Fans of the series will find themselves right at home as Devil May Cry 4 presents a lot of familiar gameplay.  The bosses are easily the most rewarding part of the game.  They're a challenge and they look brilliant in design.The combat system isn't enough to hide some of the games shortcomings, however.  The biggest problem to the gameplay may actually be the camera.  It's just not easy to work with.  The view changes often and sometimes you're faced with an abrupt view of the area.  In 2008, jumping from one platform to another shouldn't be such a taxing task.  But the camera in Devil May Cry 4 makes it that way.  There are also many moments when the view changes so suddenly that you're running in the wrong direction.  The view also gets obscured a lot.  There's also a lot of backtracking and treading familiar territory throughout the game.  While backtracking isn't that annoying, the camera makes many of the games moments more frustrating than they have to be.  It's just a good thing the game is incredibly fun to play.Devil May Cry 4 is easily one of the most beautiful looking games ever made.  The environments are gorgeous.  The enemies are incredible looking and the bosses are amazing.  Everything about the game's visuals are fantastic.  It runs smoothly as well, even when there's a ton of action going on.  The art design may be the best part.  There are moments when you might just want to stop and look at how much detail has been put into each and every environment.  The music, while good, is quite forgettable.  And in spite of the fantastic cutscenes, the voice acting isn't very good at all.Devil May Cry 4 is a solid entry to the series.  It's great for anyone who has enjoyed the Devil May Cry games in the past.  However, despite all that the game doesn't address the problems that have been rampant through the series: Bad Camera and too much backtracking.  This shouldn't turn any avid fan away, however.  It's worth a try.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00002STH5","description":"It's taken a while to get here, but Nintendo's 64-bit update to the old SNES classic, F-Zero, is here. F-Zero X is a stunning achievement in that it's truly the first racing game that runs at a brisk 60 frames per second, even in multiplayer. In fact, more than anything else, it is this feature that is F-Zero X's claim to fame. Does the rest of the game stack up? Well, it depends on what you're looking for.Instead of trying to compare it to its 16-bit counterpart, we'll dissect F-Zero X purely on its own merits. After all, the bar has been raised for racing games in general over the past few years. So what does the game have to offer? Well, first of all, forget any kind of simulation aspects. This is twitch gaming at its best. Although you can tinker with the basics, like acceleration and speed, that's about all you get to do. Everything else is just about driving. Playing like a Wipeout without weapons (which was like playing F-Zero with weapons), F-Zero X's only added enhancements are the inclusion of dash plates located at various points around the track. When you run over one of these plates, you get a severe speed boost that doesn't cost you any energy (after the second lap, you get boost power that you can use at any time, but it takes away some of your energy), enabling you to blast past some of your opponents. However, they too can use these plates.That's not to say that you can't dispose of your opponents though. By using the Z-button or the right shoulder button you can either crash into your opponent making his energy meter drop, causing him to explode if his meter is low enough. Or, you can try to shove him off the track if there is no barrier keeping you in. A number of play modes are available, including practice, death race, time attack, and vs. battle. However, the majority of the racing will be done in the grand prix mode, where the cup levels await. Each cup increases in difficulty, naturally, but with each additional level conquered, more and more racers are made available to you, adding replay incentive. If you make it to the final secret cup, you'll uncover a random track generator that offers you a fresh challenge every time.So what's the problem with F-Zero X? For starters, with up to 30 different racers onscreen at any given point, some sacrifices had to be made in order to keep the insane frame rate so high. Polygon counts on the vehicles are very low, giving them a particularly uninspiring look. The track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it. In its defense, the tracks are cleverly designed, especially the twisty corkscrew tracks that speed by at a blazing pace. One feature that's lacking is a first-person view. If speed was truly supposed to be on display here, a cockpit view would definitely have helped, but alas, there is none to be found. Control is pretty good, although the analog stick can be kind of touchy in places, leading to a few inadvertent fender benders. The sound effects are very good and actually add to the feeling of speed in the game. Unfortunately, the music can be pretty annoying in a cheesy synthesized-metal kind of way and doesn't really add much to the whole experience.As a game, F-Zero X is certainly thorough in its execution; unfortunately, there just seems to be very little in the game to keep you coming back. Sure, Nintendo incorporated all those funky characters to give it... um... character, but the game erases all that good stuff with its overwhelming blandness. Yes, the game can be fun in multiplayer, being supersonic and all that, but the game just lacks those certain intangibles that make a good game great. Practically flawless from a technical standpoint, the biggest thing missing from F-Zero X is that it lacks a soul. It's yet another stunning update to the legendary Nintendo catalog, but it's games like this that make you wonder: Where's Metroid 64 or Donkey Kong 64? Back to the drawing board it seems. --James Mielke--Copyright &copy;1999 GameSpot Inc. All rights reserved.

For starters, there are 30 racers rather than 4, and this game is very fast! But to be so fast and have 30 racers, the game is very cheaply detailed. Lets just say the car your driving is very small and looks like a box with rocket boosters. Also with 30 cars 6 cars to start and 24 to earn, it gets a bit confusing as to who you should chose to race as, so there are detailed photos of each driver so that people can pick their favorite to drive as. The originality of the game is the fact that the track forms itself into any sort of shape. It goes into huge anti-gravity loops, half pipes where you can drive on the ceiling, and pipes where you can race on the outside of it... all around it... without falling off! There are three levels of difficulty, customizable colors, cars, speeds, acceleration and three circuits with seven or so unique tracks. Finally there is an original battle mode, where you must destroy other racers by knocking them off the track.

Having said that, it must be stated that SM64 is the greatest videogame to date, and one which all games, regardless of genre, will be judged henceforth. Nintendo set itself a nearly impossible goal and achieved it with SM64. Look closely, Mario's lineage is 2D -- not ideal material upon which to base the most intensely scrutinized 3D videogame ever. But videogames are, in the end, meant to entertain. And entertainment is at the heart of this fantastic title.Like many previous Mario games, experimentation is integral to the experience of playing. You must explore everything, leave no rock unturned, no mushroom mute, no door unopened. Mario himself has so many possible movements, and the environment is so intensely interactive, that even the least experimental players will spend hours on the first level without achieving anything in particular. The game is initially less accessible than previous Mario titles, although the three-pronged analog controller isn't really where the difficulty lies -- the joypad itself performs excellently. Overall, the biggest obstacle in the game is finding the correct viewpoint. The camera, which moves on its own (unless directed manually by using the four gold buttons), tries to find the optimal angle to view the action, though occasionally you're simply not able to see where you're going. Additionally, frustration sets in as you spin the camera around while simultaneously attempting to run across a moving plank or tip-toeing across a tiny ledge. But getting the hang of SM64 is all a matter of practice , and as soon you catch on, you will execute these skills unconsciously. The variety of levels and scale each world is simply breathtaking. The game consists of 15 massive courses in which Mario can attain seven stars per course, with numerous secret areas and bonuses, including 15 extra stars (for a total or 120 stars). It'll surely take the average gamer 60 hours to reach the third and final Bowser and free the princess (not to mention find Yoshi), so the game's replay value is bountiful. And despite all of their saccharin-sweet cuteness, the graphics are magnificent. Shigeru Miyamoto's dream of producing an interactive cartoon has been fully realized -- the animation is lavish, the textures rich, and even the most superfluous touches have been completely executed. SM64 is not perfect, however. Despite the efficiency of the hardware's Load Management, draw-in is noticeable, and occasionally gamers will look right through walls or objects. Still, this is as close to perfection a game has ever been (64-bit, no less). Super Mario 64 also puts Nintendo's preference of &quot;silicon over CDs&quot; to the test, with pleasingly familiar results. Most owners of either a Saturn or a PlayStation (or both), have by now acclimated to long load times, though grumblingly. Super Mario 64 will remind them of how gaming used to be: load time is nil, and reaching a playable level is only a matter of seconds. From the time you switch on the unit until you're done, the flow is seamless, and moving from one game area to another is instantaneous. Nintendo's musical prodigy, Koji Kondo, turns in an inspired performance, somehow finding room on the small cartridge to create the appropriate music for each world. Even though some tracks are cheesy, others, like the sitar-laden score of the first fire level, are more than effective in setting the mood for the level, and are as atmospheric as any Redbook audio. Also impressive are the sound effects: Mario's onscreen antics are matched by grunts, whoops, and hollers, fleshing out his spunky personality. As a whole, the flagship N64 game more than makes up for any painful delay (or delays) imposed upon the unit's release. SM64 is complete in every way, and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the game's minimal flaws. Nintendo's craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in Super Mario 64. Nintendo 64's early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of Miyamoto and team. Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse, it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous 2D incarnations of the Mario franchise. 3D worlds are huge and cleverly laid-out so that there's never a dull moment. Secrets play a huge part of the experience, recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series. In fact, this game is exactly as one might hope it would be: Mario in 3D. More freedom, more space, more options, better graphics, improved and elaborated control schemes -- it's all there. Possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever. Don't rent. Buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2003"}

If you have NOT played Assassin's Creed 2 (AC2), stop reading this and go play AC2 first!!!AC: Brotherhood (ACB) is in all intents and purposes AC2.8 in gameplay and story. The reason I call it AC2.8 instead of AC2.5 is that it is HUGE in terms of content and gameplay, much of which is carried over from AC2.PROS- Open-world gameplay still rocks! Do what you want, when you feel like it! Explore hidden ruins, continue with plot missions, win back control of the city, hunt for hidden treasures, renovate shops...the choice is yours!- The weapons are very similar for the most part with a few minor additions, and the gameplay elements have changed slightly. This is a GOOD thing is you enjoyed AC2 as I did.- The battle system has been improved slightly but creates a significant upgrade to the experience overall. Enemies no longer take turns to attack you one at a time. They try to \"sucker-attack\" you from behind when you are engaged with another enemy, which makes things a lot more challenging and requires you to make strategic moves. Cool!- Load times are still quite good, Considering the size of the world/map, this is a solid accomplishment.- Your own 'gang' of assassins - the biggest change from AC2 is the addition of the ability ot recruit assassins and send them on missions. You can earn money and XP by successfully completing missions, and upgrade each assassin in terms of a few attributes such as armor, weaponry, and outfit color. This is a nice addition that adds depth to the game. You can send one (or many) assassins to each mission, and decide how much risk to assume; example: as you assign assassins to a mission, you are given a probability of success (up to 100%) so you can send as many or as few people as you wish. The trade-off is not having them available for story missions or side quests. I kind of wished you can get updates for these missions as some of them require up to 15 minutes to complete, and they progress in the background so it's possible for you to lose track of what's going on.CONS- As for the negatives, which are minor, the voice acting for Desmond's cast/group is pretty weak, but passable as long as you don't pay too much attention to it.- There are some minor annoyances such as the visuals not being quite as sharp as you might like it to be, but you can easily overlook this flaw in exchange for smooth, stutter-free frame rate (let's just say it's NOT Fallout: New Vegas by any stretch of the imagination!).- Other weak points are armor upgrades. Instead of being able to purchase upgrades when you have enough money (as in AC2), this game requires you to complete certain \"challenges\" that consist of gathering various items before you are allowed to make the purchase. This seems to be an artifical way of lengthening the game and making it more challenging, but not a big deal I guess. Since money is relatively easy to earn, I can see how the developer does not want you to amass a huge fortune and upgrade your character to the max in a short time, hence eliminating the difficulty of the game.Just a few notes on multiplayer - I have tried MP a few times but have had trouble getting into matches. They seem to take a long time to process. The few games I have gotten into were fun but nothing to jump up and down about. I see it as a nice 'extra' but probably won't keep your attention very long.In conclusion, this is one of the best games I've played in a very long time. Any fan of AC series should definitely get this, and any fan of open-world adventure games should seriously consider this title!!!EDIT: 12/30/2010Just finished the game; the ending was a bit of a surprise. I was slightly disappointed that not all questions were answered. However, this should still NOT discourage you from playing this great game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

Of course the idea of substituting the tough Solid Snake with the boyish Raiden upset me at first, but when you get to playing the game, you come to realize that it's not all that bad.  The villians, especially Vamp, are better than the first game, and the cut scenes are like a movie more than a video game.  The only problem I really had with the game was its regular ending.  Nothing new or special is offered here, and I was looking for a little bit more.

I started out playing the demo and what a \"tease\" it was.  I couldn't wait to get the full version.  Now that I have it and have played into the second tier of races; WOW!This game is about racing!  It also has a significant business aspect to it.You start out immediately in a race to earn your rookie license.  You don't have to win or place you just have to finish.  Once complete you get your rookie license for all three regions, US, Europe and Japan.  With license in hand can now drive for other owners/teams.  You are presented with a single driver offers from one team in each of the three regions.  I've been choosing the one that offers the most coin because once you earn the target $80,000 you can start your own team.With your own team you can start earning big bucks and higher reputation points.You'll have a spotter/crew cheif and a business manager.  The spotter keeps you advised of what's going on in the race.  He's slow on accidents ahead of you but helpful telling you what place you are in.  The manager keeps you advised and instructs you on the buisness end of racing.  She's knows what's going on.  Follow her lead.  Your team is only you until you get to the second tier, then you can hire and fire drivers to race on your team.  With your first hire you only have a choice of three drivers.  I would recommend firing the one you hire immeditely because then you can search for a driver that has the skills you want and can \"afford\".  Where talking drivers who want a bonus to sign with you and a percentage of their winnings.  You determine the parameters and are presented with drivers who match what you're willing to pay.  You're also presented with the skill set each driver that matches your search has.  Is he aggresive, consistent, what his specialty is, etc...You can race in three different regions US, Europe and Japan.  You earn reputation points based on your position in races and the level of difficulty you've chosen for a particular race.  You need 80,000 pts in a region to get to the tier two races and 250,000 to get to tier 3.  Also if you win the championship in each of the six \"disciplines\" in a particular tier and region you get a special head to head challenge race against the #1 team at the time, in which you can win substantial dollars for your organization.Disciplines are types of racing and each has a set of cars you can choose from.  Some of the disciplines are GT, Pro Muscle, Pro Tune, Drift, Demolition, Togue, Pro Tougue. there are about a nine differnt disciplines.  You have to purchase cars to drive in each discipline.  You can also sell cars you don't need on ebay. My personal favorites are Pro Tune, Pro Muscle and Touring.  However, the racing gets more difficult as you get into the higher tiers because now you're talking top-performance cars (higher speeds).What makes the game great is that the racing can be intense.  As noted by others the AI wants to win.  You find yourself battling the last half lap for the lead that's when you're more prone to make a mistake.  I've had those YES, moments when I've won by a nose.  It is defintely challenging and tons of fun!  If you find yourself winning too easily your manager will let you know and you can change the level of difficulty at the start of each race from Basic, Normal, Serious, Savage and Extreme.  I start each new race in normal mode. If I can win in normal the next time I'll bump it up to Serious.  Lets say you race U.S. Pro Muscle Tier 1.  You'll have two races on two different tracks.  The next time you choose that discipline the tracks will be modified and even different.  How many times this occurs I don't know.  It keeps it interesting.  I've started over and begun tracking the tracks in each discipline and tier. I've even started recording how many seconds I finish ahead or behind in each race/track and the current difficulty setting. That way I konw when I can bump it up.At the end of each season you have the option of the 24hrs of Lemans race.  I recommend it each time because it adds to your \"Global\" reputation. Reputation is the key to moving up the driver board.  It is a slow go up the board as a driver.  I've gone through 7 seasons and have gone from about 430 to 320 as a ranked driver and I'm on tier two in all three regions.To me grid is the New GOLD standard for racing games.  Can't wait for Codemasters to continue to improve it.Update:  Alright.  Have played all the way through and won the championship in each race.  Can't get enough of this game.  Even tried other demo's and hands down Grid is it.  Have purchased the prestige pack add on.  Like that Australian track alot.  Am continuing racing the same save but this time around am steadily increasing the level of difficulty.  The Prestige pack adds the \"Ninja\" difficulty level.  Will try to win all the races all the way up through Ninja.  The races are much easier now.  I've been able to get through most this time around without using the flashback most of the time.  Have also fallen in love with drifting.  It's incredibly hard at first.  If you need help/pointers learning to drift contact me. I go by Flsurffisher on the PSN.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-12-2010"}

To read many reviews, one would think Bioshock 2 a major disappointment due to a lack of \"newness\" in its setting, graphics, and overall gameplay.  But if you are like me and went hook, line, and sinker into the first game with its neon, art-deco, eerie, crumbling city of insanity, then for us, this is simply and extension of a game that we all probably wanted to play a lot more of when it was over.And to me, they changed enough - playing as a Big Daddy puts a whole new perspective on things, and the associated weapons and abilities that come with that made landed me right back in Bioshockland, exploring every nook and cranny for those upgrades and spending probably way too much time on a level trying to finish it all.Many games don't offer much payoff for going the extra mile.  The ones that offer you incentive (Batman: Arkham Asylum comes to mind) consume your life as you immerse yourself in the world the creators took the time to cross every \"t\" and dot every \"i\".  Like the tape recorders hidden throughout Rapture, the world of Bioshock contains many secrets, and like any good secret, you just HAVE to know.(as an addendum, I am playing this game far, far after its release, but it would've easily been a full price game for me, and undoubtedly, reviews be damned, Bioshock 3 will be a pre-order.

{"product_name":"B0016NRS8M","reviewerName":"Brandon Zarzyczny \"BigZ7337\"","summary":"A Good B Game","reviewText":"At times I love watching a good B movie, and lately some smaller game developers have been experimenting with making a good B game. I truly think this game succeeds, even though it could have been much better. Sadly the worst part of this game is the story, which is disappointing for an RPG. The game excels during all of the addictive side missions, but any time they try to inject the story it greatly detracts from the experience. I played as a warrior, generally staying away from the bow and sorcery, as I thought neither of them worked too well. For the warrior, it's nice that each different type of weapon has a different attack series, but I wish there were more modifiers, and more ways to evolve improve those special attacks. I actually really like their weapon upgrading system, but it just needed a few tweaks. Every weapon or piece of armor is made up of a combination of steel, iron, chainmail, wood, cloth, and leather. You can upgrade everything with a certain amount of these raw materials very highly as long as you have upgraded you stats. The best part of this is that every weapon you get from a downed enemy can be dismantled to its raw parts. This means that even when you fight weak enemies way below your level you are greatly rewarded with the same amount of parts received from high level items. However, this also creates the biggest problem, where you've upgraded your favorite weapon to it's max, but when you get a new better weapon, your former favorite is now useless. All you can do is dismantle it for the same minimal amount as the lowest level of equipment, or you can sell it for a couple hundred gold, which is also useless.Like I said earlier, while the game itself is really fun and addictive, the story is horrendous (you're about to enter spoiler town). I can tell you the story in a few sentences: The story apparently starts right where the last left of (which is very annoying since I and probably everyone else couldn't play through the last horrible game) and your lifeforce is drained into your sister so the evil emperor can raise some evil god/demon. After being taken back to the dungeon a group of Orcs liberate you and then send you on a mission to essentially level up and learn how to kill the emperor. This is really the last of the story until later on where you start to learn about the annoying backstory of the emperor in an attempt to humanize him. Then once you finally get to confront the emperor it turns out he's a good guy trying to prevent the evil god form returning, while the woman you've been working for the whole game is actually the enemy. She then appears and turns into a dragon for your final battle. This is even worse because the only way to kill the dragon is to use these crossbows set up in a circle, a completely different mechanic that kind of works, and completely eliminates any benefits from leveling up the entire game.Still I enjoyed the game, there's a lot of fun to had, it's a long game. I have high hopes for a third Two Worlds, as long as the developer again makes the game better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2011"}

Why should PS3 owners not get the pleasure of playing one of the greatest FPSes ever? Ain't fair.Then the news started circulating that Bioshock was coming to PS3. Could it be true? Or was it another hoax like the one about Mass Effect or Left 4 Dead coming to the PS3. Thankfully it was not and this game although a year old when it finally made it to the PS3 is one of the best for the console.Graphics: Top notch. There are a couple slow downs here and there but nothing which really effects the gameplay. The world of rapture is slow beautiful that from time to time I just pop Bioshock in the revisit this one of a kind world.Story: One of the better ones every to come out for a video game. There are lots of twists and turns and the surprise ending to boot.Gameplay: I love this game. I love the plasmid powers and I love the designs of the guns. That being said, the guns are pretty bad... Huh? How can I give a perfect 5 star rating to an FPS and then say the guns are bad? Easy. The overall package of the game is perfect. There is tons of fun to be had in this game and it gives you a world and access to powers that you are not likely to ever see in another video game. That being said, the pistol(although beautifully designed and with one of the coolest reload animations ever) has so much kickback it is completely unusable. The zoom feature does little to help. To be honest, all of the guns in this game(either before or after upgrades)including machine gun, shot gun and even the grenade launcher are just weak. It should not take 6 hits from a pistol to take down the average splicer but really it does. What is odd is the fact that I have looked at tons of reviews and I have never seen anyone mention it. Gotta be truthful and I call it like I sees it!!Conclusion: Buy this game.

{"product_name":"B001TD6SK8","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days.........","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is set between the events of Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II and follows Roxas(Sora's Nobody)& his stint with Organization XIII. It almost, entirely, revolves around Organization XIII. Organization XIII has but one goal in mind and that is to fabricate Kingdom Hearts so they can reclaim their own hearts. I have to agree with the majority on one thing and, that is, if you don't know the whole story- you may need to go back to the very beginning and live the story. If you don't, and you're a newcomer to the series, you're going to be quite lost because the plot is rather deep and 'out there'-shall we say. Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is a game that caters to the diehard KH fan only and it makes no bones about it.The game, by far, is about the best looking game I've seen on the DS thus far. Like other reviewers have mentioned, it looks nearly as good as its' PS2 bretheren and that's saying something. Course, looks aren't everything I know. How does the gameplay hold up? Well- pretty good actually...the new Panel system adds quite a bit of strategy to things. However, I was quite annoyed at the fact I had to use the Panel system just to level up. That's something that should, automatically, be done when it happens, like in your more Traditional RPGs. I loved the fact that they made the battling more like that in the original KH yet am disappointed that there isn't more exploring. Going on missions everytime isn't so bad but I would've preferred to explore more like in the original game. It does, indeed, remind one of FFVII: Crisis Core and I applaud Dredspider & Luis Zavala for pointing that out. I do love the game, it was an absolute blast of a challenge to play, mind you. It just irritates me that we're visiting the same worlds over, yet, again..why can't we see some new worlds, Square? I know there's alot of Disney worlds out there that'd be perfect for this game(if you need some suggestions-look me up). It irritates me that there isn't more life breathing in any of these levels you're doing your missions on...shouldn't there be? This is a RPG, after all.  It irritates me that most of your missions were, basically, much of the same...I like a little variety and spice in things. Don't you???Other than that, Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days is fun. It satisfied my appetite for KH, for a little while, at least. Now, I look forward to KH: Birth by Sleep for the PSP and KH:Re:Coded for the Nintendo DS. Then, onto Kingdom Hearts III.Do I recommend KH:358/2 Days? Definitely...but only for one thing- Roxas' and Organization XIII's story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2010"}

I wasn't exactly bowled over by it's launch lineup, the controlers were ungodly big, and overall, it was just too much too soon.  However, since then things have changed.  The XBox has lassoed some great exclusive titles, and third party games that were only available on the PS2 (like the smash hit Grand Theft Auto series) are now on the XBox, plus the bulky controlers are gone, and are now much slimmer.  What really makes an XBox worth owning alone is XBox Live, the online capability which has revolutionized online gaming.  The PS2 can't even come close to compare to the XBox's online features, and the graphical capabilities of the system are the best out there (except for the XBox 360).  With the 360 out now though there's really no reason to go out and buy an XBox, unless you want to play some games that won't be played on the 360.  The third party support is also superb, rivaling Sony's with a slew of quality games (and games that aren't very good), along with a solid list of sports titles that translate better here than they do on the PS2.  I'm still not it's biggest fan, but one can't deny that the XBox has left it's mark on the world, and it has cemented itself a spot in video game history.

{"product_name":"B0050SXGU8","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Lohrke","summary":"a great addition to the overly crowded FPS genre.","reviewText":"Crysis 2 is one of my favorite games of all-time, so I had big expectation for Crysis 3.  Does it live it?  Well, for the most part, but I have to admit that for all it's great parts, I also have some misgivings.It's well known that Crysis is famous for its visuals.  That's certainly true here, though I did find the textures a little bit muddier than I was expecting.  Crysis 2's lighting was nothing short of magnificent, but I find it lacking here.  It may be due to the PS3's limitations, but it's disappointing, in my opinion.  What I do like, though, is that six of the seven levels in Crysis 3 are fairly large arenas of battle, giving you plenty of room to maneuver as you like and approach situations via multiple routes. You can pick the enemy off one by one or go in guns blazing. In this regard, it's much more like Crysis 1 than Crysis 2.  Developers seem to take less and less freedom from players these days, so this is a nice change and much appreciated.The nanosuit is largely unchanged, but instead of collecting Ceph DNA to upgrade your suit, you'll find scattered throughout the levels nanosuit kits that will upgrade your lethality.  The SCAR is still the primary weapon, but there's a nice variety of guns and nice updates like varying ammo/arrow times (incendiary, explosive, etc).  Hacking has also been introduced to Crysis 3, but again, it's so incredibly easy that you wonder why it was added in the first place.  I give Crytek credit for trying to bring something to a shooter other than mindless &#34;monster in the closet&#34; shooting.  There are plenty of great battles to be had, but they don't come right away.  It takes a little while to get things going, but when they do, it's a great and fun shooter.However, there are some issues that I need to address.  First and foremost is the very choppy frame rate.  I seem to be getting a lot stutter in this game.  I understand that CryEngine 3 is designed for high end PCs, but Crysis 2 ran infinitely smoother than this iteration.  It was almost to the point of distracting.  It very rarely runs smoothly (interesting enough, this isn't an issue in the multiplayer).  Secondly, it's unbelievably easy on regular setting.  I only died once, and that is when I fell off a ledge and neglected to engage the nanosuit's armor.  Using the bow gives you an unfair advantage because it doesn't drain energy.  You'll end up using the bow most of the time because it's basically shooting fish a barrel.  If you have any experience with FPSs, start on veteran mode.  Also, the AI is still a bit wonky - it's not unusual to see enemy Cell and Ceph running in place against a wall.  But hey, it  just makes them a little easier to take down.And what of the multiplayer?  Well, it seems like it will have legs to last a while longer than, say, &#34;Medal of Honor,&#34; &#34;Homefront,&#34; &#34;Resistance,&#34; and the like. There a good eight or nine game modes.  The most interesting, as others have mentioned, is Hunter mode.  It brings some real tension and frazzled nerves, but the rounds are over WAY to quickly.  The longest Hunter round I've played was about 75 seconds.  The traditional modes are all there - deathmatch, team deathmatch, etc, etc.  My biggest complaint with the multiplayer is that the bow is a one-shot kill.  This encourages campers to sit in the corner with invisibility and a bow.  It's frustrating that my 50 bullets do less damage than 1 arrow, even though I have a metal suit on.  But hey...Lastly, I don't know what it with video game dialogue writers, but I've yet to play a shooter in which the majority of the principle players don't speak in &#34;Bro.&#34;  I think developers severely underestimate their audience.  Crysis 3 has some major groaners.  It's a small criticism, but I'd like to see better dialogue.All and all, I enjoyed this game a lot and recommend you buy it.  Given amazon's pricing history, this should go on sale for $39.99 in the near future.  At that point, it's a must buy.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2013"}

Things do go bump in the night, and that monster you thought was living under your bed as a child, is probably still there, watching you as you sleep.You choose one of three different factions, that really doesn't have much impact on your game, aside from preference. You still can interact with other factions, and even group up with them. You still hunt in the same zone as the other factions, and you even do the same tutorial level.The game it's self has a deep and involved storyline that, depending on the area you are in, is inspired from varios authors ranging from King to Lovecraft. Fans of horror games will find so much to love about this title.The controls are different from other MMORPGs, and it makes no attempt to be an Everquest clone like every other MMORPG out there. This is a double edged sword, in that it might make people who are afraid of new things hesitant to try this unique and remarkable title, but it also forges it's own identity, which is important for not just any game, but any product.The controls and combat isn't the only thing different in this game, as I said it's a unique experience, and has an identity all on it's own. Yes, you do engage in combat, though more often than not, you will find yourself solving puzzles, using google as a research tool, and trying to solve mysteries that surround you, because like in the real world, not everything can be solved with violence.The game is technically free to play, though you do have to buy the game(Sort of like Guildwars and guildwars2), so you don't HAVE to worry about monthly costs, which is a bonus if you are a gamer like me, that doesn't have a whole lot of free extra time on his hands. When you get some spare time, just hop in and play. Easy as that.Bottom line, this is a game you should have in your collection. No matter what type of gamer you are, I am willing to bet you will find something in this title to keep you entertained.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2013"}

The level designs are linear for the most part and player's won't have much trouble navigating the levels and finding where to go. Though the levels are linear, each level has it's own distinct look to it, so environments are not repeated which is pleasing to the eye.Campaign:When playing solo, the game will operate as a normal shooter since you will playing as Pointman. However, the game shines when it comes to the co-op mode. In co-op the game allows the second player to be Paxton Fettel, he plays very differently from the Pointman, using his psychic abilities and mind control techniques against his enemies. He brings in a more dynamic strategy to the combat, he can restrain enemies in the air allowing the Pointman to get an easy shot, he can take control of soldiers allowing him access to their artillery providing fire support for Pointman, and finally he has the ability to give Pointman a shield barrier that makes him more damage resistant in combat. In other words, Paxton is the perfect wingman in combat, his abilities allow for many combat options for the player, whether they want to assist the Pointman from afar with the shielding and levitation powers or possessing a soldier and fighting alongside the Pointman on the frontlines. Whatever character the player chooses to be, the campaign is very fun with two people. The story is hazey at first, but begins to clear up the further you get. The campaign is filled with intense firefights and awesome cut scenes that will leave you saying, \"Holy $#&%!\" The downside is that the campaign is very short, it will not take you very long at all to beat it. Also, and regretfully it is not as terrifying as the last two games, which is a little disappointing.Multiplayer:The game offers two competetive and two co-op modes which offer hours of fun.

It's not that none of the ideas have been tried before (ability to \"slide\" along the ground, massive battles with LOTS going on, etc)...it's that few games have executed these ideas so well, let alone executed them ALL well, and done so in a way that brings them all together very well. Vanquish is, simply put, loads of fun to play. It's not perfect. But it's just so much fun. And that's what gaming is all about (at least, this kind of game), and it's kept me coming back. Few games impart the sense of scale of the battles in Vanquish...LOTS of enemies (and of pretty varied types), bullets flying everywhere, etc. Yet at no point do you feel \"lost\" in it.

Different genres play better on different systems. For instance, racing and light gun (rail shooters) play better on the Wii, because of the Wii Wheel and precise Wii aim motion controls respectively. A lot of Playstation 3 games are 1st person shooter, which are the best on the PC with mouse and keyboard. Fighting games like Mortal Kombat are best on consoles with controllers etc.Playstation is the most normal console out of the big 3, the joystick-controller feels similar to the old consoles of SNES, Genesis, Saturn, etc. Also the Playstation brand has been around awhile.Price-wise$500.00 PS3$250.00 Wii$250.00 Xbox 360The prices above vary depend on the model or whether USED or NEW. But you could get an Xbox 360 and a Wii for the price of a PS3. I've never tried Xbox before but the controller is awkward and weird looking, unfamiliar. A lot of people get the PS3 just for the Blu Ray. But for mainly gamers, the games are most expensive on the PS3.For me I would prefer the PS3 over Microsoft's Xbox 360, because of the more familiar controller and the fact it has been around longer and for me personally, beat out my Sega Saturn along time ago. However the Blu Ray addition seems to make everything PS3 way more expensive... Now I got to pay more for every game than the Wii and Xbox360's versions!?So why get a PS3 over an Xbox 360 and a Wii (combined)? Blu-ray, controller, dependable.My recommendation is get an Xbox 360 and Wii over the PS3. Xbox360 games used and new are a lot cheaper than PS3 counterparts. And Wii is one of a kind.For the money, you should also consider upgrading your PC. Especially if you are into First Person Shooter or Real Time Strategy games, since they're the best on the PC. The PC has tons of games (16,950 listed on Amazon). And it never goes out of date, as opposed to consoles that get dated. Another boon is the vast amount of demos. However, some games make you connect to the internet; software and hardware compatibly may be an issue.

I liked last year's 2K11 but I could not seem to really get into the game much. Honestly, I think last year's version was more difficult overall. So far I have tried to unlock the Dr. J challenge and was unsuccessful...lol Even thought I didn't win to unlock his challenge it was still fun to play. Those old school players still \"got game\" they can ball. I had so much fun with the Legends and My Player modes that I haven't even touched the regular game modes yet. I have officially been drafted in My Player, I had a ball creating my players every nook and cranny...very detailed and so much fun. You can create your players complexion, height, weight, eye color, facial hair, muscular physique, tatoos, equipment ie braces, bands, headbands, socks and sneakers (name brand w/ player endorsed footwear) I have the 2011 Hyperdunks Gray/Black/Red. I was also able to create my players signature style and moves. After I did all of that, I was entered into a pre-draft all-star game being watched by NBA team scouts. I did pretty good 24pts.,(3)rebounds,(2)assists,(4)steals and(4)fouls...yikes. All of your stats are on the top right side of the screen so you can keep an eye on your progress and you also get graded A thru F. The commentators are hard on you if you mess up and will praise you to death if your doing well, they will make comments about if you are draft material or not. This game has a lot of pressure centered around it...all for the best I guess. After this game was over I had(3)interviews one with the Pacers, Suns and the 76ers. I was drafted round (1) pick 13 by the Phoenix Suns. You would have thought I was drafted in real life... it was so exciting. I could go on for ever about the fun I had playing in My Player mode.I am not the greatest NBA 2K player by far, but now I have some motivation to go to the next level and try to get better and be competitive. I thought last year's 2K 11 was ground breaking, but the critics were right this game is by far the best game of all of the NBA 2K series. It makes you wonder what is in store for next year's edition. FYI, I read that because of the current NBA lockout; 2K Sports was forbidden to put any of the current NBA players on the cover of this year's edition (NBA 2K 12). Personally I like the Legends being on the covers. I like the fact that this year, you can choose (1) out of (3) Legends on your copy of the game, that is Michael Jordan, Larry Bird or Erving \"Magic\" Johnson.

And the more mojo you `ve got, the more modes and songs become available to you.IMPROVEMENTSGraphics received a boost, in both details and backgrounds. You prefer singing to dancing? No problem, JD3 comes with all the lyrics showing on the screen for you to accompany your favorite group or singer (no, no points for turning this dancing game into a karaoke but who cares, right?).NEW SONGSIf truth be told at first glance I liked the song collection ofJust Dance 2better. However, I think this will keep happening with every new installment of the series. These games just grow on you. You are having so much fun that the new songs will simply become as dear to you as your old favorites. Give it time.So, yes, the song list may not contain the latest hits but it has some very uplifting dance songs and your list can be enriched online (although not cheaply).This is the COMPLETE LIST of the songs contained in the game, alphabetically:1. 2 Unlimited: No Limit2. A-Ha: Take On Me3. Anja: Dance All Nite4. Aretha Franklin: Think5. Bananarama: Venus6. Black Eyed Peas: Pump It7. Bollywood Dream: Kurio ko uddah le jana8. Cee Lo Green: Forget You9.

So far there are four songs offered online:52.Anja: Baby Don't Stop Now53.Glen Frey: Soul Searching54.Ole Orchestra: Jambo Mambo55.The Girly Team: Twist & Shake ItSure, the Wii may not be the most graphically impressive console. But that never stopped it from offering games that are more fun to experience. Without cameras to constrain you or complicated controls to learn, JD3 on the Wii is a great game for the young of all ages.RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2011"}

This game is so different.  There are hunderds of RPGs, FPSs, simulators, and action/adventure games out there, but there is only one Karamari Damacy.  This game is just...unique.You play as a very tiny Prince.  Your father, the King of the Cosmos, got a bit tipsy the previous night and destroyed all the stars and the moon.  Your job is to roll up everything you can on Earth in order to put together the missing constellations, the North Star, the Moon, and other notable bright spots in the sky.  Also, you can put in a few of your own stars and sprinkle some stardust here and there.The concept sounds strange...rolling up stuff into a giant ball in order to make the sky sparkly again.  However, this makes for what may be the most addicting game one may ever encounter.  After you get a hang of the strange but logical control setup, it becomes unbelievably fun.  The soundtrack fits the game better than most of those to many other games that have been recently released.  Everything in the game just works!Honestly, for $20 bucks this is a bargain on a masterful but short game.  This game is extremely short. However, the replay value is there.  The degree to which you can improve your rolling skills is endless.  Really...$20!!!  That's it!  I bought this for a friend for Christmas and he loved it, and I bought it for myself for my birthday and almost cried my eyeballs out becuase it was so fun...and very cute.You'll have a lot of fun with the Prince and his Katamari.Happy Gaming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2005"}

Well, my son enjoyed it for about 2 days (we don't let them play too long, and they probably played for an hour the first day and a bit less the second) , and my daughter not much longer, but still walks around singing into the microphone. A lot is missing from making this a hit, especially at this price. I was surprised at how weak the graphics are, especially from Konami. The 4 sing-along songs are nice, and were a hit, but there are only 4. Surely they could have included more to keep the kids interest, and to have more variety. The fairy tales are nice, but I prefer reading to my daughter, and my son found it boring. The novelty of recording your voice and changing wore off quickly, and inspite of the microphone feeling solid, I do not think it is of very good quality. We had a few feed back issues, and it just didn't sound crisp. In short, this must have looked great on paper, but when this went into production, I don't think they had their best team working on it....in fact, compared to the quality of graphics, content, etc., available/produceable, this product just is not worth it. If it were half the price, I would consider it, but mostly because of the microphone....which is not saying much for the content. So, why 3 stars? Well, I would have given it 2.5 stars if I had the chance. I should also note that my son enjoys reading books on his own, and likes to challenge himself. My daughter loves when I read to her, but it is usually at night, and she ends up falling asleep.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2010"}
{"product_name":"B003H0CC2O","description":"Set in a futuristic utopia, an elite peacekeeping force thwarts the rumblings of civil war. But deception within the ranks has caused two members of the most feared unit to strike out on their own. Now stranded on an abandoned paradise, Grayson Hunt and Ishi Sato find themselves surrounded by hordes of mutants and flesh eating gangs. They survive on two objectives: get off the planet alive and extract revenge on the man who sent them there. As Grayson Hunt, players wield an arsenal of over-the-top combat moves and outrageously large guns that feed into Bulletstorm&#8217;s distinct &#8216;skillshot&#8217; system producing unprecedented levels of frantic gameplay and yell-inducing satisfaction.","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Bulletstorm Review","reviewText":"I got the chance to play this game's demo and felt completely overwhelmed by all the stuff that I felt you needed to do, but I decided to give the full game a chance just to see if I would have the same experience. Thankfully I did not have the same experience and I actual got into the game. In the game you will be playing as the character, Gray, a super soldier who goes rogue with the rest of his group. Several years after going rogue he sees the chance to take down the man who sent them on all those missions and decides to basically kamikaze the other's ship. Amazingly enough some people survived, you (of course), the man you want to kill, and a couple of others, but you have crashed on this planet. The planet is in disarray and there are gangs that roam the streets looking for control of all that is there. You'll have to fight your way through them if you want to have a chance at getting back at Saranno, the main who sent you on all the missions that you hate yourself for.Graphically this game looks pretty good, there's a couple of locales that you'll get to see through the game, and the character design for the different factions definitely give them a unique look, but then to fill the screen with bad guys its all cut and paste. There are a couple graphical hiccups in the cut scenes where certain things don't completely render, but overall the graphics stand up for this fact paced game.I couldn't tell you one thing about the music in the game, it just didn't stand out. What did stand out was the voice acting, there were quite a few voices in there that left me feeling like I had heard them before. The dialog was above and beyond cheesy, but I think for the most part I was able to forgive the game for it.The controls for the game definitely took a couple scenes before I really got a handle on them. Once I got the controls down, though, man I had a lot of fun quickly attacking, switching weapons, using the electronic tether, and kicking enemies into highly fatal situations. There was also the sliding mechanic of double tapping 'A' that definitely created some interesting scenarios.Overall this game, in my opinion, was made to rack up a high score. Its basically a game in which you want to be inventive on how you dispose of your opponent, and the game definitely gives you some environmental help in that area with large cactus, steep drops, foot carts, highly explosive containers, spinning blades, electric-charged cables, and more. Shooting the crap out of your enemy, then pulling them to you with the tether, then kicking them away, shooting them some more, and then watching them impale yourself can definitely have its moments of utter bliss, and also cause lots of points to pile up. Now there is a reason for the points, they will be used to upgrade your weapons, possibly unlock new ones, and reload your ammo reserves. You can also change what three guns you currently have equiped. For me personally I had the machine gun, the sniper rifle, and the shotgun, and I was hell on wheels with that combo. The game does try to get you to use all the weapons so that you can unlock all the special combos that will bring in the big bucks the first time you successfully do the required action, but after a while I kind of just stuck with what felt comfortable. Fighting your way through all those enemies can at times be really enjoyable, and sometimes frustrating because you will have cleared a section of a room or area, and then as you're trying to spot up to take on some enemies on the other side of the room all of a sudden more enemies appear at your back. So make sure you're protected when using the sniper rifle. That reminds me the sniper rifle is a very unique experience not only do you sight your target but you also control the bullet, apparently everyone in the game, minus you, has beyond human reaction time, so you're going to have to steer the bullet into the opponent if you actually want to hit them, otherwise you're going to miss almost every time unless you're trying to take on one of the bigger characters who can take a couple of rounds without falling. I did have one huge glitch happen to me in one of the levels where I somehow got so far ahead of my CPU companions that I couldn't progress any further, so my advice to you is that whenever you're taking an elevator make sure they are with you, if they are not you might have to replay an entire level all over again.With all the cheesiness and the arcady feeling I still really like the game. Yes it set itself up for a sequel, yes there's probably areas that could be improved, but at the end of the day if you're just looking to blow off steam and destroy enemies Rambo style, with some added flair, this is the game for you. This game gets an 8.3 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

I couldn't really care less about those darned rebels. Obviously, my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high.But you know what? I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised. The game actually wasn't that bad!  It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky. The game really isn't that easy to learn, especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet. There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out, like what right-C does, or how bombs work. But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy. However, the gameplay got to be quite repetitive. I mean, you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky. Yay. There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do, and it gets boring. Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission.I also realized how visually stunning the game is. I have an Expansion Pak, so I really don't have a clue what the game would be like without it, but the graphics are just so crisp, at least certain features. The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great, almost to the level of Half-Life. But the graphics for the people/Storm troopers leave more to be desired. They are obviously sprites. The music does have a Star Wars feel to it, and that's growing on me. I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head, and I don't mind. Most of the music is in the menus, though. 40 minutes of speech is nice, if only I could understand half of it. Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer, which is too bad. It would have been fun. Oh well.

{"product_name":"B006KYYOSO","description":"","reviewerName":"Son of Tiamat","summary":"At least one  fighting game didn't dissapoint","reviewText":"Because that last few fighting games just weren't that good. After Soul Calibur 5 I was worried maybe namco was losing their edge. Just to clarify to all the SC5 fans out there, I wasn't complaining about the new fighting system, just the fact that the game istself was so insubstantial compared to past Soul Caliburs. That said, TTT 2 doesn't dissapoint because it has only what Tekken needed.Tekken Tag Tournament 2 has just about everything a Tekken fan could want. The every increasing roster of Tekken characters has gotten even bigger as characters from past Tekkens make a comeback, including two of my favorites Alex and Kunimitsu, two Tekken characters who definetly didn't get the love they deserved (seriously, who want to play a baby kangaroo?) Returning classic characters include Ogre and True Ogre, Angel, Michelle, Forest Law, P-Jack, Kunimitsu and Tiger. Unfortunately, Ogre, Angel, Michelle and Kunimitsu are all DLC.This is a new Tekken Tag with more ways to use your partner. You can nock your opponent off a bridge or through a wall and press the tag button to have your partner wait at the bottom/other side to quickly move in while your opponents down. You can tag out during combos to keep up airial juggles, similar to the Tag battles in DoA. Tag teem action here is sure to excite and frustrate Tekken fans who have come to appriciate the no holds barred fighting of Tekken.Perhaps the coolest new feature is the fightlab where you can train and customize Combot, returning from Tekken 4, to mix and match moves from other characters to create your own custom fighter. If you've ever played Guilty Gear Isuka and fooled around with Robo-Ky you'll get the idea. Customizing a fighter in Tekken is something I've always wanted to do and the new fight lab comes as an awesome extra. Building up fight points with Combot will involve tackling various challages thrown at by Violet, Lee's alter ego. Admitedly, these can get frustrating and violet's comic relief get's old quick but it's nice they threwn in something extra to do when not getting your but kicked online.Speaking of which, online play is no longer free, which sucks. Unless you buy the game new and get a free code, you'll have to pay ten dollars for an online mode which seems only slightly better than the one in Tekken 6. On the plus side, those of us who did reserve this game got a lot free DLC.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2012"}

All-around great grips; I leave the Vita in them at all times.And now, with the PS4 remote play and second screen support, it is even more welcome.

The story is pretty solid, interesting, and works well to combine the 2 series together.The biggest and most deadly flaw of the game is the game play, It's too complicated. To jump you have to press the D-pad instead of just flicking up on the thumb stick, Movement feels clunky and awkward, and it's real tough to dodge/block an opponent's attack. All the things that should be simple and easy to do are overly complicated to perform, It's a bit of a grind to get use to things. I would highly suggest grinding it out in practice mode for a few hours, Get use to dodging and jumping, Use the time to pick your favorite characters and memorize their combos because combos really help during fights. Really disappointed with this aspect of the game.Another complaint I have is that some of the characters just do not work out well. Some characters are stronger than others and with the weaker characters, You have to focus more on grapples and combos instead of basic attacks because you'd never win without them.
