{"product_name":"B002I0HBZW","description":"","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"A revolution plays it safe.","reviewText":"There are some things that you should know before you go into this game. Even though Team Bondi's L.A. NOIRE has the Rockstar brand on the cover, even though there is some revolutionary technology driving the narrative, and even though 1940s downtown L.A. has been recreated historically to 90% accuracy, this might not be the video game you thought you were buying. I know that it certainly took me by surprise. It's a game that's nothing like Rockstar's previous titles, such as the magnificentRED DEAD REDEMPTIONor the GTA series. Where as those games placed you firmly on one side of the law and attempted to blur the lines, L.A. NOIRE tries the same take from an officer's perspective, albeit with a completely different approach.Though the main storyline takes a backseat for most of the game, you'll follow Detective Cole Phelps as he makes his way up through the hierarchy of the Los Angeles Police Department. Starting as patrolman, you'll eventually find yourself working cases for the traffic, arson, homicide, and vice divisions, with each having its own subplot and cast of characters. Each of these subplots are then broken up further into \"episodes,\" with their own isolated set of investigations, clues, victims, and suspects. When all is said and done, it feels like playing through a full season of LAW AND ORDER.The approach to each of these episodes doesn't vary much. The beginning will introduce you to the crime, after which you follow the clues around 1940s L.A. until you have a decent pool of evidence going. To gather this evidence, you'll be asked to walk the crime scene and other places of relevance until your character notices something, at which point you'll enter an examination mode of sorts and take a closer look at whatever it was you've picked up. Sometimes the things you can examine will be junk, but anything that adds to your case will be logged away for further use.In the natural course of compiling evidence, a list of suspects and witnesses will start to present itself. This is where interrogations come in, what you'll very likely end up spending 85% of the game doing. And it's also where the game's technology comes into play.Thanks to real-time facial motion capture, the characters you come into contact with in L.A. NOIRE aren't like anything you've seen in any other video game. L.A. NOIRE relies on real, acted performances instead of just voice acting, providing a sense of realism and immersion that few games have managed to attain. When interviewing a suspicious witness, a flick of the eyes and a nervous gulp might give him away, while a firm, eye-to-eye stare might convince you the suspect is telling the truth. This also makes the drama and the character interactions just seem so much more real, like you were watching a very, very good crime series instead of just playing a video game.But that is where my gripes with the game come into play. For the most part, L.A. NOIRE doesn't really play like your average video game and is more like a TV series with interactive moments. 1940s L.A. has been recreated with astounding attention to detail, but the game doesn't encourage exploration at all. The story is constantly in play, and while diverging away from your next waypoint is definitely allowed, it just feels... wrong. It doesn't feel like you should be driving around at random, exploring things, seeing the sights. That certainly might not be the case for some players, but I tried free roaming a grand total of one time and felt uncomfortable doing so. Like, as an adult, I should know better.And those playable parts of the game are gradually, over the course of this 20 to 25 hour game, worn down by repetition. Confronting a suspect will usually always end in some kind of dramatic and destructive chase, either on foot or by car, regardless of the suspect's guilt. Interrogations lose some of their shine once you realize that even most of the innocent people will find any reason to lie to you. And since the game doesn't allow you to undo your choices or missteps during interrogations without reloading the game to an earlier autosave, some of the confrontations can get old really fast.With that, the gameplay stops feeling like the focus of the game and more like a means to an end, because outside all of the driving, the car/foot chases, and interrogations, there is a stellar story going on in the foreground against a realistic setting. The writing is pitch perfect to the point where you'd almost expect the developers had lived through the time period. Events and rhetoric from the time are constantly making their way into the script. Hollywood is beginning is rise as the entertainment capital of the world, the stars on film are brighter than the ones in the sky, and capitalism is in full swing in post-war L.A. Advertisements are everywhere, there's a cigarette in everyone's hand, the beginnings of the Second Red Scare are making its way onto the radio.Playing the game really did feel like stepping back in time, and that's why it gets four stars from me. It felt like an experience more than a game. In fact, sometimes I was so absorbed by the plot twist and the minute details of the setting and of the script, that when everything eventually stopped and I was back in control of Detective Phelps again, I had to wake up and remind myself, \"Oh, yeah... I have to play this thing.\"","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2011"}

With multiple endings, three styles of combat (party, army, and one-on-one battles), and the ability to recruit from over 100 characters throughout your quest,Suikoden IIIraises the bar for RPGs everywhere. Also new to both the series and the RPG genre is the Trinity Sight System, which enables players to experience events from the viewpoints of three different characters.","reviewerName":"Timothy Lovett","summary":"Different Viewpoints, Same Story, Beautiful","reviewText":"The greatest aspect of this game had to have been its usage of the system which allowed the user to see the same scene from different points of view. While you start off completely disliking one character for their portrayal in the eyes of another you quickly understand their point of view as you begin to control them later on.It just adds a new twist to the way RPGs are played and helps to make what would seem like an interesting story into a classic. The story itself is interesting but nothing too dramatic or world view changing. General evil power out to destroy so you must counter by becoming stronger and facing off with it plot. It is interesting, however, in the way the characters interact and the different factions at work in the story. What the stock lacks it definitely makes up for through this.As mentioned in other areas the six man teams is a bit awkward although the usage of ridden animals makes me glad they did use it. It does allow you to customize a rather large party and keep people leveled up easily but probably isn't worth its benefits just because of the added complexity.Side quests are really fun in this game though. One thing you'll notice is that as you collect more of the stars more of your home base is unveiled. So once you collect a farmer, for example, now you can farm food yourself at your home base and so on. It's an interestingly fun way to open up mini games which keep you coming back for more.Another great aspect of the game is the war mode. You assign your characters to squadrons and battle off against incoming troops so you really have to be strategical how you layout your team.Suikoden seems like a solid story. This particular one had an interesting plot and while it wasn't ground breaking was delivered in a unique way which adds to the user's enjoyment. I suggest playing it although it is kind of dated at this point.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2008"}

Reneau \"Mound of Wires\"","summary":"Wow!","reviewText":"Anyone who owned and loved either an SNES and N64 is almost undoubtedly sure to love the Mario Kart series. When it debuted on SNES about a decade ago, we were all instantly in love with it. When the N64 sequel rolled out a few years later, those who hadn't already jumped on the bandwagon were pretty much guaranteed to do so. In fact, that game is probably the best game in the series. Years went by and Nintendo fans saw the release of a GameCube version called \"DoubleDash\" and a GBA version that payed homage to the original. Though both games were fun in their own right (\"Baby Park\" anyone?.....anyone?), they just didn't really reinvent the wheel or bring anything exciting to the Mario Kart table. Mario Kart DS is a game that can possibly reverse this trend.Being exclusively designed for a handheld system, Mario Kart DS really has its work cut out for it. Seeing as how the other MK games relied heavily on its multiplayer environment, how could a handheld recreate this mayhem? Well, fortunately, the development team over at Nintendo has put a lot of work into this game.First, there's single player mode, where you can choose from Grand Prix, Time Trials, Versus Match, and Battle Mode. That's right! Mario Kart DS supports bot-matches. So if you want to just race one opponent, you can! If you want to enter a battle arena and bust some balloons, you can do that too! This incredibly helpful when it comes to recreating the multiplayer environment. Additionally, the Grand Prix mode has a plethora of unlockable Karts, Characters, and other assorted goodies. Surely, if you want to just play all by your lonesome, there are a lot of options to keep you going for the long haul.When it comes to multiplayer, Mario Kart DS isn't really lacking either. All of these game modes are available to play with multiple DS's and you can even play using just one DS cartridge and multiple systems! The real enjoyable feature on the game is really the Wi-Fi Connect Mode which allows players to connect with up to 3 other people and play \"best-out-of-4\" matches based on certain criteria that you decide. It really adds to the longevity of the game and will continually have you coming back for more.The development team has decided to keep the classic control scheme for this version of Mario Kart, only utilizing the touch screen for menu-navigation. However, they did utilize both screens on the system, using the top for classic display and the lower screen as a map which displays your position in the race as well as any items that may be headed towards you. This adds so much strategy to the game that it's insane and hard to imagine going back to a single-screen setup ever again.Additionally, the game features 32 different maps, 16 of which are classic maps from every previous game in the Mario Kart lineup! I can't begin to explain how much fun it is to go ack and play Choco Mountain or Moo Moo Farm from the N64 version, or even Mushroom Bridge from DoubleDash (No DK Jungle though...drats!). That being said, the new maps aren't lacking much. They are very well designed and feature several little shortcuts to help you out if you get a little behind.Overall, this is a great game! It has the creativity that one has come to expect from Nintendo with the pleasant surprise of lasting appeal, something that is often missing on handhelds. This game is a blast!Recommended for Mario Kart fans and anyone looking to justify their purchase of a Nintendo DS.5 out of 5 Stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000WEQL02","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"A Shooter for the Intelligent Gamer","reviewText":"Gameplay - 9 of 10RSV2 stands out in a crowd of shooter and FPS games that inundate the markets today. As a tactical shooter you have to actually use your brain to stay alive - much like real life. The action is SWAT type. In this case you're hunting down terrorists. Being able to kill quickly and efficiently will keep you alive the longest. Running into a room guns blazin' will get you killed quicker than you can say Halo. A full cover system is implemented just as in the first game. You're able to hide behind anything that will not expose your body and some that you can still be killed while behind. You are then able to reveal yourself from the side or the top of the cover. Here you'll need to stay behind metal or dense materials to prevent getting killed while behind cover.You're of course able to pick up dropped weapons left from dead terrorists. A really nice feature is the ability to mark two enemies at a time with red boxes over their heads. You're teammates-Michael and Jung can then target them first. Along with this thermal satellite is available on occasion to see where enemies lurk. Snake cams for under doors is a great help and almost necessary to keep you from getting killed. So many real life gadgets were implemented into the game to provide amazing gameplay. For some reason this game was not marketed at all or it might have done much better.Features - 7 of 10Unfortunately RVS2 is not a feature filled game. You have three essential parts: your achievements (rank and A.C.E.S.) terrorist hunts and online play. Despite this it keeps you captivated. Your rank follows the hierarchy of military protocol, you'll start out as a Private and by gaining experience eventually get to the rank of Elite. Experience is gained by killing terrorists; 10 xp on the realistic difficulty 5 xp for normal and 3 xp for casual. If either Michael or Jung kills someone you'll earn half of the aforementioned xp, unless they are \"marked.\" Along with this you have three other ways of ranking up much much quicker. This is called A.C.E.S. Within this you have Marksman, CQB (close quarters battle) and Assault. For example, if you kill someone who is very close you'll get CQB points normally 2 or 3 at a time. On the other hand if you shoot someone in the head, you'll get points for Marksman. So on and so forth. On the lower levels you may only need 100 CQB or Assault points to the next level and the reward.After reaching a certain number of A.C.E.S. points you'll level up. This is separate from ranking up. And with the level up you'll earn rewards such as new camo, weapons or clothes. Terrorist hunts are a way to hone your skills to advance in the storyline or play better online. There are a dozen or so maps loaded with terrorists waiting to kill you. These are also a good way to gain rank. Online play is an absolutely necessary part to today's videogames. RSV2's online play is pretty standard, kill the most of the opposing team's players to win is one of the few game types. Surprisingly it is fun. People are a lot less high strung here than on other online games. If you've played Counter Strike back in the day this resembles that. You're able to pick all your equipment at the beginning of the game or at your respawn. The maps are direct derivatives of the mission maps.Story - 5 of 10Bishop is your character and he appears to have been with Rainbow Six for a while now. He looks like a man of 45-50 years old. The first mission is diffusing a bomb in the Alps or something which was five years ago. Essentially you kill terrorists and then the classic Greek tragedy happens.!!!!! Spoiler !!!!!!Bishop's old friend and teammate is behind all of the terrorists and is the person you've been chasing the whole game. I'm not really sure how much more clich&eacute; you can get. But I didn't buy the game for the story so it really isn't a big deal.!!!!!!Spoiler!!!!!!!!Weapons and Armor - 8 of 10Possibly my favorite part of the game is the weapon choice you're given. Submachine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, pistols and assault rifles are all on the itinerary. What makes the weapons quality is that they are all real. From the classic HK MP5 to the P90, these guns are what bring true realism to the game. Each has characteristics of range, damage, accuracy and magazine size. And the differences show. There are also tons of add-ons and changes that can be made to the weapons. Laser sight, ACOG scope, rifle scopes and many more accessories are available. Explosives come in six types: frag, incendiary, C4, smoke, flashbang and breaching charge.The weapons are just so well executed. Being able to change the rate of fire is really impressive. Some weapons even have three rates of fire. Each weapon has a clear difference when shot as well. When you shoot the shotgun, the recoil throws your aim off by about 5 feet, while the SMGs will take a whole clip to do the same. When you hit the enemy there is a satisfaction when the bullet hits. The real challenge is being disciplined enough not to blow all your clips. Accuracy is paramount not only to survive, but also so you don't have to pick up the lame terrorist's weapons. My only qualm with the weapons is you're not able to use some of them until you get quite deep into the higher ranks.Graphics and Animation - 6 of 10The graphics are forgettable at best. Weapons and people look decent and have a good amount of detail, but lack the super realism everyone is wanting now. The rest of the visuals really resemble a polished xbox game instead of a 360 game. Light and reflection seem to be missing. Most lines are blurry and the detail is unfortunately an afterthought. The guns do however look very close to their real life component. Camo has the most detail in that the shapes are clearly defined and lines give a very realistic way to hide your character. If you're a graphics connoisseur more than a gamer, you'll be underwhelmed. Animation and character mapping on the other hand, is fairly lifelike. When you shoot, the weapon recoils and Bishop's shoulder moves back. When you kill a terrorist, he falls to the ground in a heap, instead of doing a double backflip like in the movies.Controls - 9 of 10I hardly ever give a perfect score to one aspect of a game, and this is no exception. However the controls in RSV2 are just brilliant. The right trigger does what you'd think-shoot. Left trigger is the cover button, which makes a lot of sense. These are the two things you'll be doing the most. The (A) button gives orders to tell your teammates where they should be. (B) throws grenades. (X) brings up a graphic which changes your weapons add-ons and rate of fire etc. (Y) changes your weapons (this can be done more quickly by just tapping (Y) instead of holding it.) Right bumper gives night vision or thermal goggles. The D-pad allows you to determine where and what type of grenades your teammates should throw. The back button switches from weapons free (shoot on sight) to return fire only. The control sticks do what they always do. Grenade throwing is the only serious downside. It is VERY slow and clumsy. You'll hit the (B) button and the delay is about 2 seconds. Not to mention you can't throw accurately more than 15-20 feet.Conclusion1.) Top notch gameplay2.) Rock solid cover system3.) Extensive real life weapons cache4.) Controls that rival the best FPS5.) Rewards for leveling upIf you're looking for a departure from the normal shooters, you might find this to be a diamond in the rough and an easily overlooked game. 7.5 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2008"}

Those of you familiar with the last one, know what to basically expect, those of you not....well be prepared.  You are hammered by a non-stop barrage of aliens, mostly alien insects and spiders.The real step up from the last one is the graphics and of course the online co-op.  Basically in campaign mode you have 3 levels to play, each level has 5 chapters.  This of course is MUCH shorter than the previous game, however the game has evolved a lot.  You now can select from 4 different classes, and each class has a special ability.  You also level up your character which in turn unlocks new weapons you can purchase.  Additionally you get random enemy drops (from the larger enemies, not the swarm enemies) that are class specific. The entire campaign is drop in/drop out....unless the host quits, in which case the game ends and you have to start again from the begining of that chapter if you choose.  This is an area I have a gripe, because you cannot just start a new public game to make certain you are the host...the game first looks to insert you in an existing game, if none exist it creats a new one with you as host.The campaign mode has 3 difficulties...Normal, Hard and Inferno.  Hard is quite hard....have not beaten it yet, still on chapter 3-4. There are 2 additional modes, one is Campaign Remix and the other is Survival.  Campaign remix also allows you to select your difficulty and the maps are the same as the campaign, however the placement/type of enemies are different and the drops seem considerably more numerous.  Survival is basically horde mode where you and up to 5 others try to survive wave after wave of enemies.  Another gripe is the there is only 1 class you can choose for this mode...why they did this I am not sure.  Basically if you level say your tactician up (as I did), you then cannot use him in Survival mode you can only select the trooper class.  Kinda dumb.The Co-op is lag free from what I have experienced.  It is also pretty well populated.  Sometimes I have hosted, sometimes not.  Even when I hosted, I always had people entering my game within a couple of minutes.The great thing about this game is it really is cooperative, you actually need your teammates to not suck.  The game also will have you playing over and over trying to collect better weapons and upgrade your character....both of which are a SERIOUS grind.  So basically what you are getting for $40 is a fun, online experience, a deep game with very high replayability.  The game is pretty old-school shooter for the most part, it has some strategic and RPG elements, but really it is a cooperative shooter more like an evolution of Contra type games of old.  Probably will not win any gaming awards, but will keep you busy at least a couple of weeks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SW4OC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Fox, Badgerlord","summary":"One of the best games Fore the Vita","reviewText":"Gameplay 5/5While I do enjoy a game of Golf in real life here and there, I am by no means even remotely close to good at it. I much prefer to play my golf indoors in the electronic format, and as silly as some of this game is it really captures the spirit of a good golf game. You don't play as known pros or even on real courses instead you have 14+ different players each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some can hit really far but end up slicing or hooking the ball too much while others have a much easier time hitting the fairway, just not very far.The game is easy to learn and difficult to master (Hey just like Real golf!). You start out with only basic Clubs, Balls, Characters etc... and as you play through the games challenge mode you get points you can then use as currency to buy things at the shop as they unlock. The bought items can change how your play style works from adding more shot distance at the cost of control, or giving you better control over the spin of your ball over impact etc... As you play through the Challenge mode you eventually unlock a vs. match with another character, beating them unlocks the next level of challenges as well as the ability to purchase that character from the shop.As for the actual game of golf itself, I feel this game has really brought together all that makes golf great (And yet EXTREMELY frustrating). You can be having a great round but one bad shot and you can end up aging 5 strokes to your score you didn't intend to and ruin your entire round. But this is not the games fault; if you hit the ball poorly it's because you the player messed up or used the wrong club. Not once has the game lagged and caused me to fail, or done something it shouldn't to mess my ball up. Golf is a sport of patience and accuracy, set up your shot and takes your time or you will end up in the sand. As you progress you will learn how to put spin on the ball to manipulate it to go around trees or stop rolling once it hits the green etc...Multiplayer 5/5I don't normally play multiplayer anything, but this game has done something quite magical with it's online play. There are two ways to play the game online, there are daily tournaments and lobby mode.Daily TournamentsThese are basically exactly like the challenge modes in Single player accept you are against other players. You play alone and your score is uploaded to a server, at the end of the day you get a rank based on your score in comparison to the others, and you get Tournament points based on the rank. Those points are turned into curreny points to buy things at the shop, and your online rank will change. There are three tournaments every day, A Front nine, a Back Nine, and a full 18 hole tournament.Lobby ModeThis works slightly differently. You enter the lobby and you can see other players walking around. Here you set up a tee time (say 8:15pm) you then log into the game at 8:10pm to prepare for your match. Then each player (up to 30) all play the hole at once. You are given 3 minutes to finish each hole. Once your done you wait until the time is up and can talk with the other players, congratulate (or berate) others for their play and continue on to the next hole. Obviously the player with the lowest score wins. These tournaments also come with sets of rules, some have unlimited Power shots, some say using a power shot adds 2 strokes, and others limit the level of player your allowed to use (novice only for example). All of these combine to create an enjoyable and so far friendly atmosphere in the game, I really enjoyed my time playing online.Graphics 5/5The Courses are custom built, meaning that they don't exist in reality and were designed by the game makers. They are beautifully made and while the avatars are cartoon-ish, they also look very well done, along with an array of different outfits and unlockables to go with them.Vita based Controls:This game uses the touch screen and rear touch screen but very rarely. The touch screen can only be used to... rather dully navigate the main menu (I just use the buttons not the screen). The Rear touch pad actually is far more useful, and one of the better uses of that technology. As your aiming your shot you can rub your finger along the back of the PSV and you can see where the ball would land if you shot it to the spot where your finger is at the time, as well as the distance of the next shot you will need to hit, it has become quite useful in determining where I want to drive the ball. I don't like using the front touch screen for anything in a game apart from basic menu navigation so this works really well for me.Final Thoughts:I love golf, and I love how this game's multiplayer works as well as the ability to buy and unlock more things as you progress in the game. It's a fantastic addition to the PSV lineup and I have found myself playing this game more than any other I have for the Vita so far.Overall Score 5/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2012"}

One thing is certain, in this city, you will learn how to run.","reviewerName":"Maria Marienthal","summary":"Fun game, but as always EA is sloppy","reviewText":"Mirror's Edge is THE cutting edge of game design.  The gameplay was daring, the setting signature, and the cutscenes not at all boring.  I encourage everyone to play this game for the sheer value of trying something new, and here's why...THE PROS-Stunning gameplay.  You play as Faith, a returning Runner.  Her sister has been framed for a political murder, and you have to investigate.  Faith moves like a phantom over and under obstacles, sliding along ziplines and landing like a cat.-When you get her adrenaline pumping she can slip into \"Reaction Time\" aka Bullet Time.  This makes disarming your enemies and dodging bullets much easier.  Unlike Bullet Time, such as in Max Payne, Reaction Time only comes available after a series of momentum-oriented activities are completed.-A flipping good challenge!  This is exactly what I was looking for, something new and interesting.  The learning curve isn't too steep either, but the game increases in challenge steadily.  You won't be bored.-Pacifist combat is the way to go.  This game doesn't tempt you like Metal Gear Solid 4 by dumping oodles of weapons in your inventory and then offer you a reward for not killing anyone.  In fact, you don't have an inventory.  The best method in most situations is to dash for your life and seek an out for ever hot pursuit...and trust me there are many.  If shooting people is your thing, you can definitely do that.  Hanging onto weapons is impossible, and you never know how many rounds you are packing..25 rounds max in a machine gun.-I am happy that they implemented Runner Vision into this game.  On the Normal and Easy settings, the proper routes are highlighted in red.  Thankfully EA was intuitive enough to realize how disorienting their game can be and implemented a nice way to track your position.-The first person view makes this game.  On every leap of faith (and they don't call it that for nothing) you will hold your breath and hope you don't plummet to your death.  Success is infinitely rewarding.  As Faith grasps ledges, you see her hands.  When she tumbles you roll with her.  You see her legs and body as though you yourself were rolling.  As your sprints and her biped maneuvers cause you to blink as you question her reality, she feels the pressure and you can hear her tiring.  But Faith never stops.-The intellectual challenge of solving puzzles is also fun.  It is not all sprinting across rooftops and sliding down pipes.  every so often they will toss in a puzzle in which you need to figure out where the heck you need to go.  These also become more challenging as the game progresses, so keep your eyes open.-This is fundamentally an urban ninja first-person simulator.  Everyone was thinking about this the first time they saw it.  Parkour artists, such as Faith, are today's super-athlete modern ninjas who live up to the wall-crawling lore better then true historical ninjas.-The control scheme is quite good.  It places a lot of responsibility on the left hand, all of the personal reaction time functions needed, such as jumping and sliding.  Once you get used to it though, it will make perfect sense.-She's quite the cute acrobat.  Let's be serious.  There are many female gamers that will be pleased to see a woman playing the main role.  Plus, Parkour is predominantly a male sport but is slowly diversifying.  Faith herself represents the growing popularity of Parkour to a wider audience of able bodies, regardless of sex.-Transitioning from games like Fallout 3 and Mercenaries 2 in which technology was the overriding source of information, Mirror's Edge forces gamers to use the most low-tech solution to figuring out one's location, the human eye.  There are no word maps, not GPS.  Just you, Faith, and the rooftops.-It looks good and sounds great.  For those among us who have been spoiled by the gorgeousness of Metal Gear Solid 4, Mirror's Edge (and every other game for that matter) is a downgrade in terms of graphics.  Don't get me wrong though, the visuals are a Pro because they are still beautiful.  Lighting effects and textures look realistic.  It looks as though the designers really took advantage of the Blu-Ray capacity for expansive good looks.  When on the rooftops, the view is stunning...ongoing...surreal.THE CONS-Electronic Arts is one of the most disappointing game production companies as of recent.  EA has so much money and potential, but they have nosedived in terms of editing sloppy gameplay.  They put all of their attention into sports games... and even those can be sloppy...it is hard to screw up The Sims.  Going into this game, I had high expectations, many of which were met.  However, I anticipated that EA would be very sloppy with this production, and they were.  If you played Mercenaries 2, you will understand what I mean by sloppy... unresponsive controls... inaccurate animations...  they could have done much better.-The game oftentimes feels imprecise.  You will experience a series of flawless vaults and slides when the game suddenly does not connect with what you thought you have done perfectly....and then you fall off of a high place and die.  Again, EA was sloppy.  They tried to make this game too linear, but the purpose of Parkour is to roam everywhere, to go places where most average people would get owned, but the Parkour artist succeeds.-To my knowledge this game does not keep a death count, and that is probably a good thing.  You will die a lot, especially on your first try, mainly in gun fights.  I didn't dislike this because it is part of the challenge... one foul-up is game over.  This, however, is not good for causal gamers.  Casual gamers may struggle with this game for that reason.  For those who desire a new and better challenge at every game, a few dozen deaths will not be a problem.Seriously...we all know that sloppy gameplay can negatively affect a game.  EA needs to shape up.  This was their second opportunity to match the likes of MGS4 and Grand Theft Auto 4 in terms of exquisite gameplay and they FAILED.  Please improve...you have the potential and the cash to pull off perfection and we want to see you continue beyond mind boggling concepts and produce mind bogglign gameplay.OVERALL...Mirror's Edge is a fascinating game.  It isn't a masterpiece as it should have been, thanks to EA's lazy editing.  It is definitely worth checking out.  I am pleased with my purchase and will play it in the future.  Simply put, there is nothing like it on the market.  Assassin's Creed doesn't come close.  If you want a truly unique experience, buy or rent this game and play it through at least three times... yeah buy it.  The first time will give you the story and get you acquainted with the controls.  The second run-through will be smooth and enjoyable.  On the third run you'll be kicking some serious booty and disarming SWAT soldiers in pristine style.I'd give this game a 9/10 (unfortunately I can't give 4.5 stars).  Awesome concept, but the execution could have been better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2008"}

City of Heroes is a fun and quite different spin from the Massively Multiplayer Online formula.The character creation system is undoubtedly the best character creation system in any massive online game, period.  There are so many options to choose from that you may spend hours just creating the character alone!  You can choose to have a 2 color scheme or customize the colors for each part of the costume.  The face and mask choices are limited but the markings and design are usually what set the people apart from each other.  You will see characters that are more than just 'inspired' by existing comic book heroes, but then you will also see very unique designs at the same time.Despite the many options there are still limits and numbers...even when you think you have the most unique character on the server, you will probably run into several players with similar characters.  In fact, one problem I noticed was that many players would blatantly copy the design from another character.  I was one of the first characters on launch day on the 'Virtue' server, and received dozens of compliments on my ninja-esque character.  Then within the week, I saw at least 8 or 9 people with virtually identical design to my character...everything from the color choices to the designs and clothing/accessory choices.  So even in a game with thousands of possible combinations, you will still have lazy, uncreative people blatantly copying each other's designs...one of the game's lowest points.As for the gameplay, it is fun for a while, but extremely linear.  One of the best parts is that unlike other Massive Online Games, you get powers and abilities early on, and continue to get powers at 2 level intervals.  Hence, every even-numbered level you will gain a new power of your choice.  The subsequent odd-numbered levels will grant you 2 slots for enhancements, which significantly boost your powers, so even the power you get at your lowest level can become one of your most powerful by the later levels.  You gain enhancements by defeating enemies, or buying them at special shops with 'Influence' which is the game's currency.  You gain influence by defeating enemies and by rescuing citizens from thug attackers. You can even ban together with other heroes and form Super Groups.The fighting is fun, and grouping is more fun in this game than in any other.  It is fast paced, and you don't just sit there bored out of your mind after hitting one button, watching your character hit and miss.  You actually control your character through the whole fight, using whatever powers and abilities the character has to fight off the villains.  Unlike some other massive online games, namely EQ, you don't have to wait around for hours on end for that one significant enemy to pop up, then argue amongst yourselves about who gets the loot...there are always PLENTY of enemies around in huge groups.As for 'quests', there are missions you can receive from contacts that you meet through your trainers.  These missions are usually specifically tailored for you, and if you consistantly take missions aimed at one super-villain group, you will find that villains will begin ambushing you, and you will eventually fight the super-villain leader of the group.  The amount of enemies in the mission varies depending on how many people you group with, usually increasing the difficulty and experience table.  There are also massive missions equivalent to 'raids' called 'Task Force Missions' in which a team of heroes work together to fight a series of missions, usually resulting in a battle with one of the super-villains in the game.  These Task Forces usually take over 3 hours.If it sounds great so far, you might want to know about the game's biggest downfall: boring repetition.  The game is unfortunately the equivalent of a 'level treadmill' in that there is nothing else in the game to do except fight, fight, fight and level.  There is nothing else going for the game, and while the gameplay is alot of fun, and earning those new powers is always a good feeling, the game just becomes too repetetive.  It is also too easy...the frighteningly fanatical players who play nearly 24/7 can reach the character's maximum level(40 at launch, increased since the patches) in probably under a week and a half.  Once you reach the maximum level, there really is nothing else to do, unless you feel like starting a new character.You may have noticed I left the 'RPG' part out of Massively Multiplayer Online Game.  This is simply because CoH suffers from the same thing all Massive Online Games do...other players usually throw a tantrum and complain about roleplaying.  My friends and I were kicked out of groups for roleplaying, which is simply ridiculous.  Hence I do not hold the 'RPG' part of Massive Online Games to be fact, since the majority of players seem to think of it as evil.  Try roleplaying your character around other players and you'll see what I mean.Overall, the game is great and is a welcome change from the usual massive online game.  Unfortunately for me, I was bored within one month and I cancelled my account.  However, in that one month, I definitely got my money's worth.  It is probably also the longest time I've spent on any Massive Online Game since I left the abysmal EQ 3 years ago.  So, coming from someone who HATES Massive Online Games like this, I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a change.  It is fun, at least for a while, and if you find that you truly like the game and want to stay on it, then that's great.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Robert evans","summary":"One of the Best Systems ever....","reviewText":"This system had such a great variety of game...hell it almost beat PSX...N64 put simply...isA CLASSIC!!!!It came out with some of the most well respected games ever...Classics....Lets take a look at them...EXCLUSIVE N64 GAMES...Mario64Legend of Zelda:Ocarina of TimeConker's Bad Fur DayPaper MarioMario PartyDoom 64F ZeroPerfect DarkTurokTurok 2Turok 3Turok Wage warsA few Mortal Combat games....Duke Nukem:Zero HourLegend of Zelda: Majoras MaskOther Mario Pary games...Super Smash Bros.Duke Nukem 64..And more I think....N64 lasted very well....It had a great long journey of games....Never will this system be forgoten...But this system ain't No Dreamcast I can tell ya that but then again this system came out a few years before Dreamcast..Now If you're looking for the main N64 titles then I recommend..Conker's Bad fur dayPerfect DarkLegend of Zelda Ocarina of TimePaper Mario...F zeroSuper Smash Bros.If anyone is thinking of getting an N64 GET IT!

W. Mullins","summary":"Great game, but evolutionary not revoloutionary","reviewText":"I have been waiting since the first Modern Warfare game for this game. Was it worth they wait? I would have to say yes, does it break the Call of Duty mold? Not really.The fist issue I have is with the difficulty settings, most everyone should be able to enjoy and play through the game on the easiest setting, but from there up the difficulty ramps up for faster than it should The Regular setting on WM2 feel much more like the Veteran setting on MW. This is a hard game for all but the best FPS players. You will die while fighting off wave and waves of bad guys that never stop spawning. That is part of the COD recipe for sure but it makes it particularly frustrating on levels like the Rio slums level. Where you have guys spawning from every direction, none stop and all of whom are master marksman. You will die constantly. I think they could have done better with upping the difficulty a little better at each level. The difference between the easiest setting and the next on up is extreme. The entire game feels more like the plane level on MW on any setting.The weapon selection for everything but pistols is great. You can't pick you load out but you will come across so many weapons that finding one you like isn't an issue. Many of the weapons are kitted out with optics and whatnot similar to the multiplayer mode in MW. There is also a huge assortment of weapons in the game. Where I find them lacking is in the pistol department, there are plenty of M9s, USPs, G18s and Desert Eagles, but it doesn't come anywhere close to the selection avilable for long arms. As hard as they worked to focus on accuracy I don't know why they felt it fit to are the US Army Rangers with Desert Eagle pistols. Their incorporation of the UAV is very well done but it doesn't take you out of the fight the same way the AC130 level did in the first one.The story is well told and the voice acting is good. But the story is way out there, more James Bond super villain than modern military action like the first one way. There are plenty of twists and turns in the story but I think they could have done it better. The ending in particular is poor for a military style FPS. While you really felt like a military man or SOF operators in the first on the story for the second doesn't do it quite as well. I wish they would have stuck more with the Tom Clancy style of plausible story than what they came up with. The campaign is also painfully short, even more so than Modern Warfare. To be fair many player will pick up MW2 almost exclusively for the online play, but they showed in Modern Warfare that it was possible to craft an amazing and accurate campaign and muliplayer in one package.The online play is great and I have had no issues with maps or the network yet. The ladders to unlock weapons and attachment is nothing new to MW vets and is done fairly well. I have issue with the heartbeat sensor, but that might just be me. The Special Forces mode is a good addition for people who prefer to play with their friends against the computer than to play against other players online. Though the SF mission are insanely hard, even on the lowest setting. They also don't have the same 'feel' of the campaign which is good I guess, but it makes it feel more arcade like than COD usually does. People who are prone to throw controllers might want to have some extras on hand for the veteran level setting.The only thing about this game that disappoints me is the lack of coop campaign play. There is no point in the campaign where you find yourself all alone or where it would be odd to have a human controlled squad mate. I am glad they made the Special Ops mode and it is a lot of fun. But playing through the huge world changing campaign would only be made better if you could live it out with your best buddy online. If they could make it work in COD:WaW I know that they could have been done even better in Modern Warfare 2.All said Modern Warfare 2 is a great game, good multiplayer, good campaign and well polished controls. Does it live up to the hype surronding the game? I don't think so, its a great game, but I don't think it stood a chance with as much as it was hyped. Is it a great new addition to the COD series? absolutely. Will it the best shooter of 2009, I don't know but it will be hard to beat. It is definietly one of the best shooter of the year, if not one of the betters ones ever made. If you are a COD fan already you've probably already got the game in your console. If you are sitting the fence and your a fan of the FPS you shouldn't miss this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life.

{"product_name":"B001E8VB6O","reviewerName":"Greg Sword \"DETfaninATL\"","summary":"Just what a videogame should be : Straight-forward & FUN!","reviewText":"As a lover of both great action / adventure games and comic books alike, BATMAN : ARKHAM ASYLUM was both a treat and something of a surprise to me. I grew up a Marvel kid (and remain one to this day) although I always enjoyed the Batman character because he had no superpowers to speak of - just a seemingly unlimited supply of cash and a mind greater than most. That was what set him apart for me, from so many of the superheroes I loved. So it was a real treat to be able to get to play nearly every aspect of what I liked so much about Batman. What caught me off-guard, I guess, was just how differently this game played than so many others I had just played and what I was used to about the action / adventure genre itself - the focus on sheer stealth.THE GOOD : As I just mentioned, it was a lot of fun to don the cowl of the Batman and sleuth my way through the grime and decay of Arkham Asylum, employing all of Batman's myriad of gadgets, from Batarangs to exploding gel to gliding elegantly and soundlessly with his cape, in an effort to stop the Joker's latest maniacal scheme and beat his henchmen and fellow bad-guys down. As an added bonus the game also gave you `Detective Mode' which enabled you to see through walls, find grapple points and discover hidden items. And when it came to fighting, the moves were fun to execute, neat to watch and the `slowed-down / Matrix-like' bullet-time effect that culminated every fight was quite cool. But what REALLY made the game so fun was how responsive and easy the controls were. Whether you were gliding and suddenly needed to just drop to avoid detection or whether you needed to string together a chain of punches, dodges, counter-attacks and cape-stuns in a melee fight, it was all super-responsive and very easy to execute, but not so much so that it made the game a breeze. Also, as I mentioned previously, something that really caught me off-guard was the game's heavy focus on stealth. Maybe because I was so used to games like the God Of War series, or Bayonetta when it came to action adventure games, I wasn't quite prepared for all the sneaking around and having to be patient for the right time to strike.  After a while though, I came to quite enjoy this approach, as it just made the beat-downs that much more fun, when you finally got the chance to unload on the baddies. Something else that ARKHAM ASYLUM had to offer was the Riddler Challenges where you are tasked with solving 240 `riddles' (or locating items) throughout the game. I'm on the fence as to whether this was really necessary for this game as it had no bearing on the overall outcome, but it was fun to complete. The other aspect of ARKHAM ASYLUM that it has going for it, are the Challenges. These are divided into two separate types : Predator, where you rely almost entirely on stealth to eliminate henchmen and achieve certain objectives, and, Freeflow which is straightforward melee fighting but done so that you have to rack up a certain amount of points to achieve 3 trophies (or bats as the case may be) for each challenge. This is basically Batman's version of the Special Ops Missions in Call Of Duty : Modern Warfare 2. As some final, menial thoughts for the good qualities about the game, the scenery and graphics are fantastic and I found myself just stopping to look around at my surroundings and environment quite often, be it from perched high atop the exterior buildings or crouched in a corner looking around some highly detailed rooms. Even the character models which you can take a good 180-degree, detailed look at are quite cool to check out. And speaking of good things to look at, Poison Ivy & Harley Quinn aren't too terribly hard on the eyes either ;-) Which brings me to the villains in the game. I thought it was somewhat of an interesting choice the ones that they did, or didn't use. But of course, with a game that's this good, you have to leave something for the sequel(s), right? I guess overall I'm fairly happy with the ones the chose and the ones they left for later. My only real gripe I guess would be how they squeezed the Riddler into the game (even though you never saw him) but we'll deall with that in......THE BAD: Actually, I wouldn't really call anything in this game `bad', so much as I might say I'm on the fence as to whether I thought things were necessary or could have been done a little differently.  And I guess that would apply to the majority of the things I found good about the game. For instance, was it REALLY necessary to have the Riddler challenges in the game? While I did enjoy looking for them and managed to find them all, they also felt like something that was added to the game to help prolong the otherwise potentially short duration of it. Then again, considering Batman is a detective and there's not a ton of `detecting' to do in the game itself, I guess the Riddler challenges filled that void? And tacking on to this were the challenge modes. Was it absolutely necessary to have these? Probably not at all. But were they fun? Yes. Especially the Predator challenges. The Freeflow challenges did seem to get repetitive and monotonous despite the difficulty ratcheting up with each successive one, but again, I did enjoy the Predator challenges. And unlike what I mentioned about their similarity to the Special Ops missions in COD : MW2, these can be played without having to unlock them by completing the one that came before it, so, props to the game there. Something else I found a tad problematic though, was, detective mode. As cool as it was, it was problematic in that, it was TOO helpful. So much so, that you spend most of the time in it, looking at the world around you in a bluish , x-ray tint and not looking at the fantastic scenery around you in the colors and shadowing it's meant to be seen in. Yes, I probably would have done it differently, but I don't know how because it seemed to be integral to how the game was played, since you had to know where you could grapple and where the enemies were in order to formulate a strategy. Beyond these few things, the only other minor gripes I could come up with were that for everything they allow you to do as Batman in this game (which, again, covers pretty much everything he's able to do - kudos to that!), they don't give you the opportunity to drive the Batmobile (...or Batcycle.....or Batplane......or Batboat....etc., etc.). Now THAT would have been cool! But again, I guess they have to leave something for the sequel(s), so here's to hoping! As well, it would have been cool to deal with The Penguin, Catwoman, Ra's-Al-Ghul and such, but there's that sequel thing again. I guess if I have a real gripe about any of the villains, it's the Riddler. If they're going to bother with having you track down 240 (!!!) of his riddles / objects / whatever, then they should've at least given you the opportunity to apprehend him or fight him. IMHO, a better idea would have been that, if you completed all 240 Riddler challenges, you would either be treated to a) a chance to fight and apprehend him  OR at the least  b) a fairly lengthy cut-scene where you're shown Batman going to fight and apprehend him. Either of these ideas could have been done as an unlockable reward and something that, in my mind, would have REALLY validated The presence of the Riddler challenges.THE BOTTOM LINE: This is, without a doubt, a truly fantastic game and most importantly what a video game should be : a LOT of fun without being too difficult to get a grip on. It's pretty straight-forward in its' controls, has a good story, a likeable and familiar character you control (as well as familiar characters you battle), a good blend of fighting and stealth, a nice balance of things to do (even if a few feel contrived), a good array of gadgets to use and is just overall a REALLY, really solid game. This is definitely something any gamer should play if they like anything even close to this type of game and definitely one that belongs in any serious gamers' library. While it's not this particular reviewer's favorite game, it's definitely one I can highly recommend and one I like very, very much.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-27-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00113JSCG","reviewerName":"Paul Arellano \"Last Days on Earth\"","summary":"Disaster from start to finish- Avoid It. You've been Warned!","reviewText":"I've been reviewing games for Amazon since 1999. I've seen the worst of games...Daikatana, most especially. Now, after many moons have passed, I have come across one of the worst, if not, the buggiest, most annoying piece of program I have ever encountered in my life. Alone in the Dark is a major disaster, from it's storyline, dialogue, annoying voice acting, frustrating controls, unforgiving checkpoints, and the most buggiest collision detection EVER! The only PLUS in this game are the graphics but that's about it. So I'll keep my review straight and to the point:GRAPHICS: Excellent. No complaintsCONTROLS: Main character moves like a tank with a bad engine. Controls are completely unresponsive. Some buttons do not function as stated. For example, you press A to turn off a flashlight. If you're holding a gun in one hand and holding a flashlight on the other, you can't press A to turn it off. You have to press the gamepad down, open your virtual jacket and then unequip from there. HOW TEDIOUS CAN THIS GET??? Another example: you're standing next to an object your wish to pick-up, an \"pick-up object icon\" appears telling you to press A. To pick up an object, press A. The problem with this is that turning off the flashlight you need to press A as well. So if you're holding a flashlight and you need to turn off it off (it has limited battery life by the way), you'll have to move away from the pickable object so you can turn off the flashlight.Here's another example again: You have a zombie attacking you, controls say you have to double click the left analog stick to do a quick turn. If you're holding a gun or a melee weapon, quick turn won't work, but then sometimes it does!!!And here's another example: Driving a car is like driving a bar of soap on a smooth glass. A slight turn on the stick will spin your car uncontrollably. There's an action sequence in this game that requires some driving. I will warn you now, prepare to do this about 200 to 500 times because you will fail.BUGGY ACTION SEQUENCE: There's an action sequence on Episode 2 where you have to escape an earthquake. The entire driving sequence requires you to get away from the earthquake before ti swallows your car. Unfortunately, the car is just completely unresponsive. Second, there's a jump that you have to make before the entire road cracks open. Sometimes you'll make the jump sometimes you won't. What's weird is that once your car flies over the cracked road, the game will turn into a full motion video showing your car making the jump. But once your car lands, somehow the game randomly decides whether the earthquake catches the tail end of your car thus killing you instantly or by some algorithmic calculation, you do make it. But that's just half of the problem because this action sequence will continue for the next 10 minutes and if you fail halfway or even on the last part of this sequence, the game will throw you back to beginning of the sequence. TOTALLY UNFORGIVING CHECKPOINTS. By the way, you can't skip the full motion videos which means you'll be forced to watch cheesy FMVs over and over again everytime you fail an action sequence.How about weapons you ask? Forget about using guns. Guns are completely ineffective against zombies (which you will be battling the entire game). So if ever you decide to collect ammo, well...it's pretty much useless and waste of space. Zombies can only be killed by fire. If you do have to use your gun to kill zombies, you'll have to find gasoline or any flammable liquid, combine it with your bullets, load your gun with said \"gasoline dipped\" bullets and then shoot the zombies. But wait, you can't just shoot them anywhere. Zombies have this glowing yellow areas of their body that's vulnerable to fire. So on top of mixing and matching items to make fire, you'll have to be a sharpshooter to hit the zombies where it hurts. Otherwise, you'll just be wasting time and ammo.I think I've said enough. This game is the worst ever for 2008. Do not waste your money on this. Believe me, when I read the poor reviews, I told myself \"Nah, I don't believe these reviews, I will buy it and try it myself.\" So now, I am $60.00 poorer, and my blood pressure just skyrocketed after playing this game. Avoid this game. Stick to the DOS version of Alone in the Dark.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2008"}

You do not need to play AC 2 to enjoy this game, but you will enjoy it more if you do.High Concept: 10/10Take a character like Batman, make him an assassin, drop him into Renaissance Italy, and surround him with corrupt government and church officials that need to be exterminated for the good of mankind!  Allow this character to become a millionaire and renovate Rome while building a guild of Assassins.Story: 10/10Assassin's Creed Brotherhood has a story within a story. On the outside, you play Desmond, the ancestor of Altair and Ezio, who's hooked up to the animus (a virtual reality simulator) in order to uncover clues from the past to stop a diabolical secret organization by recovering a powerful magical artifact known as the \"Apple of Eden.\"In the Virtual World you are Ezio, an aristocrat who gets swept up in the political turmoil of 15th Century Italy.  A change in the government makes you a fugitive, so you use your assassination skills to tip the balance of power and rescue Rome.  You get your weaponry and gear from none other than Leonardo Da Vinci and you form the Brotherhood of Assassins with Niccolo Machiavelli.Ezio is up against a megalomaniac named Cesare Borgia who wants to rule Rome.  Under his influence, Rome begins to crumble.  It's up to Ezio to cleanse Rome of his foul stench. Through the story, you meet many fascinating European historical figures with their own dark pasts. Similar to the Da Vinci Code, the story may have you questioning your beliefs, researching historical figures, or wanting to take a more active role in the world around you. It's rare that a video game story actually makes you want to rethink history.Gameplay: 9/10The combat is similar to Assassin's Creed 2, but the animations and gameplay are more fluid this time around.  You can kill enemies with daggers, swords, hammers, maces, poison darts, crossbow bolts, throwing knives, a pistol, hired thugs, summoned assassins, and stun them with smoke bombs.  The combat is also very easy.  As you kill one enemy, you can insta-kill others by pointing the analog stick at them and pressing the X button.  You can easily kill 12 guys in 20 seconds and you do feel like an assassin while doing it.Although, the free running is good, it's not perfect. At times, Ezio may jump in the wrong direction and fall to his death. This is extremely rare, but when it happens, it sucks.The Open World:  10/10The problem with most Open World Games is that moving through the world to your next objective feels like a waste of time.  You often spend 2-7 minutes just traveling.  Well, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood has created some interesting ways to mitigate this.This time around, it is a lot easier to get from one place to another in Rome.  The overall land mass is a bit smaller than Assassin's Creed 2 and Ezio runs faster.  You can also go about 25% faster by pressing the Y button to summon a horse, or horse-jack someone.  Assassin's Creed Brotherhood also uses underground sewer entrances as \"Fast Travel\" Spots.  Enter them, pick where you want to go on the map, and you teleport there.Assassin's Creed Brotherhood also rewards you just for playing, so there is NO Downtime between missions.  The main objective of the game is to expunge the Borgia influence from Rome.  You do this by assassinating the magistrates and burning down their watchtowers.  As you destroy the tower, you are free to renovate shops, blacksmiths, and landmarks in the area.  Improving Rome also pays you in dividends.  Every structure that you renovate adds to Ezio's bank account every 20 minutes.  You get paid for playing!Another way to profit from downtime is the use of the Assassin's Guild.  Halfway through the campaign, you get to recruit rebellious townsfolk to your cause.  By using messenger pigeons, you can send your recruits on missions to gain more money for Ezio and XP for the recruit.  It works similar to a Facebook Game.  You scroll through a list of missions with a difficulty rating of 1-5.  You choose which assassin(s) will perform the mission.  The game gives you their % of success and the time it will take to complete the mission.  You press a button to send them on their way.  If they succeed, you get rewarded.  If they fail, they die.  As the recruits gain XP, you can upgrade their weapons and armor.  This makes them more powerful when you summon them in game.  So, as you are running through the world, you get text updates that say:  Mission:  Assassinate a Herald Complete.  When the mission has been completed, you are free to upgrade them and send them on more missions.  This is a really innovative idea with only one drawback.  You have to believe that an assassin can travel from Rome to Constantinople, kill a guy, and return to Rome in 6 minutes.  It's best not to think about it and just count your gold.Missions:  6/10The only flaw in this game that prevents it from being a true masterpiece is a handful of mission designs.  Every Mission in the game has an objective, \"Kill the Magistrate\" with a condition \"Avoid Detection\" and an optional condition \"Kill him with your hidden blade.\"  The optional condition makes the game more challenging and gives you a 100% synchronization bonus.  If you were to kill the magistrate with your crossbow, you only get a 50% rating for completing the mission.  The synchronization bonus isn't really used for anything though, it just makes the game more interesting.Some Missions are amazingly great and drive the story, while others are just plain bad.Here are some tips for Mission Designers:- If the Player can Fail a Mission within 1 second of starting it, while they are reading the objective, it is a bad mission.- If you need checkpoints every 10 meters with a paragraph explaining what to do, it's a bad mission.- If there is only 1 way to complete the mission and 142 ways to fail it, it's a bad mission.- If the Player can fail a Mission because an arbitrary clock on the HUD hit zero, but Ezio still has a chance of completing the mission in the world (he's standing right next to the target with no guards around) it breaks game fiction and is a bad mission.- If the Player can fail a Mission because an arbitrary distance counter on the HUD said you were too far from your target, even though you are in a locked room with the guy, it breaks game fiction and it is a bad mission.- If the whole purpose of the game is to upgrade your weapons and gear and you have missions that forbid the player from using their weapons and gear that they have spent 15 hours upgrading it is a bad mission.  (Especially when there are six in a row.)- If the rules of the mission are inconsistent with 99% of the rest of the game, it is a bad mission.Your mission designs should never get in the way of the Player feeling like an assassin.Note:  The game is broken into 9 Sequences.  After you complete Sequence 7, the game becomes a linear string of missions that you cannot decline until you complete the game.  If you want to do optional missions or upgrade your guilds, do this before you finish Sequence 7 or after you complete the main campaign!!!Multiplayer:  6/10Assassin's Creed Brotherhood features an interesting Multiplayer Mode where you are in a room of 200 clones.  6-8 of the people in the room are players.  Some are trying to assassinate you while you are trying to assassinate someone else.  There is no combat, you just press X to kill them for the most part.  You are awarded \"Style Points\" for your kills.  It is an interesting gameplay mode, but it lacks depth.  As you gain XP, you can upgrade your character and unlock more gear like smoke bombs, disguises, throwing knives, and poison.  The gear is designed to give you a better chance at killing your target or escaping from your pursuers.  If an assassin is about to take you out and you see them coming, a B button icon appears above their head.  If you press B you have a chance at punching them in the face, and stunning them to escape.  There is a problem though.  Pressing the B button doesn't aways work.  I'm not sure if it is a latency issue or what, but it just seems odd that the game tells me to Press B to escape, I press B, and die.  The game should give the player a 1.5 second invulnerability window to press B and escape.  60% of the time that I press B, I die.  Games should never kill the player if they do exactly what they are supposed to do.There are also some team modes where you work in groups to take out another team and they try to take out your team.There are a few major drawbacks to the Multiplayer Modes.  The wait times to actually join a game can be from 1 to 40 minutes long.  To make matters worse, you can't do anything while you are waiting to join.  You can't organize your gear, set your preferences, study the map, research the complex scoring system, choose the map that you want to play on... nothing.  You just stare at a static progress screen.  There are also a few problems with assigning targets.  This is a major problem because the only way to score points is to escape assassins or assassinate other players.  I've had 3 minute stretches of a 10 minute match where I wasn't assigned a target and nobody was sent after me.  I could only wander around the level and watch everyone else outscore me.If you can actually get into a game, the Multiplayer is pretty fun, but you can tell it's very rough.  It's very simple and rewards you for playing, but it lacks the depth needed to keep people hooked for months.Graphics: 10/10One of the best looking open world games of all time, in terms of art direction and quality. The environments, characters, effects, and animations are all phenomenal. The highly detailed buildings, clothing, and props all realistically fit the world. The characters look and animate great right down to their facial expressions. It actually feels like you were transported into 15th Century Italy!!!Sound: 10/10The sound track and sound effects are amazing. The music is appropriate for the setting and gives a sense of action, mystery, and danger. The sound effects put you right into the action or they'll make you want to seek comfort in the shadows as you stealthily plan your next assassination. The soundtrack is also available on itunes!!!Replay Value: 7/10Assassin's Creed II offers 12-24 hours of gameplay, which is especially impressive in this day and age where most action games are 7 hours long. After you finish the game, you have the option to keep everything that you've earned and continue playing to collect items, finish side quests, or unlock achievements. However, there's no reason to start the game over from the beginning. Even with limited replay value, you're still going to get your money's worth.  There is also a multiplayer mode where you assassinate other players and gain XP to upgrade your characters.Overall: 8.5/10When the concept, story, art, and music are all amazing, you have a very immersive world. The criticisms about Assassin's Creed Brotherhood are that it doesn't offer much of a challenge, and 10% of the missions are unfun.Buy it if you liked Assassin's Creed 2 or Prince of Persia.Buy it if you like fun and easy games that constantly reward you.Buy it if you want a thinking man's Action RPG.Rent it if you want to try it out and have about 15 free hours.Avoid it if you like a challenge or hated everything about the original Assassin's Creed.Avoid it if you are EXTREMELY Catholic. The portrayal of the Vatican may upset you.Avoid it if you don't like the idea of being a dude, who's playing a dude, who's playing another dude.And there you have it. If you can't trust a guy whose name is Poisoned Blade and dresses like an assassin (seriously look at my profile pic) then who can you trust?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I0GEXM","description":"","reviewerName":"MJM - The Franchise of the VGF","summary":"Who Framed Mario the Plumber?","reviewText":"As the title implies, this game is a mash up of Who Framed Roger Rabbit and various Mario games. Which is not a bad thing at all, both properties are great in their own right and very much worthy of imitation. Epic Mickey borrows some storyline ideas from Who Framed Roger Rabbit and game play mechanics from Mario with a side of Disney and makes it their own.There is a lot of history to be had with this game, if you're an avid Disney fan this is a must buy. Now with that being said it is still just as enjoyable even if you're a casual fan to even really not being one at all. I believe this game would be a good time for just about any age group, and any gamer just looking for a fun game to play, there's a little something for everyone.The controls are pretty fluid and intuitive for the most part, and very easy to pick up from the start. The graphics are amazing by Wii standards, you really feel as if you're in the cartoon itself. The characters are engaging and the story is well thought out and entertaining. As stated above the history is rich and actually pretty interesting.A couple of cons would be that sometimes the aiming system is a little off, takes some playing around with depending on where you're located. The camera takes a little time to get used to, it would be better if it was fixed but since it's not I wish there was another way to control it rather than using the cross pad. My final complaint would be that I wished they used real voices instead of the dialogue being in a text format; realistically this isn't really a con as more as it is a preference.Overall the cons don't really do much to hinder the game experience, and for sure the pros out weight them. Honestly the only people who wouldn't find this title enjoyable would be the hardcore guns blazing FPS fans and/or Microsoft/Sony fan boys that refuse to play the Wii for some crazy loyalty to their system of choice.Worth picking up for full price, you won't be sorry.Michael","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2010"}

Mauricio","summary":"Underwhelming, underpowered, undeserving of your money.","reviewText":"Nintendo's late entry on to the realm of high definition couldn't come at a more crucial time for Nintendo to clean up its act. With the PS3 and Xbox 360 selling a fraction of what the Wii has sold, Nintendo just simply ran out of luck with the Wii U. I'm not going to bore you with specs of the Wii U and how the machine looks and feels. You can find those elsewhere. The problem with this system is that Nintendo made such lousy decisions this time. The hook of the Wii was the remote control that you used to wave or swing your arms to video games. It caught the attention of people who don't play video games. Thus made the highly underpowered Wii sell like hotcakes among the elderly and non-gamers alike. The hook with the Wii U is far from compelling this time. The tablet inspired Wii U gamepad lacks multi-capactive touch features, can't be taken too far away from the console, lacks analog buttons, poor battery life, and must be charged at a wall socket because the Wii U itself can't charge it. Storage options are a joke with 8 and 32 GB SKUs, the Wii U can't store games on the SD card slot so if you want to buy digital games you have to buy a wall powered USB HDD to give the console more storage. The operating system is horribly slow even since the Spring 2013 update that sped it up marginally.The Wii U had a year to brace itself against the PS4 and Xbox One. Yet nothing was done on Nintendo's front to convince people why you want a Wii U. Games came out to very little or no affair. The pride that it had originally with having a strong lineup of third party game companies quickly abandoned the newborn console. Games that did come out often had longer load times and other blemishes that made them look worse than their PS3 and 360 counterparts. And in 2014, Nintendo announced that it has lowered its sales forecast of the Wii U from 9 million by the end of March 2014 to 2.8 million units. What did Nintendo president Satoru Iwata say to his stockholders, &#34;We're terribly sorry and thank you for your continued patience.&#34; Patience that has ran out on me, turning into severe disappointment to the point that I will never ever buy a Nintendo console again unless Nintendo cleans up their act. Please don't tell me the games are coming out because I know they are, but no one's really buying them. Christmas 2013 was supposed to make it or break it for the Wii U, and the people voted NO with their wallets.From its tepidly interesting game library, to poor performance, and depressing outlook, the Wii U is so bad that only the direst Nintendo fanboys could love it while being shunned by the rest of the gaming community. Nintendo's luck has ran out and the Wii U is a strike out console. Go get a PS4 and Xbox One instead, the future of console gaming is there instead.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2014"}
{"product_name":"B0009SQFHA","description":"You are an FBI agent on the hunt in this gripping and sickening hunt for serial killers. The game is played in first-person perspective, and with the use of the Havok 3.0 physics engine and other advanced techniques, players can utilize anything in the area as a weapon when they've been cornered by their prey. Prepare for a slow-paced, frightening, and dark adventure.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Condemned is what survival horror is all about","reviewText":"Condemned lets you take control of FBI agent Ethan Thomas, who while investigating a crime scene with two cops in a seemingly run down and abandoned building, stumbles upon the serial killer who proceeds to kill the cops with your .45 handgun. Now the FBI thinks you shot the cops, and its up to you to catch the killer and proove yourself through brute force and forensic equipment while dodging cops and fighting crazed hobos.Thats right, I said forensic equipment. In Criminial Origins, you'll have to use black lights, cameras and other scientific tools to find clues such as finger prints and what not. It was a pretty cool idea and really helped push the story along. Also like I mentioned, you have to fight a lot in this game (both melee and with guns), and basically anything can be used as a weapon. This means 2x4 boards, lead pipes, rifles, handguns, small locker doors, SMGs, fire pokers, axes, shotguns, and many more (all these weapons can be used to block enemy attacks as well). You battle it out with a lot of freaky and odd enemies... some look like simple whacked out hobos, others look like anorexic zombies, some are big & intimadating, others look like the Toxic Avenger. What was cool is if you beat them enough, you can grab them and smash their heads into the floor, headbutt them, or break their necks - scoring an instant kill. Oh and one more thing - you get a taser that you can shoot and disarm enemies...very useful.The enemy AI was really good & impressive. They grab weapons off the floor or out of walls (conduits and pipes), block some of your melee attacks, take cover, and even go as far as to hide from you and pretend they are Mannequins in one stage. Additionally, if one enemy accidently hits another, they actually start to fight each other.Theres some things to collect such as dead birds and metal pieces.. each time you collect one you gain an \"achievement\" in Xbox live..so yeah. As for the ending and unlocking anything, it doesn't.The only two reasons this game has a learning curve is because you need to learn when to time your blocks, and to get used to the fact that whatever ammo you have in a gun is the only ammo you get for it. Thats right, you get no ammo. So lets say you have a shotgun with 2 rounds, thats all you will get for that gun until you get a different weapon or pick up a different shotgun.. it was sorta lame, but definitley helped in the challenge.This game's difficulty varied. At some points it is overwhelming easy, and other times its just tidal wave after tidal wave of enemies running at you. But like I said, once you learn & get comfortable with the weapons & blocking system you'll breeze through it...well not really breeze, but it'll become easier.The graphics were pretty spectacular. The hobos looked really unique, twisted, and crazy. The enviroments, though dark, where really well designed and looked really run down (which is a good thing for a survival horror game of this sort). One enemy, the last boss, looked especially weird and scary. Even the fire looked almost lifelike. To put it simply - Condemned really took advantage of the X-Box 360's hardware amd everything is amazing.The sound effects were basically perfect. The music really helped add tension, and build anxiety while the sound effects sounded brutal and painful. Each weapon provided an either satisfying thud or bang. The enemies growls, heavy breathing and screams were really scary and added more to the atmosphere. There is cursing, which helps to add personality to every character as well. A perfect 10.What kinda bummered me out about this title was how short it was, and how convuluted & confusing the story became in the later stages, and finally the ending. In the middle of the game, you find out that the man you are chasing is actually a serial killer who kills serial killers with the codename Serial Killer X. At the end of the game, you capture him with the help of some old guy named Malcom VanHorn,,who, it turns out, is Serial Killer X's uncle. Anyway, you have a choice whether to cap SKX or keep him alive, and no matter what you end up in a coffee shop talkin to Rosa (shes a woman who helps you out throughout the entire game) about what happened. She leaves, you go to the bathroom, vomit, and then turn to the camera looking like the last boss fight who was a monster... I was lost, and I'm sure you are too.Either way, If you want to play a game that will freak you out while providing awesome combat, great enemy AI, and excellent graphics & sound - then Condemned is for you. Not to mention it's one of the cheaper 360 games out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

While NiGHTS feels a lot like the Saturn game and the Sonic games they did a semi-decent job with this.

Controlling a mysterious figure that has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlord's Dark Tower. Only the player's actions will determine if they will rise to become the new all-powerful Overlord; it's all down to how much of a bad ass they want to be in order to succeed...evil or really evil! Played out with plenty of black humor and dark irony, the game will immerse players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters.","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"Flawed Gawd","reviewText":"I really, really can't overstate how much I enjoy this game.  Perfections and imperfections all, I love this thing for it's style, for it's humor, for it's constant and unnapologetic stroking of my ego.  It appeals to me personally on so many levels I wouldn't know where to begin.Which should be the first sign that it ain't for everyone.Overlord is, at it's heart, a fast-paced puzzle game.  Yes there's action and destruction and the slaying of creatures both creepy and cute.  But real progress is made by careful placement of your four types of minions and patient exploitation of their strengths and weaknesses.  Use the wrong kind at the wrong time?  Yup, they're all dead: and it's amazing how naked and exposed your metal-clad, otherwise imposing self feels once that layer of Minions is removed between you and the enemy.  You certainly can attempt a run'n'gun approach, throwing your critters at the bad guys and swinging your sword for all it's worth but you and your Minions are surprisingly frail and the game seems to reward a more patient approach, despite the chaotic nature of the visuals.The game is far from from perfect:  the Overlord moves a bit like an old Buick and more than twice I had Minions stuck on rocks and in other pieces of the environment. It's got it's fare share of bugs and poor animations (kick a villager and count down how long it takes him to actually fall, funny stuff) and the cut scenes look like they were thrown together in the eleventh hour with the remaining bits of the budget.  Seriously, that last clip before the final battle?  Bush league stuff, mate.But what it lacks in polish and precision it more than makes up for in charm.  None of the elements in the world of the game are terribly original: pseudo-English Old-timey country side, elves, dwarves, Hobbits (or Halflings, whatever), trolls, zombies, et. al.  But the way the fairy tale creatures have been turned upside down is super clever and fun--most are ravaged and war-torn, some are corrupt and greed-driven.  It's a Tolkien world filtered through the Grimm brothers and then again through Monty-Python... or something less mature even.  Fart jokes, exploding bad-guys and rampant silly-ness coat everything, giving the adventure a light-hearted edge and making the 'evil' & general mayhem that you spread guilt-free.Of course, the real stars of the game are the Minions, your little army of evil gremlins.  You start with only five but by the end you'll have control of nearly fifty of the little guys at a time with hundreds more waiting in the wings.  Push a button and they swarm on your enemies, jumping on backs, hurling fire-balls and giggling and squealing the whole time.  Need one or ten to sacrifice themselves to increase your health?  Not a problem, and they'll die with a smile.  The voice-acting for the various ambient and battle noises they make is top-notch and there's endless fun in watching your fighter Minions pick up new weapons and armor from fallen foes.  Honeslty, I get a little attached to my horde while playing and, though I know they're designed to be expendable dungeon fodder, I can't help but get bummed out when I seem them bite the dust for me.  Maybe I'm just an old softy, but I consider that reaction a testament to how well these ugly litte citters were designed.  And controlling them is pretty easy, if unrefined: you do have to give up control of the camera in favor of direct \"sweeping\" control of the Minions, but ultimately it's a fair swap.Glitchy and Kitchy, the game is fun above all else.  It's certainly not the most polished title available (by a long shot) but that forgiven, it's easily playable and even re-playable of you get into it.  And if you enjoy a personal army of knee-high goblins who will bring you treasures and explode for your amusment then you, my friend, are in the right place.  If that's not something you like the sound of... then maybe video games really aren't for you.  Try books for a while.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001NX6GBK","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"3.5 Stars","reviewText":"Make no mistake, this is most everything you'd expect from a God of War game; just based on a completely different set of mythology. The primary difference in the two games (beyond the basic storyline) involves a difficulty more suitable to less experienced gamers. This comes at a price though, as both combat and platforming are not as strong as they are in God of War. You will get hit more often (unable to dodge fast enough) and plunge to your death (when rope jumps stop your forward motion for no apparent reason). This isn't to say that the game is not worth playing. It most certainly is! The issues I mention aren't so prominent that you stop enjoying yourself. And what this game may lack in tight controls it makes up for with fun and one hell of a storyline (pun intended). Playing through the bosses and watching cutscenes often reminded me of watching an episode of Metalocalypse (sans the humor). The levels don't always present spotless or impressive graphical views, but the in-game reels are epic and gorgeous. I don't normally wax poetic about a game's storyline. And this definitely isn't the kind of storyline I expected to enjoy much; being I'm usually making fun of these myths. But I do think this is an experience to be had. Others have complained about the game's length. But I thought it was just right. Not every game needs to be as long as Skyrim. Here you'll get something just long enough to not stop enjoying the experience. In short, it isn't long enough for the combat to become a chore you're tired of performing. The game is also a trophy hunter's delight; offering an easy platinum in 10-15 hours. Clearly what I'm trying to say is that any adult who wants a bloody, sexy, creepy brawler with some light puzzle action is going to enjoy this experience. Just don't expect the strongest controls or an 80 hour playthrough.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2013"}

I felt that the voices and music were very good and served their purpose of making believable characters.It is a short game, you'll need aprox. 8 hours to complete, and for platinum you need to finish it at least 3 times. For me the short duration is not a bad thing, considering the high quality of the game, I feel that it's like an 8 hour anime movie, very entertaining.The game is comprised of 18 episodes, divided in 3 parts. When you finish the game the gme tells you that there is an alternate ending (which happens to be the real one), and you can unblock it by playing again with better scores. This is the \"real ending\".The only problem I've found with this game is that after that \"real ending\", there is a final ending, which comes in a DLC you can buy for ~6.99USD. It is a new set of episodes regarded as \"Part IV\". I feel a bit deceived for having to pay for seeing a game's ending. Nonetheless, the in-game endings are good.Summarizing: It is a very good game fo anime fans, if you like the cobat style found in the Dragon Ball Z anime then you'll also like Asura's Wrath.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2012"}

Each stage is chock full of non-stop action, oldschool Sonic platforming, collectibles galore, and various paths to reach the finish line. The controls are as simple as anything since the early Sega days. It should be clear by now that I enjoyed this game quite a lot. It falls slightly short in the story and content department. The game is not an epic experience. But it does manage to succeed in being action-heavy from beginning to end. And that's about 90% of what a gamer such as myself is looking for in a Sonic experience. It certainly puts every other 3D Sonic attempt to shame.

But I am not going to buy it. I used to a have a standing pre-order but not anymore, that has been long canceled. I gave EA a chance to mend its ways but it failed. Here is why.This is a warning Review. Warning of the dangers of the harbored Digital Rights Management (DRM) subroutine that comes unavoidably bundled with the game. This type of DRM (SecuROM 7.xx with Limited Installations) is well known as it has already been used in at least two other games (BIOSHOCK & MASS EFFECT). So my review is based on first-hand experience of a core aspect of the game.Apparently EA would rather keep its customers in the dark. That is why, in the past month, EA Forums got censored, Wikipedia entries selectively edited and Amazon reviews repeatedly deleted. What is worse, Amazon (possibly without knowing it) is breaking the law which requires the full disclosure of bundled snoop-ware.LIMITED INSTALLS? Yes, LIMITED INSTALLS!!! We only get to ride this shiny pony for...3 laps! The official announcement mentions \"on 3 different computers\" but avoids to clarify what a \"different computer\" makes: will changing the graphics card trigger the loss of a token? what about attaching a new hard-drive (internal or external) or adding a new user account. All the above have been reported to subtract installation tokens from BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT - and EA has intentionally left this area dark gray.Moreover, in order to enforce the limited installations, exactly like BIOSHOCK, there will be IRREMOVABLE FOLDERS placed in our systems' Root that will effectively revoke our Administrator rights to our own PCs! Short of reformatting, there is no deleting them even if logged in as Administrators.Is EA trying to pave the way towards a nightmarish future where PC gaming will be a continuously-billed service (such as direct-Pay TV) and not a product?Is EA trying to trigger a lemmings stampede towards the Pay-per-Play cliff, where gamers will be regarded as herded cows to be milked over months and years?Is the Company trying to turn our PC systems (that we bought and paid for) into their proprietary consoles, hence monstrosities such as SecuROM that offer zero anti-piracy protection?According to statements by their own spokespersons (such as John Riccitiello, CEO of EA) the answer to all of the above question is YES. However, I want to make clear that none of these statements had any impact on my rating of this game. The game has enough troubles as it is...Is it fair to rate badly a game based on its short duration or bad graphics? How about its instability and bugs? How about harboring potentially dangerous subroutines that will render it useless within a 12-16 months? You see how this is going?In the end, after all is said, with SPORE it boils down to this: who will actually be owning my copy? Are we to pay $50 only to...RENT this from its publisher, be potentially pestered with the insulting need to prove our purchase forever and place our hardware and data in danger?And what makes this even harder to understand: will such extreme measures actually prevent piracy? Of course NOT! They did not work for similarly DRM-plagued BIOSHOCK or MASS EFFECT, why should they start working now?So, one has to ask: what is next in store for customers that make the mistake of buying such a product? Will they be required to pay again to buy another copy of the game when the first one expires?Is THIS the solution that EA executives came up against piracy: since they cannot stop piracy, let's make all our paying customers PAY TWICE to make up for their million dollar bonuses?!NO THANKS! No game is worth such harassment!","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2008"}

There's so much about Oblivion that it would pages and pages to describe it all in detail. The main story is you have to restore the Dragonfires so the realm of Oblivion can't come back to Cyrodiil. The story is very interesting and the sidequests add to this. To start with you make your character with an absurd amount of detail and you can even name and customize your own race, abilities etc. In each city in Cyrodiil you can choose to join guilds such as mage, fighter, thief etc. You complete tasks for the guild leader and you get a recommendation to the head place of that guild. You can train there to raise attributes and rest. Now when it comes to talking to people the game uses facial expressions to show you what the NPC is feeling. You can persuade people via a little mini-game that takes awhile to master.Now let's talk about combat. The combat is very deep and simple at the same time. You block with LT and attack with RT. You can use magic, sword, bows, katanas, staffs etc. As you use your weapons they deteriorate and you can repair them with hammers or at weapon shops. Some weapons can have attributes like causing your foe to be paralyzed for 30 secs or something like that. You can use scrolls which are magic attacks for defense and offense that can be used once. When you level up you have to sleep to you can meditate on everything you learned. It takes a long while to level up in this game but it's well worth it.The vastness of attributes is insane in Oblivion. The combinations of alchemy spells and everything combined just, literally, makes it infinite. Now lets talk about vastness. The game is huge...bigger than all the GTAs put together. Anything that you see you can walk on or climb. You can ride a horse there or just go there for the hell of it and discover something new. You can pick plants for alchemy, you can find new weapons...or just completely useless stuff like bones, cups, vases, quills, mops, shovels etc. Some stuff is worth thousands some stuff is worth nothing at all. You're probably wondering how you travel such as HUGE amount of land? Well the map lets you warp...thank God for that. Of course you can't warp inside a building but you can get the idea. Now the game can let you go good or evil depending on if you steal peoples' stuff, pickpocket, murder etc. Or you can choose to be rude to people during conversations. Technically there are some flaws.The graphics are still pretty good to today's standards but show some age just a tad compared to recent next-gen games. The music is outstanding and the voice acting is superb. There is some texture pop up here and there and hitches. The constant loading is also annoying but with recent software updates that's remedied this some. You just have to get this game...it's so big and so deep you'll play this for hours and hours...also with all the expansions out there I wonder if there is an end. A note to casual players...stay away. The vastness and depth will turn some players off and will turn JRPG fans off.UPDATE: After playing another 30 hours through Oblivion 3 years later I still had a lot of fun. While the game may look a bit dated these days it still has a rich story, great atmosphere, and plenty of quests to keep you busy for hours and hours. It's rare to have a game do that to you in which you can come back years later and put dozens of hours into it and still have the same great experience. Of course after about 30 hours I did start getting bored because it feels too dated for today's standards.The music is still one of my favorite game OSTs to date and I listen to it even to this day. The music is just full of adventure, and you really feel like you want to jump into a fantasy when you listen to it. It's calming, empowering, and just wonderful to the ears.There is so much to do in this game I came across items, quests, and people I never came across during my first playthrough. With a total of over 100 hours logged for both playthroughs and still coming across new stuff? Now that's a damn big game. If I were to give it a score for today it would get a 9 for me only dropping half a point because of the age.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Too funny!If you have played HL2, DOOM 3 or FEAR...you will be biored with this lamer.PREY does offer 2 new concepts and 1 KIND OF new concept...gravity, your character is an American Indian and portals.AMERICAN INDIAN -The main character is an American Indian...or native American. I really liked this! In real life, I am 6' tall, I lift weights and look like I just stepped out of a DOOM 3 Marine platoon mission. I am sick of playing stereotypical, blond haired, crew cut, muscle bound guys. I really enjoyed being an American Indian. Yiour character has a super power...he goes into the \"spirit\" world which allows him to travel and do things his mortal body cannot do. NICE TOUCH! This was definitely a fresh, new angle for gameplay.GRAVITY -They threw the rules of gravity out the window. You can walk upside down, side ways etc. This is very nice because you get lost/confused sometimes. It does mess with your middle ear a bit. lol However, this does get old after the first 1-2 hours of gameplay.PORTALS -Enemies appear from portals. Instead of enemies pre-planted and waiting for you, they pop out from portals. This is nice. You cannot always attack from behind and it is surprising when they swarm you. The problem is...there is just noit enough challenge to the fights or enough clever AI in the enemies to keep you hooked. Some bob and jump...kind of reminds me of the old days of DOOM. Yes!! The enemies were that predictable.NOW TO REVIEW THE REST OF THE GAMES FEATURES.....WEAPONS -Lame, uninspired and nothing that really gives you goose bumps. Even the weapon sound effects were too \"quiet\" with no umppphhh behind them.MUSIC -OK. Not bad. Then again...nothing great. Some old classic rock songs thrown in to give an earthy feel.VOICE ACTING -Down right horrible. No emotion, no feeling, no soul behind any of it. The grandfather was the only believable voice. Very lame script too. Down right awful altogether.GRAPHICS -Nothing new. Not as beautiful as Doom 3, Fear or Half-Life 2.GAMEPLAY -OUCH! Talk about a YAWN fest! I kept waiting for some challenging , visceral battles. NOTHING! Everything was predictable and easy to beat. Basically, you spend your entire time winding your way through a space complex. PREDICTABLE. You will find blocked paths and locked doors. PREDICTABLE. Creatures will try to stop you. PREDICTABLE. As soon as you start wal;king on the upside down paths, creature teleport in to attack you...everytime! PREDICTABLE...dear God it was PREDICTABLE!!! Weenies that can't beat hard games without trainers or cheat codes love this kind of game. It makes them feel like their gaming gods. Real gamers will be bored to tears with this one.Nothing got my blood pumping, nothing that made me cry out or grit my teeth. I doubt my pulse got above 80bpm!!! I never sweated a single battle or came close to dying. UGHHH!!!The battles were too easy..even on the hardest setting. I finished the game within 7 hours.

There's a good mix of run and gunning, driving and shooting from a helicopter. I have to repeat that this game was allot of fun to play. There were 5-6 levels (I forget exactly) each broken up into smaller \"episodes\" similar to the Halo games. Each level was pretty unique and at first glance the game could easily be mistaken for a Call of Duty title. Only a handful of weapons to choose from that sadly, didn't follow you between episodes and I found that I stuck with the machine gun almost entirely through the game except for some of the mandatory sniper episodes.

{"product_name":"B00006GSNX","description":"Forget aboutSuper Mario Sunshine--this is the real superstar platform action game of the season. Featuring a pair of wacky robots in a quest to save the universe,Ratchet and Clankmay offer the same old basic platform scenario--run around, elude or destroy enemies, jump, and negotiate treacherously dynamic environments--but it has a number of things going for it that place it among the best titles ever in this genre.The feature that will strike you first is the terrific art direction. Set in a science fiction future, the game has a beautifully executed retro cartoon look (think old Warner Bros.). The attention lavished on every detail, from architecture to character design, makes for a world that feels complete and real. This extends to the cutscenes, which feature a variety of colorful characters given vivid life with excellent voice acting. Then there is the sheer size and level of interactivity of the environments. For me, a particularly stunning moment was when my character was knocked off a skyscraper, but instead of perishing, landed on a ledge and was able to seamlessly navigate to a whole separate section of the game. Another moment of truth came when I aimed my blaster at one of the vehicles whizzing by in the sky. These vehicles were just pretty wallpaper, I thought, but no, the thing blew up. In fact, nearly everything you see is destructible or responsive in some way: you can jump up trees, scuttle over walkways, smash boxes, and climb up ledges. And the control scheme is just complex enough to keep things interesting with multiple weapons and the like, without being bogged down by too many features.While the routine of finding and destroying enemy robots may get tedious after a while,Ratchet and Clankkeeps things interesting with the many metamorphoses of Clank (who takes on forms that surprise even himself), cool weapons like the Glove of Doom (which unleashes armies of tiny Clanks), and shifting first-robot, third-robot points of view.If this game doesn't become the bestselling platform action game of the year, it will prove that nostalgia for old characters, marketing hype, and brand loyalty really are more important than quality.--David Stoesz","reviewerName":"Pat O'Donnell","summary":"yikes! pleseant surprise","reviewText":"THIS is what I call a platformer. Picked this game up yesterday, this is what a next generation platformer should play like, it even makes MarioSunshine look weak by comparison in my view.Every level so far has had something completely different. You'll find yourself doing something different all the time.It's also not a short game, easily more than 20 hours of playtime your first time thru. Every planet I have been to so far has been larger than the one before. They are also getting more difficult in that I am much more likely to get bopped than in the first few levels. It's not too easy, and it's not too hard - just perfect. I'm also very surprised at the quality of the music. I can't remember which, but one of the planets has a techno track playing and there's a guy at one point that's yelling something. I thought it was cool because game music generally doesn't have anyone singing in it (unless it's intro/outro stuff, if your name happens to be GTA3/GTA: VC, or a few other games. Not ot mention the voice acting is superb and the dialogue is hilarious! And unlike SMS, R&C; has an intelligent camera, you can control it, however if your jumping off walls to get up on to another area, it inteligently moves to a easily viewable location and does not magically change angles and tick you off as SMS does.Not to mention Ratchet and Clank completly owns MarioSunshine in the respects of-Graphics-Sound-Animation-Control-Camera-Presentation-Story/CutscenesSo, while mario may have a little bit better overall jumping experience, R and C is an overall much better game. And certainly isn't as 'gimicky' as SMS. I like the direction the R and C is taking the platform genre and am in highhopes for a sequal. It's nice to have so many different varitey in worlds, weapons and objectives. You even get to play as a different character rather than just one all the time. Just surprised ho much more FUN I'm having with R and C compared to when I played Mario. Keep in mind I am Nintendo fan, and I still have a place in my heart for Mario, but Ratchet and Clank has set the bar so high. I still find it strange when I say R and C is better then SMS. But it's the real deal folks. If you enjoy platformers, you NEED to check this one out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2002"}

But now having it again I realize how frustrating it can really be. Its simple controls of swing and a miss gameplay made it quite tedious at some parts. This early ps2 game should not of been an excuse for the bad mele, same attacks over and over again being knocked down constantly by your enemies like your being jumped in to a gang. Some missions seemed horriblely over done with orcs with useless allies making this a one man army kind of game. As well as a bad flow and view of the camera, more work should of been put in to this game following a great trilogy,  but not the worst game made after a movie.

Let's start with the good stuff: first of all, the maps in this game have expanded greatly from it's predecessor, with it's largest being Venice. There is a lot more variety in the missions as well: instead of five different missions (all the classic missions in AC1) there is now a larger amount of things to do in a mission. You still get the classic eavesdropping and stalking, but you also get chances to assist allies, upgrade your home base,and work with cool inventions by Da Vinci. The character is upgraded as well, for one thing, YOU CAN SWIM. Also, in AC1, air kills were more of an advanced kill technique and not really noted in tutorial. Now the air assassination is incorperated in the game more as well as other cool moves. Now there are somethings that kind of turned me off. I might be to blame partly, because I got really used to AC1 that the change might have been negative. Anyway, here are some problems: first off, graphics, specifically the characters themselves. You might not notice it, but the enimies you are fighting against show no emotion, their faces are literally blank. Also, they still haven't fixed much of the free-running that is sloppy, even seasoned vetrans have to contend with moves that require specific camera angles to pull off. Finally, the difficulty has changed dramatically. The counter-attack feature lasts longer, which is good for the first bit of the game experience, but it gets a little stale after some time. On the flip end, the have characters ganging up on you on some instances, ending up killing half of your health gone within a few seconds. The thing that really ticks me off is the health idea itself; instead of having it gradually rise like AC1, you have to BUY medicine to get your health back. The money idea has it's ups and downs, it brings more life to the game, but some items end up being overpriced.Overall, this is a great game to own if you are an AC fan. Some old fashioned AC1 vetrans might be turned off slightly, but not enough to make you stop playing. For the vetrans, don't expect the game to be everything like the first, expect more and less at the same time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2010"}

I will go ahead and give it 5 stars even though it's probably not the greatest game ever. I expected it not to be. I knew that it would be fun and it is. It doesn't have to stack up to the Call of Duty series or Halo because it's different and that's the way I like it. I will also give it 5 stars because I know that many others will leave biased negative reviews and trash the game. The only thing about the game that I would have liked to see different is that the levels are a little too linear. I really haven't had a chance to play on multiplayer yet because I got the game early and there was nobody on. I started playing on the Marine campaign and, let me tell you it's a little creepy. It's dark and very atmospheric, just the way it should be. Your'e little motion tracker is thumping and you don't know when one of those aliens is going to just jump right out at you. You'll see the blips on youre tracker but they don't always come at you. Just the way it should be IMOP. Plus killing the aliens isn't always easy. They do maneuver just like they're supposed to and sometimes you will have to unload an entire clip on one just to kill it. The outer exoskeleton shell of the alien is hard like it's supposed to be and it takes a lot to kill the damn things. I think with the majority of negative reviewers they won't like a game unless it's Modern Warfare this day and age. I won't go into the details of the game because others on here are already taking care of that and I haven't played enough of it yet. I don't think I will be changing my stance on it the more I play.

I've been reading about its making for years, and couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  In some ways, it meets my hopeful expectations.  It's very addictive---you are truly driven to try to get your movies to be better rated, your stars more experienced and happier, your lot bigger and more varied and your money situation more stable!  It's kept me up night after night, wanting to release just one more movie!However, I've found some areas quite annoying.  There seems to be a constant shortage of labor in the world this game operates in.  Even when I managed to have my studio rated #1, even during the depths of the Depression when you would think anyone would be very eager to be a highly paid movie star, no-one is lining up at my gates to work.  So I am forced to overwork my few stars and directors to the point that they are driven to drink.  This seems very artifical, like something built into the game just to make it harder.The game also becomes sort of formula driven after a while.  Once you figure out what works (always make movies in the currently popular genre, don't try to write your own scripts, make your stars practice all the time) you find yourself doing that over and over, just to keep the studio high rated in the futile hope you might someday get more stars to choose from.  I found it easy to make money, but after a while there is little to spend it on.The stars are quite bizarre looking!  I would think with the whole of Hollywood to choose from, a studio could cast a few more normal looking folk!I tried a lot to make my own scripts.  The movie maker is a little hard to use, and even after watching the tutorials and reading the manual, I had a lot of areas I was uncertain about. Do I have any control over how long scenes are?  How do I put something in an actor's hand?  I think it should be easier to figure these things out!This sounds like a lot of criticism, and I don't mean to be so critical.  This is a great game in a lot of ways.  I think however it's more of a great GAME, one you figure out the rules to and play the best you can, than a great SIMULATOR, that really gives you the feel of making movies.

T-Energy helped the realm of the High Elves to experience an unimaginable boost of prosperity, making it the reigning culture in Ancaria. But a force as powerful as T-Energy carries great dangers. Not taught how to deal with this, no sooner did the Elves take control, then a heated dispute erupted among them as to how and to what purpose the T-Energy was to be used. Dispute morphed into irresolvable conflict, then rift and eventually to a civil war among the High Elves, where all participants were losers. Their realm collapsed and with it the entire power structure of Anacaria. In the turmoil all the peoples of Anacaria coveted the right, either openly or in secret, to wield the power of T-Energy and in the end, unmanaged, the T-Energy raged out of control warping creature and lands alike. Can anyone regain control over the T-Energy. And if so, will he/she strive to prevent the world from lapsing into final chaos, or deepen it?GameplayGameplay inSacred 2: Fallen Angelin divided into two campaign paths: Light and Dark. As the game begins players choose and customize their character and choose the path they will follow. This choice determines the ultimate goal and intentions of their character, and as the game progresses through literally hundreds of quests and side quests, the paths of different characters intersect at different junctions. Choose one way and you may be tasked to defend a town and its people, while another path could result in you attacking the same town. The choice is yours and the fate of the world and your well-being are at stake.Key Game Features:A massive, seamless and dynamic world delivering hundreds of hours of freeform exploration.Two deep campaigns: play as the 'Light' or 'Shadow' side, complete with distinct skills, rewards and story-elements tailored to the chosen path.Six exceptional, playable characters, each with a distinct look, capabilities and in-game motivation.Modifiable combat arts: change, upgrade and link together your alter ego's combat skills to match your playing style.Fight effectively from the back of a number of mounts under your control; equip and upgrade your character's unlockable special mount.Deities offer unique combat disciplines and unlock additional quests.Seamless transition between single and multiplayer gaming modes via Xbox LIVE.Captivating online modes of play challenge gamers in cooperative, PvP and PvE play.Extraordinary, cutting-edge graphics and Dolby 5.1 channel surround sound utilize the latest technologies for a truly immersive experience.Character ClassesInSacred 2: Fallen Angelplayers assume the role of one of six characters -- five of which are new to the franchise -- and delve into a thrilling story full of side quests and secrets that you will have to unravel. Breathtaking combat arts and sophisticated spells are waiting to be learned. A multitude of weapons and items will be available, and you will choose which of your character's attributes you will enhance with these items in order to create a unique and distinct hero.SeraphimOften referred to as 'Fallen Angels,' these mystical and angelic creatures are the oldest inhabitants of Ancaria. Fast, elegant and acrobatic warriors from a technological future they fight with light to medium weapons and, if required, with massive technological support. Players can assume the role of a Seraphim and protect the world from chaos.Shadow WarriorShadow Warriors were originally humans trained as elite soldiers in service to the High Elves. Upon their death their souls were stolen by an Elven general, bound to lifeless bodies and imbued with T-Energy. Now free, they travel between this world and the next as undead beings with only the desire to return to the peace of the golden halls of Elysium.High ElfThe best student at the ancient academy of magic in Thylysium, the High Elf character lives and breathes magic. Her hunger for adventure and her insatiable desire to increase her personal knowledge and the influence of her once-powerful house are the driving forces as she sets off into an Ancaria boiling over with turmoil.DryadMasters of the hunt and akin to the Elves, The Dryad are in tune with nature and are equipped with the strength of the forests. The most powerful and the strongest among them are knowledgeable of the dark art of voodoo and were chosen in order to save their peoples from extinction. All are expert with the bow, traps, poisons and lore of the forest.InquisitorThe Inquisitors are the High Priests of the High Elves. Arrogant and deadly, they are only committed to themselves and their ultimate goal of assume control over the T-Energy. Proficient in close combat and able to gain increasing power as damage is taken, their manipulative spells make them powerful fighters from the shadows.Temple GuardianSince the beginning of time the purpose of Temple Guardians were to maintain and protect the Great Machine, so that it could keep the world in balance. Neither fully flesh or mechanical, they are half human and half machine. Propelled by T-Energy and devoted to protecting it, they are part of the Great Machine and so able to use the T-Energy for their purposes.A Wide Variety of MountsAcross Ancaria you will find many horse dealers. They offer all kinds of animals, from the simple nag up to a real war horse. You can equip a war horse with bridle, saddle and even special armor. These special items can be found in the game just like player items, ranging in quality from regular to rare and even unique items. In addition, every character also has a unique mount created specifically for their character class. This mount not only fits the personality of the character, but also complements the various aspects of the character's playing style perfectly. All character classes can fight from a mounted position using a variety of tactics that the player chooses depending on the terrain and battle conditions.","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"Good start, but falls apart","reviewText":"I really did enjoy this game a lot when I played it... the first time. But I'm also a completionist, so I like to try to get all the achievements and this makes that incredibly time-consuming. I've owned it for 3 years now and I only play it every now and then whenever I have the time to wade through the next play through.The game is absolutely immense. There are 8 different regions, each with its own part of the main questline that must completed and dozens upon dozens of side quests. Exploring the world for the first time is actually a lot of fun. The rewards for completing quests are a pittance at best, but it can at least provide some motivation to run around killing things and collecting experience and loot.But then the game makes you play through a ridiculous number of times to get all the achievements. There are two different campaigns, one light and one dark, and you get an achievement for playing through each. But once you set a campaign for a new character, you can't change it even for the 'neutral' heroes that can play through both. In order to play the second campaign, you have to start a brand new level 1 character. There are also 5 different levels of difficulty, but you only have access to the first two when making a new character. That means any new character, not just your first: you don't get credit for having played through a difficulty setting with a previous hero. There are achievements for reaching the top 3 difficulties, and while you only have to start a playthrough to get the achievement, you still have to run through 3 full playthroughs and start the 4th just to get that last achievement. This makes a total of 4 full playthroughs right off the bat. In order to get all class-based achievements, you have to play each of the 6 heroes to level 15, which takes about 1-2 hours of repetitive opening game action per hero.You can level up your character as far as 200, and that is apparently generally recommended just to make it to Niob without dying so much you put your controller and the whole console through a wall. However, even on the highest available difficulty and a survival bonus of 100% (meaning your hero has never died), leveling comes to a crawl around level 60. At level 100 it can take hours just to get enough experience for one level. The lower the difficulty, the less experience you get, meaning that playing through on an easier setting with little risk of dying will take even longer to level. You also have to keep moving through the game, as each of the 8 regions have a relative 'max' level at which they stop providing good experience. This level doesn't scale well new difficulties, meaning that when you beat the game and start over at the next difficulty, you get less experience per kill than you were getting at the end of the previous playthrough. So if it was slow before, it'll start anew even slower. Bosses also scale poorly, often being grossly overpowered compared to surrounding enemies. There are also random optional mini-bosses scattered around the map, so you can turn a corner and get nailed while exploring and trying to level.There's an immense and in-depth skill tree with lots of skill interactions. However, if you don't pick literally the perfect set of skills for your hero, they can die in the blink of eye. If you pick one wrong skill or take them in the wrong order, it's just poof, bye-bye. Combined with the leveling issue, this is especially frustrating when trying to get an achievement for making it through one of the easiest two playthroughs without dying. Even doing things absolutely perfectly, and taking your time to level up to a seemingly reasonable number, you can get to the end and meet up with the poorly-scaled final boss and have your hero's entire health bar depleted in just one or two rapid hits. I learned the hard way that the death count doesn't reset on a second playthrough, so once your hero dies you have to start over completely with a brand new level 1 character. This makes this one particular achievement exceedingly frustrating, and has nearly killed the game for me and is the main reason I've had it for 3 years without completing it.Finally, combat is bland. For a game that is so long and involves so much fighting, the combat system could be a lot better. In essence, all you can do is attack and use combat arts and combos. Combos are defined by the user by stacking combat arts into specific attack slots, but you need to waste one of the precious 10 slots on an otherwise absolutely worthless skill in order to open up 3- and eventually 4-move combos. There is no blocking, and no dodging. You just pretty much pick a spot, hold the attack button, occasionally hit the button for a health potion, and generally pray that the screen full of enemies dies before you do. When facing melee bosses (which is most of them), you'll want to have at least 100 of the most powerful health potion available for your level, and just keeping hitting the button for it to constantly heal, and pray that the boss doesn't get two critical hits in before your next potion takes effect. It's just pitifully mindless and dull.But it's also incredibly addictive. After a certain point, armor and weapons become irrelevant. Especially if you play as a Seraphim and use the ranged weapon skill with the BeeEffGee and choose the piercing modification: entire rows of enemies just evaporate before you in a single hit. At higher levels with lots of skill investments, even the grotesquely overpowered bosses can't stand up to it for long (but they can still kill you in two hits if you're unlucky). You can slay monsters to your heart's content, collect their loot, destroy what items you don't want to keep in exchange for gold, and move on to the next enemy-populated area. It may be bland and boring, but sometimes mindless slaughtering of giant spiders and werewolves is a great way to wind down at the end of the day.This games falls victim to the tendency that game developers have these days to make incredibly difficult and poorly balanced games that play like part-time jobs instead of actual interactive entertainment. It also falls victim to the idiotic tendency that game developers have for creating poorly thought-out, monotonous achievements that drag completionist players like myself kicking and screaming through multiple frustrating playthroughs that shouldn't be necessary and which nearly kill the enjoyment factor of the 'game'. But it *is* addictive, and there are lots of combinations to try, and it is incredibly long, and those things all make it at least satisfying for the amount of money spent.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2013"}

I wouldn't say that it was technically a glitch, and something of the same nature happened to me when I was playing Skyrim, but all the same, it still makes you want to rip your hair out.I'm one of those people that like to explore alot, and I don't usually do that many quests until I've been to almost every major area on the map. To make a long story short, Around level 48, and a substantial amount into the main questline, I came across the Lost kingdom quest (a place that I had already discovered early in the game). This quest required that I activate this pillar inside a dungeon, after defeating some huge flying demon. The problem is that I had already activated it earlier in the game, and this time around, it apparently couldn't be activated again, and the only way to move ahead in the quest was to do something to this pillar, and it wouldn't register because I had already messed with it earlier. So...being that this was the main questline, I had to restart the game after playing for more than 60 hours. It is really irritating when this happens in games (Skyrim as well). If games are going to stiff you like that, then you should only be able to take one quest at a time, or not be able to activate things that are only meant for the story. Anyway..this time around, I am not messing with anything outside of quests, except for chests. My only other complaints is that I wish this game would of offered some kind of monster bestiary. A game with this many different kinds of enemies would be much better with some kind of descriptive lore about each enemy, along with artwork of the enemy or even the way they actually look in the game. Clicking the left stick when your fighting allows for some statistics of the current enemy, but it's kind of hard to look at when your you're getting mobbed by 15 enemies. You can also look at the stats of the last 3 enemies in the menu, but it's not very in depth. A bestiary is a very good idea, especially for people that like to get more involved in the game.For anyone buying this game, I recommend that you read the full tutorial located in the quest menu. That is also where you will find all the books you've collected.For the good things about this game, I could probably talk for an hour straight. I have never played Diablo, but I don't imagine that it's as in depth in character customization as Sacred 2 is, because this game is so massive on the numbers scale that I just don't see many games beating it. The thought that went into the character detailing is just amazing. So many different types of weapons and armor! I can't get over the numbers. I was really starting to get some good loot when I had my chance to find valuables up to 28%. And if you don't die, then you get a survival bonus. Just look on your Overview menu. That can be really frustrating when you look at your bonus, and it's up to around 30 or 40%, and you die not even 5 minutes later. Sometimes when you're getting attacked by 10 enemies at once, your health just goes down in what seems like a split second, so stay away from big mobs if your trying to stay alive.This is the best looting game that I have ever played, and it stomps Elderscrolls into the dust. Weapons and armor have originality in this game, and the graphics are also very original. This is a very good game, and if anyone likes RPG type games where you can kill and get loot and explore hidden areas, then you better not pass this up. And in response to someone saying this is a linear game: No, you can't cut straight across the map, and yes, you are more imbedded into your surroundings, but I think I like that alot more because that means that the map is set up for the player, and when I do get to where I am going, I feel more accomplishment.Linear though: this game is not!If you could cut straight across the map (disregarding mountains and cities), then it would probably still take you longer then it would in Skyrim. I'm not saying you cannot cut across, because there are plenty of places to cut through, where you are not on any specific path, but some trails or mountainsides you have to follow if you want to get to where you are going. There is alot of different places to discover, and even the side islands have expansive dungeons with lava, dragons, fire demons, and a purpose! If you sit there and played through the disgustingly boring (generated) side quests from Skyrim (you know, the Dark brotherhood missions that keep telling you to do the same things over and over again, and then all the sudden stop for no reason) then you don't have to worry, because Sacred 2 seems like it's got pretty much everything planned out, and you will feel more purpose for doing things. I don't know about anyone else, but playing Skyrim gave me no accomplishment or intrigue, and with this game, I get that. Just don't pass this up. This is an awesome game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2013"}

I was on the edge with this game because while the demo was lots of fun I couldn't imaging how they could make a decent game out of the concept of Style Point kills. I figured it would get old real fast.  Still I just had to try this out.  It was a bit of a new concept to shooters and boy is this refreshing!!GAMEPLAYThe meat and potatoes of this game.  Pretty much this is like any other shooter but with an edge.  Rather than just kill enemies, you kill them with style!  Leash an enemy to you, kick him in the face then pop his head off for +50 SP instead of a boring +10 for a kill.  Launch an enemy in the air and pull off a quick headshot with a pistol.  Kick a hotdog cart into someone to kill em, then blow it up taking out the rest of the mobs!  This game is about style and finding a myriad of ways to kill people.  I often found myself debating what weapons load out to chose towards the end simply because I wanted to be stylish; yet still try for tricks I had not unlocked yet. There are 2 tabs of \"general\" kills, and each weapon has its own set of stylish kills + 1 tab of hidden style kills you will try to figure out during the game.  Action is fast paced with little downtime and brings only the core elements of a shooter in with it.  There is no real fancy cover system or over the top weapon configuration options. This is just here is a gun... there are 8 baddies rushing you.  Kill em as stylish as possible. Kick em into spikes, throw em off a bridge, headshot, nut shot, throw em into electricity, a grinding wheel, a plant, electrified bugs.  Blow up some explosives and while they are on fire kill em.  Hit em in the face with a cannonball.  Pop a nutshut then kick em in the face :P  go for broke!GRAPHICS / SOUNDThe game graphics are actually quite amazing on the PS3.  The PC has the best graphics(no surprise there, my buddy picked it up for PC and it looks amazing).  The 360 seems to have just a \"slightly\" better graphics appearance than the PS3 but I am not surprised by that. This game was mainly developed on a 360.  The environments are well detailed, weapon detail is great. Coloring and visuals are nice with some pretty good physics.  *** Sound quality is exceptional.  The voice acting is very high quality and believable(despite being over the top), weapon sound effects are great as is ambient sounds in the game.  The sound track is also very killer especially the main menu them ^_^REPLAY / STORYThe storyline for this game is pretty simple but there is enough there to keep it entertaining.  It is obvious just from the first 10 minutes of the game the storyline is just added in there to give the game some flow and direction.  I personally enjoyed the storyline and the way characters interacted.  The campaign (normal difficulty) ran me around 7-8hrs.  About the same time as killzone 3 but part of that was I would restart sections to try and get some trophies on my first playthrough so you can expect more like 6 solid hours of gameplay from the campaign.*** REPLAY value, for me at least, is through the roof.  Not only is the campaign amazing; but the game tracks your stats so you could always try to beat your campaign run.  ONLINE offers Echoes and Anarchy mode  where ECHOES is pretty much running key parts of the SP campaign with a timer and score counter.  Higher you get your SP the cooler you look on the high scores chart.  ANARCHY is like horde mode.  You have waves of mobs and have to hit a certain amount of SP before advancing with your team. However you can't be a lone gunman with this mode; as there are a set # of mobs meaning you need to WORK AS A TEAM to achieve the scores and pull of team based skill moves.  If you get some people willing to work as a team this mode can be a lot of fun (or just get some friends together and try to last as long as you could)OVERALL (90% 9.0/A-)This game for me gets a 90%.  It is fantastic and for those who aren't to heavy into MP competition this is the perfect shooter to pick up.  While it can't compete with other MP shooters out there, it provides a fun and memorable campaign with over the top dialogue - and a MP element that has both competition and requires teamwork.  In my book, this is a must have title for any FPS fan period.  While this game isn't Killzone 3, Halo: Reach, Gears of War 2... it is a breath of fresh air that more than makes up for that and well deserving of a 5 star rating.* The only NEGATIVE I have about this game is the dialogue at times could be far to over the top and at times I did find myself getting stuck in textures(like I get hit by an explosion and it pushes me on-top of a texture and can't get down so I had to die/restart checkpoint)** LIMITED EDITION VERSION **It contains 25,000XP for multiplayer (you start at level 5), a silver leash color, a few skins for your character's gear, and additional Echoes maps (included with your online pass).  All the \"content\" provided by the Limited Edition is ONLINE ONLY.  The skins and such are only accessible as options for your multi-player character which kind of is a downer for me as the Silver Leash looks wicked cool. Would love to use it in the campaign.the 360 version of Bulletstorm - Limited Edition also comes with a Gears of War 3 beta invitation so if you enjoyed Gears of War and have a 360... try to get your hands on a LE version for free Beta access.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-27-2011"}

There must a Skyrim Awareness Club on this website for most reviews to be coming up the day the game came out saying the game is \"broken\" due to the technicality issues that this game consists of. Well it is a fact that Bethesda is known for their open-world RPGs coming up with technical frustrations. Bethesda's Fallout: New Vegas became 1 of the most unpleasant gaming experiences in my life. The frustrations with F:NV were non-stop. The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim does contain some of the same technical issues as with previous games, but nothing that tempted me to turn the game off. So far I'm over 50 hours into the game with a 10mb save file and bugs do show up from time to time. I deleted the auto-saves and turned the auto-saves off, and now the game is running smoother than it was before. As a friendly note to Amazon.com, i think they should look into some of the reviews that have been repeated by previous customers about the game being \"broken.\" Like i said earlier: its almost like theres a Skyrim Awareness Club going on somewhere. Their might be someone who might want to buy the game, and i think the last thing the person needs is to be discouraged from the idea of passing up a good game.

{"product_name":"B002I096AA","description":"","reviewerName":"Bbt","summary":"Weak Launch","reviewText":"Received my 3DS today and played with it a bit then got bored and put it on the charger. My biggest problem isn't the 3DS but the launch. The launch titles are dull and boring games which do not push the hardware nor impress me much as games.Aside from the poor launch, the 3DS hardware and software has some glaring problems. The 3DS comes with three cameras, but they are very low resolution which makes them not very useful. Also a flash would have been a nice addition to the device as low resolution cameras perform terrible in dark settings. Another gripe about the 3DS is the design. It doesn't have the smooth rounded edges like the Lite has and instead is quite jagged and feels a bit awkward at times. Also the stylus is located in a difficult to access spot and you basically need to have the stylus out before you start playing. Lastly there is the quite discussed poor battery life. Using 3D you'll get less than 3 hours of gameplay. Keep in mind that after 500 charges the 3DS battery life will be reduced to 70% of the normal life.There are also quite a few issues with the software on the 3DS. The 3DS does not come with a web browser. The PSP and DS had terrible web browsers that were practically useless. I had hoped since this is the next gen device and is being released several years later that they'd have a functional web browser. Instead we get a web browser icon and the notification that someday there will be a web browser... Also the 3DS download store isn't up yet, that'll also come with a future update.Questionable hardware design, weak launch titles and missing software left me feeling incomplete after opening up and playing my 3DS. Of course all this might change when better games come out and system updates add software features.My biggest concern is the 3DS will lose support and a cheaper version of the 3DS will come out with far more features after a year or two.UPDATE 8/15/2-12Seems my prediction came true. Shortly after the 3DS price dropped. Now they're releasing a larger version of the 3DS with a sleeker design and some other minor improvements.Do not buy the 3DS from Amazon. It's cheaper at Walmart and most other retailers.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002I096AA","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Sherman \"The Critic\"","summary":"The Eye Opener","reviewText":"Unlike with my Nintendo DS, the 3DS was more of an impulse purchase with a starting bid of 99 cents.  But after 2 months of testing the capabilities of this handheld system, I have no regrets yet.As far as the design goes, the main controls on the 3DS are right where they should be, especially its analog circle pad.  But it's strange that the developers have stuck the slot for the retractable stylus in the back of the console.  What's more, the protruding touch screen would've scratched the top screen if not for having screen protectors on hand, plus the Select, Home, and Start buttons sure don't feel like buttons and they're often unresponsive.Though probably its most controversial feature, the system's 3D effect is far from its biggest selling point.  While impressive, I often find myself turning up the 3D depth slider slightly or not touching it at all.  I do enjoy taking 3D photos with the built-in camera, though.Speaking of 'built-in,' the 3DS includes a bunch of software right out of the box.  Create your own Mii in Mii Maker; gather more in Mii Plaza; bring your scenery to life with Augmented Reality cards and games, record and edit music with 3D Sound; smack your friends around in Face Raiders; download extra apps, game demos and more through Nintendo eShop and Download Play; and review your progress in Activity Log.Wireless features add more incentive to take the 3DS wherever you go.  While Spotpass lets you download exclusive web-based content, Streetpass lets you share saved game data with other 3DS owners and vice-versa.  For Spotpass to work, just keep your 3DS closed and the wireless switch on while near a wifi hotspot.  Streetpass has a few more variables; you must keep your system closed and the wireless switch on and hope to walk pass someone using their 3DS in the same fashion.What's regarded as a dealbreaker for many is the limited battery life of the 3DS, running for up to 5 hours with 3DS software and 8 hours with DS/DSi software.  An AC adapter and a charging cradle are provided to remedy this, but couldn't Nintendo resolve the issue BEFORE the handheld's release?Regardless of that, if you've missed the DSi, you can't go wrong with the 3DS--at least until the next big redesign.This review will be revised with further testing of the product.This system is recommended for ages 7+.  If used by children under 7, the 3D feature should be disabled.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2012"}

As a matter of fact, if you already have D1 and 2 launching them from the disc will bring up your current save files, it is the EXACT same version up on XBLA so no worries. As for the BFG package, there is a WHOLE lot of goodness for the price. The main game looks awesome after the makeover. 3D players will love the way the 3D looks too, they did a very good job on that. A couple of small issues, you cannot play D 1 and 2 unless you DO NOT install D 3. Weird, but it is by design for some reason (they mention it in the manual, so it is not a bug but intended). Another issue I have is that every now and then the 3D option will just stop being available upon launch and I don't know why. All my hardware stays hooked up the same as do all of my software settings, I'm changing nothing and yet sometimes 3D just doesn't show up as an option at all. Thankfully the fix is easy, just go back to dash and load the game again, the 3D option reappears. Online is smoother running than ever for this game, I can really feel how Ragetech improved the performance.

{"product_name":"B000KLNLV4","reviewerName":"Turtle502","summary":"Excellent, Fun Game, but has its flaws","reviewText":"Put simply, Dark Sector is a fun game.  The game has unique puzzles that incorporate the various abilities of the glaive, this unique weapon that your character \"Hayden\" uses throughout the game.  The glaive eventually gains an ability called \"aftertouch\", which allows you to steer the glaive toward your enemies or objectives by taking on the third-person view of the glaive itself -- you travel along with it, in slow-motion, until it hits its intended target...and better yet, you get to see the results up-close.The game has really smooth gameplay, and I did not encounter any bugs, defects, or poor framerate issues.  The voice-acting is superb, and the sound on this game rates as \"one of the best\" I have ever encountered.  The controls are well laid out, and as Hayden obtains more and more abilities as the game progresses, the controls never become overwhelming or confusing.The weapon upgrade system in this game is somewhat deficient.  Once an  upgrade is applied to a weapon, there appears to be no way to remove it.  The \"blackmarket\" upgrade sites are few and far between, and once you swap out a weapon from your locker, you're stuck with whatever you have, until you either backtrack or get to the next location.The environments in the game are a mixed bag.  Ultimately, this game plays a lot like Resident Evil 4, in terms of the controls and the underlying game engine.  At times, the levels feel like a mix of Condemned, Resident Evil 4, Tomb Raider, and sometimes even Bioshock.  Some of the levels, especially the later ones, look much better than others, a sign that development may have gone off in several different directions until they brought the final game together.The game has a good save system, so you won't find yourself repeating sections tirelessly.The AI is not advanced. At times, it seems all the enemies just rush you. Some of the enemies have special abilities that make them more difficult to defeat. However, the enemies come at you in very predictable waves.  By the time you're 50% through the game, you can predict the patterns.  Melee combat is weak.There's a loosely woven story that keeps the game moving along. The cut-scenes are well-done. What doesn't make sense, at times, are the number of bosses that appear in the game, which seem totally unrelated to anything that is going on from Hayden's viewpoint. Most of the bosses are extremely time-consuming to figure out -- they are puzzles themselves.  There are no health meters on the bosses, so you never know if what you're doing is actually working.From a replay-value perspective, you may be compelled to play the game at least twice, since completing the single-player campaign unlocks the \"brutal\" difficulty, worth an achievement. There are a few achievements dedicated to online play, which this game supports.  However, the online population for this game has been very small.This game has probably been overlooked by many gamers.  The environments, bosses, and gameplay may seem dated, but the glaive and its unique abilities make the game rewarding and fun.  I'm glad I picked it up.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2008"}

I have not been quite so addicted to playing since Fallout 3.  Just one more mission, one more thing to do, one more level..... The developers must have employed some gambling consultants, because the punishment reward cycles are just about right for optimizing the addicting dopamine release that comes with playing Borderlands.  I have not played the on-line coop side (yet) and am getting through the first play as a \"siren\".At the beginning, you pick a character.  I like playing characters with somewhat supernatural powers, so Lilith as a phase shifting siren was a logical choice.  There are other more traditional soldier, tank, and assassin characters, each with their own set of special qualities.  Lilith seems to be surviving just fine without a super high level of brute strength.  Her quality of being able to phase shift and \"disappear\" helps with running away when the odds are really bad, and also with sneak melee and weapon attacks.  For the most part, she prefers elemental weapons and can use corrosive, shock, fire, and explosive weapons to her advantage.  Very fun.This game is very similar to Fallout 3 in a couple of ways.  It is an open sandbox of many playable areas.  Unlike Fallout 3, Borderlands is strictly first person, except when you are entering a vehicle.  It is a desolate environment with different baddies inhabiting each area.  It is sci-fi on another planet with alien technology.  There is a central story line, there are lots of side quests -- some really fun, others not so much -- again much like Fallout 3.The good:+Weapons:  Literally thousands.  The they get better as you level up and battle more dangerous baddies.  You learn what you like, and sometimes literal firepower is not all you might want - in fact, different \"brand name\" weapons with the same specs behave differently and you will probably have a preference.  Lilith likes things that burn, shock, corrode, and explode;  there are a huge range of handguns, snipers, SMG, combat rifles, and even more alien things, accommodating your skill set as you level up.  +Ammo is plentiful from loot and vending machines.+Loot.  Always fun in any game, and it is plentiful and well marked in Borderlands.  You learn where the good stuff might have spawned as you play.+Your own specific power: fun and as you level up it becomes much more useful.  Lilith likes phase shifting in and out of action, maybe killing things as she enters or exits.+Shields: again, lots of choices.  My personal favorite came off of a \"kill\"--notably one that had moderate shielding with an unmarked but speedy health regen.  You have choices of shields that do things when they are depleted, shields that regenerate health, and simple super shields that have large capacity.+Vehicle drivability:  unlike many PC games where you might need a controller to navigate and drive a vehicle, you will find the immediate pleasure of not only driving the \"sand buggy\" but also driving while fighting.  A very interesting and fun experience when only using a mouse and a couple of buttons on your keyboard.+Graphics: simply awesome.  Not exactly like playing a comic book, but not photo realistic either.  +Skill points and leveling up.  Just about right time frames for getting experience points that allow you to pick skills for your character.  It will be pretty obvious which skills you probably want right away - notably ones that capitalize on your character skill and raw fighting abilities.  Later it becomes more difficult to decide what you might need or want, but that is part of the fun.+Battles.  Challenging, sometimes overwhelming, but always needing some strategy.+Respawning your character.  A great system where you pay a percentage of your money to go back to a prior save.  The saves are strictly at certain points where you pass a certain clearly marked post, but they are about right.  If you are in the middle of a battle, you will be very close to where you were (sometimes dangerously close), and in most cases things will have stayed down --what you killed will still be dead.  If you exit the game, you start over at a more central point outside of the battle.  Some might not like this type of save, I personally did not find it too bad.+Overall difficulty.  Well balanced, with plenty of warnings you are about to take on something you will need to spend some time with.Now, the bad:--Backpack size.  It is too small at the beginning and does not really get much larger as the game progresses.  For Borderlands to present thousands of weapons, it is silly to provide 18 slots up to level 30.  Double it and I would have been happier.  Ammo amounts are limited, but do not count in the backpack slots, and you can purchase more ammo capacity.-Fetch and grab weapon scavenger hunts are irritating, and after a couple where I had to do multiple attempts at acrobatic moves just for the last piece, just to find out that the weapon I was given was something to drop, I just stopped doing them.-Storyline.  The storyline is not as rich as Fallout 3, and while the sandbox is big, and fun, the story is just not as exciting.  --Characters you meet and interact with... no real conversations are ever available, including disappointingly, with the main quest character Patricia Tannis.  This is not Dragon Age!  No matter, Borderlands was never meant to be an epic, only fun.--Computer lock-ups requiring pulling the plug on my computer. The screen freezes and nothing will coax it out, or even allow you to exit the program via task manager.  While this problem is occasional and predictable (with sound and motion warnings at least 30 seconds up to the point where they occur), I have not found a complete workaround yet.  I am running Windows Vista 64 SP-2, on i7 Core 920 3G / ATI-4850HD / 12 G ram combo. All my drivers are up to date.  I have tried shutting down almost everything that might be running in the background and tying things up, but nothing has stopped these occasional glitches.  Strangely enough, if this does occur, once I shut down and restart, the problem will not reoccur in that playing session.  Oh well.I am still playing, will purchase any DLCs that come out, and find Borderlands just about the most addictive game I have ever played.  It is simple fun, without a lot of fluff, nice controls, super weapons/powers/looting, and easy to play right from the beginning.  +5 for addictive gameplay.  4.0 for execution.  3.5 for storyline.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2010"}

Twilight Princess doesn't attempt to do anything differently it reminded me instantly of ocarina of time. From the locations(you revisit some of the temples from oot).

That being said. The story mode was waaaaaay too short. The characters while they all had powers unique to them were not too terribly exciting otherwise. The locations were drab and dull in my opinion and the interesting ones got boring after a few matches. If you are looking for a side-fighter I would not recommend this game.

{"product_name":"B005THAX6K","description":"","reviewerName":"Jeff Johnson \"Jeff Johnson\"","summary":"A good rental, that will force you to pay $30 to finish the story","reviewText":"Plenty of people bought this game sight unseen, because its Aliens and its from Gearbox which made the hit game Borderlands. Plus the screenshots and videos looked really awesome. Well the great looking media is a lie. The reality is that this is a game that has been in development since 2006 and the actual in game graphics show that this was probably meant for Playstation 2. The cut scenes look terrible and low resolution.With that being said, this is a sequel that is designed to fit between Aliens and Alien 3. This creates giant plot holes like why are they back at the Aliens planet and how the nuclear explosion didn't destroy everything. Or how a key character from the Aliens film got back. Not that I'm spoiling anything, you'll know it really quick. Major questions aren't answered, but I have a feeling they'll all be answered in the $30 DLC.I did like the game for the 3 days that I played it, even if it was easy. The weapons have no punch or impact. Plus the weapons were designed for multiplayer with accuracy stats so you have a 70% chance of hitting them depending on the weapon. Even in single player. You can do the single player campaign cooperatively, but the extra players don't take pre existing roles they're just added into the game which just makes an easy game even easier.There are trophies galore. Glitches galore. Clipping glitches like being able to throw a face hugger off you through a wall. Closing doors on NPCs to see them half in and half out of the door. The final boss you can clip through. Having my NPC friend run in slow motion... hilarious. I reload my weapon as I'm cutting the door so it goes into the ammor reload animation and the timer for the door cutting. Then goes into the door cutting.After the first few hours, there is a great stealth level where you are gunless and forced to creep through an alien's den undetected. That level offers the most tense gameplay that would be similar to Alien 1. I really feel like you should have been less overpowered in this game. You feel like Hercules vs a kitten farm, because there is near limitless ammo and plenty of armor. You get regenerating health in brackets, which some would complain about, but its fine. The non human enemies barely hit you. They just jump out and straight into your gun fire. They either appear in front or behind you. Never from the side or the ceiling or the floor like they do in the movies.If I don't not insta killing everyone I can see the enemy AI does have intelligence, which is strange, because it sure didn't playing the PC version. While the aliens are no threat at all, the human soldiers are a bigger threat, but pretty clueless when you flank them, but I guess that's a problem in most games. Friendly AI ends up shooting at walls thinking they can shoot through them. Another hilarious glitch is that 3 aliens will all jump to the exact same spot all at once and take up the same space directly in front of you.The final and biggest glaring issue that I have is that to complete the story you need to buy $30 DLC that may or may not ever get finished. But you can buy it. That is the biggest insult of the game to anyone that spent $60 on this game is knowing they have to pay an extra $30 to finish it. My feeling would be different if I thought OMG that was a great game and I'm gonna play it again and again until the DLC comes out! Gearbox could have still done DLC to further the story. Maybe I'd be less angry with the ending if they had the ending after the final boss lead into the DLC. Kind of like the end would be the beginning of the DLC and not end the game. On top of that.... I have a feeling the game is so easy, because they want that $30 from you and the DLC will be more difficult.With all of this being said, I felt Aliens vs Predator 2010 was a better game with a better story, with better graphics and lighting, with better multiplayer. Take that for what it's worth. Please rent this game if anything.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-04-2013"}

This game doesn't seem to be as difficult to play as Civ3, which was impossible on anything but the first two difficulty settings. Here, they have done a much better job with the difficulty playing against computer-run civs. I can't comment on all the apparent crashes and bugs because the game ran fine on both of my computers without a hitch. I did install the first patch right after installing (as a matter of habit) so maybe that made a difference. I ran into a recent problem with the 1.52 patch that prevents the game from recognizing the CD. I can insert the CD and it will fire up, but then I get a popup message saying I have to insert the CD-ROM. Some stupid annoying copy protection crap, and it's faulty. So I grabbed the no-cd crack from gamecopyworld.com and that solved the problem. This game is a lot of fun and I'll be playing it for the next couple years. However, it's not as much fun as Civ3. I can't quite explain why, it just isn't as addictive. One improvement I like is that it's now entirely possible to wage all out war without a single battle lasting 1000 relative years. In the real world, many wars waged across the globe in a span of 20-30 years (namely, the rise of the Roman Empire), so why a single battle among a few cities would last centuries is just plain bad design, and that has always been my biggest gripe with the Civ series. But in Civ 4, that seems to be less of a problem.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2006"}

The ability to jump onto and climb objects gives you the capability to roam around a bit.  The AI is intuitive at higher difficulty.

The story is entertaining, and there is some replay-ability, but they have nerfed most of the high end weapons.  This makes any of the end game fights completely not worth trying, even with completely loaded characters (which 99% of people are not).

In the past NINTENDO has made a number of bad decisions yet the company always manages to land on its feet for nothing else but for a single reason: it never forgets that gamers want first to have fun. And SUPER MARIO GALAXY II is an excellent example.The Wii console may have been made such a huge success story by applications such as Wii-FIT, but it will be remembered for the fun it offers with games such as this one. SUPER MARIO GALAXY II makes the Wii shine at its best.Princess Peach cannot seem to stay ...un-kidnapped more than a week, so her faithful plumber has to move heaven and earth to save her - yet again...But do we really need an excuse to dive in this galaxy of magic mushrooms, star-bits and coins, secret levels and surprising solutions to, apparently, insurmountable obstacles?The levels blend beautifully 2D and 3D environments and the controls work superbly. I hadn't touched a console since my University years and had to get used to the controls of ZELDA: TWILIGHT PRINCESS - yet found the controls of SUPER MARIO GALAXY II to fit like a glove from the very first moment.This installment is not one you can breeze through, there are challenging moments. If you get stuck in a level you can ask for a mini-tutorial - but keep in mind that there is no free lunch in this galaxy: your need for assistance will be marked. Then again, retrying a level was never more fun.There is invincible Rainbow-Mario, Rock-Mario, Spring-Mario and Cloud-Mario. And then there are Lumas and Yoshi. Every world has been imaginatively designed and gorgeously drawn. It is like a supernova of creativity exploding again and again.

{"product_name":"B000TG72OW","reviewerName":"A. C. Ege/Acedoh \"acedoh\"","summary":"Welcome to Liberty City**Special Edition Review","reviewText":"Niko is new to America.  Brought by hopes and promises of his cousin Roman about how wealthy he is.  Unfortunately for Niko he quickly finds the stories to be lies.  Grand Theft Auto IV starts as others in the series with an anti-hero.  Getting involved in doing the wrong things is all to easy in this game.  From the very get go you are learning that living the American life can be difficult and in order to get your story going you must break the law.  For the most part Niko doesn't have a problem with this since he has become raw after being a soldier in war.GTA IV has probably one of the darkest stories so far in the series.  This is not the type of game you will play and comment on how cheerful the story is.  For those of you who have played previous GTA games you will notice many similarities.  From the gameplay mechanics to the story line.  Although people who are new to the GTA series will find how simple the learning curve really is in this game.  The game gives you an incredible amount of tutorials and guides you thru your first several missions making things easy to understand.  Most features in this game are simple to understand and keep this game from getting over anyones learning curve.What has made the Grand Theft Auto series so superb is the story telling.  Excellent voice acting with intense and exciting missions make GTA IV a true winner.  From the first moment on you will notice that you aren't really playing a game as much as taking part in an intense crime drama.  Think Sopranos from the former Soviet Union.  The game is mission based and gives you the ability to choose what you want to do at any given point.  You meet numerous characters who are all about committing crimes and they give you certain jobs.  Of course these jobs increase your reputation and help progress you thru the story.  Along the way you will find numerous characters.  Some you will like and others you will probably want to get rid of yourself.This game has further evolved ideas from previous GTA games.  Niko can not only date one woman at a time but several.  It's really up to you.  Just remember how in real life this can be time consuming it can also be in a game.  You will have woman calling and texting you if you ignore them to long.  Then comes taking them out for dates.  Each woman has different tastes and interests and it's up to you to know where to take them.  Some of the activities can actually be fun like playing darts or pool as these mini games do have learning curves.  The girl you are with will respond to your success or failure at these games.  Obviously there are numerous other activities in wonderful Liberty City.  Also it's important for Niko to accessorize and finding the best clothing to wear is important.  Image is everything as as you progress you get access to better clothes.  The car mechanics have improved in this game but don't expect to have similar handling to a racing game.  What is cool to look at is the amazing detail they have put into the car damage.  Every little ding makes an impact on the car you are in.  Lastly is the music selection.  An incredible 200 songs are available in Liberty City to listen to on the radio.  Numerous radio stations including the talk ones belt out hit songs and comedic advertisements.  Niko even has the ability to watch t.v.  They covered every detail in this game and it shows.As if a single player mode that will take you 30 to 40 hours to beat is not enough there is also online multiplayer.  Yes you and 15 others can play on the beautiful streets of Liberty City.  The multiplayer is truly open ended for your enjoyment.  Several game modes plus the ability to create your own multiplayer.  You can also invite seven friends to take on eight others.  It's easy to say this game will be enjoyed for months on end.  For those of you choosing between the PS3 and 360 version you may have to consider the 360 will have it's own unique content in 6 months available on XBOX LIVE.It's easy to be impressed by Liberty City.  It's as close to New York City as any game has ever got.  From the pedestrians that make up the neighborhood to the realistic design of the buildings.  The weather changes and the days progress realistically.  This is one of those games where you can just take it in and enjoy the scenery.  In Grand Theft Auto you have the freedom to do what you want.  This game is intended for adults.  The language and content can be mature most of the time.  Although that is at a parents discretion.  I wouldn't suggest this game for everyone.  Although I would suggest it for those who have enjoyed previous Grand Theft Auto games.  I would also suggest it for those who enjoy mafia or crime movies.  This game will have you sitting back and enjoying the incredible story.  Just don't forget that it's your story to play.**Now for those of you asking.  Is the special edition good for you???  If you are a GTA diehard fan I would say yes.  If you enjoy getting extras for extra money I would say yes.  The Special Edition comes with a mediocre soundtrack album featuring songs you may have never heard before.  You also get a good quality lock box with a duffle bag.  In the box is a rockstar key chain.  I now own this stuff.  It's nice but I don't think it's of the best value.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2008"}

Discover the true origins of Dracula and the Belmont family in this exciting first episode of the saga.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"Delivers a Reasonable Game of Thwarting Evil","reviewText":"I marvel at Konami.  They sought the bravery to live up to what PS1's Castlevania: Symphony of Night has left behind.  They are  just plain gutsy.  If this kind of creation were to be in my hands, I would feel the ricochet of a hand grenades splinter everything within my stomach.  Konami's reattempt of a 3D landmark not only has to confront the magnitude of SotN, but the latest and greatest GBA installments.  If that weren't enough to degrade their morale, the bitter memory of N64's Castlevania still reeks the air.  With the overwhelming odds hurling against them, I am not surprised that the label who brought you such established titles as Metal Gear Solid and Suikoden, fight back to liberate themselves from their once, horrible Castlevania past.  Yet, do they forge a hit?  In the words of your casual gamer, most definitely.  However, as a fellow fan of SotN and wholly valuing the RPG ingredients, Lament of Innocence simply gets the job done.  To say the most, Castlevania: Lament of Innocence is upgraded to the third dimension, and contends to be a slick hack-and-slash.  However, the lacking RPG elements which made SotN and Aria of Sorrow so grand, leaves me grief-stricken.Lament of Innocence is the preface of all Castlevania games that have come and gone.  Leon Belmont and his friend, Mathias, screen the lands of all that is evil.  On such a night, Mathias finds out his wife unexpectedly dies.  Plagued by grief, Mathias is unable to bring up his weapon.  Next, an invasion of unknown ghouls raid the land.  Leon, strictly ordered not to engage the demons, can only watch until he discovers his love is missing.  Leon discovers that she is taken in a mysterious castle owned by legions of the undead and Dracula himself.  Leon, furious, goes against directives not to dispute the matter, and launches into the Eternal Forest and sets foot in the castle alone.  He must now crush the Count with his great big whip (no pun intended)!  As the plot thickens, a number of things are explained, and it does a very good job.  My minor protest leans toward the lackluster lines from the cut scenes, one reason why I can`t fully immerse myself into Japanese Anime.  A deftly crafted environment of gothic horrors, Lament of Innocence delivers a reasonable story of thwarting evil.The fundamentals which made Castlevania a franchise before SotN is back, bigger, and badder.  If you already manifested an impression from N64's attempt, forget it.  But if you, like myself, have fallen for SotN and the Aria of Sorrow, a different genre altogether, I can't blame you if you breathe fire.  It lacks the depth I have grown accustomed to.  Don't let it utterly dissuade you though, because Lament of Innocence is very gratuitous to barrel through.  Instead of the multitude of weapons before, the trusty whip takes its rightful role, as you are given the opportunity to slay the endless tide of nasties.  Whether you like it or not, Lament of Innocence is a hack-and-slash.  You advance from room to room, defeat enemies in every corner, gain items to win passage, and fight gigantic bosses along your merry way.  Interesting enough, there is a new control set up than previous games.  Leon is given the line up of weak and strong attacks, jumps, the traditional sub-weapons (crosses, axes, daggers, etc.), blocking, and dodging.  The difficulty climbs as you progress further into the game, enemies are unbeatable until you bring special combos into the battle.  Leon is awarded with abilities as he explores the castle's many rooms.  No leveling up, you are upgraded with more combos and scant magic, which is entirely of no use in the game.  You can also equip a minute digit of armor, capes, relics, and weapons.  Orbs are also thrown in to aid Leon.  They imbue special powers to the secondary weapons.  Somehow, despite the 3D that surrounds the game, Lament of Innocence closely plays as 2D trapped in a 3D world.  The action is unrelenting, in your face with awesome enemies and menacing bosses.  Blocking enemy strikes is fun as the intensity of the game arises.  Frequent are your save points, and the bosses are not a letdown.  As usual, they offer their challenging, creative methods of annihilating.  Also there are a nice variety of monsters, who'll whoop your butt a couple of times.  Your venture will take you over excellent level composition and some eye-brow arching puzzles.  Gushing with countless rooms, the game is brilliant in its artistry and genuinely merits the ambiance of a Castlevania game.The unpleasant side of the game is mainly contributed to the terrible camera.  A nuisance, the camera is held in weird angles while in battle and jumping on some platforms.  During heated battles, the monsters can obscure your view of Leon as you try to hack your way through the packs of whatever.  Other times the camera is slow and bogs you from keeping up with Leon.  I can't help but feel that Konami rushed the game so it can hit stores before Halloween.  These camera glitches can setback the game.  Other than the camera flaw and the realization that Lament of Innocence doesn't hold up to SotN's substance, it does conquer the realm of 3D rather finely.  As far as dungeon crawlers, it is very satisfying.Booming with quality and bleeding with gothic style, its rewarding to behold the surroundings.  Enormously stuffed with nightmarish flair, the setting is detailed and artistically admirable.  There is a plethora of different monster designs and objects furnishing room to room.  The lighting effects are definitely worth gazing dumbly at, and the number of enemies and special effects on screen keep up with you as you hack, hack, and hack through them.  The white spheres that explode on impact look extremely awesome.  Slowdown doesn't arise from the occasion, if anywhere to be found.  Leon himself looks impressive, and definitely stands out from the demons as the protagonist.  Enemies thoroughly string up grotesque exquisiteness, not to mention the imposing bosses.  Dark and gritty, Dracula's castle is gothic and worth taking a nice, long stare at.One of the most striking traits of SotN was the clever soundtrack.  The original composer returns and delivers the goods.  Working with an assortment of instruments, composing industrial music, and a choir to back it up is absolutely moving.  Lament of Innocence strives to be amongst the most memorable soundtracks ever, period.  The situations are coupled together with the melodies, each track of music is properly thrown in.  Sound effects are executed in precise perfection with the snapping whip and the assaults Leon and his enemies lob at each other.  Despite the awful lines in the cut scenes, the voiceovers suitably fit the appearance of each character.  Plus, like Symphony of the Night, you can play the disc on a stereo and listen to the impossibly beautiful soundtrack.Castlevania: Lament of Innocence outlines itself to master 3D.  It grants plenty of old-fashioned, kill everything in sight enjoyment.  And who doesn't love that?  Furthermore, just listen to the music!  It's probably one of the best soundtracks ever conceived in a videogame.  Concluding the game are hidden extras, new characters, and different difficulty settings.  Pumping with eye-candy, a powerful musical score, and top-notch speedy action, this game amounts to a reputable Castlevania installment.  I may have my own laments of the missing RPG construction, but this has to be the beginning of something superb.  Future Dracula-hunting, may yet find its way into the magic that is Symphony of the Night.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car.

I also said it plays smoothly on my 1ghz AMD Athlon system with (only) a Geforce2 Pro video card. This means I was getting great framerates at 1024x768 with all the details on so I was really surprised to see all of the complaints.  Many were from people with systems a lot more powerful than mine. Hopefully these tips will help get your game working or help you decide if your system can handle this game before you buy it.1) The components you need to look at, in order of importance, are the video card, memory (RAM), and CPU speed.  Some have complained of problems with off brand or integrated sound cards.  I use a SBLive so I can't confirm, but Soundblaster users shouldn't expect problems.  High performance PC games generally require quality components to run efficiently.2) For video, make sure you have a 64MB card, preferrably Nvidia based and either a Geforce2 TI or faster.3) Ati Radeon users, if you have an 8500 you should have no problems. If you have a 7500 you'll probably be tweaking the settings a little.4) Make sure get the latest video drivers. I'd post links to where you can get them but the dumb censors here always delete them. Do a search and you'll figure it out.  Nvidia users - I'm using the 28.32 drivers and the game runs great.5) 256MB memory or greater is important for the game to run smoothly.6) CPU - make sure you have 800Mhz (Intel or AMD) or better.  You may be able to get away with slightly slower as long as your other components are up to par.7) Defragging the hard drive may help but very little. The game rarely accesses the hard drive once the level is loaded.8) If you have a Geforce2 MX card, the MX card is the problem. Sorry folks but those cards are real slugs.  If you have a Geforce 4 MX card and you're whining, your card is a slug too. My Geforce 2 Pro is almost as fast as your card. Geforce3 and Geforce 3 Ti cards are faster than yours. If you don't believe me, consult the 3Dmark website for proof. Remember these words Nvidia card buyers - - MX = SLUG. That said, you should still get decent framerates from this game as long as you update your drivers.Yes, Rockstar Games probably should be taken around back and slapped for saying this game will run on a P450 with a 16meg video card (minus one star for that nonsense). Maybe they'll include a 'work over a Rockstar programmer' mission in their next release.Hope this helps.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-11-2002"}

Autosave files still get corrupted. I save a lot more and reload the game after 3 hours.3. The local maps are terrible - following them in large buildings are incomprehensible, worse than Fallout 3.4. Some side quests can't be completed, they remain open. No pointers and their options are sometimes all faded.5. I don't have any more quests available. I'm still trying to get some. Their should be a lot available.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Why Oh Why Has This Been Done?FREQUENTLY this game, New Vegas:1. Hangs up.2.

{"product_name":"B00886WO5W","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Jones","summary":"Alright boys, roll up your sleeves 'cause this is a mess.","reviewText":"Is this better than Dead Island? Yes. Is it a good game? Relatively.Dead Island Riptide actually has a good story. It has a new addition to the character selection. It has new weapons and ways to use those weapons. The combat is fluid and responsive without giving the player absolute power. You are still a vulnerable human with weaknesses that the zombie hoard will pick apart.But the game has flaws. The first play-through was fine but the second proved to be full of game crashes. Why? Maybe it was the update. The single player difficulty was THROUGH THE ROOF. What do the developers think is going to happen when Xbox Live is no longer supported? I guess they are banking on us not playing the thing.But you can transfer your character level progression from Dead Island to the sequel and it is a warm welcome. You get a head-start in the game but only a little bit. Your level is high without giving you too much of an edge. The level cap has been increased so there is still some way to go before you can max out your character.The story has more emotion and the NPC characters are more relatable and associative. You also get to see your fellow immune survivors at base when no one is playing as them. That's refreshing.The graphics are nice. They aren't pretty but that has never bothered me. The graphics do their job and that's all I need.The new enemies made little to no sense and the difficulty is much higher because of them. There is a loss of balance with the new enemies like the Screamer and the Wrestler (Seriously, they couldn't come up with a better name). They do not make the game bad such much as distraction. New moves to old zombies also increase the insufferable nature of the game while also adding to the challenge. It's a double edged sword, so to speak.If you need a number score then I give this game a 7/10 for doing things right while also doing some wrong.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2013"}

I was pretty disappointed and after a few frustrating deaths arising from the inability of my PC to keep up, I simply gave up.When I purchased my Alienware last year, I came across Doom 3 gathering dust in one of my CD folders and tried to do it again.  Bitter irony - my graphics card would not break a sweat, of course, but it wouldn't play nice with the NEW card because of antiquated code.However, I was excited to see that they were going back to remaster Doom 3 for consoles and the PC in HD and upgrade the sound.  And now...I am a HAPPY Doom 3 owner.  :)How does performance stack up?  Buttery, and I mean BUTTERY, smooth!!  This game does show its age; for its time, textures/shadows/lighting were pushing extremes but you can tell that Doom 3--despite its HD makeover--came from a different time.  But it's still a fun, scary ride and to run it at full bore on the PS3 with nary a hiccup is an absolute joy.  An even bigger bonus for me is that now I can play it in 3D.  And it looks GREAT in 3D - the visual separation is extremely well-done and it's hard to imagine that this game was never rendered in this format to begin with; it really adds an additional layer of fear seeing hellspawn rush at you as you frantically blanket the screen with gunfire.Doom 3 is packaged with the expansion pack entitled Resurrection of Evil and also comes with additional levels referred to as the \"Lost Mission.\"  I haven't run through these yet, but I can already tell you that they will not disappoint given how my first few hours have gone this far.And for the truly nostalgic, Doom 3 BFG Edition comes with the ORIGINAL 1st person shooter titles of Doom and Doom 2, the games that followed id's path from Wolfenstein to help define FPS as they have evolved today.  Doom won't fill your widescreen (keep in mind that this title is 20 years old now!), but it's surprisingly well-rendered in a PS3 environment and it wasn't as blocky as I first feared it might be.  I keep finding myself wanting to jump, crouch, aim down sights, etc., but it's a pretty good LOL moment when you realize that this game REALLY pre-dated those aspects of your typical FPS today.At $39.99, it's not a bad value especially for a nostalgic guy like me.  For anything less, I'd say that it's a MUST HAVE if you're NOT the nostalgic type.Great job!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"FANTASTIC for those who use the PS3 for more than just games.","reviewText":"This doesn't need to be a long review - it's a remote control.But first, as I've read other comments, THIS REMOTE DOES TURN THE CONSOLE ON AND OFF.  As long as the main power switch is on in the back of the unit, this remote will work fine.  In fact, this remote can even be used to play some games!The concept of a bluetooth remote seemed odd to me, until I explored the Playstation 3 beyond it's games - which is easy to do, as there are very few quality games!I have loaded my PS3 with a number of songs, all well organized and sorted.  I will often tuck this remote in my pocket and wander about the house as I clean, cook, etc., and have found it extremely useful when I want to skip songs, pause, stop, etc, when the PS3 is not in line-of-sight.  Because bluetooth works on FM frequency, that means as long as you're within range (usually 30-40 feet) it'll control the PS3.  The ONLY gripes I have is that I can't use it to control volume (which really isn't a fault of the remote) and that the remote has to go into a sleep mode because of the fact that Bluetooth is constant transmission and therefore would drain the batteries very quickly.  This means that you basically have to hit a button twice if you stop using the remote for a short period of time (I really don't know how long it stays awake - I believe less than a minute.)  Still for the functionality it provides, it's s a small gripe.A worthwhile purchase for those who use the Playstation 3 to do more than just play games or movies.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2008"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"obryanstars","summary":"Great Game, What Did We Expect?","reviewText":"I've played this game for hours (demos, rentals, friend's houses, etc..) and I must say that it is addicting.  From collecting shines to hovering above the rest of the world, it's hard to find a glitch in Nintendo's latest installment of Mario.  Here what I thought of Super Mario Sunshine for the Nintendo Gamecube:1. The graphics: Beatutiful!!!  Perhaps the best to be shown on Gamecube yet, SMS looks awsome!  From the shimmering water to the sandy beaches, this game really packs in the feeling of a vacation in the bahamas.  Mario looks as good as ever, everything is sharp and convincing.  The civilians and people looks about as good as it can get, and the water; my goodness it's incredible!  And with the whole point of it being really dark (and shadowy) toward the beggining of the game with no shines to 100 later on, it really goes from dark, cloudy, and gray to sunny, warm, and humid.  The graphics bring this game alive, and deliver what past Mario games couldn't: real worlds!2. The gameplay: wonderful! It's just fun!  It really is like Mario 64 in dozens of ways.  As with 64, you collect as many stars as u can to beat the game.  Only this time they look like mini suns, and are called \"Shines.\"  To get shines u must complete various tasks, whether it be cleaning up grafity to defeating a boss.  You'll need every skill in the book to collect these shines.  To go with that a ton of patience.  This game just goes on and on, and every minute that goes by just keeps getting funner!  By far the funnest of the series, Mario brings that innocent sense of fun that has been missed recently with games like HALO, GTA3, Max Payne, and other shooters.  Mario is back and bettter than ever, now armed with a super-fun hose type thing (don't know what it is) and all of Mario's old moves (super slam, jump, slide, glide, etc...)3. The overall depth and reaplay value: tons!  I'm not sure how many shines there are, at least a hundred.  And each shine (whether buying it or winning it) feels like a major accomplshment.  Fun to just fool around after beating (which could take weeks, even months) this game does not disapoint.  It's long, fast, fun, and easy to control.  I could play this for hours, and feel tempted to buy a Gamecube just for Mario.Overall, I'd just like to say how much fun this is, and how good the graphics are.  The new hose thing is a blast, whether it be shooting or hovering, it's safe to say this ladies and gentlemen: Mario is back, fun, and new.  A bit of new spice to the old winning formula, Super Mario Sunshine is worth your fifty bucks, and will go down (i think) as one of the classic Nintendo games of all time.  Why Nintendo will never die, Mario.  Hope this helped, thx!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000INV44U","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"It Scores!","reviewText":"What is it with Mario sports titles that make them so enjoyable? To me it's the combination of Mario characters, sports and special moves put together makes for fun sports titles.  You don't even need to be a fan of sports to enjoy Mario Strikers Charged of the Wii, much like Wii sports in a way.  I played the original Mario Strikers on the Gamecube when it was released and later on Mario Strikers Charged was one of the very first Wii games I bought (and one of my reasons for buying one) and it remains one that I still enjoy today. Strikers Charged was released on Wii in 2007 and despite the few years that have gone by it remains an excellent Wii game that still looks good graphically (for a 2007 Wii game keep in mind and the 17 courses look very good)and is a blast to play. It's one Wii title that is worth trying and buying. It's a great Mario game and it's a fun sports game at the same time, a winning combination.There are 12 captains and 8 sidekicks you can choose from, and as can be expected every player has their own special abilities. For instance Bowser can breathe fire with his special, while Mario & Luigi can become huge and crush other players with theirs; it's the same for the sidekicks. The captains can perform what are called Mega Strikes which can lead to up to 6 goals being scored at the same time (so much for the fair play of soccer huh?). The game can be very challenging; I had difficulties winning all the trophies because the game is so unpredictable. The fact that you can never predict anything for sure makes it interesting and fun but it can also be very frustrating. Some may not see the \"soccer\" aspect of the game, seeing only characters running around hitting each other and using special moves but it is the way of the Mario Sports games since some time now (Tennis, Baseball, Basketball). It may seem un-sports like at first but I assure that there is strategy behind this game, lots of thinking is implied such as knowing when to use which special/character at the right time and staying focused.Strikers Charged offers an exhibition mode, cup quests, online mode and more but those three are the core of the game. The controls are fairly easy to understand and are simple enough, you need both the nunchuk and the Wiimote to play however. Interesting enough, this was the second Wii title to feature online play. Just in case you're wondering, Miis can be used also. The best part of the game is the multiplayer play, known to be a key feature of the Wii console. The Wii is primarily aimed for casual gamers and social gaming and this game justifies this (ok it may not be for every casual gamer but...), it's much more fun with friends than alone even if the game offers a good single player play.I must admit I am not a fan of soccer at all, I don't hate the sport but I certainly never expected Strikers to be as fun as it was when it came out for the Gamecube in 2005. Strikers Charged for the Wii is no exception and with the Wii's innovative controls it makes it a better game and a more entertaining one I believe. Unfortunately, unless you often play with friends or challenge others via Wi-Fi, once you've beat the game you might find yourself playing now and then but don't expect terrific replayability. You seriously don't have to like soccer to enjoy Mario Strikers Charged but it will appeal more to some than others. 4/5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"One hell of a fun game!","reviewText":"Kingdom Hearts is one of those games that seems weird when you first here about it.

{"product_name":"B0050SYEYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Winter","summary":"Worth Every Penny","reviewText":"343 Studios have done a tremendous job with Halo 4:  it is a sequel worthy of its predecessors and I've been enjoying it very much.  Those of  you who have followed the saga of The Master Chief will find a very interesting reveal of many of the things you'd been wondering:  about Cortana, the Forerunners, and much more.  I won't spoil the story for you, but as you can see in the commercials and trailers we also get a new race to battle, with some very clever twists designed to make a veteran player have to think on their feet once more.  With a new race are a whole new class of weapons and with the Single Player Campaign I found myself reminded of some of the best feelings of my favorite FPS games, stretching all the way back to Doom, Quake, and Half-Life.  One interesting note:  the little 'Grunts' no longer speak English:  like the other races of The Covenant they speak in their own dialect.  Much as I enjoyed the cute quips of \"More! Enemy!\" and \"Bad Cyborg!\", this change does bring the story together a little more consistently to me.If there's one drastic difference in Halo 4, it's that there are several interactive cutscenes.  These aren't quick-time events:  they're more like those moments in the Call of Duty games where something dramatic happens and you are just watching through The Master Chief's eyes.  The only downside to this is you spend your time on the edge of your seat hoping you'll know when to grab the controls again.  There are melee kills that pop the camera to an over-the-shoulder view and then there are a couple of moments where you interact with switches and the camera changes to a short cutscene of The Master Chief flipping the switch/opening the door/etc.  There is also a sprint mechanic that takes a bit of getting used to: click down to sprint, but take your thumb off the stick and let it pop upright again to be able to re-shoulder your weapon.The maps we are introduced to in the Single-Player Campaign look like they'd be fantastic in Multiplayer:  I haven't dived into the Multiplayer yet but I will say that there are plenty of areas for hiding, taking the high ground, or mixing it up with a bit of both.  We also have armor enhancements beyond the ones introduced in Halo:  Reach.  For example, The Master Chief can cloak.  He can produce an energy shield, but it's not for having instant invulnerability:  you'll find yourself using it most in times when you're pinned down and need to get to cover to recharge.  The use of these armor-driven powers is on a cooldown timer that's more reasonable than the all-or-none method introduced in Halo 2:  if you need to re-engage the power before it's fully charged, you get what charge is built up--like Crysis.I bought the collector's edition.  It comes with the three DLC add-ons, access to a streaming version of the Forward Unto Dawn video series (but only through Halo Waypoint), and \"eyes-only\" UNSC  mission briefs.  We have a blueprint (that I won't spoil for you), a notebook similar to the \"Dr. Halsey's journal\" that was included in the limited edition of Halo: Reach (only much smaller), and all of it packed in a foldover game case.  I was really pleased that the DLC was more of a quick unlock than it was a long download--I know there's some controversy over on-disc DLC, but I guess in this case, not having to sit and wait (or re-download it if I have to replace my XBox 360) makes it a bit more convenient.If you've enjoyed the rest of the Halo series, I hope you enjoy Halo 4 as much as I have.  I'm sad to see Bungie step away, but I'm also impressed with 343's work on this worthy sequel.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00BGAA0SU","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Not All Smoke And Mirrors","reviewText":"&#34;Infamous&#34; has always been a series that never quite stuck with me. Electricity powers were cool, and seeing the story unfold depending on my choices was neat, but a bland protagonist and a sort of pedantic narrative offset any enjoyment I could gain. Yet I had high hopes for this entry, given that it looked like the first &#34;must-own&#34; PS4-exclusive title after the disappointing &#34;Killzone: Shadow Fall&#34; and &#34;Knack,&#34; and that despite my apprehensions about the franchise, Sucker Punch is still a very capable developer with a lot of talent under their wing. Perhaps they could deliver the exclusive that I'd been waiting for since launch day, one that could stand head and shoulders with the best Sony has offered in the past. Is the third time the charm for &#34;Infamous: Second Son&#34;?Yes and no. All of the pieces are here, that's for sure. The charming rogue protagonist, Delsin Rowe, is a Native American whose Washington reservation is barged into by a prison convoy escorting three Conduits (read: people with superpowers) to a maximum security facility. They, of course, break loose, Delsin absorbs one of their powers, and has his reservation assaulted by the ruthless antagonist, Brooke Augustine. With the help of his cop brother, Reggie, Delsin sets sights on Seattle to absorb more powers, stop Augustine's oppressive regime that has taken over the city, and use his new abilities to help his tribe recover.The story does so much right in a lot of regards. First off, it's genuinely refreshing to see Native American characters portrayed as, well, actual people, and not defined by worn tropes about spirits or hating &#34;the white man,&#34; like we saw in last year's frankly poor &#34;Beyond: Two Souls.&#34; Here, we see Delsin and Reggie as two brothers, and their tribe as a family; it's very respectful, and I admire it for not going down a more racist path. Furthermore, the characters themselves are generally likable, but perhaps none more so than the protagonist. Delsin is a remarkably likable protagonist, almost like a PG-13 version of Dante. His quips and witticisms are funny and delivered without a hint of irony, and on top of that, his trials and tribulations throughout the course of the game really make you feel for the guy. His realistic reactions to gaining powers and coping with the burden of being discriminated against by the general populace round him out, helping to avoid the pitfalls of having a character who's too stoic or too silly. The writers struck a perfect balance with this character, and I sincerely hope we see more of him in future entries.That being said, the rest of the writing could have used some serious work. The supporting cast is all over the place, with high points like straight man Reggie, and the delightfully evil Brooke, and serious low points like the walking cliche that is the gamer geek Eugene, or the manic pixie hobo girl that is Fetch. Characterization isn't the real problem here, though. No, what really sets &#34;Second Son&#34; back is its by-the-numbers, &#34;us against them&#34; plot. Despite some later twists and turns that genuinely surprised me, the story is unfortunately hamstrung by its usage of the same narrative ideas &#34;X-Men&#34; was touching on back in the 1960's. Not only that, but the supporting cast backstories come across as afterthoughts, tacked on to make the mostly ancillary cast seem more compelling. Ultimately, the story gets the job done, and there are some truly emotional moments during the climax, but it doesn't dig quite as deep as I'd like it to.Same goes for the moral choices players can make. Aside from the obvious (don't kill civilians, don't act like an all-around hooligan,) players are often given two choices during cutscenes, and the binary choices available are astoundingly black-and-white. There's no moral grey area, only &#34;good&#34; and &#34;bad.&#34; There are even games with binary choices that still managed to make me think about things for a few minutes, but the choices here are so blatant, a child could tell you what's wrong and what's right. It makes it so that players either have to be playing as an intentional hero or intentional villain, with no moral wiggle room to speak of. Granted, it is nice that what choices you make have obvious impacts on the narrative, which is more than I can say for, say, a David Cage game. Still, a bit more ambiguity would have gone a long way here.Issue with the plot aside, let me stress how much fun this game is once the world opens up to you. I've played a lot of games with superpowers, as they've always been a guilty pleasure of mine. And while this might not be the best out there, at least in my opinion, it's definitely one of the most creative and consistently fun. Players are given three sets of powers for most of the game: smoke/fire, neon, and video. Each of these offer their own projectile capabilities, melee attacks of varying strengths, and other various attributes. For example, smoke lets you break yourself down into ashen soot and go through vents; neon allows you to run up walls and snipe enemies from a distance; video lets you sprout wings and, eventually, fly around the city to some extent. Players are, of course, given attacks that are similar to third person shooter weapons, such as pistols, rocket launchers, assault rifles, but with such unique twists that they never feel like mere stand-ins. Few games have given me as much joy as I felt gliding over a hundred feet above ground, sending enemies below flying with a constant barrage of pure television static.At the same time, though, &#34;Second Son&#34; plays it too safe too often for me to truly commend it for being original. The same gripes I've had about open-world superhero games for years reared their ugly head several times over the course of my time with this one. Finding awkward ways to exploit my powers to cheaply take cover from enemy fire, realizing that all of my enemies have similar powers and immediately feeling less powerful, nagging limits to otherwise cool abilities... the downsides here are immensely annoying, and it continues a trend of games that give you cool powers, then immediately start pounding you into submission with stronger enemies. I hesitate to bring up other games so much, but I can't help but be reminded of &#34;Saints Row IV,&#34; and how downright satisfying the powers in that game were. While what's on display here is fun, and certainly interesting, I can't help but feel disappointed at the lack of innovation on display here. The game limits the player far too often for them to feel truly empowered, and with a game built around superpowers, that's a serious problem in my book.Still, where it counts, the gameplay is mostly solid. Players are given a large playground to mess around in, and one that has plenty of things to do in it. Aside from just tooling around by scaling buildings, or pulling ridiculous stunts off, you'll also get to participate in some truly engaging side missions. While a few of these are standard &#34;find the collectible&#34; or &#34;fight a hoard of enemies,&#34; they take place in the midst of some great set pieces, and with cool powers that truly allow the players to navigate the environments in any way they see fit, even the most trivial parts of the game become ridiculously fun. That is to say, the goals themselves might not be that interesting, but if you're creative, you can turn the game into a hectic, creative and engaging time with a few flicks of the analog sticks.Lastly, the game makes pretty great use of the DualShock 4 touch pad, perhaps the best I've seen in a PS4 title thus far. It integrates the little gadget in a way that, while somewhat gimmicky, is nevertheless creative and seamless. Turning the controller sideways and shaking it to paint graffiti is cool, as using it to tear open fences, smash support pillars, or absorb energy. Other than that, there are some contextual moments where it's used to an impressive degree. For example, Delsin goes through a security checkpoint early on the game, and gets his hand scanned. The game prompts the player to place their finger on the pad, then keep it there as the game &#34;scans&#34; it; this prompts the controller to rumble and make noise. While, yes, this is a little goofy, I still found it a neat way to show off the latent potential for immersion that Sony's newest little gizmo has to offer.Graphically, though, there are barely any complaints to be made. The world Delsin inhabits is beautifully rendered, down to the very last detail. I only spotted the occasional jagged edge, and there were no real pop-ins to be seen for the most part. A colorful urban sprawl, Sucker Punch's dystopian Seattle maintains the atmosphere and scenery one would expect from Washington, yet offers enough interesting, futuristic technology to keep things fresh. Aside from the eye-catching scenery, the character models in &#34;Second Son&#34; are arguably some of the very best I've ever seen in a video game. The main characters speak, and their faces crinkle, their complexions change, their eyes bulge and narrow. For all of the pretensions of Quantic Dream's &#34;emotional&#34; graphics, I found the characters here to look and behave in a far more human fashion than anything that divisive studio has ever produced. Sure, there are some lazy textures here and there, like reflections on buildings that don't match what's actually behind them, or clothing on certain pedestrians, but that's really just nitpicking. This is a gorgeous game, hands-down, and given that we're already getting something of this caliber early on the PS4's life cycle, it makes very excited about the graphical capabilities of this system.Yes, &#34;Infamous: Second Son&#34; is a bit trite in the execution of its narrative, and yes, it has some serious issues with limiting the player's enjoyment of their powers in combat situations. Yet it's hard for me to discount the sheer amount of fun that can be had with this game, and the impressive amount of content offered for sixty bucks. This is a sleek-looking and fun experience with plenty to do, and an enjoyable cast of characters participating in a relatively fun plot. While I would hesitate to call this a &#34;system seller,&#34; this is undeniably the best console-exclusive title of this generation so far, and one of the more intriguing superpower-fueled experiences on the market.Score: 8.5","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...","summary":"Rolling around at the speed of Mario","reviewText":"If you want the short version of my review, it's this: IT'S FRICKIN' MARIO KART!!! Of COURSE you'll have a lot of fun with it!The longer version goes something along the lines of this:Holy CRAP! Even after eight games in the series, or ELEVEN if you count the three arcade crossovers with Pac-Man, the Mario Kart series is still alive and kicking on the Wii U! Mario Kart 8 elevates pretty much everything we've come to know and love about the series by featuring all sorts of crazy new courses and features, while also keeping what did work in past games such as the gliders and underwater portions a laMario Kart 7. The anti-gravity feature makes me wish there was a newF-Zerogame, but it works remarkably well in Mario Kart, making some tracks feel even more like thrill rides than they already are! There's also a few new items borrowed from Mario's latest3Dwhereabouts, but one interesting new addition is an item that not only creates a small \"BOOM!\" effect around you, but it also gets rid of the oncoming blue shell about to inflict pain!However, the game is surprisingly more balanced than before. Yeah, there'll be some of the usual cheap shots caused by thrown items, but I've only ever seen a blue shell appear onscreen once per track at MOST - Sometimes, there won't even be one at all. The game also moves at a much snappier pace, as Lakitu picks you back up from the track before you even completely fall into water or lava, and your kart hardly flies up into the air when you get hit by something. If there's one nitpick I have, it's the fact that Coins can be selectable in the item roster. Why? Not only are they scattered on the tracks, but I could only imagine what else I should have gotten instead.Meanwhile, the tracks themselves are outright gorgeous! If there's any game on the Wii U that shows its graphical capabilities, it's Mario Kart 8. I haven't seen a game look this good sinceSuper Smash Bros. Brawl! It's extremely appealing to see how classic tracks from older Mario Kart games have evolved here. If it's not their updated looks that'll grab you, it's gonna be how they are designed. Case in point: Toad's Turnpike fromMario Kart 64- Not only do you get to ride on the sides of some of the walls, but a few of the trucks also carry speed ramps, and there are item boxes roaming the roads, too! Or how about Sherbet Land fromDouble Dash? While the nightly scenery is dazzling, the real kicker is how there are brand-new underwater sections that serve as alternate routes for when you do not want to go on the ice-filled top parts! If there's one classic track that is worsened in Mario Kart 8, it's Yoshi Valley from 64. It's still a very fun track to play, but it's not as unique anymore. Not only are the Spiny obstacles absent, but the whole mystery aspect of the course (wondering who's in what ranking) is eliminated. Still, every single track in the classic cups is a blast and mostly made even better with Mario Kart 8's new mechanics to the point where they almost feel like new tracks.And now to discuss the new tracks! Holy HECK, they are fun! Regardless of what Mario game out there you say is lacking in the ideas department, there's no way you can call Mario Kart out on it, especially this new one! Where else can you have fun racing around in a water park, an airport, a neon-lit disco palace, or a city that's very reminiscent of the first level ofSonic Adventure 2(Or should I say San Francisco)? These tracks put Mario Kart's imagination to the test, and it really manages to be successful on that front! With emphasis on the anti-gravity and gliding/underwater racing, the tracks can be enjoyably wacky and twisted, and it's fun to see even places like Bowser's Castle incorporate curvy tunnels!What's not as fun to see, though, is...well...the Battle mode. Instead of giving us battle arenas exclusive to this mode, we instead have a quarter of the racing tracks to battle on. Yes, the Battle mode itself can be fun, but the tracks are too wide and not as fun to roam around in as arenas made FOR this kind of play style.On top of that, the new characters in the selectable character roster are not as interesting of additions as the many other Mario characters that could be chosen instead. Yeah, the Koopalings are probably a given by this point, but did we need a baby version of Rosalina, or a metallic Peach? And why are Metal Mario and Lakitu still here?Ah, well. Despite those things, Mario Kart 8 is incredible. There's still no other kart-racing series that could handle or pack as much fun as the series that started it all, and that series hasn't being going anywhere but up!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2014"}

I picked this game up yesterday and have to say the graphics are mind blowing! I love all the new race tracks they've created, along with the upgraded tracks from previous MK games. I love the new items they've added such as the pirhana plant (a plant that bites your opponents as you get near them) and crazy 8 (a ring of 8 random items circling your cart). I enjoy the parachute that lets you glide through the air in certain parts. Anti gravity mode is fun. You'll know you're either upside down or driving alongside a steep wall once your wheels change to anti gravity.The only downside to this game is battle mode. This time around, there are no actual battle arenas. You instead choose a race track to battle on. That's right. Those race tracks, which are normally used to race on, have now turned into your new battle arenas as well. Personally, I'm not a big fan. It's still fun, but it's so difficult to find your opponents. I tend to spend the majority of my time driving around aimlessly, trying to find an opponent, only to realize the time is finally up. Whatever happened to the battle arenas? Furtheremore, if you're a fan of coin battle, that's gone. The only thing you get is balloon battle.Anyway, other than battle mode this game is a ton of fun and I'm so happy I got it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2014"}

Well, they hyped up the online mode alot, not that it's a dud but it's actually fun to ply. Single player is much better than expected in online mode, but the bad thing is there's no online headset chat compatability, and no records of the opponent you're facing. It basically you going into as room and challenging annonymous people, while you're annonymous yourself.If you were looking forward to the Create a PPV mode, it's not like you actually get to detail the arena and stuff, it's just you summing up an eigth card battle, chosing your arena, and announce team. So now you can create the most memroble matches.Create a Belt will take long to custom since you need to get money by preforming additional tasks in both season and challenge mode.The voice overs was a bit shbby, not that it was bad, but some characters were really off, and others managed to get there act together, e.g. Triple H, Eddie Gurrero and Vince McMahon.The commentary is up to date but can continually be repeated, even in season mode, as now for the first time, it's found throughout the game.Overall, this game was great, atill going on in season mode, but other than that, the game plays well, with a great roster, good graphics, some good voice overs, challenge mode, commentary, original music, original entrances, and the best season mode in the Smackdown! series, there really is no reason why you shoudn't get this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2004"}

It BARELY squeezes in on the back, and when you snug it on there, you'll find that your wireless network adapter hardly fits in place any more.  Mine kept coming unplugged as a result and losing my connection with Live.2) Noise.  This sucker is LOUD!!!  I have a ton of cooling fans on my PC, and this thing is much louder.  In any intense moments in horror games, I find my concentration straying from the sound design of the game and instead focusing on the fan humming along.

You can hear it rattling around back there when it turns on, and this can't be good for your 360.4) Power drain.  As some other reviews have noted, since the power to the whole system is routed through here, you're bound to lose some power to your system.

Mine sits in an enclosed entertainment center, and I've had it overheat when I shut the door to the 360 by accident.

There's still a solid platforming design underneath the flash, but it's a pretty easy romp compared to Nintendo's Mario titles. This is especially appearant now that the game is over a decade old(!) and the flash no longer holds up as well on the GBA port.Still Rareware really did an excellent job, and their success here propelled the company to a strong supporting role on the Nintendo 64. Gameplay is on the easy side, but the levels are still a blast to play through. There are lots of varied environments and things to see, with no dull moments in sight. A fitting memorable soundtrack adds to the experience. Plus, Donkey Kong Country revitalized one of Nintendo's dormant characters, taking him from a pixelated barrel-throwing ape to a rendered, barrel-throwing ape with attitude.Overall there's a great experience here, just one that's a bit on the easy side. The two sequels ramp up the difficulty level considerably, and together the games form a fine trilogy on the SNES.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2006"}

But the game isn't all graphics and no gameplay. Believe it or not, the gameplay is actually better than the graphics. You can do everything you've seen ninjas do in movies.

Some of the coolest moves I've seen in any game for awhile. They are also easy  for beginners, but hardcore gamers can spend alot of time on perfecting them. The stages are very varied and very large, the sound is nice and the enemies and weapons are also very varied. One problem that many people may have is the game's difficulty. It is very hard.

Colonna","summary":"Great Audio Experience","reviewText":"Before I go into this review, this is an important note: As of this writing, you cannot use these headphones wirelessly, as you need to connect to the PS4 via the supplied 2.5mm to 3.5mm cable.  This is an issue on the Sony side, and a patch is expected. Of course, that defeats the point of wireless, but it is an option.  With that said:These have really nice sound and put you in the action audio-wise when you are playing COD or anything else.  You get immersed in the surround sound, and because you have a headset on, you aren&#8217;t driving those around you crazy.These are marketed as being for PS4, but you can certainly use them for PS3 or Xbox as well.So, what&#8217;s in the box?&#8226; PX4 headphones&#8226; PX4 Wireless Transmitter&#8226; Detachable &#8220;boom&#8221; microphone&#8226; Digital Optic cable&#8226; USB charging cable&#8226; 2.5mm adapter cable (adapters to 3.5mm)&#8226; Xbox 360 chat cable&#8226; Quick Start Guide&#8226; Turtle Beach stickerSet up is simple, charge &#8216;em up and go!  The controls are easy to learn.  The left ear cup has the Power Button, Tone, &#8220;Blast Limiter&#8221;, Mic monitor, Xbox jack, Game Volume, and the mic port.  The right side houses the Bluetooth/Chat Volume, Bluetooth LED and control button, the mic mute, and the charging port/LED.The Bluetooth works well, and you can jump in to answer a phone call and go back to playing, etc.  Pairing is simple, like any other Bluetoooth device.  Note: if you use these on Xbox, you must use a cable to connect.  Based on your Xbox version, the connection may vary.  The Ear Force user manual covers this in detail with diagrams, etc.  You should not need to buy any extra cables, using what is included in the box.I also like the detachable microphone, since I tend not to use one, so I like to take it off.They are very comfortable, even after an hour or two of wearing them.  The padding seems to be of nice quality, and they feel light on your head.Blast Limiter is a nice feature if you tend to play with the volume turned way up, as it will limit the spike in volume for explosions and other very loud, sudden game sounds.My favorite feature, because I always like to customize/play with sound is the &#8220;virtual positioning.&#8221;  You can use this to adjust the surround sound.  So, for example you might want your front channels set for 30 degrees and rear for 105, or maybe 60 degrees in front and 150 in the rear for a more &#8220;front/back&#8221; audio experience.  There are 6 preset variations; you cannot customize these beyond the 6 settings.As for power, the headsets put out 27mW per channel, THD &#60;1%.  The speakers are 50mm with neodymium magnets.  The frequency response is advertised as 20Hz - 20kHz, &#60; 120dB.Battery life is great.  I get about 14 hours or so of continue use off the Li-Ion battery.  The system will power off after 5 minutes without a signal to save battery life.  You can also play while you charge by plugging it in while you are playing. The USB cable charges only.  It does not connect the headset to other devices for audio use.Overall, great sound and performance, good price &#8211; not much to dislike about the PX4.  In the end, there are other options, some cost somewhat less and everyone has their own likes and dislikes.  I think these deliver excellent sound and the audio experience in a game is very life-like.  If they were a little less expensive I'd rate them a 5, but in general they are really nice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2013"}

Surprisingly, the controls are pretty easy to pick up (you'll still need a game session or two to get a decent handle on it).  I'm a big Metal Gear Solid series fan and there are some parallels in how to approach and play this game, so I really liked most of the missions, objectives, and goals, and how they can be achieved any number of ways.  Plus, the variety of game play was a pleasant surprise:  missions take play in the jungle, in cities, and on the high seas.Unfortunately, there are some aspects that knock it down a bit.  First, this game presumes you've played the series before and understand most of the mechanics/nuances with little explanation.  Second, objectives and the way-ahead are sometimes unclear.  I get stuck from time to time trying to figure out exactly where I'm supposed to be going.  Plus, there's really no explanation on how important the side-quests are to the main quest.  Are potential bonuses and upgrades worth all the running around completing them?  Who knows?  Third, the dialog is difficult to understand, so I turned on the in-game captioning.  Yikes.  Small letters and they're white which means they blend right in to most of the in-game backgrounds.Finally, I was completely lost at the whole &#34;new-guy-in-an-office-cubicle&#34; thing after the first mission was played.  Is this guy the one &#34;remembering&#34; the game events?  Is there really a purpose to this?  It completely surprised me and I still don't know what that's all about.

Throughout most of the game, you aren't even an assassin, just in the garb of one. It's more of a pirate game than it is an AC game.That being said, it's a great game! Yes, it's more piratey than it is assassiny but it's an extremely fun game, with epic sea battles and a fabulous storyline that will leave you wanting more. Also, since it's less assassin like than other installments, you have the option to craft clothes in the game, that are pirate outfits, so you don't need to wear the classic assassins hood if you don't want to, though there are plenty of hooded robes to choose from as well, if that's more your style.The main assassin storyline takes place BEFORE the events in AC3, but the backstory(Modern setting) takes places AFTER the AC3 backstory. Also, the backstory no longer follows Desmond, and also isn't third person as in other previous installments. The modern setting required missions are first person, and centers around an unnammed character which is supposed to be you. The missions consist of hacking mini-games, and no platforming. The few required modern day missions are brief, so unless you want to fiddle around in the modern world, you can get back to the meat of the game.I haven't tried the online version, but I'm sure it's just as fun as the rest of the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2013"}

Since the PS3 holds it value well, I was able to sell my older model and purchase the newer slim model for about a $50 difference. With the new price level, the Playstation 3 continues to set the bar for a complete entertainment system. While stand alone blu-ray players have seen prices drop, the overall value of getting a blu-ray player and a new game console in one package is still outstanding. The built in wireless means you will never have to worry about firmware updates as long you have an Internet connection and a wireless router. The PS3 makes it easy to update your software, games, and firmware with just a few steps.  The new PS3 Slim is not only smaller, but it also seems much quieter in my opinion, though I never had a big issue with my old 40GB model to be honest. If the noise of the older models was a concern for you, then you will be happy with a slim model. The larger disk space of 120 GB versus my older 40GB model is a nice benefit of upgrading as well.

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"They missed the mark....","reviewText":"Let me start off with some basics. First, I did experience the import bug. What does this mean? It means that I had to spend two whole minutes of my life recreating my character to look exactly like he always had. The important stuff, like the decisions, stats etc, all imported just fine. So if your time is so valuable that you can't spare the two minutes and could get angry enough to give this game only one star--get over it, then go get yourself into some anger management classes as fast as you can. You aren't the president or the Pope, and I hate to be the one to break it to you, but your time is NOT that valuable. Now, onto the game.... SPOILER FREEI'll start with the multiplayer, which I thought was a fantastic addition to the game. Surprisingly, there are people upset about this additional feature. Instead of just not playing the MP, they are getting all worked up. What a joke. Are the controls as tight as a dedicated first or third person shooter, no. Big deal. Its still a blast to play, with plenty of things to unlock and a load of characters to play that are different and give you plenty of variety. This was a good decision for EA because now folks will all buy copies so they can play with their friends, rather than buying one copy, playing it, and passing it off to their friends. A good business decision and a way for them to increase revenue AND increase enjoyment for the customer. I will point out that I don't like EA but love Bioware. EA seems to have left Bioware alone in terms of letting them make the kinds of games they want to make. Many would disagree with that, and that's their opinion.Graphics don't take a huge step forward but there is a level of polish. Nicely done overall.The characters from the first two games all make an appearance, though may not all be useable as squadmates. While I would have liked to have seen certain characters get more screen time, I can't say that this upset me too much.Voice acting for most of the characters is pretty good, but the male Shephard still feels as emotionless as he has in all the games, despite all the scenes they inserted to try and fix this problem. Its not the story, its just bad voice acting on his part.Nice variety of weapons and armor. I liked the changes from ME2 in this regard, and I like the level of customization you can do to your armor now. Another change that I didn't like in ME2 was the lack of abilities compared to the first game. They really did a good job expanding those again for ME3, so thank you Bioware; I appreciate it.Controls are pretty good most of the time, though not particularly better than ME2. Getting into and out of cover isn't smooth a lot of the time, and when you are running, you'll often grab onto cover which can be frustrating, but its not a deal breaker.I like the expanded areas and functionality aboard the ship. You can do a lot more on the Normandy than you could in the past, which is a nice addition.Some of the weapons I really didn't like, even though I did like them in the previous games. It seems that they tweaked the characteristics a bit too much in some cases. Some of the guns kick like crazy, but didn't used to. I'd point out to folks that these weapons kick far less when fired from cover, so bear that in mind. The Incisor rifle is the perfect example of a weapon I really loved in ME2. It fires a three shot burst in rapid succession. In the second game there is very little recoil between shots 1, 2 and 3. In this game, after the first shot fires, it kicks up so much that the second and third shots will often miss the target unless they are at point blank range. Again, this is mitigated somewhat by firing from cover, but my guess is a lot of players will not enjoy this rifle as much. The other example is the Argus assault rifle. A very heavy, three round burst assault rifle with terrible, terrible recoil.Overall the game makes improvements on virtually all fronts. Having said that, this game feels darker and more depressing, for obvious reasons, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. And I have noticed that a great deal of folks are upset...VERY upset about the ending. I haven't gotten there yet, so there may be an edit to my review when I get there, but at this point I'm about half way through the game and I am very happy with it. I've seen a few minor bugs, such as a few times when I am out of ammo and run over an ammo pickup and it says, \"Ammo full\", when I have zero, all the while I have husks or Cerberus troops bearing down on me. It got me killed a couple of times, but it was more funny than anything else and doesn't happen often.If you liked the first two games, you should enjoy this one very much, especially for those that liked the biotic characters. Although I play as a soldier, biotics have been given a very significant boost this time around, and I'm glad I got to experiment with them in multiplayer. I never liked them before but have learned to appreciate them this time around. As I said...I may be back for an edit after the end....***Review EDIT***I had originally ranked this game 5 stars, but after playing it all the way through and doing some more multiplayer, I had to knock off two stars. Here's why.....The multiplayer is very fun, but they implemented a couple of things very poorly. Here are two examples... You purchase packs that give you random things for your character, new weapons, weapon upgrades etc. On a number of occasions, it gave me the upgrade of character training, which is extra experience. The problem? My character was already at level 20, which means the experience goes out the window. They should have done a better job of not giving you something you couldn't even use! Second, it is virtually impossible to get a preferred weapon leveled up to level 10. Why? Because there are probably several dozen weapons in the game at least. Each of them can be leveled to 10. Considering you rarely get a weapon upgrade, and couple that with the chances of it actually being for the weapon you want, and you're in for some serious frustration. I have three different shotguns at level 8 and I've never even equipped them in multiplayer. They should have implemented this like they did in the campaign and it would have been much more satisfying.Lastly, the ending is as bad as everyone says. Let me be clear on this, its not because its a depressing ending, I expected that. Its because they are just...plain...bad. Badly written, horrible ideas, horrible everything. Hard to believe it was Bioware. Your choices from the games have virtually no impact, and the endings are purely nonsensical. Its very sad to see it end that way.EDIT: Update 2Bioware has done an excellent job of supporting the multiplayer mode for this game, which I applaud. They have massively increased the size and scope of this game mode, and I'm still playing it almost daily, all these months later. But they have really dropped the ball with the single player content in two ways. First, there hasn't been nearly enough. Leviathan and now today, Omega. My problem with them is the cost relative to the amount of content you get. Its 15 dollars to get Omega, which amounts to about 2-3 hours of additional game play. WAY TOO STEEP.

For the first time, experience your favorite Nintendo worlds in crystal clear high definition. The New Wii U GamePad controller removes the traditional barriers between you, your games, and your TV by creating a second window into the video game world. It incorporates a 6.2-inch, 16:9 aspect ratio LCD touch screen, as well as traditional button controls and two analog sticks. Plus, in this bundle, you'll get Super Mario Bros. U and the New Super Luigi U, where it's finally Luigi's turn in the limelight!","reviewerName":"Rezivor","summary":"4.5 stars for my experience w/ Wii U so far.","reviewText":"I picked this bundle up @ a local Fred Meyer for $299.99 on Friday. Only have the 2 games that come with it. Both games (Super Mario Bros. U, and Super Luigi U) are on one disc. The games are great if your an 80's kid that still enjoys Mario, like me. Happy to have those games over the Wii U Sports games! Setting up the system isn't too hard. There are some pieces that come with it, which are stands for the system & controller/gamepad. The gamepad comes with it's own charger. You'll want to either charge your gamepad/controller before you start the system set up. Or keep it on the charger while starting to system set up (that's what I did). When you set up the system, you'll need to be able to go online. You go through all the user info, ect..and it will ask you for a net connection. Once you do that, you'll start to update your Wii U system to play the games (to my understanding this is the same with the Xbox One & PS4 too). Once you start the update DO NOT POWER OFF OR UNPLUG ANYTHING. This may cause your \"brick\" (freeze up and not work). And when the system is updating, it may seem like it is done quickly but it is not done. You can see the update progress/status if you look for it. It is a little bit of a process....but just follow the steps and you'll get through it before too long.  Then enjoy your Wii U!!! I am NOT a \"fanboy\" of one system. So I like & buy all consoles/systems for gaming. But I gotta be honest....I was a little dissapointed with the first Wii. Nintendo had catered to the \"casual gamer\" too much in my opinion. Making gimmicky, and really cartoony-simplistic games. I'm all for Mario,Zelda,Metroid,ect...But would have really liked some games for the hardcore gamers too! Afterall, we're the one's that have been supporting their business since the 1980's!! They should have considered making games like PS3 & Xbox 360. I know the first Wii wasn't as powerfull as those systems. But the Wii U is supposedly a little bit more powerfull. And they claimed the Wii U can have better graphics than 360 & PS3. So with that said, I am expecting more hardcore gamer games with this system!!! Zombi U got mediocre reviews. But I have a feeling that games is good. So I am going to get that in a week or two! It has good graphics, and from some of what I heard, gameplay too! Also I'll test that better graphics ststement with Call Of Duty Ghost. And some other more recent releases. I don't like that Nintendo Wii U's game library consisted of many games already released years ago by PS3 & 360. Many people already played/own those games. So why would they be interested in buying the same games on a \"next gen\" system!?! I'm not....I want new games!!! And the Wii U has some to offer so far. But really need to step it up, entering it's second year! Wii U has the potential to be a great system. That's if they focus more on great games over \"casual\" games. A few game developers have said that they won't even work on Wii U games. Which sucks, cause some of those companies are good companies. However....Many still are. And Capcom is one of them! I've read (so I don't know how true it is) that there might be a Resident Evil 2 remake for the Wii U. If that is true.......That alone is a big deal!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2013"}

Some may complain that they're too &quot;Matrix-y&quot; but I think they fit the game rather well and are very entertaining, regardless of the implausibility of some of the scenes.The updated gameplay, which basically adds all the moves from MGS2, is somewhat nice, but makes the game a little easier.  The original simply wasn't designed with first person shooting in mind, it makes the game a little too easy now.  For instance, in the original, there was a room you had to get by where you absolutly were not allowed to use your weapons, forcing you to either sneak past the guards, or sneak up behind them and snap their necks.  Well, now you have the tranquillizer gun, and can just put them to sleep from afar.  Pretty easy.The second time around, I also notice how cheesy the plot can get at times, maybe back when I was younger I could tolerate cheese better.  Oh well.At any rate, it's nice to know that the granddaddy of all sneaking games is still one of the best, despite all the different variations on the sneaking theme in games that have been released of yet (it seems all games these days has at least one &quot;sneaking mission&quot; involved).Bottom line:  Worth at least a rental for those who've already played in, just to see the game played with hardware that matches its sophistication.  A must-buy for those who haven't experienced it yet.  If you thought MGS2 was good, it's worth your money to figure out why the rest of us thought it was a somewhat dissappointing sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2004"}

I will update this review after I have played the game more thoroughly, and after I have finished playing it.The biggest thing I have noticed are the differences in how the game is presented,  for everyone who was a fan of the original game that was released for the Play Station 2 their may be some disappointment,  so far they seem to have gotten rid of the look they had for the first game,  The first one had the feel of a gritty old western,  with intentional flaws and hiccups,  this added to the games feel.  It was a spaghetti Western video game.  This game is extremely polished,  it seems to be more like the game \"Gun\" then a sequel to Red Dead Revolver.The game play so far has a nice feel to it,  Will update here with more information once I have played the game more.  But preliminarily the game has a very solid feel to it,  when you shoot things even little rabbits,  you can feel it.Overall with my limited time with the game it is a great game,  it does not seem to be a sequel to the first game,  but more of a stand alone tittle,  by which I mean they seem to have changed the aesthetic of the game drastically,  if you loved the look of the first game you may be disappointed with the crisp perfect picture of this game.  Gameplay has been fun and has held my attention,  it is most likely a purchase as opposed to a rental as it will most likely give you hours and hours of gameplay and have strong replay value,  will update with any changes in view.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2010"}

Your mission isn't terribly new (infiltrate a terrorist base and blow everything up), but the gameplay is: your numerous enemies are watching for you, and you are encouraged to sneak rather than simply charge in. Every level brings new challenges. You fight snipers, invisible ninjas, psychic warriors, and even an M-1 tank! As the father of the modern spy game genre, this game is an instant classic.Your allies and superiors speak to you via a cool, implanted radio,  monitoring your progress, offering  tips--but failing to give you the full story. The combination of a mysterious and engaging plot and high in-game tension makes this a thrilling ride. Campy humor also abounds as you rescue beautiful women, verbally spar with your allies, and blow up enemies in the bathroom. A user-friendly control interface allows for sniping, hiding, crawling, and running, and the graphics leave nothing to be desired. If you like espionage, spy movies, or just want to own and play a piece of gaming history, then this is a must have.Metal Gear Solidis one of the all-time greats. Game tip: Secretly attach plastic explosives behind an enemy, sneak out of the room, and see what happens.--Allen StewartPros:Story well-integrated into gameplayStealth favored over brute forceChallenging puzzlesCons:Puzzles can be frustratingTorture scene too intense for younger gamers","reviewerName":"Disintegration","summary":"Brilliant, possibly the best action game ever created...","reviewText":"Metal gear solid has the most complex and often perplexing storyline I have ever seen in a video game, hands down. It will always have you on your toes, literally. I have seen many movies, and I can honestly say this game has a better storyline than most movies. Here is what you need to know..Graphics- 100/100 The graphics were top of the line when this game first came out, and even to this day they look great. There is so much detail to every aspect of the game, and even compared to most newer games, this game wins out. Back when I first played it in about early 2000 or so, the graphics were the best the playstation had to offer, and that's a year or so after this game came out, which is pretty astonishing. There is even a scene where Snake is in the girls bathroom, and there is a mirror which perfectly reflects everything. I mean, back when this game came out that was a pretty big feat both graphically and attention wise. Most games just don't pay the kind of attention this game does.Sound- 100/100 Perfect. Just flawless. There isn't much of an actual soundtrack, but the music is incredibly atmospheric and will make you feel like you are Solid Snake, infiltrating a nuclear base. The voice-overs are the best I have ever seen in a video game. Solid Snakes voice over is perfect, and just about everyone elses fits their personality and there image. Otacon's fits him perfectly, so do Meryl's and Liquid Snake's.Seriously though, this game has incredible sound and has never been surpassed by any action game to date.Gameplay- 100/100 I have heard people complain about the poor camera views limiting the gameplay, but in my opinion, the camera views perfectly fit this game and the game wouldn't be the same without them. Sure, it would have been nice to have a first person perspective while using the weapons, but it's all the same to me. I think it is perfectly fine having to shoot enemies in a third person view, and it works better with the type of graphics that it has. When you are spotted, enemies will storm in from all directions to stop you, something that seperates this game from all others. This game gives you good reason to want to play it safe, but still allows you you have some action packed fun as well, if you want to take a chance that is. Also, this game has an incredible storyline but doesn't throw it in your face all the time. MGS2 drags the storyline on eccesively and bores you with excruciatingly long cut scenes and codec conversations. I remember using the square button to skip most of the cut scenes in MGS2. The problem with MG2 is that the storyline is too complex for the good of the game. I mean, much of it is pointless grubble and the game bores you by making you listen to conversations about crap that doesn't apply necessarily to the main storyline, making it a waste of time. This game, however, truly has a wonderful , complex storyline that you will WANT to watch and listen to. Every conversation and cut scene adds to the game flawlessly, so you will probably never get bored, although I am sure you will find yourself reading the codec conversations manually instead of listening to the people talk, since they tend to talk rather slowly and take up a bit too much gameplay.Overall- 100/100 This game is as perfect as it gets, and I have beaten it at least 15 times, if not more. Even to this day it is a pleasure to play, and I don't think it will get old any time soon.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2005"}

This game looks excelent! Much better than ANYTHING a developer could have ever accomplished on the original XBox.As far as the difficulty in building a good mech goes, it has nothing to do with spending time to get \"better parts\", it is all about learning how to build a better mech. You really need to spend time finding out what kind of mech works for you. That does indeed take some time and effort, but all the parts to build a decent mech are all right there. Sure, there are some advanced parts that you can aquire through the Marketplace, playing through the storyline, or bidding on in the auction, but they aren't anything spectacular. This game is not for people who want to plop in a game disk, find the rocket launcher, and get 30 kills.I really enjoy this game, it isn't as fast paced as the MechAssault games are, but the customization is so much fun. Anyone willing to spend the time  to tweak their mech just right to fit them is going to have lots of fun with this game. I personally love my little hovercraft mech with 4 pile weapons and a machine gun on it. It is fast, maneuverable, and can eliminate almost any mech with just two hits. Throw an NA jammer on it during multiplayer games and come up behind the commander mech and take him out before he even knows you're there.This game is really fun, with amazing graphics, but it does take some time to get into and isn't for those who like to jump right in and expect to be good at it right away.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-15-2006"}

At other times, you might need a water based character. And the fact that you can take your character, that you use on a Wii, to a friend's house, who might have a PS3, is a win all the way around.And trust me when I say these little figures(which retail for around eight bucks a pop) are this year's Zhu Zhu Pet. Many stores have had their pegs wiped clean during the 2011 Christmas season. Tonight we went in search of some additional figures to supplement the three that come with the base game.

It has more new content, units, heroes, and other items than most games do let alone an expansion pack. You have 26 missions plus 3 missions from the Warcraft III demo. And one of the missions (called Act I) contained 15 quests that had 41 sub-quests to be completed, and though it wasn't that hard, there were a couple of challenges here. It took me (according to the game time counter) almost 2 hours to complete, but with the cut scenes, it was closer to 3 hours. The best thing (and I probably shouldn't mention this but I will) was that when you finished this bonus campaign, it said to be continued at the end. Then it informed you that you would soon be able to download Act II and Act III for free from Blizzard once it was completed. So free stuff is on the way. As for the 25 mission single player game, I found it quite challenging (unlike one of the other reviewers). These missions seemed longer and harder than Warcraft III. I think any fan of Warcraft will love it. Another cool feature is when doing melee attack and armor upgrades, you can do all available upgrades at once instead of waiting for one to finish and then have to go back to that building and start another. This expansion pack has more stuff packed in it than any other (except maybe Total Annihilation: Core Contigency) and like I said before, more than some games.

{"product_name":"B00009PS24","description":"The future of racing has arrived! High speed fun in the fastest, most visually stunning racing game ever.","reviewerName":"Matthew Ivester \"Power User\"","summary":"Fast, Tough, and Exciting -- in other words, F-ZERO.","reviewText":"Having been a *huge* fan of the original F-ZERO (released way back in the early 90s for the Super Nintendo), I was very excited to hear that Nintendo (in collaboration with Sega) was producing a new game in the series, and I picked it up last week just as it came out -- which I rarely do.  (see also: Soul Calibur 2)I can say now that Nintendo has produced an amazingly fun, fast-paced arcade racing title, certainly the best game of its type currently available.  There is a huge variety of fantastically detailed tracks, 30 cars to unlock, and a challenging story mode to complete as you progress.  The graphics are astoundingly detailed, especially considering there are often dozens of cars careening around (and off) the track at any given time.  The game supports Progressive Scan (480p) if you have a TV that can display it.The gameplay comes at you fast and furious, as the quicker cars regularly cruise in excess of 1200 km/h (about 900mph, or mach 1.5), and the game does an excellent job of conveying the sensation of speed.  There is a new system of turbo boosters that allows you to get a boost of speed at any time after the completion of the first lap -- but using the turbo drains your vehicle's energy, risking a crash if you smack into too many walls or other cars.  The tracks are brilliantly laid out (at least the ones I've seen -- I haven't unlocked all the hidden ones yet),  ranging from a mobius strip cutting through a lush jungle, to a twisty road winding around crumbling egyptian-style ruins, to flat-out racetracks encircling floating casinos.  Fans of the series will be happy to see a few classic tracks like Mute City rebuilt for the new game.  The designs make excellent use of your car's ability to stick magnetically to the track surface -- many of them look more like rollercoasters than racetracks.  One particularly memorable one has you racing on the outside of a giant set of metal pipes, while a raging pool of lava below sends gouts of flame leaping over the track.However, the game is *extremely* challenging, particularly the story mode missions.  This is sort of unusual: I expect the upper levels of the racing mode to be insanely hard, but normally you use a story mode to ease people into the game and *not* to make them pull their hair out!  The first mission is a nice, easy introduction to the game, and then the second is ridiculously hard -- and the next few aren't much easier.  In another strange move, you have to unlock the story mode chapters by earning \"tickets\", either by playing the racing mode or by getting good enough times in the Time Trial mode (you also get tickets by beating each story mission, but not enough to unlock the next one by itself :/).  The same tickets are used to buy extra cars and parts to customize your vehicles -- which is annoying, since it means you have to choose between playing the story mode and unlocking new cars and parts to use in the GP (until you get good enough to tackle the higher difficulty settings, where the rewards are more plentiful.)An interesting feature is that you can take a memory card from your GCN and plug it into the upcoming \"F-ZERO AX\" arcade machine, which will allow you to use your custom cars in the arcade, as well as unlocking various new tracks, cars, and upgrade parts when you return home (you can also unlock them by beating all the hidden tracks in the GCN version on the highest difficulty setting, but as you can imagine, that's quite difficult.)  If one of them shows up anywhere near me, I'll be sure to give it a shot and report back.  Several games have tried things like this in the past, but without too much success (at least in the states, where good video arcades are a dying breed).In short, F-ZERO GX is a fast, challenging futuristic racing game that gets a strong recommendation for all racing and F-ZERO fans.  However, be warned that it can be quite frustrating at points -- don't get this for anyone with a short attention span.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2003"}

First of all, i dont play games looking for technical issues and flaws (like certain ign reviewer did when playing this game).  I play games to immerse myself on new realities, not to escape my life but to enhance it (lol).  I am a vita lover since the very first day, and i have some of the best games vita has to offer, but let me tell you once i started playing Gravity Rush i forgot i had other games.  I have not closed the game since it launched, i play it in every chance i get, even the PS3 gets envy.  I can talk about all around games because i got most of the major home consoles and portables, and Gravity Rush has NOTHING to envy from AAA PS3/360 titles.  This game has everything a great game needs, a vision, great art, fun gameplay, interesting character development, great balance of action and story telling, twist and turns in every corner.  It just keeps coming at you and is HARD to put this game down.  I will mention the game has some tech issues but i think the developers did their best and it works!!!!Gravity Rush is not just my favorite vita game thus far, it makes a complete organic use of the vita functions.  Is intuitive, nothing feels gimmick about the controls.  I just cant recommend it enough, and Japan Studio is top notch, the pedigree is there and they just deliver a reason to play the vita every day and a good reason for gaming lovers to get a vita.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2012"}

In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles.

The Gamecube controller may look funny but it dits rather comfortably in most hands and works well with most games, despite the three buttons less than the competition's. The digital cross-pad is not very comfortable to use, I think, because it's sort of detached from the left handle, making it hard to reach unless you have a long and very jointable thumb.It's true that the GameCube cannot play music CDs or DVD movies and, I'm not going to deny it, that is a weakness. If you want to watch DVDs, play music CDs, and play video games all in one system, the Gamecube is not for you. There is also minimal support from third parties, hence the long list of games available for the other consoles but not Gamecube. I'm not a sports fan, so the lack of sports titles doesn't bother me. The Gamecube also has no hard drive, and there are no plans to make one. Online play is limited to one or two video games, maybe a smattering more. There aren't too many bloody games on this system, because most third parties don't believe they blong there, and Nintendo's in-house development team is more interested in games not limited to adults.The strengths of the Gamecube rely on its first-party titles such as Animal Crossing, The Wind Waker, Super Smash Bros Melee, and Metroid Prime.The Gamecube does have a lot of titles that are mostly aimed at children, but that doesn't make it a \"kiddy system\" per say. That is, unless you think BloodRayne, MK Deadly Alliance, Eternal Darkness, five Resident Evil titles, Red Faction 2, Blood Omen 2, Hunter The Reckoning, Turok Evolution, BMX XXX (which is uncensored on GameCube), the True Crime games, Dead to Rights, Eternal Darkness, and Hitman 2 are there just so mom or dad or an older sibling can play once in a while. Maybe that doesn't matter to some hardcore gamers since many of these titles are also available on other consoles. I still think this is just a result of jaded game companies who haven't forgotten or forgiven Nintendo for censoring the blood in Mortal Kombat on SNES and the sex in Duke Nukem 64 for Nintendo 64.The unit is rather small, measuring about 6x6x4\" without the GB Player attachment.

Don't worry about it, although the Dreamcast has Resident Evil: Code Veronica with it's flashy graphics and all, the game isn't due for quite some time I think. Although the PSX may not have DC's graphical capabilities they are still not bad, considering the DC is 128 bit, and the PS is only 32 bit. RE3 has some of the best looking graphics the PSX has ever rendered. The FMVs are perfectly compressed and they look better than those found in Final Fantasy 8. The game still uses pre-rendered backgrounds like all the other Resident Evils as if it was a ritual. The character detail is fantastically smooth and the main character Jill is very nicely detailed. She is complete with some of the finest looking skin touch ups any RE game has had. As for the frame rate, it always stays perfect and doesn't drop at all.Although some people might say &quot;been there shot that&quot; to RE3, they should still play it due to the new challenging puzzles the game has to offer. The weirdest thing in the game is that it's more of a prequel than a sequel. The game takes place 24 hours before the 2nd Resident Evil. It starts out with zombies attacking RPD members and ends up with all of the RPD officers dead, while there are still tons of zombies on the loose. You will eventually meet up with Barry from the first RE too. Now for those of you who find the Resident Evil series a little too hard, you'll be happy to know that when starting Resident Evil 3 and picking easy mode, you start out with an unlimited number of Ink Ribbons, and a hefty amount of ammo. You just have to get in the office room at the very beginning of the game. You will also come across some very familiar places in RE 3. Like the RPD conference room in RE2, and the RPD station it's self. Believe me this is by far one of the finest moments of the PSX, and is the best Resident Evil game ever (even better than Code Veronica for the DC). The game also features tons of dialogue, which most of takes place during an FMV sequence. Your main goal is to stop Nemesis who is basically the granddaddy of all the Zombies.The game has admirable voice acting to make the gaming experience feel better. It's voice acting is usually done correctly being very precise and on time so don't expect voice acting timing like in Silent Hill. You'll experience some great sounding explosions, and the gun shots sound unbelievably real. If you turn up the volume and play with the volume set on very high, when a zombie pops out you will probably need a diaper change, but you will get retribution by blasting his head of and hearing the clarity of sound effects.Those of you who have played the first 2 games (Director's Cut excluded) will already be very familiar with the controls. But those of you (all three of you) who haven't, will have a little difficulty with adjusting to the controls. Me on the other hand, I'm a huge fan of the series and I know the basic layout. But don't worry about it, you'll have time to practice your controls in the beginning.Wrapping up this review I can say that Resident Evil 3 is not only the best of the series but it is also one of the best PSX titles out there today along with the top quality titles like Final Fantasy 8, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater and Syphon Filter.9.3 / 10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2001"}

At $20 this game is definitely worth it.The first day I played this game with several friends and we had a blast. Unfortunately there was only one course, one crash junction, and 3 identical cars available. This was frustrating to say the least as we wanted an enjoyable multiplayer game but seeing as how we had to spend several hours unlocking things we tired easily.The game at first impression was great. Amazing speed and graphics, a lot of fun, and smashing each other up seems like it would never stop being fun. Well once my buddies left the game soured on me.Single player is a drab experience. The first 30 or so events are a lot of fun and somewhat challenging with good racing and excitement. Problem is by about 30 events you have seen everything the game has to offer. They boast a whole ton of race modes in the description however many of them are the same thing. You really have time challenge, race (6 players or vs. 1), rage (destruction derby), and crash mode. Multiplayer has numerous options but most are only a variation of the crash game and the rest are only available online so I wouldn't know about them.Crash mode was great fun. I love the wanton destruction and the after touch ability made getting the cash and powerups fun and challenging. Problem was there are an insane number of these in the game. We're talking like 70+ different junctions. I mean smashing into traffic is a lot of fun but try it 30 or 40 times in a row and you will get bored. Plus some intersections are not only difficult just downright stupid. To achieve gold you have to have the patience of a seamstress to constant replay over and over again as you try and blow yourself up and reverse directions to get 4x multipliers. Worse are the load times! Why so many and so long??? When I replay a level that just loaded why does it take forever and go back through all the original screens? Could have been done better.When it comes to racing the most fun you will have will come early. The most enjoyment I had was the first 20 or so races. They are the most interesting to fight with the competition and really see some good crashes. Problem is the lack of diversification in races makes it really monotonous later on and as the competition gets better you just get frustrated more often. And as for unlockable cars. Yeah there are 70+ in the game but they are all the same! I mean for every class there are about 7 or 8 cars and they are either one of two body models with slightly different paint schemes and virtually no difference performance wise. Seeing as how you can change the color of any car the need for more of the same model in different paint scheme was unnecessary. Plus having to constantly win new events to unlock the same car over and over bored the heck out of me.As you progress through the game and finally get better cars you will find the game starts to become almost unplayable. As speed increases the screen blurs. Add this to crazy backgrounds, intense light effects, and hard to see cars, tracks can quickly turn a person with 20-20 vision into a sniveling blind man. There just is too much going on in the environments for a person to be able to handle the high speeds of some of the cars. You will be smashing into obstacles and oncoming traffic all the time and swear you never saw it. Things like intense sun glare on the pavement hide civilian traffic almost to the point of stealth for instance. Worse is in some levels the crash physics are not always equal. On some tracks you can careen around the track at top speed clipping walls or other obstacles almost head on with no effect and in others if you so much as touch a wall it will crash you. This was my ultimate frustration. After 50+ gold medals I have the physics down pretty well in races only to have my time trial thwarted by rubbing a wall and going into an elaborate crash. This will frustrate anyone looking for the game to be constant over the course. It also makes the annoying time trial missions virtually impossible with some cars. These missions require you to run at top speed, almost constantly boost engaged without crashing once. Some tracks allow you one or two mess-ups but most of the advance courses require you to run a perfect lap. Add in that you can't see traffic or obstacles, boost blurs your vision, and the crash engine is not always equal. Makes these races a virtual frustration of agonizing proportions.Overall I found the novelty value of this game great. It's basically Tony Hawk with cars. High-speed arcade fun with a lot of annoying quirks. The music is nothing special. I could have cared less about most of it but some songs are decent. The graphics I'd say are slightly above average. Mostly the crash scenes add to my assessment but standard-racing scenes won't blow your socks off. Control is functional. There is a decent physics engine so it has some realism to it even though it's an arcade racer and that was nice. Story wise or evolvement was an utter disappointment. Screaming and swearing through one race just to unlock another one 173 times over with about 10 different cars (car types not individual models) doesn't have the kind of lasting appeal I expected from this title.I would say Burnout 3 will deliver to the hardcore fans who loved the originals and newbies will like it for a bit but those average gamers looking for some fun may want to stay back and rent this title for a weekend as it will keep you entertained for a while but annoy you forevermore.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2005"}

Loved it. Whenever a few friends would come round for drinks B2 would be slapped in. Sure the racing was nice and opening cars and tracks added to the games' longevity but for the most fun you had to have a 'crash' party. When Burnout 3 was announced I was stoked - new cars, better graphics, extra modes and of course - more crashes!Unfortunately, this game is ruined for me for two reasons - firstly, during racing Burnout 3 has the single most cheating AI ever. Full stop. You can be *20+ seconds* ahead and crash and be at the back. Now I may not be a Phd here but unless the crash took 20+ seconds to happen there is no physical way they could have caught up. Crashes take a couple of seconds. So how did the AI cars manage to catch up? Simply put, they cheat. The game uses rubber-banding to ensure the cars are only ever a certain distance away. Want to check that - try going slow... meander along at 30 mph and the opponents will too. This took ANY skill away from the racing aspect of the game.Okay but there's still crash mode right? Well amazingly enough the developers took the pure simplicity of B2's crash mode and turned it into a fiasco. Point one - crashing was all about chance. You chose a vehicle, raced like mad and picked the most opportune time to crash. After that it was in the hands of the panel-beating gods. In B3 however you have 'aftertouch'; you can now control your car's direction to some degree in mid-air. This takes away chance and replaces it with skill and this is a step backward. The final nail in B3 crash modes coffin is the multilpliers. Dotted around the crash levels are little childish bonus icons that give you extras and, as such, render the crash levels to be nothing more than collecting tasks. There's NO point attempting to not go for the 4x multiplier. None. So once you have scored it, you're pretty much done with that crash level. No more choosing the right time to crash or experimenting with various methods. In Burnout 3 crashing is ALL about hitting that 4x. Nothing more. The replay is also awful - it's EXACTLY what you saw during the game - just behind the vehicle. No cameras cuts to enhance the fun.You also HAVE to play the other modes to unlock crash modes first. Again this is a departure from B2 - WHY?So that leaves Road Rage Takedown - the only part of B3 that added from B2 but that didn't hold my interest for long.Graphically it's all candy for the eyes as to be expected, but if you're a massive fan of Burnout 2 then expect some major changes in B3 that, in my opinion, ruin the game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00007B77T","description":"We could talk about theSerious Sambackstory, but that would be missing the point, namely to commit carnage on a galactic scale. The smooth engine, multiplayer options, and fast pace make this game a solid choice for fans of first-person shooters.The interface uses the tried-and-true Xbox formula for shooters: the left thumbstick controls movement and the right thumbstick controls the angle of view. The extensive arsenal is something special though, with each weapon possessing a different efficiency so you have to find the perfect weapon quickly for each situation. For instance, the shotgun is a great weapon for up-close fighting among a crowd of enemies, but it's horrible at a distance or when you're stuck in the middle of a melee. The enemy list is also quite extensive. You will be fired upon, stepped on, stabbed, slashed, and electrocuted. Enemies will appear by land, air, and water.What makes this game stand out and keep you interested, though, is its irreverent, offbeat sense of humor. Serious Sam makes outlandish comments throughout the game, rides cosmic surfboards between scenes, saves progress at Dr. Who-like telephone booths, and pays homage to the Indiana Jones theme song. And you can change the blood splatters between red, green, and hippy (flowers and fruit). Our only major complaint is level design. Even when you believe you've cleared a room, enemies can pop out of midair and injure you. By not allowing you to seal yourself off from the onrushing masses in appropriate spaces, a major strategic element has been missed.--Eric Franklin","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"One of the most intense & fun games out there","reviewText":"Sam \"Serious\" Stone takes up arms against an unseen maniacal genius named Mental's army of living monsters & freaks through a huge variety of levels.Short, sweet, and to the point is the story of Serious Sam for the X-Box. But what is the game like? Through a first person perspective you run around collecting a huge chunk of weapons including (but certainly not limited to) rocket launchers, shotguns, and flamethrowers and fending off hordes after hordes of millions of enemies at a time....no really, I'm not kidding. Serious Sam is one of the most, pardon the pun, seriously intense games I have ever played. You will ALWAYS be on the run, and just like the video game Black, always have your guns firing away. Just when you think the action is over, a health box appears, and as you grab it - ROAR! More monsters to blow away. Although this may seem repetitive, the sheer amount of action and intensity will keep even the most \"elitist gamers\" entertained. Since this X-Box release allows a co-op mode, you and a buddy can team up against Mental or (if you want) blow each other away in humorus yet bloody ways.Although action and destruction is Serious Sam's main points, the game doesn't have a \"serious\" tone at all. In fact, the game is pretty goofy both in Sam's dialouge, some sound effects, and cut scenes. I mean at one point you just finished putting a major dent in Mental's forces in some ice world to get your grubby hands on some orb.. you walk in and the orb is gone! All of a sudden you walk outside and there is a skeleton-horse sleigh waiting for you. All of a sudden you hear a hip-hop version of the song \"Jingle all the Way\" and then you see Serious Sam riding in the sleigh wearing a Santa Klaus outfit.Graphically speaking, this X-box video game looks truley beautiful with vibrant jungles, dark caves, vast white sanded deserts with gigantic pyramids, etc. The monsters look menacing, goofy, and at times, absolutley huge. The guns look great, and the lighting effects look even better.Ontop of that, the music helps to add to the atmosphere. Most of the time its straight heavy metal music, but at times it could be like Middle Eastern tunes or something like that. The guns sound BRUTAL, and deliver a very satisfying punch to your target.Serious Sam is a pretty long game not only because your gunfights will last a half hour each time, but because there are a lot of stages to cover. Despite being a basic straight forward game, you're looking at a good 10-15 hour game if you decide to take a few breaks sooner or later.To end this review, all I have to say is: if you're a fan of FPS or want a fast moving, action packed experience with some laughs sprinkled ontop then go out and buy Serious Sam.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00007JZB3","description":"TRON 2.0is an action-packed story-driven title inspired byTRON, the groundbreaking science-fiction motion picture. The game takes place in present day, approximately 20 years after the events of the film. Playing as Jet Bradley, son of ENCOM programmer Alan Bradley from the movie, gamers are digitized into cyberspace and will race on light cycles, battle corruption both inside and outside of the computer world, and explore locations including the Internet Hub, Firewall, Corrupted Server and Light Cycle Game Grid.","reviewerName":"Ethan D Van Vorst","summary":"The Electronic World Awaits....","reviewText":"After reading through several of the reviews here I've noticed that the single most common denominator is that the majority of us are 30-something males who saw this movie in the early 80's and have had a deep affection for the basic idea of it all. I mean, c'mon now, who wouldn't want a few days *inside* the computer in neon highlighted clothes while throwing a guided Identity Disc at people and get to drive around in a Light Cycle? No other movie I can think of screams for some kind of sequel quite the way TRON does (especially in todays' computer-driven world), and Buena Vista has tried to fill the gap with this awe-inspiring game.The plot revolves around an encroaching data corruption plague that threatens the computers of ENCOM, against the backdrop of a hostile takeover from rival corporation FCon (on paper it sounds like a Bill Gates-like boredom fest in the making, but it works out quite well). The main protagonist is Jet Bradley, son of Alan Bradley (voiced by Bruce Boxleitner himself), who is sucked into the computer world, a la Flynn, by Alan's brainchild computer program Ma3a (voiced by Cindy Morgan, Yori/Lora of the original movie). Needless to say the storyline is intriguing and wonderfully put into the aspect of the Digital World with such panache that I wonder how this game didn't do better sales than it did.Graphics wise this game is a virtual feast for the eyes. Where Doom 3 might hold the title for most visually realistic FPS this game is by far the most beautiful. Syd Meade's virtual world comes completely alive in this game, and to get to be *in* it is a dream come true. Almost every surface of every character and object is gorgeously highlighted by the cool neon lines of Tron-esque cyberspace. There is absolutely no other way to play this game but on the highest possible graphics setting because to put it even a smidge below that would be almost criminal.Gameplay is equally absorbing. You begin your stay in the computer world with your trusty disc weapon. There are a number of weapons you can pick up later in the game, such as the mesh Blaster (basically a machine-pistol), Suffusion (a cyber-shotgun), LOL (a sniper rifle), as well as a wide array of energy ball weapons. You'll find yourself highly reliant on your trusty disc though, and really there's nothing wrong with that as it's the most reliable weapon you have and a pure joy to use. In addition you can aquire various \"subroutines\" by downloading them from data bins located all over the digital world. These subroutines allow you to do various improved styles of combat, or give you armor bonuses, or can give you increased abilities such as jumping higher or running silently. Most subroutines start out as giant Beta versions which suck up a lot of space in your configuration, but can be upgraded to Alpha or Gold versions throughout the game, provided you can find the subroutine enhancement critter-thing (there seems to be one for each level). This increases the combat/power value of the subroutine while letting it take up less space in your configuration, thus allowing room for more. Quite clever indeed!One of the biggest sells of the game is of course the universally loved Light Cycle. No one who tries this game can deny what a long-dreamt about experience this alone is, and the inclusion of the Syd Mead-designed Super Light Cycle only sweetens the deal further. Cycles zip around on racing grids and every sound you remember from the movies is there, from the digital \"thwip thwip thwip\" of your cycle passing over grid lines to the fantastic sound of an opponent running into your light-trail. There are admittedly some rather odd (and questionable) maneuvers that your computer opponents can perform that will have you shaking your head in disbelief, but overall the Light Cycles half pay for the game by themselves.Jet begins his trek in the digital world hotly pursued by ENCOM's ICP's, basically Anti-Virus programs, who blame him for the spread of the corruption. With the help of Byte (an upgrade to Bit, from the movie) Jet travels from server to server, hard-drive to PDA, and all over cyber-creation. Some of these digital world locale's are genius in design and are pure fun to go through, notably the Net (complete with a pub called, quite cleverly, \"The Progress Bar\") to the old EN-8212 mainframe of movie fame. All the while Jet is pursued by ICP's and the corporate thugs of FCon, who seem obsessed with finding and capturing Ma3a.As gorgeous and engrossing as the game is there are a few weak spots that prevent me from giving it a perfect 5 star review. Others have pointed out a dislike for the puzzle/key-finding aspect of the game, but I rather enjoyed it. It was a lot of fun exploring every nook and cranny of the Tron universe. But I will say that while most of the maps are great fun to experience there are a few that are outright frustrating. Right off the bat the PDA is a living, breathing nightmare to navigate and beat(can I get an Amen?). The old ENCOM mainframe is a lot of fun, no doubt, but something of a letdown when you discover that you can't find Tron himself but only a sparkly bubble known as the Tron Legacy Code. Further the FCon antagonists are quite a bit over the top in their sinister designs. The HR woman looked like she was on a 48 hour caffiene binge at any given time. And the tragically short encounter with the infamous digital Tank only left me wanting for more, in addition to the elsewhere-mentioned scarcity of Recognizers (the few times you see and hear them really bring this game out). And the ending was almost anti-climactic. This is a long game and to go successfully through it to an ending that was, shall we say, underwhelming at best, really just irks you.I should note though that Tron 2.0 is left open for a sequel story-wise, but that the luke-warm sales of this game probably told Buena Vista Games that it wasn't necessary. And that's what really saddens me because the Tron universe has a truly rabid following. The Light Cycles alone could make a fantastic game in and of itself, and it's included in the package! The ending leaves a number of questions. Where's Flynn? Is the CEO of FCon who I think he is? And most of all, where the heck is the sequel??? Overall a fantastic game that I find myself playing again and again! Fantastic work Buena Vista and Monolith!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2005"}

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A Knockout!","reviewText":"Pros:+Really fun art style+Simple to play, yet difficult to master+Addictive music+Addictive gameplay+Different ways to playCons:-Competing in multiplayer can only be done as Little Mac-There's no online multiplayer, but I really don't think that's a big dealThose who owned the original NES probably got a chance to play the original Punch-Out.  At the time the game was incredibly awesome and incredibly difficult.  There was also a Super Punch-Out for the SNES, but after that there was never another game.  With the Wii's motion sensor controls, however, it's amazing we didn't get a Punch Out game for the system sooner.  Wii Sports has already established that a boxing game is perfect for the Wii.  Punch-Out for the Wii makes it possible.If you were one of those people who played Punch-Out for the original NES, then you'll be right at home when playing it on the Wii.  It's instantly familiar.  A lot of the competitors are the same, and they look very much the same.  So is Little Mac.  And the gameplay is just about the same as well.  If you were a veteran of the old games you'll find that playing Punch-Out for the Wii is like returning to visit an old friend after a few years.  There's a lot that will start coming back to you.As Little Mac, you'll step into the ring and take on a grand total of 13 fighters.  Just like the original Punch-Out, there's a bit of pattern recognition going on.  Making the right moves at the right time, and watching your opponent are the keys to winning.  While it's not quite Wii Boxing in terms of making punches and whatnot, it is quite a challenging game.  Especially your first time through.  And it's still pretty addictive.  All you really need to do is watch your foe and make sure you make your punches accordingly.  You've also got Stars that you obtain by punching your opponents at the right time (when they flash).  This allows you to use Star Punches which really pack a wallop.It's got simple gameplay that you'll find incredibly addictive for a while.  You might, however, find the main campaign to be a little short.  And indeed, it is.  But the game does have a few things that help it along.  For example, after going through all the fighters once, you'll have to do it again to defend your title, but the fights won't be the same.  They'll be more challenging, having more moves and moving faster and requiring you to take on different tactics than before.Aside from that there is also the exhibition mode where you go up against the fighters but pertaining to specific conditions.  Again, simple gameplay, but it can be very challenging to figure out just how to complete some of the conditions.There are a few ways one can control Punch-Out for the Wii.  The first, and most obvious, is to use the Nunchuck and Wii Remote so that you can swing them to make punches if you wish.  You can also use the balance board for ducking and dodging.  Lastly, you can use just the Wii Remote by itself and play like the original NES title.  Of all the control schemes using the Wii-Remote like a classic NES controller is the best, and that's pretty sad.  The game is fun with the other control modes, but it's hard to doubt that it's just a lot easier to pick up and play with the classic controller approach.  On the other hand, it's nice that we're not playing a Wii game where the Wii Controls feel tacked on.Another addition to Punch-Out is that people can now play multi-player.  This is a really nice addition.  Two people can now go at it.  They'll both play as Little Mac, though, and this is probably the biggest complaint concerning multi-player.  It would be so much better if players could choose between any of the opponents to play as and go head to head.  It would make Punch-Out the perfect party game.  There's also no online multi-player but I doubt most gamers will lose sleep over that.For a Wii Game Punch-Out looks pretty good.  It's artistic style has often been fairly popular.  Punch-Out is, and pretty much always will be a cartoony like game.  And it's definitely true of the Wii version, which makes Punch-Out come alive the way it should.  It still sounds very good as well.  There are some nostalgic tunes thrown in there, but mostly it just suits Punch-Out.For old fans of the Punch-Out series, this is like a thank you gift.  They're more apt to enjoy than someone who has never played it before.  If you're new to the series, this isn't really all that bad to play at all, and you might find yourself becoming addicted.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B007A7UJ4S","description":"","summary":"4.75 is not a possible rating","reviewText":"This game completely blew me away.  I haven't played an RPG since i battled Sin in Final Fantasy X.  I wasn't a huge fan of it then, and in honesty, I'm still not now.  This game, however, really creates an immersive game play that is both beautiful to witness and fun to play.  The fighting is very straight forward and the strategy is easily picked up upon.In the game is is a book called the Wizards Companion.  I at first thought this was just an unnecessary additional concept not helpful to the game.  Soon after, I couldn't figure out which elements would defeat others, and which sign (moon, sun, star, planet) defeats others.  Consulting this Companion answered all those questions and is a plethora of information.  The stores that you find along the way often give a great life lesson, Aesop's Fables style.All of the characters in the game are well written; there are some repetitive bits about wanting to borrow some quality from a person, but it's easy enough to get through.  People have complained that there is a lot of unnecessary menu sequencing, however, I have not encountered this problem.  All the menus make sense and feel organic to me.  We who play who are older than the general target audience (the game is E after all..), must keep this in mind when there are helpful reminders.There is one bone I need to pick, which is why I gave it 4(.75) stars instead of the full five this game really deserves.  It is the fact that the point I am in the game, my companions are utterly useless and boss battles usually end up me versus the big baddie, and random encounter battles also seem very skewed and difficult all the sudden.  I am willing to accept that this may be due to poor strategy on my part, but it is terribly frustrating to breeze through the entire first portion of the game, but become challenged significantly more, seemingly randomly.Overall this is a very fun and engaging game.  The visuals are absolutely gorgeous at times, and the rest of the time are simply beautiful, along with the amazing complimentary music.  If you like Studio Ghibli, you will like this cinematic scope.  If you like RPGs, I couldn't say if you would like them because I have no real credentialed experience with other RPGs to say if this compares or not.  Having said all that, this is a great game that I have already put about thirty hours into.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2013"}

It hits some really high points but also stumbles badly in some areas as far as I'm concerned.The good: I liked the art design, use of multiple characters, and the varied gameplay mechanics in spots.  Tons of game here; 40 main levels and not too short at that.The bad:  Overly easy at the beginning and by extension somewhat less than engaging, which I wrote off as due to the target audience.  But, I had to reevaluate that notion after the second world.  I am only 2 levels away from completing the game, and the difficulty is maddeningly unbalanced.  Later levels can be long, exacerbated by midpoint icons being too far apart.  Nothing is more frustrating than, spending 15 lives mastering a difficult run only to experience a second difficult run.As someone earlier mentioned, you can easily collect over a 100 lives in the progression of the game, which at the time seemed ludicrous.  Now with only two levels and 40 lives left, I am wondering if that will be enough.To top it off boss battles are ridiculously easy even at later levels.  At this point I am just playing sporadically so I can finish the game and be done with it.This is all the more depressing when I contrast this game with New SMB, a game that while other might have thought easy, felt just right to me.  I kept coming back to that game to find the secret portals after I had completed it - a truly great game.In summary, I can't really recommend this as a fun casual game for kids.  Although it starts easy, it is really geared for more of a challenge hungry hardcore gamer.  That just isn't me.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2008"}

But I didn't know about the \"Boss Fights\" yet, and my first one was so frustrating, I amended my rating from three stars to one. I received several comments regarding this, one of which made the very good point that, in my review, I did state the things that I LIKED about the game (I still like it a lot, and am still playing it), so in essence it wasn't really fair to reduce the rating so severely based on the ONE thing I didn't like. I think that is a fair point, so I re-edited the review as below. Thanks for your comments!************************This game is very good, for what it is. My problem, really is what it is NOT. It is not \"open ended\" or \"sandbox\" or \"open world.\" Some ads and reviews make you think it is. You do not have infinite choices. Some ads and reviews may make you think you do. You play as a character who is almost killed, then brought back as an \"augmented\" individual, who is the security chief for some huge global corporation that manufactures the components that \"augment\" humans. It is in the near future, so it's not the nanotechnology of say, the Borg 300 years from now, but it's as advanced as mechanical enhancements would be say, 50 years or so from now. Anyway your character has to investigate what seems to be a big conspiracy, while preserving his employer's company in the process. That's a simplification of the story line, but it's the gist of it.The game is a sort of combination RPG and FPS, its been compared to Mass Effect. Evidently there are branching story trees and endings, depending on what you did, said to someone, didn't do, passed on, did when you felt like it instead of when the quest giver said to, and on and on. This sort of give the feeling of \"open endedness\" but this is NOT an \"open ended\" game. This is a game that has a large story part, like LA Noire, combined with game play. You can't really go where you want, and do what you want, say like in Oblivion or GTA. When you're on a main mission, progression is linear. You can take different paths, but you have to go where the game wants you to go. When on \"side missions,\" it's similar. You find a location and do what you're supposed to.As far as main missions, I hope you like stealth, because you'll be doing a lot of it, or trying to. It's said that you COULD go in \"guns blazing\" but that won't really work because (1) mission areas are large with a fair number of guards, mercs, punk gangsters, whomever you're facing in that location so if you pop up shooting wildly, they will take you out quick, and (b) you only get a very small amount of ammo for the various weapons you can carry. I mean a SMALL amount of ammo. One thing that's messed up...say you are in cover around a corner, with your 10mm pistol and a guy a little ways away is shooting at you with a machine pistol. Take him out with a head shot, and, you think cool, I can go pick up that pistol and plenty of ammo. Nope, that gun will have 1 round in it, and he might have 6 more when you search his body, BUT, if he HE'S firing at YOU, it seems like he has unlimited ammo!! The game does NOT want you to have a fair amount of ammo, so you must use your shots wisely. This usually involves trying to sneak through an area, getting detected (you will ALWAYS get detected), and running like hell for a spot around a corner, up some stairs, etc, where you can take cover and have all the enemies come at you single file, instead of staying in the open so they can flank you. (The AI btw is pretty weak. Once you get this down, assuming you have enough bullets, tranq darts, etc, you can take down like 20 guards without taking a hit)Another thing: If you like to be evil, and randomly kill bystanders, ala GTA, that ain't happening in this game. Now you COULD do so, you can pull a weapon and fire on anyone at anytime, BUT, in public areas there are always numerous police around, who will immediately attack you, and in areas where you could get away with it, it's not worth wasting the limited ammo you have. The city areas are not that large, there are merchants you can buy and sell weapons and ammo at, and \"LIMB clinics\" where you can buy augmenatation kits, if you have enough credits (money). You can also find aug kits in various places, and when you get enough XP points the game will reward you with ONE measly point to upgrade you augs with.This is one part of the game where you do have some choice. You can upgrade your augs in various areas, the best ones are probably social and hacking. Since this is basically a kind of sort of stealth game, the hacking will come on most handy. Also, talking with people, (its like Mass Effect where you say something, they say something then you pick one of several responses), give you the most XP's.Now I come to the part of the game that I have a SERIOUS issue with: \"Boss Fights.\" My issues are (a) I'm not an advanced gamer and they are too damn hard for me (I only have done one, so far, the first), and (b) most importantly they TOTALLY KILL THE FLOW OF THE GAME. e.g. They don't belong in this game. That is my opinion.Briefly, when you get to the end of a level (which you won't know unless you have the guide or are reading an on line guide), you go through some door, into a cut scene that sets up the Boss Fight. It seems that each \"boss\" is about 30 levels higher than you, with every aug possible. The frustrating thing is, unless YOU have invested in the proper augs and/or have the correct weapons, which is not possible to know without reading some guide or walk through before hand), you will have NO CHANCE of beating that boss. At best, it will be INCREDIBLY frustrating; yes there are supplies scattered around the area, but you must avoid the boss/select weapons/pick things up, etc. If you are not good at this (like for example, me), you will die, many many times, and THEN, each time you DIE, you sit through the 40 second LOAD SCREEN. Did I mention how I think that Boss Fights DON'T BELONG IN THIS GAME?For example, in my case, I had done the body armor augs up to the EMP/Electrical current one, which, it turns out, will help me in the SECOND boss fight, but is no use in the first. I only know this because due to my frustration being killed literally 50 times by the first \"boss,\" I went on line and found a guide. If you are stuck on that first \"boss\" I can help you--you need the stun gun with about 20 darts, and the revolver (most powerful unmodified handgun in the game), with about 30 rounds. You need to come through that door with your stun gun out. (Oh, be sure to save before going in the door). When the boss comes at you (DON'T get within his reach he grabs you automatically, and it will be OVER), run straight at him, and fire your stun gun. This will stun him for a second or two. Hit him with it again, this will stun him for a couple more moments. Switch to the revolver and shoot him in the chest, repeatedly as fast as you can. After he takes 5 or 6 hits he will go down.I think it's ridiculous to need a guide, to refer to BEFORE you enter a level. To me a guide is for those few times when you just can't get through a section, to be used as a last resort, NOT to prepare for a section of the game. Basically if you don't have the correct aug/weapons/tactic ahead of time for each boss (and there is no way to know, till you get there, and then it's hopeless), the level and therefore the game, becomes unplayable. Again, this is just my opinion.I do recommend this game, but you just need to understand what you are getting. It's a stealth game. If you have the patience for that, and to watch a lot of FMV, and do a lot of conversation trees, you will like it a lot. It is pretty addictive. If you want a pure shooter, or a sandbox game like GTA or Oblivion, you will be disappointed.I would say rent it first. I will finish it, but the Boss Fights really killed it for me. When Skyrim comes out, it's going BACK.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0045U4U52","reviewerName":"Bruce Kane \"Truth hurts\"","summary":"WARNING! Over hype game alert. Proceed with caution.","reviewText":"Every PE fan has been waiting for this day. The day where we can finally see Aya back in action, but was it worth it, or not? The short answer is, NO! But let me explain.The main heroine Aya Brea this time around, is so weak compare to her attitude in PE 1&2. They made her so defenseless, and boring, that you can't actually take the story seriously, because of it. And I'm being kind to the story atm, because it's pretty lack luster too, but back to Aya. Brea has barely no dialogue, which makes me think that SE must been paying the voice actors/actress pennies too none, because overall dialogue for everyone is boring. The her design is still great though, which give credit to SE of coarse, but overall I was very displease with what SE did too Aya Brea.I won't go into detail about the story, because it's really terrible. Either I'm growing out of JRPG's, or the corny stories are just getting old and more dry each day. I honestly don't know how you can mess this up with a great story/game like PE1. I guess it was pretty easy, because this and PE2 succeeded in doing just that.And now for the combat. Oh boy! Where do I begin with this disaster?  The controls simply put, are terrible. It's based on the infamous auto lock system, which controls the terrible camera too what direction you want it too face, which is based on where the monster is at. It could be left, right, etc, which ultimately neglects what spawns from behind you which = a easy way for monsters too get a easy kill. The directional buttons provide free use of the camera, but the monsters don't exactly give you the time to use that before they kill you. And now about the monsters/bosses, which are ridiculously tough this time around. It can be, because they wanted the game to be harder, or because the game is ridiculously short. I'll go with choice 2. The monster/bosses in this game, are crazy hard. If you've play Lost Planet, Monster Hunter, you'll know what I'm talking about + they regain health if you don't Overdrive, which Overdrive, is a fancy way to add more damage or transfer to another body before the one you're in dies. you have a last resort power call Liberation, which basically puts you in a special form for a \"SHORT\" time, which can either, Heal you completely, do more damage with energy shots, or make one final stand before death, and sacfice yourself for massive damage. All these things are great, but the monster still tend too have the upper hand, which ultimately kills the fun out of the game for some.Overall I sadly didn't enjoy this PE. Instead of taking two step forward, SE took two steps back instead.  The hero isn't interesting. The story isn't interesting. The CGI is always great. SE is always on top when it comes too CGI and the art presentation. The OST is fantastic. It's the only thing that kept me going in this game, but the overall product just doesn't work for me. I give PE: 3rd Birthday Fair.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2011"}

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access.

This is one of the only next-gen games I've really got into. For this review Ill first address the main complaints about the game and next say why I love this game.Complaint 1: You Cant shoot while runningAnswer 1: The game mechanics are such that shooting while running would be a pointless pain in the ass. Its hard enough to shoot while moving (aka in a boat or vehicle) so such a feature would get minimal use.Complaint 2: The zombies are listless easy targetsAnswer 2: Compared to what? Most people who make this complaint say that RE should go back to its roots. If one wants to see listless zombies all they have to do is play RE at its roots. Also the zombies are faster and much more difficult on professional mode (After the game is beat on veteran).Complaint 3: The AI is badAnswer 3: This one I can kind of understand but it does have advantages. When playing with a human player, they know what to look out for - they shoot first and ask questions later. The AI seems a bit slow during many enemy encounters. On the up-side, the AI doesn't miss when shooting and is better than any human with in stages where one moves and shoots. I feel the AI over all is strong but does not compare to good players but its often hard to find those players.Complaint 4: The shock factor / scares are goneAnswer 4: This is a two sided coin also. You're not going to have many moments where your heart jumps in your throat but there are tons of surprises that keep you on your toes. All too often the player is separated from his / her counterpart while enemies rush at them and they have no idea where to go or what to do. Also the cut scenes have tons of events that the player must pay attention to. This is definitely more of an action game than anything and I like it that way.Complaint 5: The game is short...Answer 5: ...with loads of replayability. I'll write more on this later.Complaint 6: The controls are the same / datedAnswer 6: Interesting how the controls were fine with all three Halo games but a similar control scheme in two resident evil games is a sin. I personally find the controls comfortable and easy to use. Out of all the times I've read this I haven't once read a suggestion to fix it.Complaint 7: The inventory is hard to use during battleAnswer 7: In the heat of battle it is difficult to switch items but there shouldn't be too many times this is an issue. When the partner is dying, you use health automatically when saving them. The only issue is if your partner runs out of ammo there will be precious little time to re-supply him / her.Complaint 8: lack of puzzlesAnswer 8: Again, this is a debate of old vs new resident evil. I like the direction resident evil is going in, more puzzle lower the action. When blasting away dozens of enemies while dodging spears, bullets, and axes, stopping to do a puzzles constantly would just ruin the mood.Now why I love this game:Reason 1- Online-coop: This is the first RE game online and I believe it is a HUGE step forward. Its always more fun to play with a real human and it makes the game more intense during those moments you get separated.Reason 2 - cut scenes: I have to at least touch on this, there are over 40 (mostly) brutal cut scenes which keep you hooked. Though the story IS fairly weak, the cut scenes more than make up for what the plot is lacking.Reason 3 - stage select: This is perhaps the best feature of RE 5 in my opinion. I'm fairly busy going to school, going to the gym, doing work etc so I don't always have time to sit down for hours and play a game. With the stage select option I'm always up for a quick co-op / mercenary game before I have to leave for somewhere.Reason 4 - replayability: The stage select option adds a lot to the replayability. There's tons of gems, guns, eggs (for some reason), and bonus emblems to collect. It will take several play-throughs of a stage before you get all that stage can offer. Also with four different levels of difficulty, I personally want to see if In can beat my time on a stage. Professional makes it especially tough when one hit is more than enough to do you in.Suggestions: Thus far I can think of these criticisms, if I think of more ill add them1 - Diving: It would be useful (much more so that shooting while running) if one was able to dive to the sides during some of the fights - especially on the harder modes.2 - Non-infinite ammo mode: when creating a game there is the option of using infinite ammo or not. While infinite ammo is fun as hell (rocket launcher anybody?) it can make the toughest parts of the game a breeze. I think Capcom should have included infinite ammo as a completely separate mode which would really help separate the boys from the men (or those with a social life from those without).3 - More stages: Although I dearly love each stage, I would love to see more in updates. I like this game for the action and it wouldn't be to hard to create similar (yet different) stages using some of the same environments.4 - Enemy location: On all the difficulties the enemies are the same and in the same locations. This makes it a lot easier and a lot less surprising on subsequent play throughs.5 - AI: Although I'm fine with the AI (and rarely use it) it would appease to a lot of people to add AI options such as attacking enemies with priority or only using health at certain times (See FF XII). Also during online games you can only use 4 commands: Stop, go, come on, etc. More commands should be added in an update, this shouldn't be hard to do.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2009"}

The hulk should get rid of David Banner if some super fairy ever comes along offering the wish be fulfilled.  The Hulk game is no different.  They should have scrapped the banner levels and just shipped a short game.  It would have got much better reviews.  The banner levels are only terrible in that they are HARD, and they stop you from doing what the rest of the game excels at: smashing things and people as the hulk.  Man oh Mickey playing as the Hulk is better than Rock n Roll.  Smash walls, people, cars, pillars and everything in sight.  This part of the game is awesome.  Unfortunately the makers of the game must have known this and so they have you doing it again and again and again.  This gets a little monotonous.  Luckily it is so much fun that it is not too big of a problem.Bottom Line:  Is it fun?  Oh man is it.  If you have some love for the green guy, get the game.  But, only do so if you can get codes to completely skip the terrible Banner levels. Will I keep it?  Tempting, but no.  As fun as the hulk levels are they get monotonous.  Is it for kids?

Weapons of mass destruction, deployed with complete impunity razed the land in the blink of an eye. The dire situation forced the two opposing factions to negotiate a cease-fire and an agreement was quickly reached, but although the war may have ended, its effects remained. With the deteriorating environment, Earth's population was drastically reduced and those who survived lived a confined existence trapped in underground cities. Eventually countries joined together to form the Greater United Nations and turned their eyes skyward, to space. With the establishment of the USTA, the Universal Science and Technology Administration, man began to seek new worlds beyond the stars.AD 2087...The first year of the spacedate (SD) calendar. Thanks to the success of Professor Trillas Bachstein's warp drive experiments, mankind's dream of a spacebourne existence has inched closer to reality and the USTA secretly began to implement its SRF project, the Space Reconnaissance Force. Now it is SD 0010, and the first official SRF mission and your adventure has begun.CharactersPlayers ofStar Ocean: The Last Hopewill meet and interact with a wealth of characters from different parts of the galaxy, each with their own history and weapons of choice. Just a few of the more prominent characters to familiarize yourself with include:Edge MaverickAlthough generally possessing good judgment, this young Earthling commander of the maiden deep space voyage of the SRF ship the Calnus, can be reckless. His signature weapon is the sword.Faize Sheifa BelethA young Eldarian committed to etiquette and logic, and capable of astounding feats of engineering, Faize is always honorable of those possessing abilities he lacks. His signature weapon is the rapier.Reimi SaionjiThe kind and levelheaded navigator of the Calnus, Reimi was born in an aristocratic Saionji family and has a shared history with Edge back on Earth. Her signature weapon is the bow.Lymle Lemuri PhiOrphaned on her home planet of Lemrick long ago, Lymle is mischievous, but friendly and inexplicably retains the appearance of a young girl. Her signature weapon is the wand.Gameplay and CombatAlthough Edge Maverick is the main character inStar Ocean: The Last Hope, players will of course experience gameplay action in the form of a number of different characters and utilize the signature attacks assigned to each. The game features a real-time combat system which allows for up to four party members to remain active in battle at a time. Improvements to the game's combat system include 'Rush Mode,' where players can switch out active members of their combat groups for reserve members in real-time; 'Sight In/Sight Out' which allows for timed evasive and counter moves against enemies; and the BEAT (Battle Enhancement Attribute Type) system, through which players can change a character's fighting style at will. Other actions players will master through gameplay include piloting of the spaceship Calnus, a first in theStar Oceanseries; item creation in the form of weapons, healing items and accessories; and Private Actions (PAs), a cause and effect relationship between character in-game actions and the acquisition of new abilities and scenarios. Through the increased flexibility mastery of all these skills provides, players should be able to more easily increase their team and individual team member's combat experience and status, and so unlock more advanced combat styles and linked combinations.Key Game Features:Series prequel-Star Ocean: The Last Hopeis a prequel in the classic series, combining sci-fi and fantasy elements, spanning multiple planets and the vastness of space itself to recount the origins of the Star Ocean universe.Exciting Battles- Exhilarating combat expands upon the franchise's famous real-time battle system, including the amazing graphics and visual effects only possible on Xbox 360.Compelling Scenes- The game features breathtaking CG movies by Visual Works, the cutting-edge studio whose previous work includes cutscenes for the acclaimed Final Fantasy RPG series.","reviewerName":"Benjamin S. Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"A great experience, if you accept it for what it is (A J-RPG).","reviewText":"I was a big fan of j-rpgs in my youth. In recent years however I have become a bit melancholy. This is not because J-rpgs have gotten worse. Put simply it is akin to loving a flavor of ice cream but getting sick of it after eating too much.So when I say Star Ocean Last Hope is a great game and addicting to play that is a testament of quality. In truth I dreaded getting this game. I was afraid I'd get tired of it after playing it a mere 3 hours and put it on my shelf where it would hence forth collect the dusts of obscurity. Imagine my glee when this mishap did not happen!Before I go into how great star ocean last hope is I figure I will take time to warn you of its' shortcomings first. This game is guilty of having a blond idealistic youth as its' main protagonist. Almost every stereotype you can think of that inhabits sci fi japanese anime settings makes an appearance. The voice acting at times is grating. Not because the voice actors/actresses are bad but because of the lines they are made to read.If you disdain playfully rambuncious cute nekos , adorable little girls that wave magic wands, big breasted pointy eared milfs, stoic self sacrificing cyborg scientists, the typical childhood girl friend next door, naive feather winged angel babes that come along with the baggage of prophetic nightmares, long haired brooding scythe wielding bishi-boys, and the usual sibling rivalry established between two best friends avoid last hope at all costs. It is not trying to be radically different from other J-rpgs. If anything it is proud of being what it is. Still reading? Still think Last Hope holds merit? Good, because the worst it has to throw at you ends with this paragraph!The most rewarding aspect of star ocean is its' combat engine. When you wade into battle with enemies after charging them head first it's go time! You will be running around the battle field, jumping, side stepping attacks, stringing together combos, and strategically taking cover so you can fire off your spells without being interrupted. The fights are very much in \"real time\" and to me the system is much like the Tales series. (Though fans of the Tales games claim it's battle system is still better).For a guy such as me tired of heroes getting in a perfect line to match their enemies on the other end of the court as if everyone is about to engage in a poetry slam fest or dance off this is a huge ray of sun shine. Combat is last hope is fast, furious, and in your face. It's easy to switch off + take control of each character and whether you like long range attacks or up close attacks you'll find someone that fits your style of play.\"Beats\" are styles that give each protagonist different tactics and bonuses when facing their foes. You can also reconfigure everyone's battle ai if a certain series of actions are making you come up short handed. Nothing about this is truly original but it works well and getting a varied number of \"battle trophies\" makes you feel a sense of accomplishment.The story in Last Hope is engaging. It will keep you playing to see what happens next BUT also be aware it is not trying to be high-brow literature. Think about any favorite Sci Fi series you have watched. Not every episode blew your mind. Not every character stuck out as memorable. However you tolerated a few lags or annoyances knowing the series would \"pick up\" in season two or be handed off to a better writer. Last hope is this same roller coaster. The plummeting dips are worth tolerating to get to the exhilarating high points!To get the most out of last hope there are a few things I'd advise.1# When you get Bacchus immediatly go to Aeos + Lemuria to mine: Mining is essential for collecting gems and metals to make good stuff when you communicate with Welch who helps you from earth. It can be a pain to neglect this and have to back track later. It may even require switching cds. The moment I got Bacchus I re-visited Aeos and Lemuria to drill for resources.2# Have Reimi harvest: Whenever you get a chance have Reimi harvest plants and vegetables. Whereas mining is essential to create weapons and armor \"plants\" are used in recipes to make awesome potions and foods that replenish magic,restore health, and cure ailments.3# Be balanced upgrading your skills: Do not just pump your combat abilities. Occasionally put points into things such as cooking,alchemy, artistry, robotics, and smithing. These trades aid you when creating new artifacts. Sometimes what you make is better than the merchandise offered in stores.4# Switch out characters in your idea groups: When you talk to Welch you create teams to invent. Try switching off people in each team until the ideas keep flowing.5# Do not sleep through a whole voyage...Socialize!: Right before you go to a new planet you have \"free time\" on your ship. Instead of sleeping until arrival see if your friends and crew mates have interesting things to say. These events sometimes occur after you take a short nap. Depending on how you respond to people will gradually effect the story.6# It's a Japanese RPG....embrace it, don't be hating!: Lymle says \"kay\" a lot and some angst ridden people hate her for that reason alone. I find this ridiculous considering she has a decent back story, lovable personality, and is a useful magic user. Look, even in real life our friends have little annoying habits or weird quirks. It's true J-Rpgs capitalize on \"cute\" \"odd\" or \"sexy time\" at every opportunity. While these exaggerations of certain themes can be awkward also remember such things were done in our favorite J-rpgs in the past too. (Even Chrono trigger had it's dose of perverted erotic innuendo + annoying hero habits) If you knit pick enough you'll find \"the bad\" in every thing. Instead, weigh everything fairly and acknowledge the good as well.Pros and cons+Engaging story set after World War 3 in which mankind is forced to reach out to the stars.+Is the prequel to the first Star Ocean. Fans of the series will get a lot of service!+Fun exciting combat+ Environments are interesting to explore. Area puzzles are not too hard to figure out. (For the most part)+Crafting system is easy to understand.+Good music+Characters become more and more likable as you learn about them.+Socializing is encouraged between planet jumping+Boss fights are challenging but rarely escalate to being frustrating.Cons-Every anime stereotype you can imagine rears its' head screaming. Nothing is subtle. This IS a J-RPG.- At first many of the protagonists seem to come from cookie cutter character molds and they sometimes speak annoying dialogue.-It's nice to be able to \"dash around\" enemies the only problem is there are so many of them in certain scenarios \"escape\" is not always an option.-Expect to level grind....a lot.-If you want to make the best objects and do certain side quests back tracking and cd switching  become annoying obstacles.Pro or con?+/- Overall the graphics look beautiful but the faces of some of the characters look as if the designers struggled between \"anime\" and \"semi realism\" to such a large degree the end results appear a bit off somehow.+/- Edge Maverick is a bright eyed optimist towards the beginning of the story but a mishap that happens in an alternate dimension makes him mopey for awhile. At least he eventually gets the spring back in his step later on. Personally for me it was nice to see a main protagonist express a large range of emotions. Edge is definetely a cut deeper than Cloud or the typical \"silent hero\" types. I suppose I can forgive him for being \"emo\". If I felt responsible for screwing up a whole civilization I would likely act much the same. (And hey, he does move on)+/- Some have said \"blind siding\" is difficult. This is a combat manuever in which you charge up, jump towards an enemy's weak spot, and do more damage by exploiting their vulnerability. I am actually able to do it once or twice per battle but admittedly when you are charging up it leaves you open to attacks. Perhaps this aspect of combat could have been done better but considering all variables it's still a nice feature.Rent/buy? This is up to you. If you love J-rpgs and don't mind some lighthearted Saturday morning cartoon fluff mixed with a dash of melodrama and over epic cheese you should bite into this juicy morsel asap. However if you are not big on the whole \"Japanese RPG\" phenomenon give it a pass and conserve your cash.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2009"}

Second, the charge indicator is inaccurate and inconsistent: sometimes it'll say it's full when it's actually almost dry, and other times it'll say it's running low when the charge is actually okay.Not that it's too big of a problem, because when the controller is actually running low on charge, the lights around the Xbox Guide Button will begin flashing.  As you're playing, you'll notice the flashing lights out of your peripheral vision.  That's when you pause your game, look down at your controller, and see it's crying for more power.  You simply plug the cord into either USB port on the 360 and you're set!  The light on the charger will be red as long as the controller is still charging, and when it turns green you know it's full.Overall, I'm very happy with my charger and it's already paid for itself in all the money I've saved in not having to continuously buy more batteries.

{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"Excellent action game!","reviewText":"Dead Space was a very good 3rd-person action title. The graphics and controls were top-notch and very slick and really drew you into the experience. This is very much carried over to it's sequel with even more impressive gameplay and action but unfortunately, like the first Dead Space doesn't quite feel like the survival-horror game it's trying to be.The story of Dead Space 2 picks up three years after the events of Dead Space 1 with now fully-voiced Isaac Clarke on a space station breaking out of a mental institution and fighting through waves of monsters on his way to finding out the truth about his condition as well as the outbreak. Making Isaac a talking hero was a wise choice on the developers part as not only is the voice-actor giving a top-notch performance but it gives us a personal connection with the hero. The overall story itself is good sci-fi thriller with some great (and psychological) twists and turns but somewhat lacking the personal connection to events we had in the first Dead Space. It's really the story of Isaac losing his sanity that keeps us engaged.Like I said before, the gameplay was already rock-solid in the first Dead Space but it's even more refined in this sequel! Isaac is even more responsive as you shoot, dismember, punch and stomp your way through hordes of monsters! The gameplay flows so naturally and even the zero-gravity moments feels easy to control. There's stasis and telekinesis you can use in combat too, but I only found myself using them in puzzles. While stores and workbenches make their return you have to hunt-down schematics of weapons and armor before you can buy them, so always keep an eye out.Also, with the gameplay taking place on a space station we see some pretty varied level designs and some great action set-pieces (a particularly memorable one early on on a train). The graphics in these levels, as with the gameplay carry a polish that we rarely see in games today (with zero slowdown!). I doubt there will be a patch for this game anytime soon as there doesn't need to be one.As I mentioned in my opening Dead Space 2 like Dead Space 1 is a terrific action game, but doesn't quite live up to the survival-horror genre it's going for, mainly in that these games really aren't that scary. While there's definitely a sense of unease in the game filled with some moments that might make you jump (along with some disturbing hallucinations) it's never what I'd actually call SCARY. While I died plenty of times I never once was afraid to press on, in fact I even found myself chasing monsters into unlit hallways and secluded rooms.While the horror elements of Dead Space 2 fail to live up to the scares it promised the gameplay elements and polished graphics make it a terrific 3rd-person action game! It's a good twelve hours of gameplay (spread across two discs) and I was more than happy to start another play through unlocking better armor and weapons. Dead Space 2 is a must-play for any Dead Space fan and anyone looking for a great action-experience!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001NIP3EG","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"Fun, exciting, beautiful, but a few too many flaws.","reviewText":"The first BIOSHOCK was a masterpiece; I'm not sure I've ever used that term to describe a video game before, but there you have it.  Obviously, it was an impossible game to top, and so you have to go into BIOSHOCK 2 with your expectations somewhat lowered.  That said, the storyline here is solid, if not as unique and engrossing as the original: you are a Big Daddy, searching for the girl (Eleanor) you were assigned to protect.  Only problem is, ten years ago, you were supposedly killed; now that you've come to, your sanity (in fact, your life) depends on finding Eleanor and rescuing her from her actual mother, who has taken over rapture in Andrew Ryan's absence.The graphics are amazing (especially the corrosion effect that happens later on, as well as the flooding and out-door scenes), and the game-play is quite fun.  So why only the four stars?  Well, the game has a few glitches.  Bodies and loot disappear quite frequently; this is something I've always despised about video games, but I understand its necessity.  However, in the BIOSHOCK universe, you need bodies in order to survive.  So the fact that they disappear is, suffice it to say, disappointing.  Then there is the annoying soundtrack; whereas the first BIOSHOCK used music and sound to great effect, the second is filled with your typical escalating \"terror\" soundtrack (which often occurs even when you aren't under attack; it gets quite confusing).  There's also the repetition of landscapes, and the obvious consistency errors from the first game: your Little Sister refers to you as \"father\" instead of \"Mr. B,\" and quite frankly, the Big Daddies in the first game (and this one) are far harder to kill than you are.  Another error, one that's relatively minor but comes into play often, is the slowness of response: when you switch weapons or plasmids, there's a delay before you can use them that I don't remember from the first game.  This delay is also evident in the menus and vending machines.  And again, thanks to the PS3 controller, you'll often end up ducking when you don't want to; they really need to reconfigure the controls for their games.There are a few saving graces, however, which make this game a must-play.  We get even more moral choices: not only do you decide between sparing and harvesting the Little Sisters, but you also get to choose if certain villainous figures live or die.  Then there's the fun of wielding a weapon and a plasmid at the same time.  Plus, we've got a few new plasmids (plus a couple old standbys), and the new weapons are rather exciting: the hack gun comes in handy, and the spear gun is one of the more brutal video game weapons I've seen.  Plus, there are the Big Sisters, which are indeed quite hard to kill (think a Big Daddy, but fast and agile; they can--and will--climb walls and break windows to kill you).  There's plenty of loot to be had (again, when it doesn't disappear on you), and plenty of extra rooms and annals to check out as you explore.  The gist is, BIOSHOCK 2 isn't as good as the first game, but we knew that going into it; however, it's not as good a game as it should be on its own.  It's still worth your time, however, especially if you're a fan of the first.  I'd definitely play the first BIOSHOCK before this one, for all you newbies out there.  BIOSHOCK 2 is like an unnecessary addition: yeah, it's fun and worthwhile, but only if you've played the first game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0044S8DA8","description":"","reviewerName":"Hamster Army","summary":"One of the best Action RPG's I've Ever Played, Period","reviewText":"I was highly encouraged to hear the original Lead Designer of Morrowind/Oblivion, along with McFarlane and other talented designers and developers were being brought together with money from one of pro baseball's greatest pitchers of all-time (and avid gamer and Everquest fan) to create a new RPG game.After we finally were able to play it a couple of years later, after a somewhat disappointing (and apparently forced) demo release, I am hooked.The combat is epic, full of \"wow\" moments and when you pull-off the timely combo or hit a boss with the right ability/spell at just the right time, you realize how fun and rewarding it can be to progress through the ranks and storyline of Amalur's lore and benefit from its hidden riches.Because the world and lore are new, and born from a respected writer in Salvatore, I find myself paying much more attention to dialogue and back story information, no matter how inane at times, than I would say, Skyrim or even any Blizzard game at this point, or MMO (a genre which I have given up for the last few years).The pacing is excellent, the dialogue is never cumbersome or too full of mundane fantasy muck, the dungeons are of a perfect length, unlike say, Skyrim, where you might spend 1.5 hours slaving through a Dwarven ruin, which gets old after the 1st time you complete one frankly.  And there are diverse regions on the map that keep you gawking at the amount of animated detail and color, over-exaggerated landscapes and creatures, at times over-sized enemies that strike fear into you time and time again, and quests that force you to make real choices (to kill? to turn-in this person? to help them instead? etc..,).Like any video game it's not perfect by any means, the oft-mentioned limited FOV (or camera view/angle that's fixed) is a serious design flaw baked into the game apparently, and while tolerable, is a major gripe for almost everyone who plays it.  The lack of better auto-targeting in combat outside of bows can be a tad frustrating at times, the monetary system is out of whack (when will this ever be resolved in RPG's people?), and the game can lack some real challenge in combat on normal mode (yet can be frustratingly difficult if you're say, a mage, and have to face a Troll boss, who his so resistant to elemental/magic damage - yet there's no real option within the abilities to use physical damage outside of a summoned character - that is difficult to control).You will find these gripes to be minor, as major as they may or may not sound, as the game flows, plays and is presented beautifully, is highly stable and bug-free, provides hours and hours of fun and escapism, and is deep enough to keep RPG fans happy.Undoubtedly the plan is to develop the world into either an MMO or franchise, and it will be very interesting to see how this particular single player game is added onto over the course of the next year or two in particular.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-12-2012"}

For kids, perhaps it's the idea of collecting and battling cool creatures, teaching them killer attacks, and watching opponents' HP bars drop to zero. For teens and adults, it could be the deep but approachable battle system or nowadays the pure nostalgia of it all. Whatever it is that draws people young and old into Pokemon obviously works, but even though Red and Blue got the series off to a great start, Silver and Gold is where the series truly lifted off. Tons of new monsters, moves, and features made the GS generation the best, and to this day it lives on as a great handheld RPG.Pokemon Silver starts off as all other Pokemon games do. A studious Pokemon professor sends a local teenager on a journey throughout the land of Jhoto to become a Pokemon master, filling up the Pokedex (Pokemon dictionary) with information about each of the 250+ known creatures. This quest becomes optional, however, as this young trainer decides to take on the Pokemon League challenge, facing off against the 8 toughest trainers in Jhoto to reach the Elite Four and become the League Champion. Of course our young hero crosses tracks with a rather evil gang of Pokemon abusers called Team Rocket several times along the way and also fights to put an end to their bad intentions. Pokemon is rarely strong in plot, and Silver is no different, but as the case often is with video games, the story is only there to provide a setting for the game to take place in. It all works, even if it's nothing special.So what carries Pokemon Silver is not its story, but its deep but approachable battle system. It's as simple as one Pokemon battling another until one runs out of HP, but there is so much that goes into this battle system to make it deep and strategic. There are many different types of Pokemon and each available move also takes on a particular type, so figuring out strengths and weaknesses is key. With just over 250 different Pokemon and even more various attacks, the game offers many different approaches to battles. It isn't very hard if one simply wants to teach their creatures the most powerful attacks and plow through everything in sight, and to be honest that strategy is usually the best one. However there are also loads of moves that will affect an opponent's status, raise stats such as Attack or Speed, and more. Each Pokemon has a full set of stats and up to four moves that all play a part in the myriads of equations that go into every battle; when looked at objectively it's easy to see that Pokemon's battle system is quite deep.Outside of battle there are few genuine gameplay attractions other than wandering about seeking out more Pokemon to capture and train, but there are so many opportunities to battle that the game rarely becomes stale. It's hard to get bored with the game because there is always something to do, whether it's looking for new Pokemon or entering a bug catching contest, and most, if not all, of the game's side tasks involve plenty of battles.What really makes Silver so great, though, is not only its battles but also its plentiful additions to the game's structure. It's leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors for several reasons, the most noticeable of which is that the game keeps real time and translates it to the game's world. So yes, it actually gets dark at night in the game itself, but as a GameBoy game the visual change doesn't make a difference so much as how the game's world simply comes alive. It feels so much more real when you are forced to actually play the game at night to catch certain Pokemon or wait until a particular day of the week for a certain event to be available. It might sound annoying, and it can be at times, but the fact is that the feature gives the game an unexpected touch of reality, and the game's atmosphere and fun factor benefits from that in tremendous ways.Silver also still has one huge advantage over all Pokemon titles before or since, and that is the inclusion of the 8 Kanto gyms from Red and Blue. So not only are there 8 gyms in the new land of Jhoto to beat and a new Elite Four to fight: after the Champion has been defeated, players are given the opportunity to travel to Kanto and fight all 8 gym leaders from the first game. This nearly doubles the game's baseline length and connects the game to its predecessor, which is simply great. Although there isn't as much to do in Kanto as in Jhoto, it's still a worthwhile extension of the game as a whole.But Pokemon Silver isn't perfect, there are still a few rough spots here and there. One such issue is that HM moves (moves that are used both inside and outside of battle) still can't be forgotten when trying to learn new attacks. Though there is now a move deleter who alleviates part of the problem, it is still annoying when I want to teach a Pokemon a new move but can't make it forget an HM. And though I don't consider this a huge problem, the game eventually is lacking in higher leveled Pokemon to train against. Once a player's creatures are at level 70 or higher, even the Elite Four becomes too easy and short on experience points.Pokemon has taken far too many hours of my life from me, and the game that is the greatest culprit of that is most definitely Silver. It is by far the most significant improvement of any Pokemon game yet as it took the formula of the original game and added a few substantial extra features to the game's world and very essence of what it is. Pokemon Silver is a fantastic game and an excellent RPG that's easily recommendable to anyone looking for a lengthy and deep RPG.Positive:+ Deep battle system is as engaging as before+ Over 250 monsters to collect, not too many or too few+ Real time really brings the game to life+ 16 gyms make the game almost twice as longNegative:- HM moves are still a pain9/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-13-2010"}

That's not a lot of power, compared  to a next-generation system like theSega  Dreamcast; but, when you factor in its very low price and the enormous  library of games that are available (more than 1,000 that are spread across  every genre imaginable), one can see easily why it's as good a deal as ever.

That sums it up.","reviewText":"A lot of people have been complaining about how the sony PS1 isn't all that impressive.  I have to dissagree all the way.  i think that a PS1 totally rocks.  And although the Nintendo 64, (I own one) Has 64 bits, that doesn't mean that it's better than PS1.  The sony playstation one has the type of graphics which makes every single game look different...if you look at the Final Fantasy trilogy and plus Dino Crisis one and two, you will notice that both games have a complete different set of graphics, and they both look like they're both on two different platforms, yet they're not!Now, look at Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, and Podracing, all that of which are on the N64.  All of these games are good and fun to play, yet the graphics have the same type of texture to them.  They have the same look, same feel.When you buy a Sony Playstation, however, you will undoubtedly notice the complete differences between each game.  At times, and I swear that this is true, I think the Playstation has better graphics than an N64.  Just pop in the opening scene to Heart of Darkness, or the sequences on Dino crisis, and you will know what I'm talking about.I'm not saying that the N64 is bad.  I enjoy the N64, especially with games like Zelda and Mario.  But I do believe that the Playstation is way better, due to the fact that the games are way cheaper and just as entertaining, and although the 64 has more bit graphics, as soon as you buy a playstation, you'll hardly notice the differents.And there's one thing that the Playstation one has that all these \"Advanced\" Consoles don't have at all: Great gameplay.  Most of these advanced consoles with great graphics ONLY have great graphics.  Sometimes the gameplay stinks.Plus, the playstation just lowered the price.  If you're into good games and want an entertaining system with excellent graphics, superb gameplay, and a wonderful game library for cheap yet it still has the qualities that an N64 has, then get the playstation.

To the point where it had bred fanboys and haters alike. It's almost to the point where you can't just say the game is good. You either love it or hate it. I don't love Halo, but I don't hate it either. For what it's worth it's a pretty good game. Obviously if you didn't think much of the first two games, however, it's unrealistic to expect you'll think highly of the third one. Simply put, if you don't like Halo, don't expect the third game in the series to turn you into a fan.The story is told through cutscenes that are well acted with their voice talents. If you've been interested in the story since the beginning, chances are you'll like it and be satisfied. The game doesn't drown you out in story sequences either. For those who just want to get to the gameplay, you've got it. But there is a fair amount of story here as well.In terms of gameplay, however, Halo 3 doesn't really do much to distinguish itself from Halo 2. Most (if not all) the mechanics to the gameplay are pretty much the same. There are some new weapons thrown in there, but for the most part, a lot of your arsenal comes from the first two games. There's very little that separates the third installment from the first two. This can either be a good or a bad thing. Good because you'll instantly be able to familiarize yourself with the game. It's like seeing an old friend again. Yet because of this, the game is no challenge at all for the veteran Halo gamer. Likewise, those expecting Halo 3 to go above and beyond will find it doesn't. Whether or not the game being too much like Halo 2 is a problem or not is up to the individual gamer.In addition to that, the campaign is quite short. Most likely you'll be able to finish it in one or two days without fail. To compensate, however, the game does have different difficulty levels and there are plenty of achievements to get. There are also skulls hidden in some of the missions which can alter gameplay and make the game a bit more difficult. So it may be short, but there is replay for anyone who wants to master the game. There's also co-op with up to four players. You can actually do co-op with some friends online.Halo has always been well known for its multi-player. Particularly online. Again, like Halo 2, it doesn't do a whole lot of things differently. There are a couple of new modes, but much like the gameplay, there's just not enough new here. However, there is a Forge system that allows you to customize maps by placing things like weapons and such in different places. You can even share these creations with your friends online.  Multiplayer isn't everything its cracked up to be, though.  While it can be fun, it only really takes off if you decide to get on XBOX Live or System Link with a bunch of friends.  Offline it's only you vs. your friends and even when it's four of you it's rather unexciting in some of these maps.  You can't set up AI competitors either.  So unless you go online Multiplayer can feel quite empty.The game looks good. By far one of the prettier games on the console. There certainly are better looking games on the 360, but this one is still a nice piece of eye candy. It runs smoothly as well at a steady framerate. There are a couple of moments of clipping but it's not enough to hinder gameplay and some will not notice these things. The game's soundtrack is also a good one. Many tunes are repeated from the previous games, but what's new is also good.Halo 3 is a good game overall. If you were impressed with the first two games, you'll probably be impressed here. It doesn't do enough to distinguish itself from the previous games but it's still a good game overall. As I noted before, if you didn't like Halo before, do not expect the third game to make a fan out of you.Pros:+Familiar gameplay+A lot of online multiplayer modes+Good graphics and music+Emphasis on gameplay and story+You can customize maps+There's some replay value hereCons:-The campaign mode is quite short-In terms of gameplay and multiplayer the game does not do a lot to distinguish itself from the previous games and there isn't enough new stuff thrown in either","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2007"}

But the other aspects of the game were very enjoyable.I think maximum enjoyment of this game would come if you went in expecting a Call of Duty or Battlefield 3 esque clone, and instead was exposed to this take.This is the best story-driven game I've ever played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2012"}

I have read alot of reviews and felt like this was going to be one of those programmer made games just to show how smart they are at making a game. Boy I was wrong! Yes the game is hard, Yes when you die you are in soul form and yes when you die you have to do it all over again. This was what I was faced with when I first started this game. Now I have to admit that there are lenghty reviews about this game maybe from people trying to boost this game and then there are reviews about this game that rate it in the toilet. All I'm going to say is that this game woke something up inside of me that seemed to be asleep a long time since the laungh of the next-gen systems and that is the feel of finally beating a level and a boss in one fell swoop without dying once. Now I have to admit that this took sometime to do and I mean sometime to do more like 4-5 hours but during this time I had fun doing it. Now most who played this game will say that there is something wrong with me if I can play this game for the time I did and not lose my mind. I did lose my mind cause the game was just that frustrating at times and with no plan of attack at times left me dead more then alive. But this game is what you get when you put OLD school gaming with NEXT-GEN graphics and a good storyline.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2009"}

You'll love this.","reviewText":"It's been a long time since I've encountered a demanding game like Demon's Souls, a fantasy action-RPG by From Software.  It seems an increasing number of games are shying away from engaging the player through challenge, but the seemingly ruthless and demanding challenge of Demon's Souls is like a breath of fresh air....or perhaps a cold bucket of water waking your slumbering skills from hibernation.The story of Demon's Souls is unremarkable.  Demons have destroyed the kingdom of Boletaria, and you must rid the land of the invaders.  How you go about that is up to you, thanks to wonderfully flexible combat, characterization, and game structure.  Graphics are good but not outstanding, relying on art direction and mood to create a compelling environment....and it is compelling indeed.  Demon's Souls is dark, gloomy, oppressive, and each world has its own set of unique enemies and dangers, and each world feels strangely organic.  The game's technology might not have the majesty of From Software's two Otogi games on the first Xbox, but similarly, Demon's Souls is full of subtle, remarkable audio and visual detail.It must be stated that Demon's Souls is not for the impatient gamer.  Button mashing will get you killed quickly during the tutorial; it's actually impossible to survive the tutorial!  The game causes you to think about each and every combat situation, but gives you plenty of tools to work with.  Do I have enough room to swing my weapon?  Am I in danger of falling off a ledge?  What type of weapon or spell is best suited for a particular enemy?  The player becomes increasingly engaged as Demon's Souls unfolds, reminding me a lot of the complexity of my much-beloved Vagrant Story on the PS1.The RPG system of Demon's Souls is quite reminiscent of Vagrant Story's, allowing players to increase stats and equipment as they like, without following a set path.  You must choose a particular class to begin, but you can then develop however you like.  It is entirely possible to start as a barbarian and become a mage, or choose to spread your stats equally.  The path you choose will, however, have a drastic effect on how the game is played.Much has been made of the difficulty of Demon's Souls.  However, it is not as unforgiving as many have stated.  Combat is demanding, but the player must remember that any enemy in the game is deadly and must be approached with caution.  Despite proceeding with care, you will still die, especially when you are adapting to the game's unique feel and circumstances.  Dying sends you back to the beginning of the level and enemies respawn, yes, but you get to keep all the items you discover, and many levels contain shortcuts that can reduce retracing your steps.If you have the time, are ready to embrace a challenge, and are prepared for slow but constant progress, look no further.  And if you enjoyed either Otogi game or Vagrant Story, Demon's Souls is the unofficial sequel.  I've just touched on the features and secrets the game contains.  Those who give Demon's Souls a chance may just discover one of the most compelling and rewarding games in the current console cycle.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-06-2009"}

Can't stop thinking about how I feel about the last 3 times I pulled the trigger. I mean omg I am seriously questioning what I have done in that game as if I did something crazy in real life or something. this game=masterpiece. ****end spoiler alert**Sitting here at work rubbing my eyes and groaning about being so tired. And The Last of Us is to blame, entirely. Not sure why people say the game is short.....? Granted I take the time to explore every nook and crannie (do people still say 'nook and crannie'? lol). I do this because I like to put myself into the game as much as possible, acting it out as if I am doing what I would do if I were really there. And believe me in a post-apoc world like this I would be scavenging every drawer and corner trying to find supplies. This just makes it all the more realistic.Anyway, as I was 'saying', I'm only at 72% of the game according to the save file stat and I'm 22 hours in. First half of that was on hard, which was doable for me but I'm a very busy guy with a busy career and even busier juggling wife and 2 boys. So my game time is not a whole lot. I was dying to get through the story so I flipped it to easy. After beating it I'll turn it back to hard and have another run-through with listen-mode turned off. If I don't get sucked into the online mode first which is very possible.I am absolutely dying to know the ending of this game.....it's all I can think about right now. This coming weekend I'm gonna have as much of a TLOU marathon as I can and beat this sucker.This game is not for everyone, you'll either love it or just think 'meh'. Honestly I love it but I do wish it were a bit different. If they would turn this world into a completely open, skyrim size/style game I'd probably sell my kids on the black market and play play play. Kidding of course.I initially said I would let my older boy play this game, as I let him play CoD and other games with some violence. I am glad I held off and checked out the game first, it is seriously violent at times. This is the first game I have sheltered him from due to the violence content. He doesn't get to play anything with sexual content or adult themed games like GTA or Saints Row, but this one has Joel grabbing the back of people's heads and absolutely smashing their face into stuff....have to draw the line somewhere.bottom line, awesome game...wish the world was a bit more interactive but there's nothing that detracts from this game at all....not even the looooong load times. Switching weapons is a slight pain though when you have 6 different short guns and almost as many longs.I've got a rockstar to drink now to get me through the day....tonight, I stab clickers in the temple with a hand-crafted shiv.

{"product_name":"B002I094AC","description":"","reviewerName":"JoshJosh","summary":"a great game today","reviewText":"I am writing this from the perspective of someone who never played StarFox 64 back in the day (though I did enjoy the original on Super Nintendo). In fact, one reason why I wanted this game was because I've never played 64. So here's the scoop:You play as Star Fox, with 3 other animal dudes on your team (a rabbit, a frog, and a falcon). Each mission is on a different planet, and tasks you with flying through, shooting enemies, and taking out bosses. There are actually two types of missions: one is a straightforward linear level with enemies and obstacles flying into your field of view. The other is a wide-open map  that features full 3D movement and is closer to games like Ace Combat than StarFox.The controls are simple but good. You have a basic laser, as well as a limited number of bombs. You can brake or boost. The game is fast-paced and smooth (I am pretty sure it is 60fps), and the controls are responsive. There is optional gyro control, which works well, but I prefer the circle pad.Nintendo has upgraded the graphics nicely here. The textures are sharp and the effects are extremely good. Snow, water, and lava are all shaded and pop with color. There's none of the dull N64 work you might be expecting. It's a more substantial upgrade than Ocarina of Time. The 3D effects also look great.The core of the game is, then, a basic but well-executed arcade-style flying game game. It's the sort of thing we used to get all the time, but rarely do nowadays. What is unique about this game is the structure. You start on the planet Corneria, and need to progress to the planet Venom. Along the way there are 15 planets, but you only need to go through 7 of them. Your path is dependent on actions which happen on the planet. For example, on Corneria, Falco is in trouble. If you help him out, you go one way. If you don't, you go another way. This gives the game a ton of replayability. You can mess around and see the different paths. Each map is very different and offers unique challenges. Though one play through is fairly short, Star Fox 64 is not the sort of game designed for one play through.Also helping the replayability is a score attack mode and the ability to earn medals based on skill. This game plays well enough for a score attack mode to work, and the combination of it and the replayable campaign means that there is plenty here for anyone who gets into it.The combination of sharp mechanics, great level design, and charm (the characters are goofy and have lots to say) make this a keeper in my opinion. In fact, it just might be the 3DS' best game yet. I know the system has received its share of criticism for the game library, and I guess a port of a fourteen year old game doesn't technically address the problem. But for anyone who has not yet played StarFox 64, it is absolutely a gem of a game and worth checking out immediately.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2011"}

The game's centerpiece story mode stars you as an unknown skater who gets the chance to live the scrub-to-am-to-pro dream. It's a classic tale of opportunities, power, and betrayal among friends-just like Julius Caesar or Showgirls. Your personal quest takes you from New Jersey to various spots around the globe, where you'll be meet pros like Hawk and Steve Burnquist while doing burly tricks...and much more (no spoilers here). Some of the missions are a little hokey, and while the driving sequences do break things up a bit, they feel a little forced-but the satisfying story mode is a big improvement on THPS's structure. The story ramps up the difficulty gradually, so you build skills as you go, but there are now four difficulty levels, making THUG totally accessible to newbies.When you finish the story, you can create almost everything yourself-skater, deck, tricks, levels, even level goals. PS2 owners get two major perks: They can map their own photo directly onto a player's face (very easy, very cool), and they can trade all of the above while skating online. The control and gameplay feel as tight as ever; old vets can drop in with ease. The new mechanics this time are wallpushes as well as getting off the board, running on foot, and climbing ledges. Jumping off the board (and keeping a combo going) expands your trick lines immensely, but it's just tricky enough to get on your nerves. It's easier on the PS2 than on the Xbox (mapped to the Black button), but it ultimately feels like one priority too many. Graphically, the game's no slouch; The Xbox version looks a hair prettier than the PS2, but the levels are huge and richly detailed on both systems, and linking animations are noticeably improved. Expressive voice acting and an enormous 75-song soundtrack featuring NOFX, Jurassic 5, and Jane's Addiction (the Xbox also supports custom tunes) make this the best audio experience in the series. The PS2's online elements give it an edge, but skate fans on any platform-including those who have strayed from the franchise in recent years-should buy Underground. The new name signals a new experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2003"}

They redid the stealth action game.  Assassin's Creed combines Splinter Cell and Prince of Persia to create one of the most amazing action games I have ever played.  Most of the technology in this game is top-notch.  As a rock climber myself, the climbing in this game hits a sweet spot for me.  It's pretty impressive how realistically they implemented it.  It's definitely one of the best parts of this game.The combat has been criticized as being an endless string of counters.  Well you can make it that way if you want -- waiting around to counter -- or you can make it interesting and actually go after guys.  Either way, I find it to be fun, original combat system that adds greatly to the game.Another new feature that is very Prince of Persia-esque is the \"free-run\" system.  Basically, Altair can run over any obstacle.  It's so fluid and easy to do that the issue isn't a matter of control.  It's a matter of which way are you going to go, and how hard do you want it to be to get there.  It's very fun.Assassin's Creed replaces \"stealth\" with \"blend\".  You hide in the open within the crowd rather than sneaking around in the shadows.  It's fun and realistic, and quite impressive.The story is interesting, but will certainly have it's share of critics.The enemy AI so far is a mixed bag.

But there are no guarantees in deep space. Pandora, one of these distant planets, was reported to be rich in untapped mineral wealth, and so drew many hoping to get rich quick, but in the end little was found beyond the scattered ruins of a past alien civilization. With nothing to gain, any who could soon abandoned Pandora, leaving those who remained to deal with the lawlessness of a world gone bust, and the mystery of the long-dead alien civilization. But as chaotic as these times were, there were worse days yet to come. After several years the planet's huge orbit slowly brought it near to its sun and once unknown and horrifying creatures sprang from their long hibernation to terrify the stranded colonists. The only hope of the colonists seems to be a vault discovered in the side of a mountainside, rumored to contain alien technology and secrets about Pandora. Will this discovery be the colonist's salvation or their end? Discover their fate inBorderlands.GameplayAs in a traditional RPG,Borderlandsis built around the continual leveling of characters as they delve into quests.

Borderlands is really just a Fallout knockoff with a strong Halo like feel.  To me games like Call of Duty are too firmly planted on rails not allowing for much diverse gameplay and Halo was just a dragging grind with no major single player reward.  Borderlands was fine for a few hours but got stale real fast and suffers from some major flaws.  Maybe Borderlands 2 will improve on the formula but I will be hesitant to jump in.Right off the bat I started as a Soldier to get into the flow of the game and then maybe attempt the other classes later on.  In my very first encounter with enemies I was immediately concerned with how grossly underpowered my weapons were and how difficult it was to kill basic enemies.  I chalked this up to the RPG elements and figured with leveling the game would even out.  This never truly happened in my experience and as such I found the game to be just an arduous and often frustrating experience.There are several major flaws to this game with me.1.  The aiming interface and mechanics are clunky on the Xbox.Right off the bat I regretted grabbing this title out of the bargain bin for the Xbox and instead should have grabbed the PC version.  The default settings are slow and cumbersome.  Upping the controller sensitivity was imperative to me and while it helps the actual effectiveness of aiming was never very consistent.  Even with Aim assist on it's a very frustrating experience.  Your crosshairs jump all over never allowing fine tuning to aim and in major battles you will waste a ton of ammo firing all around enemies meanwhile AI aim is spot on.  Some weapons are better than other but the whole process was very inconsistent and because of its cumbersome nature you can never truly excel at it.  Worse there is no consistency to your shots even when you are on target.  For instance you can have your cursor dead on an enemy standing still, hit one shot, and miss completely the next.  This was most apparent with shotguns.  I would have a Psycho bearing down on me litterally feet away and blast him once for a Crit then the next shot point blank would completely miss.  This kind of erratic behavior was common for me.  Some shots would produce big damage while the next well placed shot would do next to nothing.  The emphasis on criticals was even more annoying because it was so hard to aim well enough to get them.  Add in that enemy mobs would move in the most erratic ways.  They would straff and charge around, often at ridiculous speeds, and with no clear motivation.  Enemy AI was also incredibly intelligent and could spot you from a mile away and always had perfect AIM.  The most pathetic thing I saw was the axe throwing mobs could heave an ax with spot on accuracy from a mile away and even score hits lobbing them over huge boulders and buildings, meanwhile perfectly aimed sniper shots would collide with invisible objects and poor clipping.All in all I felt the need for dead on accuracy was not balanced with the shoddy mechanics of the game.  Enemies are really hard in this game regardless of level so the need for a fluent and accurate aiming system was paramount and it doesn't exist here.  Instead you burn tons of ammo and spend hours cursing the screen.2.  The leveling system is garbage.The nature of an RPG is that a player can build the character to suit their play style and ultimately make the game easier for them as time goes on.  This is normally achieved by building skills or attributes which makes you stronger.  Borderlands though has a pretty shoddy leveling system.  First of all it takes forever to level up.  It requires tons of kills and quest completions to gain even a single level.  Second of all you don't really even have attributes.  Instead you have a WOW inspired talent tree that allows meager % bonuses to certain skills.  So yeah you can make your shield regen faster or improve your core health some but most of the talents are geared towards your turret which is an item rarely employed.Basically the bonuses just weren't good enough to make a significant improvement in the character.  Yeah you got some attribute bonuses but in the end the key to powering up was finding better guns.  Better guns make all the difference in this game but even this is a frustrating experience because you will spend hours debating which guns to keep but then enter combat and find even your best weapons are still horribly underpowered.  I just couldn't help but feel that I was always inferior in strength to even the most basic mobs I was fighting.  I even spent hours at one point power leveling to my early 20's to the point I wasn't even earning XP for many kills in quests and the game was still insanely challenging.  It is made apparent early on that your character will always be at a disadvantage because the games difficulty is scaled very high and there is no real way to level it out except to hone your skills rather than building a better character.3.  The game punishes you heavily for failure.Unlike most modern FPS games there is no health regen, at least not right away.  Instead you need to heal via health packs and rely on your shield to protect you.  In my experience with the game this was a major pain in the neck.  Your inventory is insanely limited so you really can only carry a couple of health packs and they are all heal over time deals anyway.  If the shields were stronger this would help but they aren't.  At level 22 I found a lvl 4 mob could deplete my 179 point shield very quickly.  This means that you are going to take health damage a lot and enemies rarely dropped health packs.  So the emphasis was on finding shields with health regen powers.  Easy enough early on but the speed of these regens was painfully slow.  This meant tons of time spent just standing around waiting after battles while my health slowly climbed back up.  Not very engaging honestly.  Ultimately the game is pushing you to use cover and not get hit but if you go back to the cumbersome aiming controls (for the console anyway) then you will realize the drag this will be.The next way the game punishes you is by dread awful spawn mechanisms.  This game is very much like WoW and enemies exist in areas as a pack.  Clear that area out and the exact configuration of enemies will return.  The downside is they return almost immediately after you leave.  Thats fine enough in the world map but in dungeons its an absolute pain.  It basically kills you if you need to backtrack or wish to run back and sell items.  It also kills your ammo supplies.  Naturally any exposed ammo you find early on in dungeons but aren't picked up will disappear but the enemies return quickly.  Further adding to the annoyance is that when you kill the boss you have to fight your way back out to complete it.  Its a major time suck and sometimes that grind back out will kill you faster than the boss.The last insulting aspect is that dying is severely punished.  Gathering cash is a big grind in Borderlands.  There are crates and containers everywhere holding small amounts of cash.  Running around for an hour you can pick up a couple grand maybe.  In dungeons too these things exist and it is neccessary to open them all even though for the first half of the game I never spent much in stores on anything other than ammo capacity upgrades.  The hook is though that it can take you an hour to gather a couple thousand bucks but if you die the game forces you to pay a respawn fee.  Early on the fee is a couple hundred but after a few deaths the fee was upwards of 8-9k.  In other words you could spend 3 hours exploring a dungeon only to mess up and die and all of that cash you gathered is gone and then some.  This just adds to the time suck and makes the games challenging aspect even all the more frustrating.4.  The game really kin of rams the need for co-op down your throat.  I tend to play most of my games alone.  I'm just not much of a co-op gamer but Borderlands really wants you to go it with friends.  The difficulty of the game alone is high and as such seems heavily tailored for multiple players.  There are just so many aspects that are grueling alone and one can easily see the benefit of having a friend join you.  Certain boss battles are major grinds or neigh impossible without support.  Heck even as I type this I have some bandits in a vehicle just driving circles around me and I'm burning loads of rockets trying to kill it.In the end I think Borderlands is a playable game but it wears you out about halfway through.  It's just not a strong enough title to really keep me interested because the difficulty is just so high and the game doesn't reward you for sticking it out.  A million and one guns doesn't mean much to me when 99.9% of them are garbage and the leveling system doesn't really improve my character any.  If I actually finish this game it will be a miracle because I am just so bored of it.  I'll also be very wary of Borderlands 2 which releases in a a few weeks.My advice is that if you need to play this now budget title that it would be best to grab it on PC and make sure you are gonna play with friends as the single player just has too much frustration in it to be considered an all around fun title.  I cannot fathom why this game was rated so highly by the gamer mags.  It's just a major frustrating time suck.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Mr.Chunky Monkey","summary":"Great Game, Well Made Entry In The Series","reviewText":"I've played this game a number of hours now and I can honestly say this is a pretty awesome Resident Evil game. The types of areas including dark alleys, halls, and mysterious fortresses are here.Whether it is good or bad the game seems to be more action oriented, although it depends what difficulty you play it on. I started off with the hardest difficulty to get a feel what it is like. This is the mode where the game becomes truly \"survival horror\" as the zombies and monsters are more numerous and require more bullets. I found myself quickly scrambling for hiding areas and vantage points when surrounded by the enemy. Gets adrenaline pumping like before though of course not how it was with the good old RE1 or RE2. But it is not the game's fault. I grew up as a gamer and became desensitized to much horror and violence in games so we cannot really expect same old style thrills.The game has a decent coop mode for playing with friends and that can really help with high difficulty settings because when your partner is AI you pretty much play on your own because they only cause damage to zombies sometimes, and when they do, it is lower damage than yours. Still my CPU partner managed to finish some zombies.The one thing about this game that I'd have changed is I would have first made it more paced like RE5, or 3DS RE Revelations. Those games have your character run slower than here. In this one your character can run and sprint faster than you'd like sometimes when there may be zombies just around the corner, and there are many moments like this. Also I would have adjusted the game to maybe have less detailed in graphics but to be more stable as far as frame rate. For example if you played Resident Evil 5 and then Resident Evil 6 you'd have noticed RE5 is smoother, and RE6 is slightly less smooth. Feels like 30 or 32 frames in RE5 and 30-27 frames here.Also pretty cool feature are random encounters with NPCs which are mostly there to create drama and have little actual effect on you. The scenes are frequently cheesy and over acted, but that is how it was with RE games before. Usually they are not plot related but rather observations by main charactersSo overall I think Resident Evil 6 deserves about 4 out of 5 stars because you get pretty consistent and relevant gameplay that is easy to be engrossed in and enjoy. Sometimes you'll be surprised by quick time events (which you simply love or hate), and more darkness throughout the game. Unusual settings where RE franchise didn't go before. Old familiar characters to be played as. Stats and skills to be gained to have your skills upgraded.Overall it is very nice with some fine running not done well. I recommend this as a BUY. I have an important piece of advice for you if you are undecided whether to get Resident Evil 6, if you are looking for honest opinions look for those reviews with \"amazon verified purchase\" label next to them. Many of the 1 star reviews are left by trolls who have a vendetta against publisher Capcom and go from site to site leaving zero score reviews.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2012"}

As you can see, you can pick up used versions of this unit for fairly cheap (I got mine for $20).  Microsoft continues to support the players, so even with the latest xbox update, you can rest assured that this unit will still work.  In addition, many of the HD-DVD movies can be found fairly easily for pretty cheap.  Most movies can be found for less than $5, many of them even 2 or 3.  Obviously, most people won't want all of the movies that were released on HD-DVD, but you'll definitely find a few favorites.  I've saved over $170 from buying HD-DVD movies verses Blu Ray.  There are even a select few that have yet to be released on Blu Ray.As far as sound and picture quality goes, they are every bit as good as their Blu Ray counterparts.  Due to the xbox's capibilities, you don't actually get the full audio quality, but the difference is so minimal that you would only know if you had a $1,000 sound system and the two movies side by side.  The picture quality is amazing.  Most titles, you won't even need to find the DVD to compare, you'll know instantly that it's a vast improvement.  Since the drive is an extension to your xbox, most universal remotes will work with the play, pause, skip, etc. functions on the movies.If nothing else, you can consider this an extra drive for your xbox to quickly switch from playing a game to watching a movie.

{"product_name":"B00AXI9WFS","description":"","reviewerName":"Jen \"Geek Girl\"","summary":"Complete unique and fresh experience","reviewText":"I have completely rewritten this review to add more detail as we've uncovered more Infinity goodness!We've been playing for hours upon hours since Sunday's release, so I feel I have a good grasp on most aspects of the game. Forgive me if I tend to compare Infinity to Skylanders as it's somewhat inevitable given that many people are here because of their interest in the former game. If you're interested in my direct comparison, continue on, but keep in mind that despite the similarities, these two games are entirely different.My initial thoughts on the game are how well-made and how deeply complex it is. For anyone who has played Toy Story 3, the play sets will instantly feel familiar. The Toy Box mode from Toy Story 3 is recreated here in almost identical fashion. Missions are located by glowing blue beacons in the sky and marked by a ! over their heads. A waypoint indicator (optional) is back again to guide you to the location of your mission objective. Back as well are all the little collectibles to pick up around every turn. Having spent a lot of time with the Cars play set with my son, it's also very familiar to find that the cars are controlled exactly like they are in Cars 2 (which happens to be the only game that we've ever unlocked every single achievement in!). The turbo meter is back and the controls for driving and racing are almost identical, with a few new additions. The same tricks and stunts can be performed here, and while the races aren't as long or varied as with Cars 2, all the familiarity is awesome for this Cars-loving family. It really feels like a mini Cars 2 game within the bigger game.The game in general is very easy to jump right into. The tutorial is brief and gets you acquainted with the basic controls that apply to all characters. Once you enter a play set, you will be briefly introduced to their special controls as each character set has their own abilities. You start out in the Toy Box, and this will be my first (and probably only) complaint about the game. You are dropped in the Toy Box with very little explanation about how to do anything. It's possible that we missed something as my son was excitedly mashing buttons, but I felt a little lost initially. (EDIT: After going back, there is a tutorial for the Toy Box itself, but I haven't yet been permitted to complete it!) The possibilities are so immense that it's hard to fathom, and the manual says nothing about this. More on that later. Onto the Skylanders comparison!Similarities:- Figures: Clearly the biggest similarity is the collectible figures. Although the need to hot swap characters as is the case with Skylanders, you're probably fine with just a single character until you come across an area or item that can only be accessed by a specific hero. Very similar to elemental gates, though it's usually just a chest unlocked an not a new challenge area. While Disney may have shot themselves in the foot for not pressuring you to have all the figures, it's refreshing to be able to experience the game with just a single favorite and not feeling like you're missing out, or worse, not being able to complete the game because you don't have all the necessary elements. If you are a completionist, however, you will want them all as each character is represented in the game's Hall of Heroes by a grand statue that changes as the character gains levels. If you want to unlock every single item in the game, you'll also need all the characters, but these items aren't essential to gameplay and are for Toy Box and cosmetic use only.That said, you do have to have at least one character from each play set to play in those worlds. This isn't an issue since each of the three worlds that come in the starter pack are also accompanied by three characters, one from each of those worlds. The Cars and Lone Ranger play sets also come with characters from those worlds, so not being able to \"complete\" a given play set should never be an issue. On the other hand, if you want to play multiplayer in any of the play sets, be prepared to have TWO characters from each world. While you can have two of the same (two Lightning McQueen, for example) you MUST have two from that world, or you and your kids will not be able to play together in that world. If you want to play multiplayer in Monsters right off the bat, you will need to pick up Randall or Mike. If you want to play Incredibles in multiplayer, you need Mrs. Incredible, Violet or Dash. I know some think this is \"underhanded\" by Disney, but to me, this really isn't any different than Skylanders forcing you to go out and buy at least five more figures to be able to experience the entire game. You can experience all Infinity has to offer with what you get in the starter pack, but if you want to play multiplayer (and who wouldn't?!) you need to plan on buying three other figures. The great thing about the Infinity figures is that multiple people can share the same figure. More on that in differences!- Leveling and Upgrades: Figures do level up and receive upgrades, though their upgrades are specific to their world. Meaning if Holley Shiftwell receives the Turbo 2 upgrade, it's only persistent in the Cars play set. I started a new save game in the Cars play set to try a few things out, and I no longer had my previous upgrades, but my experience level and money did persist between games. In Toy Box mode, it appears you automatically have all of the general upgrades, regardless of your progression in the play set. Experience here is called Sparks, and is obtained by completing missions, challenges, and also by smashing stuff. Likewise with money.- Objectives: In Infinity, objectives are called missions. Each play set has a long list of tasks to complete, ranging from very simple to quite challenging. There is definitely a lot here to keep the completionist busy for a long time. Where each Skylanders level has a variety of very similar tasks to complete, each of the 5 Infinity worlds has a wide variety of different challenges.- Challenges: Infinity's version of Heroic Challenges and Arena Battles is Challenges. Some are unlocked through story progression and others are purchased with coins. Each challenge has three difficulty levels and you appear to have to complete them in order. For example, completing easy unlocks medium, medium unlocks hard. For each level you complete, you get a \"mark\" on the icon above the challenge entrance, up to three total. The color also changes, which affects how you see them from afar. Uncompleted challenges glow yellow, while completed challenges are red so you can easily see which ones aren't complete and where they are on the map when you're exploring. Challenges range from racing around different tracks to trying to shoot a certain number of targets in a specific amount of time. Some are very simple, and some I've struggled to complete at the hard level. The racing challenges are actually very.. well, challenging!Differences:- Power Discs: This is an all new idea and plays into the fun of the chase as each Power Disc pack has two random discs in it. There already appears to be rare ones as we happened to find two that were a different color and had holographic designs on them rather than a regular picture. The circular variety give activated powers (like invulnerability or increased health) and the hexagonal discs give you things to play with in Toy Box, be it a new theme for your world or a new toy to play with. We've found several different cars, including Mickey's car, Cinderella's carriage and the ride car from the Astro Blasters attraction at the Disney parks. Each one plays familiar music when you ride around in it. We also found Stitch's ray gun which is very fun to chase each other around with! There is no point in having more than one hexagonal disc as using them once unlocks the item permanently, but it may be worth having two of each circle disc so that each player can use the same power up if desired. I've also heard that the 3DS version of the game allows you to \"stack\" two power ups at once, so also something to keep in mind when collecting the discs.- Upgrades: You shouldn't expect all of your upgrades to be about improving your character. While many are, about half are related to improving the world that you're in. For example, the cars get upgrades that increase their speed, towing ability, missiles, etc, but they also receive upgrades that spruce up the town, be it by adding new citizens or a new venue to the town. At the start, only Flo's V8 Cafe and Luigi's Casa Della Tires are present, but through upgrades you can purchase stores for Sarge, Filmore, Ramone, Lizzie, etc. Purchasing these stores also opens up new missions for you to complete, and as a result, new items and upgrades.- Character Swapping: While it was an oversight on my part, I was expecting to be able to play all characters in all play sets, but I was a bit sad to find out that in the play sets, you must play characters from those worlds. Cars can only play in Cars world, pirates in the pirates world, etc. While I've come to enjoy the game despite this, I wish it was open like Skylanders where you could play your favorite character no matter where you are. That said, I do understand why they have this restriction, because certain characters just wouldn't work with the mechanics in other play sets. For example, Lightning McQueen can't ride a horse in the Lone Ranger and Jack Sparrow can't tow cars who've run out of gas back to Flo's. However, in Toy Box mode, anything goes and you can run races with Sully or wield a gun with Mike. Truly with the Toy Box, your imagination (and grasp of the controls) are your only limitations.- Customizable World: You can change the look and feel of any of the buildings in your play sets. This is persistent to your game save, so I visit my son's world, I see how he has decorated Flo's V8 Cafe with pictures of Mater. If he visits mine, he sees an overload of pink and flowers! Customizing is very simple and intuitive and should be very easy for kiddos to pick up on, especially if they've played Toy Story 3. The interface for customizing is almost identical here. You interact with the building by pushing the button displayed on the screen, and it presents a graphical panel of options for customizing various parts of the building. This can be done at anytime and doesn't cost anything, so it's pure fun. You unlock other colors and designs by collecting them around the play set, just by picking them up. There are also countless spots where you can add your own little touches. There may be a post where you can choose to put a sign or wind chimes or whatever else you may have. And the fun part is, that persists through all other parts of the game. If you later race Chick Hicks around town, your wind chimes are there in front of the barn and your Guido Crossing sign is still in front of Luigi's shop. You can also customize the people (or cars!) who live in your world. When you first start out with the Cars play set, all the little citizen cars are just white. You can interact with each one and change them however you like, depending on which items you've found around town (and there are a great number of them). This may include a special hat, a new paint job, or new tires. You can also purchase new citizens altogether from the same menu where you purchase upgrades, which gives you new options for body types of your cars. Even as an adult, it's very fun to watch all our little creations drive around town. My son and I are constantly pointing out the ones that we've customized and complimenting each other on our designs!- Unlockable Items: Each play set is littered with items for you to pick up and collect in little capsules, like the ones you'd see in the quarter machines. Red ones are the more common type, unlocking only one item either for your play set or for the Toy Box. Green ones unlock a whole set of items for Toy Box. Some items are cosmetic, for customizing the citizens of your world or your buildings, some are actually useful items that change how you play. The former is the more common type.- Local Multiplayer: Clearly both games have local multiplayer, but there are many stark differences. In Skylanders, you are more or less bound to each other. You can't go anywhere independently, and that's not necessarily a bad thing for that game. After all, what's the point of beating up bad guys in multiplayer if you're not even together? That said, multiplayer in Infinity is a whole different scenario. You can work together, both directly or indirectly, or you can do your own thing entirely. As a result, multiplayer in Infinity is split screen, which we weren't crazy about at first, but now we absolutely love it. Here's why. If you're working on a mission to put out fires, you can split up and each of you can cover a different area. If you're on a stealth mission, one of you can be the lookout and guide the other from a different location. If you're racing, clearly the race wouldn't be very fun if you were stuck to each other and would kind of defeat the purpose of having a race in the first place. Given that cooperation is entirely possible, it's not required, and here's where Infinity is entirely different from Skylanders. At some point, my kiddo just wanted to drive around and customize everything and create a pile of cars that he towed to Mater's impound lot. While this looked absolutely fun and exciting (!) I wanted to continue on with missions and get more upgrades. While he was happily doing his own thing, I continued on completing missions and finding collectibles by myself. He was swapping out his cars left and right, opening chests and the like, and my game was never interrupted. There's no \"loading\" screen when a character is swapped, so he could change characters and power ups to his heart's content, even access menus while paused, and I was still cruising around. When one of us decided to take up a challenge, the other would be invited and given the opportunity to accept or decline. If one declined, they would be taken out of the game while the other completed the challenge, and then brought back again after the challenge was complete. If one accepts, they go on to complete the challenge together (or compete against each other, depending on the challenge). The ability to not be stuck to each other and be bound to what the other is doing is a really fun twist and makes the game feel much more open and interactive.- Online Multiplayer: I feel this part is somewhat misleading. You can't go online and team up with random people like you would in a game like Castle Crashers or Halo, but you can play online with friends. This isn't very useful if you don't know anyone who plays the game yet, but I'm sure communities will form online and people will add each other that way. I think random teams would have been a fun addition and I'm sad that this wasn't an option. I understand Disney was likely concerned about content being appropriate for the whole family, but since they support the parental settings in Disney Infinity, I don't think this would have been an issue. You could just block certain accounts from user created content and allow others full access. Basically online multiplayer is co-op in Toy Box mode with up to 4 players, including 2 local players. Disney has a few worlds they created available for download, and it remains unclear how you will access worlds created by other users. I've heard that it's possible to upload worlds to Disney that they will then make available to others for download, but I have no idea how this works yet so I can't really comment on it.- Experience: This is probably the single biggest difference between Infinity and Skylanders. Experience (sparks) are not gained by battling endless hordes of monsters. They are earned by completing missions and challenges. This may be off-putting to the biggest fans of Skylanders, but as a serious Skylander fan myself, I still find a lot to enjoy here. I don't really need another Skylanders (neither does my bank account!) but Infinity shines in it's own way. You shouldn't expect to jump into a hack and slash game here. While there is some of that (more in some play sets than others) this game is primarily about completing missions and progressing through the story. While it's entirely possible to replay areas to get more sparks the money, just like with Skylanders, you will basically be replaying story mode from the beginning. So far there is no shortage of missions and they are easy to locate by their glowing beacons that shoot up into the sky. The challenges also provide plenty of sparks and money, if you're successful, of course. Another brilliant addition is that in multiplayer, experience and money are automatically shared equally. No more fighting over who gets the next chest! Thank you, Disney!- Character info is stored locally: Unlike Skylanders where character levels and money are stored only on the figure itself, character info is also stored locally. This means multiple people can share the same figure, yay! This was an ingenious move on Disney's part. Say you're playing Lightning McQueen and he's level 7 and then you go to your friend's house to play. McQueen will show up as a \"guest\" in your friend's game, retaining your level and money. You can continue to play him as a guest and he'll keep progressing. He will retain any experience and money he earned while you were playing as a guest with your friend. However, if your friend doesn't have McQueen, he can take ownership of the figure and the character will start back at level 0 for him. The neat part is, when you take McQueen back to your game, he still has the amount of experience and money he had when YOU last played him. When your friend plays him again on his game (or if he purchases his own McQueen) he will then start from where he left off with the borrowed McQueen. In essence, each figure can retain information for multiple save games. Several family members can use the same figure, and since the character information is also stored locally, each individual can have their own information on that one figure. Another bonus is, if your figure ever stops working, you can just purchase a new one and no information will be lost. Very, very cool.- Length: With the number of hours we've logged so far into the Cars world alone, I think it's safe to say that Disney Infinity has many, many more hours of play than either of the Skylanders games. We had easily completed Skylanders Giants in a week, and that's with most of the stars and achievements unlocked. Granted, not all of our characters were level 15 in that week, but we had played through all the content. So far we've only played in the Cars play set and a teeny tiny bit in Toy Box, and with 4 other worlds to play through and the Toy Box to dig into, it would seem we have weeks of new content to play through.- Toy Box: There's is just too much here in the Toy Box to delve into with this already lengthy review, but suffice it to say, we are always thrilled to go into the Toy Box and try out the things we've unlocked while playing in the play sets. I haven't had a chance to go through the Toy Box tutorial yet, so I really have no idea what I'm doing besides chasing my kiddo around in makeshift races, so I'll add more to this section later. In the meantime, the DisneyInfinity channel on YouTube appears to have numerous tutorial videos. I've watched a few and I'm very excited about the possibilities!To close, there is so much more here than I was expecting. I was honestly a bit hesitant thinking this endeavor by Disney was going to fall short in the face of Skylanders, but we are already hooked on Infinity, pursuing each challenge, objective, mission and upgrade, and having already sunk a good chunk of time into the game with only a single world, and considering we appear to be not even half way through, I think it's safe to assume that as we play through the other four play sets, we will experience many, many more happy hours of play together. There's really no reason NOT to pick up Infinity if you're looking for a good time for the whole family.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FQBPCQ","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"The Legend lives on.","reviewText":"Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess has been dubbed one of the biggest launch titles in history, coming out with the Nintendo Wii on November 19th. The game's appearance on the Nintendo Wii was confirmed by Nintendo president Satoru Iwata at E3 `05, and has since been a target of hype and anticipation like no other. Numerous delays-including the delay of the Gamecube version of the game until December `06-have held Twilight Princess back, but rest assured that Nintendo's flagship Wii title is for real. It's not too bold to say that Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess is the greatest Zelda game of all time, and Ocarina Of Time sits playing second fiddle.Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess takes our hero Link to the land of Hyrule (where else?), where a mysterious and terrifying twilight has taken the land by storm. This twilight is the product of the evil Twilight King Zant, whose shadow creatures begin wreaking havoc on the world. It's up to the blessed Link to save the day, but of course, it's not that simple. Early on, Link enters the darkness of the twilight and is temporarily transformed into a wolf. He also meets a strange character named Midna, a twilight being bent on driving the evil Zant from power. The story delivers on all counts, gripping the player to Hyrule and almost all of its NPCs like no other Zelda game before it. It's dark and twisted for Legend Of Zelda standards; and throughout the story you'll question everyone from Link to Midna to even Zelda herself.Zelda games are all about adventure, and Twilight Princess gives the player a massive world to do all of the adventuring one could possibly want. The world is full of caves, towns, and dungeons to explore as well as lakes, forests, deserts, and mountains. The scope of the game is huge before even considering the hefty amount of things to do. Twilight Princess follows a very familiar Zelda structure, for the most part. Players are thrown into Link's world and eventually a conflict leads him towards a region's dungeon area, where Link will solve puzzles and defeat a boss character to restore peace throughout that region. This game does take the formula a little further; different regions throughout the world will be consumed by twilight throughout the game. Link must enter in his wolf form and seek tears of the region's inhabitants, which restores power to an overseeing guardian who drives away the twilight and restores the area. This extra factor in the gameplay really prolongs the game, but in a good way. Twilight Princess has a pace that never lets go of your attention but yields enough freedom to allow you to explore, which is the point in the first place.Dungeons are a major highlight here, and the developers have mastered level design. Like the rest of the game, they follow a familiar pattern. Each dungeon introduces major challenges, new puzzles, and an important new item that will help you out with the former two situations. This structure has held strong since the series began in 1987, and it is rock-solid here as well. When you come across the bow in the second dungeon, for example, you're bound to use it a lot to solve the puzzles and open up some new areas as well as defeat the boss character. Zelda is very similar to another classic Nintendo franchise, Metroid, in that finding new items can really open up a lot elsewhere in the game. As I mentioned, exploring the world is a big deal in this game, and finding new stuff to uncover nooks and crannies is the trick to finding even more cool stuff.The big controversy over the Nintendo Wii version of Twilight Princess was whether or not the controllers would be able to deliver familiar control mechanics so that Zelda fans wouldn't have to adjust much to a new scheme. Rest assured that Twilight Princess on the Nintendo Wii controls perfectly. That's really all there is to say about it, in general. It feels great, simply put. To go a bit more in-depth, though, you control Link's general movement with the nunchuck's analog stick. Unsheathing and swinging his sword is done with movements of the Wii remote, and for the spinning slash attack, the nunchuck. Z-targeting is back and works as well as it always has, and items can still be used and mapped to different buttons on the Wii remote. Using projectile items is a real treat; items like the slingshot, boomerang, and bow can be fired with the Wii's B trigger and aimed with the Wii remote's motion sensitivity as well as a targeting reticle on the screen. After some practice, defeating enemies, solving puzzles, and simply moving around is as easy as it ever was. Twilight Princess has as much of a learning curve as Ocarina Of Time did, and anyone who's played a Gamecube or Nintendo 64 Zelda game will have no trouble hacking and slashing through minion after minion, stopping only to scratch their head at the next befuddling puzzle or look at the scenery.There are distractions everywhere that strongly support the rumored 70 hours of gameplay. Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess breaks a traditional Zelda mold by forcing you to find 5 Heart Pieces to restore a Heart Container (normally you'd collect four), and as a result, there are 45 of these pieces scattered throughout the world. Fishing was always fun on the Nintendo 64 Zelda titles, but it's an all-new experience here. With the Wii remote, you'll cast the fishing rod, set the hook, and reel in a fish rather than pressing buttons and moving analog sticks. There are 60 Poe souls and 24 Golden Bugs to seek as well as other mini-games scattered throughout Hyrule. If there's not enough for you to do here, well, I don't know what to tell you, because this game's loaded.Twilight Princess is easily the best-looking Nintendo Wii title out of the gates. Hyrule has never looked so beautiful. Link's character model is detailed down to the chain mail protecting him underneath his tunic, and when you see the high towers of Hyrule Castle far off in the distance of the grassy rolling hills of Hyrule Field, it's hard to say the view isn't stunning. The character designs of the last few Zelda games have been superior to most games, but Twilight Princess takes it to a level so high that even those who don't normally appreciate such a thing as art style and design will be impressed. Enemy designs are some of the best in the series, and boss characters are more fearsome than ever before. The twilight structures enemies are very interesting, usually colored in a very dark palette with high-contrast, almost neon-colored designs covering them. Even the different weapons and items look interesting, and are much less conventional than those of previous games. The animation is smooth as silk. Link has no problem keeping up with your flinging of the Wii remote as you slash through keese and other familiar enemies. I was happy to see that some of Wind Waker's effects, like the exploding enemies and flashes of light during battle, were kept intact despite the otherwise polar opposite art direction. It also won't hurt to mention that the game's cut-scenes are choreographed beautifully, making for some of the best story clips I've seen in video games.The music ranges from classic and memorable to completely new, but never leaves the high quality that you'd expect from a Zelda game. If there's anything as familiar as Link's green tunic, the Master Sword, or the Triforce, it's the different sound effects, jingles, and tunes that series veterans could hum in their sleep. You'll hear the familiar theme songs, that little tune that plays when you unlock a door or uncover a secret, and even the same jingle when you open up a treasure chest with an important item inside. There is still very little voice-over, with most of what's there coming from Midna's foreign twilight tongue. While most veterans of the Zelda franchise are happy with this, I would have liked to see other NPCs speak throughout the game. I wouldn't mind if Link remained his voiceless, wordless self, but everyone else could and should be talking.After reading eight paragraphs of praise and little else, you might be wondering: Is Twilight Princess a perfect game? Sadly, it's not, though it's close. It's got a few flaws that keep it at a mortal status, though none of them are detrimental to the gameplay and are easily dealt with. First of all, the sole visual fault comes from slightly blurry textures that show that the game was intended to be a last-generation Gamecube game. Second, some of the alterations to small elements of gameplay bothered me a bit. For example, Link climbs at about half the speed he used to, making those all-too-common vine or grate climbs a major chore. Also, there are several lava, poison, and endless pits that will set you back-sometimes too far back. Early on in the game, you're to follow a monkey holding a lantern through an area filled with poison gas. If you get even an inch too far into the poison gas and away from the safety of the lantern, Link will pass out and return to the beginning of the area. The frustrating part in this specific example is that you battle enemies and can't control the speed of the monkey, so it's entirely possible to return to the starting point multiple times. Last of all, some of the twilight enemies-specifically the shadow minions that you'll encounter often as a wolf-are somewhat annoying to deal with. They present a definite challenge, but eventually they can become quite tiresome.Even with those three gripes I mentioned above, Twilight Princess is a blast to play. It's tough to creatively elaborate on that; it's just fun, and that is the most important purpose of video games. Legend Of Zelda: Twilight Princess is an epic, and nothing less. It's a game that will test anyone, whether the player controlling Link with the Wii remote is a veteran or beginner. There is so much to do and so much to see that only the definition of time and meaning of life is more perplexing to think about. Nintendo couldn't have kicked off the Wii launch in a better way, but more importantly, they've one-upped a game that is considered by most as the greatest of all time. Ocarina Of Time, eat your heart out. There's a new legend, and it's Twilight Princess.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2006"}

There are a lot of sidequests and a lot of things to discover!Challange: 5/10: If you're looking for a challange, look elsewere. I mean, this game is extremely fun, but easy! If you want a hard game, try beating this without Badges! THAT'S hard!A great, underrated game. I can't wait to get Paper Mario: The Thousand Year door for GameCube!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00109KMOO","description":"All the creatures of myth, legend and lore are real-they've just been sealed away for thousands of years inside Pandora's Box. When a thief named Deckard is hired to steal an ancient artifact, he unwittingly triggers a war between man and myth. Giant Gryphons rule the skies, Werewolves tear the innocent limb from limb and cities are held under siege as creatures we'd dismissed as the imaginings of our ancestors prove to be very real and very angry at being prisoners for untold milennia. As the only person able to seal the box, Deckard finds that he must work with a shadowy secret society to save civilization before it's torn apart by tooth and claw.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Great ideas buried under a hunk of crap","reviewText":"The Good: Huge bosses, decent graphics, cool enemies, decent storyThe Bad: Terrible level design, extremely difficult, lame weapons, weapons are never powerful enough, retarded healing system, story isn't done justice, there's going to be a sequel...Legendary is yet another game this year that has been released and has totally let all of us FPS fans down, but what a surprise right? FPS games are probably the most prone to failing terribly due to lazy level design, bad story, bad physics and anything else you put in an FPS. Unfortunately, Legendary does almost everything wrong and hardly anything right, but you can still squeeze a few drops of fun out of this weekend rental. Legendary puts you up against Pandora's Box's creatures that starts taking over and destroying the world while trying to be controlled by the evil LeFey.While the plot sounds semi-interesting it takes a face dive right into a mud pit once you start playing since you don't really give a crap after about thirty minutes. If playing the game is hard enough as it is the mechanics the game is built around are totally slapped together and not very well done. Even when I saw videos of this game I knew it didn't look complete and they actually shipped the game unfinished. First and foremost, the main culprit is the Unreal 3 engine. Now I'm not bashing the engine at all its just many developers tend to think U3 will MAKE the game for them and they just have to tell it what to do and that is not the case. There are a lot of similarities to BioShock, in fact, from the Animus powers shooting out of your hand (with almost exact animations), to the same glowy look on everything you interact with. While the game looks half way decent everything looks like it was copied and pasted into the game instead of built there. You're wondering around a war torn London and New York and you don't even feel like you're there since the game doesn't replicate the cities at all not even famous landscapes for Christ sake! On top of this the physics are way off and everything seems to stick like glue or something and it's just really weird. There's terrible collision detection to where enemies will go through walls and stick there and start flopping around like some kid with Down Syndrome.This is also coupled with cramped levels, linear levels, and everything just looks the same. Turn this wheel here, kill these creatures here, shoot these wire suspensions here, bypass this keypad here. The game is very tedious and just completely retarded and put together so poorly. Even moving your character is even a pain since when you get hit on one side you stop moving that way for some strange reason and I have no idea why. You'll be strafing left and then get attacked by your left, but you just stop dead in your tracks and you have to jam the stick left a few times before even moving again. The guns don't feel powerful at all and are just completely retarded with almost no recoil, they are all standard such as shotguns, machine guns, a rocket launcher, and a weak pistol that does NOTHING. The most original weapons is probably an axe but even the more powerful weapons take awhile to tear down foes coming after you. The enemies are just absurdly difficult to bring down even on the easiest setting. For some unknown reason the weakest enemy (Blood Spiders) just swarm after you and you have to find the sac holding them and getting there can be a pain since this leads into the lame healing system. Other enemies range from werewolves, minotaurs, griffons you name it.These are cool enemies and shouldn't have anything go wrong but it does anyways! They throw so many enemies at you and you never feel powerful enough to take them down so you're constantly scrounging your health with the difficult healing system. You have this power from your hand called Animus, so you take Animus Clouds from dead creatures and you use this for health. You hold down Y to take it, but it takes so long to absorb it all and this is NOT good when you have a ton of guys shooting at you or creatures clawing at you. You hold down Y again to heal yourself, but as you can see, using the same button to heal and absorb is not going to work very well. When you're near clouds you absorb them instead of healing and vise versa. If you double tap Y (why are we double tapping with so many buttons!) you can do an Animus Push to stun enemies and this does absolutely nothing. Now when it comes back to the combat you can't use any melee attacks, no cover system NOTHING, ZERO, ZILCH, SQUAT! You have to hide behind everything and peek out like a stupid old PlayStation game from 6 years ago. This makes things ridiculously annoying during the unbalanced levels that are badly designed.This game just has so many things wrong you wonder what there is to like? Well its for the sheer epicness that game seems to pull off with 300 foot Golem, a HUGE krakan you fight in London, and even the giant Griffon's are cool to kill. If you can bear through this 6-7 hour campaign you can find some fun in this game. With a different story, decent graphics, cool enemies, and lots of big bosses you can have fun once. Legendary, this definitely, is not.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}
