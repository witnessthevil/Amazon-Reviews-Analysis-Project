{"product_name":"B0000664JE","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Not bad, but not what it should have been","reviewText":"When comparing the three systems neck and neck and side-by-side Xbox has taken a while to get up the standards that I'm holding the system to based on Microsoft's over inflated system stats and the rather blatant dishonesty about the systems actual performance. Its still not there yet, I am still at a state of &quot;prove it&quot; with Microsoft, though the games (and controllers, thankfully) have been getting much better since launch, Dead to Rights is a prime example of why I don't think the XBox is the most powerful console of the bunch. Maybe its developer laziness but there is a lot of Xbox games that have these types of flaws. Before I get into what is wrong with this game, however, let me address why I like it despite its many flaws.The game has a very strong story to it, granted its nothing new or revolutionary, we've seen this good-cop-gets-framed-breaks-out-of-jail-and tries-to-prove-himself-innocent in countless movies in the past. This game is kind of a mix of Max Payne and the Fugitive. Although there is nothing innovative or revolutionary about the story it is still very good, and it flows together very well. It has brilliant dialogue, and great voice acting.The game play is where this game really shines. The great gunplay gave me a huge adrenaline rush. It's not easy for a gamer of my tastes. I don't play games like this very often, so I'm not terribly good at them, or wasn't. I like how you HAVE TO use your environment against your enemies, from having to hide behind counters, and walls to tossing flammable canisters at the enemies, and shooting them at just the right moment, even taking hostages and using them a human shields. Once you get the hang of how to use your environment to save your hide the difficulty drops significantly. This game is very fun to play.Sadly it is not the prettiest game to watch. For a game that is so heavily reliant on story and dialogue the fact that the character's lack facial animations during in game real time cut-scenes is a sore disappointment. This, being an XBox game, should not have been an issue. Also, the only good polygon model for this game is Slate and Shadow. Every other character in this game looks utterly terrible. I expect much more from Namco. The cinematic feel of the game that they were trying for suffered greatly because of this. The presentation to this otherwise great game is so bad that I cannot justify giving it more than three stars. It may play like a next gen console game, but it looks like a slightly improved N64 game, blurry textures included! Its sad really because this game could have been much better than it is, especially with its presentation. Thankfully for Namco, the game is still a blast to play. It would have been nice if the characters had facial animation, and lip-synching to back up its story.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2002"}

Sturgeon","summary":"Best Zelda Yet","reviewText":"First a small note about the gold remote bundle. I was able to get mine at retail price having reserved it through a local game store. Being only $20 more than the game itself, it was very much worth it.I love the gold coloring and the Zelda emblem on it. It's also nice not to have to put that heavy attachment onto the bottom of my remote for motion plus games any more.So at retail prices, it's very much worth it. But for the prices these online scalpers are charging, you're really better off getting the game and Wii remote with motion plus seperate. Pretty gold color and the Zelda emblem just is not worth the scalpers prices.The cd that comes with the game is also nice. It comes with the both the game and the bundle, so still not worth getting the bundle at scalper prices. It only has 8 tracks, but those tracks are surprisingly lengthy and well worth listening to.Now, on to the game itself. It seems like the biggest complaints I've seen about this game, both here on Amazon and on 'professional reviews,'  have to do with controls and graphics. Let me take these head on.Graphics: Every time I've heard this complaint, it's more of a complaint about Wii limitations than anything wrong with the game itself. These complaints come from people too used to PS3 and 360 graphics. If you're used to playing the Wii, you know what to expect graphically. And honestly, this has some of the best graphics I've seen on the Wii.Now in complete honesty, there are a few points where the graphical limitations of the Wii show through in a VERY bad way. But those are few and far between. For the most part, Skyward Sword is very beautiful.Controls: Again, this is a Wii game. Wii is synonymous with 'motion controls.'  With the Wii motion plus, this made it possible for the developers to do things they couldn't previously do in other Zeldas.Now part of what they do does make the game challenging. You can't just waggle your sword around and expect to defeat enemies. Even non-boss enemies will require you to be very specific at how you swipe your sword, whether that be horizontally, vertically or diagonally.Fighting takes precision. Yes, that makes it more challenging. But that's also what makes this one of the better Zeldas. You aren't just going to breeze through fights like you used to.You're also not going to breeze through puzzles either. In the past, if you were a Zelda veteran, you knew all about pushing blocks, hitting switches, etc. But with the motion-plus, Nintendo has been able to introduce new kinds of puzzles and new kinds of ways of defeating enemies. Some old tricks make their return, but you're going to have to learn some new ones to make it through this game. It's honestly the breath of fresh air this franchise has needed for a long time.I named my review 'Best Zelda Yet.' That is not a claim I make lightly. Ocarina of Time has long stood as my number one favorite Zelda for both personal and practical reasons. Even with the advances Twilight Princess made, I stubbornly held it down to a very close second. So for me to say 'best Zelda yet,' claiming it even better than Ocarina of time, you can be sure that Skyward Sword really did something to earn that statement.And it did. The motion-plus controls make it feel like I'm truly the one behind the sword for the first time. As stated before, the new ways of solving puzzles and defeating enemies are a breath of fresh air desperately needed in this series. The increase in challenge over other Zelda games is also welcome. This game does everything right. If you're a Zelda fan, you should not hesitate getting this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2011"}

Even if I bought them on day 1 (which is rare), it'd be months to a year before Id get around to playing them.  Many of us suffer these kind of job/time/responsibility constraints, but what it does is put us in the enviable position of getting great games for a fraction of their new retail.  So, perhaps my review is skewed by the bargain price MOH now costs.Still, its a solid game.  There are those that love modern FPS for the multiplayer, but I'm not one of them.  Watching my nephew play online multiplayer reminds me why I can't hang with most, and frankly, don't want to anymore.  I'm in it for the single player campaign, and what I have loved about COD/COD2, Battlefield 1/2, I love about MOH.  Fast paced, immersive, authentic in its feel and gameplay, I honestly can't understand what people are griping about.Except it doesn't break new ground, but I'm not really looking for new ground in a game of this type - what it does (and what others mentioned above do), it does well, and you can expect consistent gameplay from MOH.  In fact, in some ways, MOH imparts upon you the feeling of unbalanced odds in unadvantageous terrain better than the other aforementioned games.  None of the COD/Battlefield games, I feel, convey an Afghan ambush like MOH, and I appreciated this different side of modern warfare.  Sure, its got similarities to the others (the drone comes to mind), and sure, others do some things much better (I think Battlefield 2 currently holds the solo campaign title) but I left the finale feeling like I had experienced something familiar, something new, and had a blast doing both, and for me, it was enough.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2011"}

You are a young trainer who has just acquired their very first Pokemon, and are tasked with retrieving a very important egg from a friend of Prof. Elm name Mr. Pokemon. Upon receiving the egg, you find out that someone has broken into Elm's lab and stolen one of the starter Pokemon (and what a coincidence it's the one that's strong against the one you picked).You run into the unnamed rival, battle him, and are then told to fill up the Pokedex, beat the Elite Four and just be super awesome. But there's an issue, Team Rocket has returned. After being disbanded 3 years ago after Giovanni lost to a snot nosed brat (who, as we know, is the player from FireRed/LeafGreen/Red/Blue/Yellow) and you must stop them.... again.GraphicsThe graphics haven't received much of an overhaul, but this isn't bad, as Pokemon has looked just fine for several years. I enjoy the simple, yet well made pixel art. Buildings have a slight 3D effect when approaching from the side, and the people, Pokemon and effects are all very well done.ControlsThe controls have remained mostly the same, one this you can do is register two items instead of one (not sure if this was a feature in Diamond/Pearl/Platinum), these items are conveniently placed on the touch screen so you don't have to open your bag to fish them out.Voice/Music/SoundThis remake has some of the best music of all the Pokemon games. At first, it's nothing special, but when you arrive in Kanto, the music turns into a sorta techno beat, and it's good (I HATE techno so the fact that I like this is amazing). Battle music ranges from Wild encounters, Trainer encounters, Rival encounters, Gym Leader encounters, Elite Four encounters, Champion encounter, Legenadary encounters (and some have their own unique theme) and the encounter with Red (the player from the FireRed/LeafGreen/Red/Blue/Yellow).OtherBesides the things many of us already know (after defeating the Elite Four, the player can play through Kanto, fighting Brock, Misty and other Kanto Gym Leaders) HG/SS offers a few new changes. The most prominent being that the Pokemon in the top left slot will always be following you, much like Pikachu did in Yellow version.There is also a Safari Zone in Johto this time around (which was not included due to the Glitch City in Red, Blue and Yellow versions) and the player can manipulate which fields show up in the zone (swamp, grasslands, water, rock, etc) allowing more control over which Pokemon appear.If you bought the game new, you also received a device called a PokeWalker. This device acts as a pedometer that you can transfer a Pokemon onto and take with you. After a certain amount of steps, you receive a &#34;watt&#34; (or charges), these charges can be used to battle and catch wild (and sometimes rare) Pokemon and find items with the Dowsing Machine, you can also send and receive gifts from others.If you enjoy friendly completions, you can become a PokeAthlete  in the Pokeathlon Dome. This is a series of events that test your Pokemons' skills (speed, stamina, skill, power and jumping abilities, these can be looked up under each Pokemons' information). There are many events like the Circle Push (sorta like sumo wrestling), Hurdle Dash (like at the Olympics) and several others. Winning (and losing) earns you points which you can spend on items (such as Stones, Apricots, Nuggets and more).OverallThis is a game that fans of the series should absolutely pick up. It's all the good things about Pokemon and none of the bad. If you have even enjoyed a single episode or game, you MUST get this game. This is one of my most enjoyed games of all time.10.0/10.0Pros- Great music pieces- Great looking game- Can enjoy both Kanto and Johto- Fun having your Pokemon walk with you- PokeWalker is a nice toyCons- It eventually ends","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2013"}

Sadly, Wanted: Weapons of Fate is really nothing else but wasted potential.  Taking place after the film, you play as Wesley and take down hordes of baddies.  The whole curving the bullet technique is here, and is a fun little trick to pull off at first as well.  Once you get the hang of it though, as well as the game's controls, Wanted ends up being a pretty boring and easy affair.  The fact that the game is so short that you could finish it in an afternoon doesn't help matters any, and neither does the fact that there's no online play either.  The game looks decent enough, there's multiple difficulties, and there's some unlockables including alternate costumes and the like, but once you play through Wanted: Weapons of Fate, there really isn't any reason to go back.  Were this a budget-priced game, it would definitely be worth checking out, but alas, it isn't, and considering the elements that could have translated so well into the action video game world, the game just ends up coming up so short.

And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Slick","summary":"WORST","reviewText":"I have the wii version and is HORRIBLE.

You'll get invested in the characters and you'll play to find out what happens next.You'll also enjoy exploring the city in the game as well.  It's a realistic and busy city.  It's fun to explore while on foot thanks to the focus on free running in the game and also driving in one of the many vehicles in the game.  The driving controls are arcadey but aren't excessively so.  Plus the vehicles have a ramming function that is perfect for slamming other vehicles off the road.  It's awesome.You'll mostly be using your fists in the game.  Guns are pretty scarce at first.  That's not a bad thing, however.  In fact, I found it to be refreshing.  Wei starts out with a basic move set but as you gain experience points with by completing triad and police missions he'll acquire more moves that look great and are fun to pull off.  Fighting isn't very complicated.  There is mainly just an attack button and a counter button.  There are different enemy types however and Wei can grapple an enemy and perform one of many satisfying environment kills.  It's a fighting system that reminds me of Arkham City and Assassins Creed.There is a lot of variety in this game.  I was learning new things about the game every time I played it. The first time I jumped off my vehicle to hijack another in a high speed chase was a great feeling.  I loved this game because it was always throwing something new at me to tackle.  Something that not many games do recently.If I had any complaints about the game it it would be about the visuals of the game.  They aren't bad but there are a few bugs.  The characters have a plastic doll look to them.  While animations look great you'll constantly see enemies clipping into walls and objects and there are only a few variations of each character type.  Free running and movement can feel imprecise as well.  You might climb a wall you didn't want to while running and you might not be able to target the enemy you want very quickly either.

Nothing that will shock you or ruin the experience. However, I do mention a few things that some clueless people may not be aware of.**Tim Schafer is a mad man. Let's just get that out in the open. He has a sick, twisted mind and lives in a more cartoony version of any of Tim Burton's films. This mind is perfect for writing video game masterpieces. When you experience a Schafter game, you are generally felt with a bondship between the characters you encounter and yourself.Br&uuml;tal Legend is no different. As the game starts off, you generally want to care for the characters, hoping that this journey won't end in failure. But what really grabs you is not only the characters, but this twisted land of metal that Schafer has pulled out from the imagination of metal legends and their legendary album covers. If you really go back and look at a metal cover by bands like 'Iron Maiden' or 'Slayer', you see these horrible images of death and destruction: perfect for video games! And this is what Tim managed to accomplish by combining humor and colorfulness to the very dark and violent images you see in metal.Enough of the overall conceptual background. The story is pure magic. You star as Eddie Riggs, a roadie that tours with a rapcore \"metal\" band of today's world known as Kabbage Boy, and manages to get smashed by his own evil stage creation. Through this, and his magic belt (which is Ormag&ouml;den, an ancient ruler of the metal land), he manages to travel back in time, to when metal was king. A time before the 70s and 80s. With the help of a few true metal warriors, you battle in the Ancient World for peace against Doviculus, the Emperor of the Tainted Coil, and his Glam metal minions. While the game is an overall short experience (around 7-10 hours), you will end up having a blast the time you are playing.The game plays out like a typcial hack and slash. You have your battle axes for melee combat and electric guitars for ranged attack. You're also equipted with a car, a hot rod, that can be upgraded to be a mean machine with a killer engine, as well as guns and mines. If these do not excite you, you also have the ability to double team with any friendly AI unit on your team, as well as beast of the field. For instance, your first group of allied AI is the Headbangers. When you jump into their group, or double team with them, you are in a sort of mosh pit that knocks anyone around in a more controlled melee beating, as well as giving them more damage. You can do the same thing with player vehicles, giving you alternative methods to use your allies.The point of the game is to reclaim the land by completing several quest. The main quest is generally the same thing. You battle bosses, drive and protect a tricked-out tour bus from baddies, and then basically play a somewhat strategy game of \"Defend the Stage, Attack the Stage\". The way this is set up, your crew builds a stage and you have to control your merchandise stands, all of which are built on fans that generate into your economy. You'll have to keep a balance between fighting off the opposing stage and enemies, while maintaining your troops and your own stage. Really, this is a difficult thing to accomplish, especially if you're looking at it like you're playing an RTS game rather than an action hack and slash game. This almost seem overwhelming the first few battles, and when you finally get the hang of it, they bust out the Tainted Coil teams which felt are a lot like the Zergs in StarCraft. They'll rush and crush you. Giving that this is the main point of the single player experience, and multi player, you better get used to playing in a mode like this.Some of the side quest are really great, but they do tend to be on the repetitive side. You basically have the choice to defend or ambush enemies, race a wise-talking Irish demon, help a cannonier learn how to use his cannon, hunt wild animals, or just find hidden treasures. Basically, you'll do these a lot, over and over. Granted, they're side quest, so if you don't want to do them, you don't have to. They're more of added bonuses.Multi player is something that can be either extremely fun and exciting or make you want to duck and run. It follows the same method as the single player's stage battles, but some of the players you'll encounter seem to have been born playing this game already. A general hint to beating these foes is to just remember the game is not an RTS, no matter how much it looks like it.As for graphics, for being a new engine, it looks great. It fits into Tim's overall world and is set apart from other worlds. It does everything, from great facial animations to terrific lighting, very well. While it looks great, you will encounter some minor hickups during the game, mainly in the overworld. The sounds are terrific, and with a 100+ soundtrack, you can't go wrong.If you're really looking for a game to keep you busy this holiday, this game may not be it, but it will entertain you and leave you with a wanting for a second. Or just wanting a new world for Tim Schafer to create to shatter your world.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2009"}

Brilliant while it lasted,Parasite Eveleft me wanting more.--John CockingPros:Mutating dogsInvolving storylineElegant game mechanicsCons:Too short, and it's confusing","reviewerName":"Feelah the tigress","summary":"Aya Kicks Butt!","reviewText":"Parasite Eve is a game that blends both the survival-horror and RPG genres together, keeping the best of both worlds.  Ultimately, this makes this a unique game the likes of which I've never seen successfully repeated (yes, the sequel is quite bad).  That being said, I really enjoyed this game, and I'm sure you will too!Graphics (score 7/10): The graphics look a bit dated by today's standards, and weren't even the absolute best for their time.  However, they look good enough, and are not too displeasing to the eye.  The CG cutscenes still look excellent, in my opinion, and do a good job of showcasing the freaky creatures that the game features.Music (score 8/10): I really love the music for this game; I even went and got the soundtrack because I enjoyed it so much.  My only complaint is that the opera scene in the game uses a synthesized vocal track which sounds absolutely hideous compared to the regular opera singer's voice on the soundtrack.  Why they didn't just use the un-synthesized song is beyond me.  Also of note is the excellent exploration-related sound effects.  I don't think I've ever heard squeakier, creepier door sounds in my life.  Yes, these sounds are a bit unnaturally loud, but they are well-suited to this type of game, and add to the creepiness factor.  Unfortunately, in battle sounds like gunshots are oddly muted--eve the rocket launcher is quiet.  One more thing--even though the music itself is great, there are times when it is strangely absent.  At times I can tell that the silence is used for dramatic effect, at other times it just seems random.  For instance, the Weapons Department of the police station (where I store my excess crap) almost always has no music, but the rest of the station does.  This makes no sense at all.  Oh well.  Rest assured that the negative points to the music really don't detract much from the overall fine experience.Characters (score 8/10): Aya is the main character, and the only character which you will get to control.  That being said, I really liked her and think she is more than capable of carrying the game alone.  Being a survival-horror sort of game, only having one character helps add to the feeling of loneliness and fear since you are on your own.  One thing I really like about Aya is that she is not treated like a stereotypical girly-girl nor as a blatant sex-object.  This unfortunately seems to happen a lot in games where the main character is female.  She is very much a believable no-nonsense cop.  After seeing too many games where the female characters fight while wearing mini-skirts and heels (who fights monsters in a mini-skirt?!), I've really started to appreciate the fact that the designers opted for realism in Parasite Eve and put Aya in jeans, sneakers, and a jacket.  It's really unusual to see such a believable female lead character, and I'm very pleased.  As for the other, supporting characters (and even Aya herself), they do not get a lot of background information or dialogue, and do not really get a lot of character development.  The other characters are really more archetypal characters, such as the workaholic cop who doesn't spend enough time with his family, or the nerdy, socially inept scientist.  Even though their personalities aren't deeply developed, you can still understand and relate to them as characters because you're familiar with the archetypes.  This lack of deeper characters normally wouldn't work in a traditional RPG, but the game pulls it off well because it is more story-driven.Story (score 9/10): The story takes place in a fairly short amount of time (6 days), but it's very engaging.  True, the premise of sentient mitochondria is a bit far-fetched, but if you suspend your disbelief, the story is incredibly enjoyable.  Square did a good job of crafting a creepy tale full of hideous monsters that'll keep you on the edge of your seat.  The main storyline is great, but one thing I must point out (without spoiling anything) is that the bonus ending (for going through the Chrysler Building in the EX Game) is a real bust.  I felt so cheated after seeing that ending--it is way not worth the effort to get.  However if you stick to the main game, you're likely to have a great time.Battle System (score 10/10): The game designers did a great job of blending action elements and turn-based gameplay to give us an enjoyable hybrid.  You can move Aya freely around during battle to dodge enemy attacks while waiting for your time bar to fill.  Once it's full, you hit the X button to bring up an attack menu and a grid.  The grid shows you the range of you're weapon.  Simple, yes?  Also, you can opt to open up your menu when you get your turn and use an item instead of attacking.  The game features many guns and armor which can be customized by using a \"tool\" to add features from one weapon/armor onto another.  You also get bonus points when you level up which can be used to increase your inventory size, the speed of your time bar, or weapon/armor stats.  Overall, I found the customization feature to be very enjoyable.Gameplay (score 7/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  One thing that I found annoying was Aya's running speed; it's like her feet are sticky or something because she runs really slowly.  Another thing that was a bit annoying is that the game has random battles, but they aren't exactly random.  There are \"hot spots\" on the floor that can trigger random battles if you happen to step in that area.  Unfortunately, these are somewhat few and far between, and the more they are triggered, the lower your chances of getting that spot to trigger again.  While this is good because you have fewer random battles than a normal RPG, it would've been easier to level-raise if the game featured just regular old random battles that trigger every few steps or so.  Other than that, the gameplay is mostly positive.  I really enjoy how you can return to previous locations to level-raise or get items (can't leave the final area at the end of the game, unfortunately).  I also like the fact that they kept the survival-horror feel of having limited inventory space but also gave you a convenient place you can store extra items (in the Weapons Department of the Police Station).  Overall, I think the game designers did a very good job of combining the best elements of survival-horror and RPG gameplay.Overall (score 9/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  If you're a fan of RPG's and always wanted to play a survival-horror game but really hate the gameplay element of the latter, then Parasite Eve is for you!  It's really quite sad that Parasite Eve is the only game I've found that successfully pulls off this blending of genres; I really wish there were some more (Parasite Eve 2, unfortunately, was quite awful).  I strongly urge you to add this game to your collection; you won't be disappointed!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2009"}

There are other games like Burnout 3 or Dirt that sometimes feel too arcadey (floaty/simplified driving) to actually be enjoyable with a wheel and a controller actually feels better.DISCLAIMER: Wheels have gotten a hell of a lot more popular than they were a few years ago and most all of the newer driving games I've seen come out in the last few years have had solid wheel support. So if your are thinking of purchasing this with the intent of playing new and future games, you will PROBABLY have a pretty good time with it.Detailed Review------------------Logitech was kind enough to send me both the GT (cheaper model) and the G27 (this model, that adds a shifter and clutch pedal) racing wheels to review. While the built quality and little touches like leather-wrapped handle and medal pedals are nice on the G27, they aren't that noticeable once you are racing, so I am going to stay focused on the actual functional differences between the wheels when applicable.If you are a casual gamer and like racers and want a wheel to make the more \"simulation\" style ones like GT5 and F1 feel better, you can probably pickup the GT and be as happy as you are going to get. There are paddle shifters on that one and the driving mechanics are the same except for the lack of shifting.The G27 shifter does not have a hardware-tie-in to the clutch on the foot pad, so you can just slap through the gears without ever clutching or WITH clutching and it's up to the game to decide how to handle that (e.g. change gears no problem, grind gears, etc. etc.) because of this lack of awesome integration I didn't find the shifting mechanism  as \"to die for\" as I thought I might because I was at the mercy of the game to make the experience awesome an not that many did.That being said, it is really up to you if you need the shifting action or not and want to pay for it in the G27 -- it feels decent, the shifter is a bit small and the action is fairly smooth, not very \"clicky\".As with any of the other Logitech wheels, when you set this bad-boy up, get ready for some cable nightmares:* PS3/Computer cable* Pedal cable* Shifter cable* Power cableThere are cables everywhere and unless you have a racing stand ready to go and plan on hooking this to your coffee table, it will be an eye soar.WARNING: Leaving this hooked up for long periods of time can lead to your wife/girlfriend forcibly ending your racing career by telling you it needs to come down.Given how inexpensively wireless functionality can be put into controllers now (e.g. Rock Band instruments) I would have loved to see a wireless version of this controller... all of the cabling is really an ugly mess once it's all hooked up.The built quality of the wheel itself is excellent. I had no complaints here and thought it felt great. As I mentioned the shifter itself feels a HAIR cheap and doesn't have a nice metaly/clicky action to it, instead its s slightly smooth mildly clicky action. It is leather wrapped which is a nice touch though.The force feedback can go from \"realistic\" to \"wrist punishing\" depending on if the game lets you adjust it or not, and most do. As mentioned above, in GT5 is where this wheel shines it's brightest, feeling absolutely as real as you are going to get to driving in your living room.It is hard to review a peripheral like this because so much depends on how well the games take advantage of it. GT5 and F1 felt the most realistic to me, Burnout 3 was pretty useless because it is an arcade racer and using a wheel doesn't give you enough control to respond to the floaty controls fast enough so you end up fishtailing all over the place a lot.Dirt 1 didn't calibrate very well, Dirt 2 felt awesome. NFS Shift felt great as well.Conclusion----------------------If you love racers and don't mind spending some cash, the G27 is an easy recommendation. Just be aware that the wheel experience is governed almost exclusively by the game (so each game will be different) and not by the wheel itself.If nothing I wrote so far got you off the fence between this wheel and the GT, then get the GT and save the cash. I tried to outline the big motivators for getting the G27 over the GT and if none of those stuck, then I don't think you will feel the $100 difference.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

MacMahon","summary":"Excellent Multiplayer, Fun Singleplayer, Battlefield is BACK!","reviewText":"Battlefield is back on PC with Battlefield: Bad Company 2.  While not the fully featured PC exclusive Battlefield 2 and the rest were, BC2 has new modes, building destruction and amazing modern graphics to balance that out.  It's also a fine PC port, featuring dedicated servers, perfect mouse control, larger player count (32) and higher graphical fidelity.  Some of the maps here are just stunning, like the forrested islands and barren deserrts.Words can't really explain how much it adds to Battlefield to be able to destroy a building around someone.  Camping is almost eliminated and the grenade launchers will fly at the slightest hint of someone behind a wall.  There is less safety, more running, and thus a highly fast-paced game.  If you like squad multiplayer with tactics, but also a fast pace, you will be enthralled here I believe.  Somewhere between Rainbow Six and Call of Duty, expanded with massive areas and vehicles, BC2 is unique and extremely fun to play.  You WILL want to max your level, it's an addiction hard to deny.Singleplayer is good, though nothing amazing.  Unfortunately the original Bad Company never came to PC and thus I never played it, but the story seems self-contained throughout and is a relatively great military shooter.  It lacks the spectacle of the Call of Duty games, but it does have larger, more open areas and much better graphics depending on location.  A few levels put you in massive open areas like Crysis with multiple objectives, the best of which is a barren deserrt with castles, ancient tanker ships and humvees.  The campaign feels fun because of funny dialogue and an emphasis on enjoying blowing things up, rather than drama.  Some reviews say the singleplayer is an afterthought, and while multiplayer is the reason to get this singleplayer is definately better than you might think and well worth a playthrough.All in all BC2 brings excellent multi and great singleplayer into a nice package, all presented well and with quality on the PC platform.

Medal Of Honor kind of fell out and i never really heard anything about them once the original call of duty came out, and especially when call of duty 2 came out for xbox 360.  Then when Call of Duty 4 came out you never even heard a single word about Medal Of Honor anymore unless it was a commercial from EA trying to sell it.  There was no buzz or anything for the past about 3 to 5 years.  COD 4 comes out, COD: World At War comes out, and the Modern Warfare 2 comes out.  Then a while later you start hearing about Medal Of Honor switching to the modern warfare game type.  Finally there is a huge buzz about Medal Of Honor again.  I knew right away that i was going to get this game the day it came out.  THIS GAME IS AMAZING! Single Player;  The first couple of levels arent that amazing but they're not bad either in the single player campaign(although there are a couple epic moments).  About the third level this game takes it up a notch.  Every level is amazing now!  This story mode is way better then Modern Warfare 2's story.  Do not give up on this game after the first level.  Multi Player;  The multiplayer is great and very fun.  It is not as in depth as COD, but it is amazing.  There is only 4 game modes and ther all about equal in fun.  The gameplay is very different then COD.  If you expect to sprint around with a sub machine gun or something then think again because you cant do that in this game!  You need to be tactical and pick a spot with a good vantage point of the enemies.  Multiplayer is great!  Don't be an extreme COD fan and start complaining about no killcams and the noob tubes don't kill people across the maps.  Boohoo, get over it!  There are a few critiques though, : 1) Explosions are too weak, 2) Not enough levels or game modes, 3) get more in depth on leveling up.  That said i love this game online.  It is a great break from Modern Warfare 2. Buy this game. That being said I am not a COD hater.  I own COD 4, COD WAW, and MW 2, and i enjoy them all.  But, I think that Call Of Duty: Black Ops is going to crap all over Modern Warfare 2. Treyarch is stepping it up with the wager matches, massive customization, currency system, and just changing up the setup menu and everything.  Black Ops is going to be EPIC and I am fully excited for it.  :)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

S.","summary":"Multiplayer is an expected flop","reviewText":"When I heard that Assassin's Creed was going multiplayer I knew it would be a huge mistake.  Nothing in the Assassin's Creed series speaks to me as multiplayer, ESPECIALLY a versus multiplayer.  In single player I had endless troubles catching people running all over rooftops and platforming.  I could just imagine how ridiculous it would be with internet lag and intelligent players thrown into the equation.  Honestly, Brotherhood is a very good attempt at making A. Creed multiplayer, but it just doesn't cut it for me.First of all, the multiplayer does not play like Assassin's Creed games at all.  It is only a mini game.  There is no sword fighting (or any tactical combat at all), only assassination and various tools to help you do so.  One of my favorite parts about Assassin's Creed 1 that hooked me was the depth and fluidity of the sword fighting.  It was sorely missed.  It is understandable that they did not allow multiplayer sword fighting, as that would be impossible to keep fluid with internet lag.  However, it is just ridiculous that assassins are hunting you and you can't defend yourself with a sword (which all good assassins should carry, like Altair and Ezio).  Inconsistencies like these damaged the game's immersion, making me feel like I was restricted from the full experience by these arbitrary rules.  Another inconsistency is that, while in most modes you can assassinate others, you can not assassinate the assassins that are hunting you.  You may only \"stun\" them by knocking them out for a moment so that you may escape.  Really?  I have a blade that I am VERY capable with and I can't kill the number one threat to myself - assassins who are hunting me?  That is... well, I'm sorry, but retarded.  My favorite part about A. Creed 1 was the intense immersion.  This just feels like I'm playing a silly game of tag.A major problem for me was just how much most of the multiplayer modes are dependent on sheer luck or idiotic risks.  In two of the multiplayer modes you are both hunting players and are being hunted by players.  Yea.  Good luck with that.  Inevitably when you go to make your move you will be giving away your position to the assassins hunting you.  It is a complete contradiction.  You want to be stealthy because you are being hunted, but you are forced to break stealth to hunt your target.  Because of this most games are reduced to a mere causal chain of pure chance.  One person kills another, then that killer is killed, and that killer is killed, and so on until everyone is dead except for one lucky remainder.  Rinse and repeat.  Luck of assassin targets and spawn locations are also a big problem.  In Free For All (Wanted) I'm often killed by the same assassin many consecutive times.  Out of pure chance one person keeps getting me as a target AND I keep spawning in his general area.  Fun.  Also, often your target will be snatched before you can reach them, in which case you've probably already given your location away.  This is pure luck depending on the location of your competing assassins and the choices of the target.  For example, if the target is walking away from me and towards a competing assassin, then getting that kill will be doubly difficult - I have to reach the target faster and not compromise my stealth.  This is rather impossible.  And, as it is impossible to know the location of competition, you leave yourself entirely to luck in your pursuit of your target.Aside from all these theoretical problems with Brotherhood, there are very real issues with the multiplayer.  Lag and bugs are serious business in Brotherhood.  It is not rare to see someone \"teleporting\" and miraculously killing you.  Why, just hours ago my friend claimed someone appeared to teleport through an entire wall and assassinate him.  The same lag-induced oddities have happened to myself.  As for bugs, I have seen players (in Manhunt mode) who cannot be killed by any means or stunned with Smoke Bombs, yet they walk around and \"stun\" every assassin who approaches them.On top of all these issues, multiplayer is barely explained in a VERY simple tutorial.  This leaves so many parts of the multiplayer unexplained and players must seek the very small third-party information or simply make uninformed assumptions for themselves.  I have often assumed incorrectly about multiplayer game mechanics, due in part to new players being restricted by the \"leveling\" system.  It makes the mutliplayer infinitely more difficult to learn, as you must reconstruct your strategy as you gain more tools.  Nothing makes sense in the beginning UNTIL you do get your tools.  Then it makes half-sense, but still feels clunky and unresponsive.Oh yes, did I mention that it is insanely difficult to get a game going?  I have waited for games longer than 10 minutes many times, eventually saying screw it around the 15 minute mark.  And don't even try to play with friends.  The wacko system will separate your friends the first chance it gets to fill another game.  There is no integrated support for Xbox Parties to keep your party together.AS FOR THE SINGLE PLAYER...  It is the same quality one could expect from Assassin's Creed 2: thrilling gameplay, decent but iffy story, and annoying platforming exercises.  If you appreciated AC2, I assure you you'll enjoy Brotherhood's single player campaign.  I, myself, am an Assassin's Creed 1 fan.  The open world gave me the feeling of an assassin's freedom, the espionage drove the story with thrilling anticipation, and the realistic characters made Altair's experience infinitely more memorable than the overtly linear story driven Ezio.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-14-2011"}

You don&#x92;t actually control the Italian plumber-to-be but instead his dinosaur pal, who has the curious ability to eat his enemies and then immediately turn them into eggs, which he can then fling at more enemies.Since Yoshi isn&#x92;t particularly fast and can float in midair for a few seconds after making a jump, the whole dynamics of the normal Mario gameplay have changed, but the same incredible attention to detail and endless imagination that mark all of Nintendo&#x92;s best efforts are still here in full effect. In fact they&#x92;re joined this time, after the rather plain-looking prequel, by some wonderful pastel-shaded graphics that were jaw-dropping when the game was originally released in 1995 and still manage to impress now.As with the otherSuper Mario Advancetitles, this game also contains a four-player version of the originalMario Bros.arcade game, making it even more of a bargain than it already was.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Bruce Aguilar","summary":"Yohis rules!","reviewText":"I had never played this game on the SNES so I was completely unprepared for it's brilliance.  Since I picked up this game little else has been on my mind!  Everything from graphics to story and featurees is handled expertly.  I can't imagine a Mario game getting much better.  In fact, i'd go so far to say that this IS the best Mario game ever created!What was most impressive to me was how easily the game flows.  Unlike other games where you are constanly going over and over the same area trying to reach the goal, after three or four tries I was able to move on to the next section.  That's also made possible by the short levels.  Now don't let that scare you into thinking that the game is short thought, because  it's anything but.  There are so many levels and ares in the game that you'll easily be playing for 15 hours.  Thankfully you don't have to play straight through though as you can save after you complete each level.  This is a terrific game for all levels of videogame players.Do yourself a favor and buy this game if you have a GBA.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002EWD02C","description":"Ashan is a world of legendary peoples. Proud Elves guard the emerald forests of Irollan... Mighty Knights rule the fiefs of the Griffin Empire... Studious Wizards survey the oasis-strewn deserts of the Silver Cities... The grim Necromancers worship in the wastelands of Heresh...and the ravenous demons are immured in Sheogh, their prison world.    During certain lunar eclipses the walls of Sheogh weaken and demons burst forth, plunging Ashan into war. And since the dawn of times, the demon legions have been repelled by the allies thanks to a powerful artifact known as the Blade of Binding.    Once again the armies of Sheogh are coming and the Blade will be wielded...     Your journey in the world of Might and Magic will be punctuated with riddles, extraordinary encounters and epic battles against creatures searching for some fresh hero blood. Your hero will travel thanks to a node system, so watch your step as some of these nodes might trigger special actions, hide terrifying traps or even legendary treasures such as forgotten artifacts or secret units.    To stand a chance against your enemies, your hero will have to equip magical artifacts and build up the most powerful army. Your army will be composed of Core, Elite and Champion units, each of them having specific sizes, strengths and abilities. It&#x2019;s up to you to choose wisely each of these units combined to the appropriate artifact and work out the best strategy to wipe out your enemies.    While roaming around Ashan or winning battles, you will discover new artifacts and gather different types of resources such as Ore, Gold and Blood Crystals. These earnings can be used to buy new Elite or Champion units for your army through specific Creature Dwelling buildings. Make sure to look everywhere as you will be able to unlock and collect powerful hidden units and artifacts!    You will be confronted with many challenges such as defeating the enemy heroes by crossing their armies in standard battles or launching into special challenges and Boss fights where your strategic skills will be put to a severe test. Finally, you can solve puzzle battles and get powerful rewards by finding the right combination and wipe-out the enemy in a limited number of turns.","reviewerName":"Rorke Haining","summary":"highly addictive puzzle RPG","reviewText":"If you know Puzzle Quest, your opinion of this game will probably be identical to your opinion of Puzzle Quest.  I loved Puzzle Quest and love Clash of Heroes too.  Each game takes a simple, lightweight puzzle game and uses that as the combat minigame within a larger, lightweight RPG structure.  What's so startling is that, by themselves, the RPG and puzzle elements of each game are actually kind of weak, and yet the fusion of the two genres works beautifully, producing highly addictive games that are greater than the sum of their parts.The storyline of Clash of Heroes is standard fare for RPGs.  A demon horde threatens the world, a secret artifact that allows the bearer to control demons has gone missing, and only you and your band of intrepid yet completely novice heroes can save the day.  Engaging but forgettable.  The plot is linear and you advance it by entering the next toughest battle in sequence, but there are generally a few optional side quests you can explore at any given time.  Winning battles and solving side quests yields resources and artifacts.  Resources are used to buy advanced troop types for future battles, and artifacts grant you special abilities in combat, except you can only wield one artifact at a time.  Your hero also can cast a single, fixed spell occasionally during battle.  Your hero and troops can also gain status (mostly HP) with experience, maxing out at level 10 for the hero and level 5 for the troops.  That's the full extent of the RPG element.The puzzle minigame in Puzzle Quest was basically Bejeweled.  The puzzle minigame in Clash of Heroes is a similar but original match-3 system.  Your troops are on the touch screen, while your opponent's troops are on the top screen.  You must rearrange your troops into offensive and defensive formations and launch attacks to outmatch your opponent.  To keep things interesting, you can play with and against approximately 40 different troop types, and of course in some battles you face unique situations such as tricky, pre-arranged puzzles and minibosses with special powers.Clash of Heroes is my current favorite game and horribly addictive.  I'm over 100 hours into the game and still loving it.  But I can't in good conscience give it 5 stars, not because of the simplistic game elements, but because the game also has a few rough edges.  There is no way to determine or estimate the strength of an opponent until you enter combat, and many times you will be immediately out of your depth and forced to lose resources or reload and replay.  (I eventually learned the trick though:  random battles are easiest, required battles (marked gold) are in the middle, and optional battles (marked silver) are the toughest.)  Also, the game has poor in-game help.  The puzzles are turn-based, so I expect to be able to explore help during battle.  Instead, help is only available outside of battle, before you know what help you need, and even then, the content that is available is very limited.  For instance, sometimes you'll be facing a new opponent using troops you've never seen before, but not only can you not get help on your enemy's troops, you can't even get help on your own troops!If you like puzzle games, RPGs, or strategy games, odds are you'll really enjoy Clash of Heroes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2010"}

When I saw that they put this out as a 3D first person shooter, I was very disappointed.  While I don't mind the FPS format, I really didn't expect this to translate as well as it did.  In the previous Metroid games, you had to explore every nook and cranny to make sure you had all the power-ups, while most of the FPS games I've played were focused on shooting things.  Well, I'm very happy to say that the game designers kept the Metroid feel even though they changed the entire engine it's based on.  Quite frankly, I think this was one of the smoothest FPS games I've ever played.  The controls are very natural, and they have a nice feature of \"locking\" onto a target.  The gameplay is very much \"free roaming\" meaning you can pretty much go wherever your current power-ups will allow you to go.  As far as the graphics and sound go, well they're superb.  This game really shows what the GameCube has to offer from a technological standpoint.  The sound is pumped out in Suround Sound (which I really enjoy) and the graphics are so beautiful.  The scenery is breath taking, and the animations are outstanding.  Oh, and one of my personal favorite features of this game:  The scan visor!  For those who relish little details in video games, this is right up your ally.  You can scan enemies and objects in the environment alike.  This helps you through the game, as well as enhances the story.  At any rate, to avoid making this too long, buy this game!  It's awesome!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2005"}

But not bad for something that is now free to play!If you wanted to know what Tera is about my advice is to just download the client free from the website and try it out as its now free to play.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2013"}

Other than the first couple of games on the PS1, they all got pretty bad reviews, so I never bothered with them. Then I saw that this latest game got much higher scores than usual, so I played a demo to try it out. It looked good, so I rented the game since I had heard it was fairly short.The game had its good moments, but unfortunately, there were a lot of bad moments in between. The controls were often very glitchy and non-intuitive, leading to Lara falling to her death way too many times. Combat was never much fun, but fortunately you didn't spend too much of the game shooting people. The vast majority of the time was spent on puzzles and trying to navigate from point A to point B. My biggest gripe was the occasional level where you had to ride a motorcycle. It ticks me off when developers feel the need to add driving into a game for variety, but don't spend enough time perfecting the controls. Had I felt like I had any control over the motorcycle, these levels may have been fun, but I didn't, so they were just frustrating.On the plus side, there was a good variety in levels, ranging from actual \"tomb raiding\" to raiding a laboratory in Kazhakstan to mountain-climbing in the Himalayas. The story was fairly interesting, although it ended very abruptly, leaving an opening for the next game in the series.I made it through the game's easy mode in just over 8 hours (which is probably longer than most people would take), so I would definitely recommend renting first. That way you can decide if you like the game enough to buy it so you can beat all the time trials and find all the trophies to unlock everything.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2006"}

{"product_name":"B004EQCCI4","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Truly phenomenal","reviewText":"I can remember a time when I was laid up for 2 months following surgery nearly 2 years ago.  I was down in the dumps and my wife asked me what would make me feel better.  \"A PS3,\" I said.  We've had a Wii for quite sometime, but waiting for 3rd party developers (and still waiting) to make something truly exceptional for an adult audience was making wish I had something to do while all I could do was stay at home.So, nearly 2 years ago, we got one.  One of the first games that I ever played on it was Uncharted...and what a marvelous journey that was.  Here was an action game that was a cleverly disguised movie.  My wife actually enjoyed watching me play just so she could see how the CHARACTERS and STORY developed.  We became engrossed with Nathan Drake's adventure looking for the Man of Gold (\"El Dorado\").  The story took historical anectdotes, twisted them, and turned them into a great story.  We were introduced to our hero, Nathan Drake, as well as his crotchety partner, Sully, and an intrepid documentary film-maker Elena Fisher.I grabbed Uncharted 2 almost immediately after finishing the first one.  I was a little apprehensive at first since sequels tend to be quick cash grabs which may not be as intricate or were completed with obvious corners cut.  Not in this case.  Uncharted 2 introduced us to more characters, another potential love interest in the form of Chloe, and another fantastic tale that ultimately takes our heroes to a mysterious temple in Nepal.  The flashback form of the story was interesting and, although the plot twist was easy to spot, the twist was still sent up in a tradition that rivals most Hollywood releases today.I owe a lot to Naughty Dog for Uncharted and Uncharted 2 taking me out of a deep funk and marveling at what video games could achieve if developers took the time and effort to craft something extraordinary.Last December, I learned that Uncharted 3 was available for pre-order on Amazon.  And pre-order I did.  I received it last night and although I lag far behind others in reviewing it (60 already - amazing), I wanted to give it a fair shot.  I completed quite a bit of the game so far (it has been a late, late night!!) and I must say that IGN's review of 10/10 is dead on the mark.  The melee system of Uncharted 3 just makes a lot more sense, it's simpler, and adds a new dynamic to action sequences that Uncharted 1/2 did not have before.  Additionally, it's great to see \"old friends\" again.  Drake is in his usual confident, acrobatic swagger.  Sully is back as well along with Chloe and (later) Elena.*minor spoilers* Chapter 1 starts off with a bar-room brawl, introducing you to some of the new melee aspects.  Chapter 2 actually flashes back 20 years to when Drake and Sully first meet; it's almost done as an Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade introduction, but it feels a little more believable (remember - it's an action/adventure).  It also introduces you to other control techniques as well as introducing you to Nathan Drake's journal, where he keeps his clues.  Chapter 3...I won't spoil it, but it does introduce some additional stealth melee attacks that extend Nathan Drake's range in terms of handling different encounters. The story centers around another Sir Francis Drake fable with a rather interesting integration of T. E. Lawrence (a.k.a. \"Lawrence of Arabia\").  History buffs will actually enjoy this twisting of historical figures into yet another exciting adventure; it's cleverly done and, once again, Naughty Dog has done their homework (even referring to Lawrence's motorcycle \"accident\" in 1935??  Alluding to the fact that maybe it WASN'T an accident?  Brilliant!!  *end minor spoilers*Uncharted 3 reminds me once again why I'm glad that I got a PS3.  Uncharted 3 has characters that you can buy into, a story that keeps you rooted to the couch, and dialog that is so incredibly well-acted that it really does feel like you're watching a movie.  If the graphics in Uncharted 1/2 weren't convincing enough, Naughty Dog has upped the ante again, showcasing the PS3's ability for rendering beautiful environments, including adding detailed touches of sand clinging to and shaking off a character's head.  All the characters were motion-captured AND the voice actors are the same ones who are being captured, so the acting feels genuine because they are all tied together.  These are characters that are compelling enough to care about...and just as you think, \"that's enough for tonight...I'll finish Chapter 5 and go to bed...\"...well, another cutscene floats in and you're still tubing down that river of adventure, craving to find out more.Congratulations, Naughty Dog...Uncharted 3 makes me hope that a chance for a 4 is well and truly alive.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000A76ZNO","reviewerName":"James Hunt","summary":"Decent RPG","reviewText":"When starting the game it seemed like it was made for little kids but I stuck with it and it turned into a fairly good RPG.The game was very stable - zero crashes.  Graphics were good.Comedy was nicely interjected although some of it was pretty juvenile.  (farting and belching on command, I'm kind of surprised there wasn't an option for relieving yourself)I loved all the mini-games.  Actually I wish there was an option to export them to your computer and play them outside the game itself.At first I thought the economics were well done.  The prices were different based on the supply available.  Then I found out you could buy all of something from a merchant who had a large supply (at a low price) then turn right around and sell them back to him at a high price (since now he is out of them).  You could just continue to do that with the same merchant over and over.  He would have unlimited money so you could always make as much as you needed.  After that the game wasn't near as much fun.  I played through it to get to the end but the illusion of being in an alternate world was spoiled.  Its amazing to me how many developers mess up the economics in their games.  It should not be that complicated - just make sure that there are always useful/fun items to buy that are expensive enough that they take a long time to save the money.  Its just like in real life.  Why do you think so many athletes and movie stars get into so much trouble?  If things are too easy you just don't appreciate them.There were not enough hot keys to assign all the gestures, dances, spells, etc.You should be able to have a separate row of hot keys for different situations.  You could then toggle through them or the game could automatically bring up the right ones depending on the situation.  e.g.  one set of hot keys for combat, one for flirting, etc.The combat was too hectic for my taste.  Too often you would be attacked by a horde of monsters and the combat degenerated into a mashing of keys.  The requirement that you collect the experience instead of getting it automatically on the kill was just a needless complexity.Overall I'd say the developers did a very good job.  There were a lot of neat ideas that were put into the game.  Its definitely worth a look if you like RPG's.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2010"}

I mean I've played through most of the other installments in the Halo franchise and felt, what more needed to be said? I figured it would be the same thing here. More running and gunning, more ridiculously over the top explosions and more brutal kills. Of course, at its core, no FPS really gets way from those things. However Reach really did deliver some new elements into the Halo universe. First of all, it is pretty. The animation and character models are very nice. Remembering the primitiveness of Halo and Halo 2, and even comparing to Halo 3 and ODST, you've got a really nice looking game.The changes in gameplay are pretty standard, new button layouts, changes to existing weapons and additional weapons, as well as smarter, tougher AI enemies. The difference in toughness of the enemies is immediately apparent if you play one of the other games in the series right before or after this one. The hunters are a nightmare, in the best possible sense, a hulking, shambling engine of destruction that you can't just kill with one shot from a pistol, or a couple bursts from an SMG. The leader elites are strong and smart. Every once in a while you do find hiccups in the AI like an enemy trying to walk through things, or grenade sticking another enemy, but for the most part they are much smarter, and don't have the annoying human voices.The multiplayer is several notches above the previous installments. Firefight is the best addition to online multiplayer for this game. The standard online multiplayer is pretty much the same as before, a few different play modes, but nothing really too new. If you liked it before, you'll like it still. But firefight fleshed out and expanded the ODST version. You can get into this with your friends or with strangers online. You have 4 different options for the firefight battles and with the increasing difficulty of this  game mode it really doesn't get old.The music is still good as was the rest of the series.The story was done well, it had good moments and bad, but then again it was a video game story.The main game didn't feel very long, but I'd be more than willing to go back and play again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}

It's got the courtyard,the pit,the pit bottom and Goro's dungeon,but where are the rest??? I found that to be a major issue for me.Another problem I had with it,is alot of the backgrounds don't have the music in them,from the original games.It seems all kind of shuffled up.Lastly,another little issue is,you cannot perform a stage fatality in the pit 2,that was orginally in MK II,which IMO,was the best stage fatality out of the first three games(Including UMK3)...oh and why is Johnny Cage all of a sudden fighting with his shades on??? But Overall though,if you can overlook the little flaws,I guess this is a good game...but IMO in could have been somewhat better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-26-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000021Y5P","reviewerName":"Steve \"SBN\"","summary":"A good Game with a serious case of the Glitches","reviewText":"Mortal Kombat Trilogy, a fighting game that takes all of the characters from 1-3 and Ultimate MK3 and placed in a massive (at the time) fighting game. basically all of the same sprites from the other games (excluding Johnny Cage, which is the only new looking sprite in the game) put them in a fighting game that is just Mortal Kombat 1-3 with a few missing levels, missing the Pit 2 fatality animation, and adding 4 older versions of the characters with some horrible animation. I still like the older MK games, but with the age of the newer mortal kombats (Deadly Alliance, Deception and Armeggedon), these games feel a little too outdated. I think this is a great game but it has a ton of glitches (and there's only one good glitch in this game). when you turn on the 1 button fatality option and when you try to finish your opponent with your 1 button fatality, it doesn't always happen. sometimes you might end up still trying to finish your person off and no matter if you hit that person or whatever, you have to wait until the match is finished. When you play this on a PS2, if you have the speed doubled and you finish a match, it freezes on you, if you have the graphics level doubled and you either finish the match or something else that you do, it might or will freeze up. If you don't have either option on and you decide to start over from the beginning (that stupid buy in screen is what I am talking about), it freezes on you. The only good glitch in this game is that when you play as Noob Saibot and you do that jump and grab move, if your opponent is to the point to uppercutting him/her off the bridge and into the Pit 1 spikes, you can actually have that person fall all the way to the ground instead of just landing on the spikes and having them stopping the opponent falling all the way to the ground. you can actually see a little bit of blue on the bottom of the screen when this happens.because of these horrible flaws, thisis why I am giving the overall rating of 3. If this didn't happen, then yes I would recommend getting this, but because Armeggedon is coming out in a few days (which has all of the characters from the series, including Chameleon from the PSone version of MK Trilogy, Meat from MK4 and 2 new characters from the Konquest mode in that game and hopefully won't have any horrible glitches like this game does), it's probably pointless to get this. If you don't like PSone and you have a N64, get that version. If you don't have either but have a PC, try getting Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition and the PC version of MK4 (I think they released it for PC too). If you hate either PSone or N64, wait for Armeggedon. If you don't like the 2 systems and don't care for Armeggedon, get Deadly Alliance or Deception on the PS2, GC, or Xbox. If you don't like that, then youare out of luck.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2006"}

If you want to put something awesome under the tree, buy it.  Some people will be speechless.  Others will not.I only give the Kinect with Kinect Adventures 3 stars.  Some people feel this is harsh.  However, I have specific reasons for doing so.  The bottom line is:1) The kinect is very finicky.  Its the most finicky accessory I own, and I have a PS3, a wii, and an Xbox 360 with many accessories.  The reason its finicky is because of how it works.  Your clothing choices can affect its ability to track you.  The room lighting can affect whether the face recognition (auto-login) can work.  These aren't deal killers, but it's just not perfect.  You will still have fun, and most of you will enjoy it even though it's not perfect.2) The included game - Kinect Adventures - is not as deep as most games are.  It has more material than a demo game.  But it has less material than a full game.  Unlike wii+wii sports (or wii+wii sports resort) you will NOT get weeks and weeks of gameplay from Kinect Adventures.  Kinect Adventures IS FUN.  But for the price of this product, I expected more.3) This is not a paradigm shifting technology.  For those of you who know videogames, this is a VERY EXCELLENT IMPROVEMENT on what the Playstation 2 \"Eye Toy\" could do.  Considering how finicky the Kinect is, and the fact that Eye Toy technology is so old, I just think the Kinect is just \"OK\".  I am not bowled over by it because, um, I've been around.I fully expect that the price of the Kinect WILL COME DOWN in the near future and at that price it will be worth at least 4 stars.  And the technology will be improved and work better, and it will be worth 4 or 5 stars.  For now, I just give it 3.And yes, I enjoy playing the Kinect and I'm glad I got it.(end of short version)Long Version.There are a lot of videos that have been produced by Microsoft explaining what the Kinect does.  I will not be talking about how the technology works, you can watch one of the many advertisements to see that. The Kinect system is really fun and if you are looking for something cool to put under your tree - this is it!However, there are a few details I am critical about.  And, if you have small children I particularly urge you to be very patient with your kinect.  The kinect is finicky.  The most finicky system out there.1) The Kinect requires more room to play than any other game experience on the market today.  If you can't fit a 9x6 throw rug on the floor, then, you can't play kinect in that room. There are very few children's bedrooms which have enough floor space to play this game. It's a limitation of how it works, and it makes complete sense if you are considering that it is motion control. If you have a small amount of space (say, less than 8 feet) then it is only recommended to play one player at a time. If you have 10 to 12 feet of space in front of your TV, you can play two players at once.Did you catch that? Who has 10 to 12 feet of dead space in front of their TV? Some people, but not me. My couch is pushed back against the wall now. The coffee table is leaning against the right wall of the room.2) The Kinect respects a tidy room.  It has to establish the \"floor\" when it starts up. Microsoft has recommended that the floor be clean. The kinect cameras will have a more difficult time if you have clothes, schoolbooks, and papers everywhere. Before you play you may have to clean up a little. This is not a deal breaker, but the point is - its finicky.3) You must have a well lit area without shadows or gameplay will suffer.  Depending on the lights I have on in the room, the kinect may or may not be able to log me in, and often recommends that I set up a new account.  When you set up your KinectID, it even recommends that you re-run the tests in different lighting and at different times of day to make sure its accurate.  That's finicky.  There is no other game system out there which cares enough to make you run tests multiple times a day.  If you have a table lamp making a shadow across the game area, it may affect your gameplay (this is per a microsoft kinect video on youtube). The Kinect is slightly more finicky than, well, everything else.4) During play, its easy to get out of range. Kind of like playing a game with a dance mat, you can work your way too far forward or too far to the side. The Kinect does tell you that this has happened. **This will not be a big deal for kids 12 and over.** But if you have younger kids playing together, they often push each other out of range without meaning to.  In the river rapids, one kid will cross over the middle (in excitement) and the other kid just gets pushed out of the play field.  You might have to establish the box on the floor or they will get frustrated: we say, if you move off the carpet, the Kinect can't see you - which provides something you can tell with your feet.5) People who stand up are automatically added into play.  People who are not playing should often be to the side, NOT behind the player.  When I was watching the Kinetimals ad, I see the Mom and daughter #1 on the couch on the side wall, and daughter #2 playing. The chairs behind the player are empty. When they switch players, the Mom gets up, and the DAUGHTER SITS DOWN ON THE SIDE COUCH. This is an accurate representation of HOW YOU PLAY. But its not the normal way we (or most people I know) orient themselves and play.Why does this matter? Kids sometimes get tired of sitting and stand up, and the Kinect automatically tries to initialize them as a player whether anyone wants it to. I can even see geriatric people getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the game and causing the player to get a lower score. I only mention this because, like the Wii, I feel that the Kinect is an \"all ages\" system.As far as partying goes, if you are trying to get a high score, you need to have everyone in the room be a bit more controlled than if you were playing wii or xbox 360 with a controller. Thats right, party, but don't walk around! Don't stand behind the player.7) It has to be able to map your skeleton.  If you are wearing baggy pants, it will not be able to map your legs.  Did you ever think your clothing choices would matter?  Well, it does now!  Children who are 48 inches tall often have problems with the Kinect thinking they are kneeling. This can be compensated somewhat in the setup, but lets be honest: my list of things that can and will go wrong is getting a bit long.  The kinect is finicky.Yes, the Kinect could be that great for you. But no, it won't necessarily be.  All of these concerns can be fixed with a little trouble. They aren't deal killers. But the out-of-the-box experience is not always as magical as all of the 5 star reviews claim.Another reason I am giving this product 3 stars is because the included game does not have as much depth as either the wii sports (which came with the wii) or the Wii Fit game that came with the balance board. I've only been playing on the kinect a few days, and already I feel I need to go out and spend $40 on another game to utilize this new technology for my enjoyment. Don't jump to the wrong conclusion: Kinect Adventures is fun. We enjoyed it. But in my opinion it doesn't have as much lasting power as it should have. I am sure that when the next game arrives in a few days, I will give that GAME a 5 star review.This slight disappointment with the included game also tends to make me feel that the $150 price tag is a bit much. I'll spend $200 on the Wii, or $200 on the Kinect+1 game, when I've already bought an Xbox 360.  Its really easy to see that the Kinect costs a premium.  OR you can buy an Xbox with a Kinect for $100 more, without Kinect Adventures.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that this means that Kinect Adventures is being sold at a value of (wait for it) $50 and has limited play value.  I'm sorry, I'm still shaking my head over it.  This bundle is just not worth the money!I've also been around the block and remember the Playstation Eye toy, and I congratulate the Kinect team on making a motion control sensor that is about 300% better than the Eyetoy, if such an improvement can even be quantified.  But.  The Eye Toy Play 2 with Camera is still less than $20 and I think the Kinect can come down in price a bit too.When the price of the kinect comes down, or the included game is improved, or the controls are not so finicky, then I will gladly add a star. Right now, I think the value is \"its ok\" which is 3 stars.The BOTTOM LINE:**Overall I would highly recommend the Kinect.** I think the game is very fun. My wife vastly prefers it to the wii. Anyone who dislikes video games where you have to push certain button combinations will prefer the Kinect. So I do think its worth buying. Its not perfect, but it is different.  But I think its far from perfect and THIS BUNDLE does not deserve more than 3 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2010"}

Using the environment as your camouflage Snake makes his way to a small defunct post to rescue the man, but after you rescue him things suddenly turn for the worse.Your mentor, instructor and lover, only know as The Boss, has betrayed you, using a special forces unit, called Cobras, that goes beyond the fantastic, has crossed over and defected to the Soviet Union, taking along two \"Davy Cocottes\" recoilless rifles that can fire nuclear warheads. One of these weapons is used to destroy the weapons factory; sparking massive crisis. After Snake has thoroughly been beaten the crap out of, he is quickly patch up and sent out into the field again, this time to stop a third world war.

And similar to Splinter Cell, you can use the environment as your camouflage, also change what uniform you are wearing and apply face paint. With five levels of game play you can challenge yourself with tougher enemies and less weapons.MGS3 has all the thrills of Japanese Anime, along with all of the plot twist, the slight feel of a James bond movie (a Bondish theme song and love story) and all the American Gun Ho-ness you can digest.I love to see Kojima remake his original Metal Gear games, both the ones that appeared in the US and the games that are only available in the Japanese market, to show a new generation of gamers what this heavily detail franchise is about.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

Final Fantasy XII is the only Final Fantasy I haven't finished. I managed to get in about 50 hours of gameplay, and even with that investment I think I'm still only halfway through the story.Which reminds me, where is the story in this game? This is the first time I played a FF game where I honestly can't even remember what it's about. I tried picking up where I left of some time ago, only to give up in frustration again. The characters are about as boring as they come. Vaan, the protagonist, is a whiny teenage boy (what a surprise..) who is rebelling about something, and he wants to be a pirate, and he's pissed about some stuff, and the other people in the party are angry about something too, though you wouldn't really know it since they appear to have no emotions whatsoever. The dialogue, which is hidden somewhere between the endless monster grinding and side-questing, is about as bland as natural flavored oatmeal. There are no witty one-liners, there are no heated debates, they just tend to walk along stating facts, making dreary comments about the socio-political problems of their world. If I wanted that, I would watch C-SPAN, not play a video game.What this game really lacks, and desperately needed, was a bad guy. Oh there's some Prince or whatever who's manipulative and sneaky, but it's so dull. Bad guys need to be bad, they need to have an evil laugh, you need to see them torch a village to the ground so you can hate them and want them to die. FFXII has villains, but they're not interesting, there's no drama, there's no excitement or anything.The gameplay is really contradictory, the battle system has you auto attacking for basically 80% of all battles. Then there's about 200 different macros, or gambits, that you can make to help make the game even more dull! But wait, it's not gonna be that simple, you have to find all of the gambit parts first, oh and if you want to cast spells, you have to first buy the spell, and then learn the talent for it. That wouldn't be so bad if the spell buying system wasn't so completely frustrating. Oh you want this spell? Sorry this store doesn't carry it, but you could go past a dozen loading screens and check the other store, which probably doesn't have it either. Which brings me to another point: loading screens. My god this game is absolutely plagued by them. The maps for all the towns and places are divided into dozens of sub-sections. Getting to the sewers in the main city will probably mean you need to get through 5 or 6 loading screens. And I hope to god you have all the maps memorized, you don't want to have to look them up, since getting to the map where you're at will require you to load about 5 screens because when you bring up the map, you start completely zoomed out instead of zoomed in.This game just goes out of its way to frustrate people. And no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get past how badly it was made. The soundtrack is so dull, it's lacks any sort of emotion or creativity. I usually buy soundtracks ahead of time, because FF music is always worth it. Well it wasn't for this one, it sounded like a regurgitation of the FFT:A soundtrack.All in all there's about a hundred RPGs I'd recommend for play before this one. If you missed this title and are afraid you're missing out on something then don't worry, this game is something you can miss without regret.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-30-2010"}

It's fun all around until you get to the point that you're just racing and doing car demolition for most of the game. Each portion is fun, but weak by themselves. All together though, each portion makes it solid. Only problem is that it starts to feel like you're just playing a series of mini-games (Go there, shoot them, activate switch, drive there, shoot them, come back, race, race dangerously, get paid, repeat) which makes it feel tired after a few hours. Each part of that really only takes a few minutes. The longest mission took me about 10 minutes. Each race is only 3 short laps which takes about 2 minutes (4 if you count the load screens).

Here is the stuff they didnt cover. First off, the game is 3 disk. BUT only really 2, 3rd disk is multiplayer. And the second disk is maybe half the length of the first. So dont go buying it thinking it will play out for months. I played some side missons and the main and it took me 10 hours first run through. Second, the ending might just be the worst ending I have seen. It came out of nowhere and just kinda left you sitting there with your mouth open. What The?!The only other thing that keeps this game from being perfect is the boring characters you run into. Subway town has the best ones, but the other characters just are so boring. Rest of the game rocks, and rocks hard.Lots of Fun, already beat it and want to run through it again. Graphics are amazing, guns are amazing. Story is great, exciting world to run around in. Its like DOOM meets ROAD WARRIOR. If you like first person shooters with some serious bang behind them pick this up! Also, something interesting.

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"C.

{"product_name":"B000CBCVFE","description":"Resident Evil: Deadly Silence is a DS-exclusive remake of the first Resident Evil game, with the DS's unique features in mind. Work your way through the classic storyline as Jill Valentine & Chris Redfield work their way through that well-known mansion. You'll find that there's no solace in a room that you think you've completely freed from zombie infestation.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Ten Years and Still an Incredible Game!","reviewText":"When Resident Evil first debuted in 1996, it was an instant classic.  This is THE game that is responsible for the genre, \"Survival Horror\" and ten years later, you can play it on the go with your Nintendo DS.The story is almost known to everyone in the gaming world nowadays, but let's take a recap.  The STARS Bravo Team has disappeared while investigating nasty murders in the mountains near an old mansion.  The Alpha team has been sent into these mountains to find their comrades, and are immediately chased into this mansion full of horror.  As Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine, you'll have to survive the mansion and its terrors and unravel a conspiracy beyond belief.Almost everyone knows the story, and on the Nintendo DS you'll find you can play through it in classic mode, rebirth mode or Wi-Fi mode.  Capcom has been known for giving you different scenarios, and Resident Evil shows that perfectly.  At the beginning you can choose to either be Chris or Jill.  Chris can take more damage, although Jill has an easier time navigating the mansion, and gets some fairly more powerful weapons early on.Classic Mode is basically the exact same game that was presented to us in 1996.  Most--if not all--the regular enemies are still where they once were, all the secrets are unchanged and everything.  If you still remember the game from ten years ago, it hasn't changed.  Not at all.Rebirth Mode is worthwhile, though.  Upon playing it, there are more enemies in place, and from time to time when you enter a room you'll be in the first person perspective, fighting against an enemy that is creeping toward you.  It is your job to use the stylus to slash at your enemy until he dies.  At first this seems stupid, but it's actually really fun and intense.The map is displayed on screen at all times, so unlike before, you don't constantly have to bring up the map.  When you take damage the top screen also flashes, which is actually more of a distraction than anything.Wi-fi mode, while great to have, really isn't as worthwhile as you might think.  Everyone needs the game card.  You can have up to four players going through a portion of the mansion.  Whether you are cooperating or competing the objective is the same, to get to the goal as fast as you can.  In cooperating, you both have the same life gauge and you both go at it on your own.  In competative, you're both against one another trying to see who can get there the fastest.However, the problem is that you don't ever get to actually see your partner.  You're both going through these portions of the mansion but you won't run into one another, and that takes the joy out of it, really.  So wi-fi really isn't worth it.I must say, though, it's fun to play through classic and rebirth mode to check out the differences.  While it is just a port, the differences aren't just small things you won't notice at all.The controls are still a bit clunky.  Yes, up is still going to be the button to move forward at all times.  And if you're used to Resident Evil 4, it may be hard to go back to those fixed camera angles.  So even veterans of the series may have to readjust.The graphics aren't bad, but they are, for the most part, dated.  They don't quite live up to the DS's potential, but they do look a little neater than they did on the PSX.  The music is hair-raising, and is still your only warning sign of danger.  Especially the sound effects of shuffling zombies, dogs clicking on the ground.  This stuff sounds even better with the DS's stereo sound.  The voice acting is still laughable, and I suppose that's actually amusing.  The dialogue is so bad that it's classic.  You'll be saying to yourself, \"Wow, we've come a long way as far as voice acting and scripts are concerned.\"  Again, if you just got off Resident Evil 4, this could be something that takes a moment to get used to.  Still, the fact that you can laugh at the voices shows that the game really is a classic, as voice acting really has come a long way.The major problems with this game are simple.  It's a game that's already been redone.  The Director's Cut and Gamecube versions.  Also, it's a game where its age really does show.  Can Resident Evil survive the test of time?  The answer is, yes, it can.  But unfortunately, a port might not hold true.  In fact, if you've still got the original one (or the Director's Cut) it's hard to actually recommend this title to you.  Rebirth Mode is great, and it's also fun to have it on the go, but there just isn't enough new content to it.  It's a great game, and after ten years it's still a blast to play.  But for Resident Evil's ten year anniversary, I was expecting more extras and secrets.  Still, I'd say it is worth it.  Pick it up, enjoy it, and relive the classic game that invented a genre.The Good+Classic Game+Classic Story+Interesting Puzzles+The map is now displayed on the top screen+New Touch Screen antics are really nice+Graphics are smoother+The Music is still really good+You just have to admit that after ten years, the game is still pretty damn good!The Bad-The voice acting is terrible.  Although, I like that you can see just how far games have come, you'll find yourself laughing in spite of the games overall serious tone.-There just weren't enough new extras for this port.  Yes, it's nice to have a rebirth mode, and it's nice to carry it around, but there could've been more extras thrown in here.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2006"}

Maybe it was me, but I couldn't seem to switch the movement keys to the right hand arrow keys nor would it allow me the use of my Xbox 360 controller. I fooled around with it a bit and it was a real chore to have the movement on left hand side of the KB and the mouse look around function there too. This required me to reach all the way across my KB with my left hand to control the on screen movement. A real bummer to me.

You get a physical \"guitar\" controller with this game, and it's amazingly fun!You hold the controller just like a real guitar, and it's switchable for left handed players. The neck of the guitar has 5 buttons on it that you play with your left hand. In the center of the guitar is a \"strum\" button that you hit to play the notes. There's even a metal bar to wiggle, to cause the notes to \"bend\" to give an extra crowd boost.If you're not a big hard rock / metal fan, there's only a few songs to choose from. You get Ziggy Stardust, Crossroads, Killer Queen, Sharp Dressed Man, More than a Feeling and a few more. Those who like harder rock will be quite thrilled, though. There's Iron Man, I Wanna Be Sedated, Symphony of Destruction, You've Got Another Thing Comin' and much more.There are four difficulty levels. You start with easy of course, where it's great fun to play along with your favorite songs and just have fun. When you crank up to the higher levels - moving through various venues and unlocking different characters and guitars - the keys get VERY difficult. Still, it's a blast hammering away at the notes, waving your guitar around in the air and having fun.The sound is quite good, and you get a real boost from hearing the crowd cheer and yell for you. The visuals are reasonable - but really, this isn't a game about visuals. You just watch for the buttons to press, and press them. It's really about the music.Now, I do have to mention some complaints. The first is the song list. I wish they'd offered more of a wide selection of song types. I suppose that new games will come out soon with more song options, which I'll look forward to.Next is the key layout. I really love the strum bar. But the buttons up on the neck of the guitar are AWFUL. They have 5 wide buttons all in a straight line. The buttons have to be pressed straight in to work well. Human fingers simply don't work that way. They should have put the buttons at an angle - both angled a bit diagonally the way a hand holds a guitar neck, and also angled up-down so that your fingers press into them at an angle. As it is now, the buttons tend to stick and jam. When you fail at a really complex song because the keys have stuck, it's very frustrating.That being said, you can usually get through an hour or two before your fingers really start to kill you. If you play with a group of friends, passing the guitar around between songs, that means an afternoon can go by before all of you end up with finger pain. I suppose it's a built in way to ensure that you don't play video games all day long :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00004U1R2","description":"Conker's Bad Fur Dayis for adults, the ESRB has rated thisgame Mature; it should not be bought for--or played by or around--children. That stated, the story of the game is the following: Conker's verygoodnight turns into a very bad day. He has to deal with a crazy and abusive world, all while suffering through a massive hangover. Conker encounters abusive paint pots; jabbering dung beetles; trigger-happy, scar-faced Tediz; and a belligerent giant, with only a frying pan as a means of self-defense. He is resourceful, however, and makes the best of his situation. The game combines elements of 3-D exploration, combat, and puzzle solving. It features cinematic cutscenes, movie parodies, facial expressions, dozens of unhinged characters, and 1- to 4-player deathmatch games in a variety of styles.","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"What a Suitable Death Toll for the N64","reviewText":"My problem with Conker doesn't have as much to do with the idea so much as it does the follow-through. In all honesty, I was thrilled to hear the company had recognized their own flaws and were attempting to reconcile for them by releasing a shockingly robust title that seemed to spit in the face of everything they'd done since the debates caused by the home release of the original Mortal Kombat. However, I left my initial playing with the sense that the while idea itself was exactly what the company needed, the execution was more than a tad lacking.The story plays out like a theatrical feature, which is appropriate considering the number of situations the game eventually borrows from popular films. Glass of milk (or is it a white russian?) in hand and a scowl plastered upon his face, Conker is immediately reminiscent of the kind of anti-hero popularized by Bruce Willis in Die Hard or Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction. Surrounded by his supposed friends and acquaintances, this introductory scene was a great way to set the tone of the story and introduce a hardened, slightly older version of the title's namesake. The moment the king's flashback begins is when the player begins to take control of the action.There's a lot of Hollywood inspiration in Conker's tale. From the little nuances and cliches such as the opening scene, to borrowed scenes or tips of the hat to films like the location of the King's throne at the end of the game, to straightforward rip-offs of memorable scenes or films like the unquestionably Matrix bank heist, this cartridge is chock full of film-lore. And, to its credit, the vast majority of the game's quirks, nods and thefts are handled very well, with just enough originality and additional humor thrown in to make it work within the broad confines of its storyline.For the most part, the story is successful. Its film parodies are spot on, while its original threads tend to lag behind a bit and force a joke just for the sake of it. It feels like the game was rushed, and rather than waiting for the inspiration to create something undeniably funny, the writers instead went with whatever they came up with the fastest. In addition, there's little if any direction as to what you should be doing at any point in the story. Bad Fur Day is a big fan of putting you in the middle of an immense area with no visual clues as to where you should go from there, then erecting giant invisible walls out of thin air and hoping that their placement will corral you into the exact area in which you should be. Successful or not, this method is employed over and over and over again, from the game's start until its finish.While the storyline is competent for the most part, the actual control and gameplay itself is nearly unforgivable. Physically controlling Conker is a complete nightmare. Even the use of the N64's well-designed analog joystick can't save this horribly imprecise setup, as the squirrel will occasionally veer left or right without explanation or mosey over the edge of a cliff moments after you've told him to stop moving entirely. Conker does have a sort of double-jump feature, in that through the use of his tail he can hover in the air for a couple additional seconds. He can also perform a high jump and a long jump, by crouching or running for a few second before leaping, accordingly. Unfortunately, these high jump and long jump options only seem to work when they feel like it. I've been running for upwards of a full minute, jumped, and watched Conker perform a weak little sissy jump and fall to his doom. This game really feels like something that wasn't fully tested before its release, the controls reek of incompletion.Add onto that one of the most horrific cameras in the history of 3-D rendering, and you've already got a pissed off gamer. Seriously, you're given supposed control of these angles through the use of the C buttons (similar to the way the camera is maneuvered in The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time), but as soon as you find a vantage point you're comfortable with and release the C button, it just goes off on its own and returns to a completely unhelpful, useless view. This camera cannot pass through walls, so if your back is against one and you're trying to prepare for a complicated, lengthy, precise leap, you've got to do it blind. Better still, once you've made up your mind and attempted said jump, the camera will awkwardly spin as soon as it's got room to get behind you, effectively reversing your controls in mid-air and introducing a loss of direction to your life.The audio is one of the few undeniable triumphs of this one. The voice acting is tremendous, Conker's voice suits him perfectly and the actors themselves seem to be having a lot of fun with the material. The music is the usual fare for Rare platformers, light and bouncy, and serves as a constant joke considering the circumstances surrounding it. Little tidbits like the main character mumbling to himself and retching when he's drunk, or fighting back bile while rolling an enormous ball of poo really make a difference in the experience, and are things I wish more games took the time to incorporate.When push comes to shove, there's really only one thing you can create with the ingredients provided by Conker's Bad Fur Day, and that's disappointment. There's no question in my mind this game needed another couple months of production before it was ready to ship, and looking back it should be regarded as the poster boy for the N64's lifespan. This game wasn't created to entertain and enamor so much as it was to annoy, frustrate and defeat.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2004"}

My understanding is Uncharted 2 is better, but I don't know how.  This game is a case-study in what adventure games can and should be.Disclaimer:  I love adventure movies.  Indiana Jones...The Goonies...National Treasure...Tomb Raider...even Sahara.  Movies that take a solitary adventurer and pit him/her against dark forces and things of the past for the sake of treasure.  So, to be able to actually PLAY an adventure movie was a dream come true.Others have said Uncharted is cinematic, and I think thats an understatement.  Naughty Dog (who I hadnt heard from since Keef the Thief on Amiga, does anyone remember that one?) has accomplished this interactive blockbuster by several means:Graphically, this ranks amongst the top in the genre, maybe the top in all of videogames.  Its up there.  Texture and rendering are unbelievably deep.  Moss on rocks.  Leaves, flowing vegetation, the light bouncing off swaying palms.  Sunsets off the seascape.  Overcast skies in the rainforest.  Extremely realistic water flow, and how your clothes stay \"wet\" after you emerge from swimming.  The motion blur of the background when you pan the camera view.  The vividness of the color palatte is amazing, and will put your HD TV through its paces (as it should).  This game is a reason to buy an HDMI cable.  The main distraction from gameplay is that you want to stop and take pictures.  Its beautiful.The beauty helps support the solid gameplay.  Do you remember the first time you played Tomb  Raider, how exciting it was (and how quickly it became a test of patience and unnecessary precision)?  Uncharted takes all the good things you remember from past adventure games like it and discards the bad.  The puzzles are thought provoking and challenging, but not arbitrary (pull some box, set off some weighted-tile, etc, etc, etc).  Things have a clear purpose, and navigating the platforming portion of the game doesnt require perfection (and 100 restarts).Sound is on a par with everything else in the game.  Music is perfectly matched to the scenario, and epic in its sounds and scope.  Great, great scoring.  Less important, but a detail I appreciated was surround sound accuracy, especially when you pan the camera view.  They didnt have to do this, but it adds so much depth to the game.  Buy a surround sounds system for games like this.Minor gripes - gunfights are realistic enough, but how many 7.62mm bullets does it take to drop a bad-guy?  Was my AK disfunctional?  Also (and this is a common gripe from what I've read) the wonky camera angles can sometimes throw you off as you dash, climb, and swing along a vertigo-inducing cliff face.  That being said, those same pesky camera views can sometimes immerse you in the scene, making it seem like you really are part of a movie in progress.Uncharted has it all, the look, the voice-acting, the mechanics, the humor...I put this in my Top 10 games of all time, easily.  If you are new to the PS3 (and were always sort of jealous of Uncharted when you owned a 360), you owe it to yourself to make this part of your permanent collection, especially as it is now at am amazing price-point.  This is a game that will define this console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2009"}

It's hard for me to swallow the fact that I'm now an elderly in the gaming world. Which makes me sad about this game on the PS Vita. The graphics is great, as long as you can see it, and herein lies the problem for older gamers like myself. Our eye sight is just not what it used to be, so when the developer ports the 1080p game graphics to a tiny screen without resizing the assets (including many a menu screen), it's very frustrating for us. It doesn't have to be this way; other Vita racing games can be a joy to play. Here everything is just too small on the screen, so it's all too easy to crash into a bridge support or another car. Navigating the map is pretty much impossible for anyone older than 40.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-24-2013"}

I'm now on level 26, have over $7 Million credits and over 70 cars, and 31 percent game completion. I must say that playing GT3 and GT4 definitely helped me prepare for this. After finishing the entire GT3 and GT4 and the first day of GT5 with a controller, I broke down and bought the Logitech DFGT wheel. My god this driving wheel not only enhances your ability but the overall enjoyment of the game. Really, a driving wheel is a must for this game. While it's true that there's no car damage factor in the game, everything else is spot on realistic. I definitely enjoyed this game more that Forza Motorsport 3. There's so many different aspects of this game that makes it so deep. Driving licenses, special and seasonal challenges, the various A-Spec races...it's all good!  Just be very careful when buying or selling expensive cars and/or modifications because everything's automatically saved and there's no going back for redos. Getting all golds in certain challenges are very hard but so fulfilling and memorable once achieved such as the Go Karts, Jeff Gordon Nascar and Top Gear. For a real challenge, try doing races without the driving line. I haven't even touched the B-Spec yet. The best racing game in my opinion, and I've tried them all. Simply gorgeous on my 42\" plasma screen.Update...22 days of glorious racing and I completed the game's final special challenge while on level 31. I got all Bronze on Vettel's X1 Challenge. I never sweated so much playing a video game in my life. The sheer sense of achievement and exhilaration felt after successfully finishing Suzuka was just amazing. I also loved the joy I experienced after getting all Gold in Loeb's Rally Challenge. Wow, I got Vettel's Red Bull X2010 to reach a top speed of 307 MPH on the Indy Track(with draft). Also, the Ferrari F1 races in the seasonal events is a great idea. Now I just need to rest my thumbs from the force feedback wheel :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A beautiful shooter with excellent multiplayer","reviewText":"The Good: Looks amazing, tighter controls and weapons, new weapons are awesome, jetpacks!, the story is engaging, the characters are well fleshed out, varied game play and environments, the multiplayer is super addictive and funThe Bad: Difficulty is poorly balanced, not enough multiplayer maps, doesn't do much to the core FPS game play to make it feel revolutionaryOnce you start calling out beloved franchises and threatening to kill them you will get scrutinized for it by fan boys/girls. The first Killzone (released in November of 2004) was deemed a Halo killer and was Sony's late attempt to create an FPS killer app that would dominate Halo. It failed big time due to the lack of power the PS2 had and Killzone was released with lots of slow down and didn't look nearly as good as Halo 2. It's sepia toned art style was also a turn off from Halo's colorful world. So, Killzone 2 was shown and trumped Halo 3 in a lot of ways (mainly graphics) and became PS3 owners favorite FPS.Fast forward almost 7 years from the first game and Killzone 3 is an unstoppable juggernaut and a huge technical powerhouse. Plus don't forget about the astounding multi player suite. The single player campaign has always been touch and go for some people, but I personally think Killzone 3 has the strongest single player in the series and even stacks up (or is better) than some of today's FPS single player campaigns.You play, once again, as Sevchenko and you're righting the genocidal Helghast army, but this time it's a lot more personal and the ISA are really in some trouble. After assassinating General Vasari at the end of Killzone 2 the ISA squad has to stop a new rising threat while the Helghast high council tries to use a new super weapon to wipe out Earth. It sounds clich&eacute; but the characters are engrossing, and they are more fleshed out and their personalities are deepened which makes for a more riveting story. You really feel like you're on the brink of defeat due to the constant struggle for survival. The dialog is sharp, and the set pieces are phenomenal which makes for a roller coaster campaign.You really care for the all the characters in this game since it feels like it was directed like a movie. Every scene is carefully plotted out and the action compliments it. Speaking of action that's what Killzone is all about. Shooting guns in this game feels tighter and a bit faster than the past games. The recoil has been toned down so not every weapon feels completely inaccurate which makes the game not so hard as well. The old weapons are slightly upgraded so they feel nicer to wield around, but the new weapons kick ass. The WASP is a portable mortar which homes in on enemies and if you zoom in you can use it as a one shot artillery strike. The Arc Cannon shoots green energy and makes enemies explode, so this naturally replaces the lightning gun.There are also more weapons that you can carry such as detachable turrets that you can store on your person for later. Ammo crates scattered around help you stay loaded up on ammo for your favorite guns, but being able to carry a normal weapon and a heavy is a great change. The jetpack is a new addition and it feels great to fly and works well in multi player. There are also some other parts of the campaign mixed up with vehicle sections and even a section in space! The campaign never gets boring and is constantly changing things on you and this includes environments (more on that later).Shooting overall feels better than the past games and is really fun. The guns have weight to them, but not the annoying weight where it makes the game feel slower. Aiming is a lot better since it's not as stiff as the past games as well. Killzone 3 is also heavily cover based so you can't just run and gun or you will die almost instantly. This requires strategy with the weapons you choose and I love this a lot.When it comes to looks Killzone 3 shines over any FPS out right now. Fighting the huge MAWLR at the end of the game is just jaw dropping since everything has such detail. It seems impossible for Guerrilla to have squeezed so much power out of the PS3, but it really shows here. This game just looks astounding with a ton of background detail and not just in the foreground. Everything moves, everything feels dynamic and the lighting is amazing. Killzone 3 tries to dodge the complaints about the \"boring\" sepia tone by adding color to the environments without ruining the art style. Fighting in snow, lots of reds and oranges and Helghan, the burning city of Pyrhhus in the beginning of the game plus not to mention all the green from the new super weapon's energy.The multi player is extremely fun and more refined this time around and the unlocking and level up system is addictive. Using points to unlock new gear keeps you coming back and the more you play the better you get like in any great FPS. The maps are very well designed and don't feel so random like they did in the past games. There are great spots for strategy and learning the maps only takes a few play throughs. Each class has its own unique abilities and you will want to try them all because not every weapon is available for every class. I never had so much fun on a PS3 FPS online than I did in Killzone 3.When it comes to 3D and the Move I couldn't test this fully, but I have tried a bit of each and I have to say the Move feels great to use, but not as tight as the controller. the 3D is also great for certain moments of the game, but other times you won't notice much. Apart from this you in for a great ride with Killzone 3 due to its varied game play (the stealth section actually works!) to the brutal melee kills that add a \"Hell Yeah!\" factor to multi player. Even being able to be healed when you die in the campaign makes the game feel fresh. Everything is tighter and even looks better than the last game, and that's worth my $60.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002I0F5M8","description":"","reviewerName":"Son of Tiamat","summary":"Conquests of the Caped Crusader","reviewText":"Anybody who has played Batman: Arkham Asylum and loved it knows precisely why it was such an amazing game. Take one part Matrix: Path of Neo for epic, super-human martial arts beat-em up; ad in another part Splinter Cell style sneaking around in dark environments for tense moments that test skill and patience; throw in some cool gadgetry to help you along the way like in Ape Escape; mix it in with amazing graphics, superb voice actors, and arguably the greatest super-hero ever and you had Batman: Arkahm Asylum.So, how much more can such an already amazing game offer us if given a sequel? Apparently, a whole lot more.If you can believe it, the intro to Arkham City is even better and more pulse-pounding than the intro to the first. You start off, not as Batman, but as Bruce Wayne, who is lobbying against Arkham City. I won't give anything away about what soon happens to our seemingly mild-mannered aristocrat, but I will say this...laying the beat down on some thugs as the boy-billionaire is one of coolest experiences I've had in gaming.Soon afterwards, you suit up. Now you are Batman, but this isn't a self-contained island you're dealing with anymore. This is a no man's land. Pouncing on an unsuspecting group of baddies isn't as simple as it used to be; there are always more goons lurking around the corners, ready to jump into the fray like a vicious pack of wolves. More than once you'll find yourself overwhelmed and having to flee a fight while the stinging insults of said goons follow in your wake. Take my advice and just let it go. Survival is the name of the game.If you've been watching Youtube then you've no doubt seen Batman's new flight mechanics. These are as fun in practice as they are to watch, although there is a learning curve to gliding effectively. There's also a pesky helicopter searching for you at all times. These guys are Tyger, Hugo Strange's own henchmen. Avoiding the helicopter can be tricky, but also fun.As you'd expect, Arkham City plays almost exactly like the first one with a few tweaks and upgrades. Batman starts off with most of the same gadgets he had at the end of the first, including the grapple gun, the cryptographic sequencer and the remote batarang. He also has several new moves for melee situations. Batman must've been taking lessons from Chuck Norris because his martial arts are better and flashier than ever. He now has the ability to perform a counter-attack against two or more assailants at a time instead of just one. He has a new punch combo attack where he repeatedly thrusts with each press of the button. As Batman lays down an 18 punch combo on a single guy, or gigantic goon, I can't help but think of Kenshiro! \"The one-hundred crack fist of the North Star! You're already dead!\" Oh, but...this is Batman so minus the brutal killing of your foes. Let's just say he's more like Donkey Kong when beating up some Tikis.The new combat moves make the game as fun as ever but also makes NOT using them an exercise in restraint. As stated before, enemies can show up when you least suspect and they sometimes pack heat. This will undoubtedly force all of us to use our brains even more when devising effective plans of attack. To aid in stealthy takedowns are a new set of \"predator moves\" where Batman can use far more takedowns from different hiding positions than he had previously. Again, a new set of moves and abilities to augment the ones we had before in Arkham Asylum. It's almost like the first game just laid the foundation and the sequel built onto it!In addition to the main story mission are additional side missions that will pop up along the way. These may have you saving random inmates from other, worse inmates, to working with Bane to dispose of drums of Titan chemicals (Titan once more plays into the game's story) to solving mysteries planted by the Riddler. (By now we've all heard the \"Riddler is Jigsaw!\" equations made by everyone so I won't bore you with that. I don't even like Saw). You may want to hold off on the missions that involve Zaasz making you run across Arkham City to answer telephones until you've unlocked some flying upgrades. Certain henchmen will be highlighted in green. These are henchmen you can interrogate to acquire more info about the various crime lords they are working under. Taking them out last to initiate interrogation is a tough and not always fun exercise that we will nevertheless do in order to gain more precious XPs.This game has a dark look and feel that pulls you in. Jumping across rooftops as the Batman is a whole `nother experience from doing it as Spiderman. The dingy, grungy look of the city, the background music and ambience. All of these together invade your subconscious until you feel alive with primal, survival instincts. I can't even describe it, really. You feel like a predator, but also like the prey. You're always walking a narrow line between seeming invincibility, and utter helplessness. This game puts you in a place all of us have been our whole lives without always realizing. When we dreamed we were running from danger, or dreamed we were conquering obstacles to achieve glory. This is just a personal opinion, of course, but I'd swear I've seen this in my dreams. Maybe I was just dreaming of being the Batman. This is as close as any of us will likely get.The villains look fantastic. Mr. Freeze, interestingly enough, has a huge suit that reminds me of the Mr. Freeze suit from Batman and Robin. I apologize for even bringing THAT movie up, but the suit in that movie was still cool looking. Mr. Freeze looks menacing and sounds awesome with the voice talents of Maurice LaMarche (the guy who was Brain in Pinky and the Brain and about a million different voices in Futurama!) Penguin looks viscious and cruel and is twice as ruthless, no doubt to overcome his own size. Twoface looks somewhere between The Animated Series version and the Dark Knight version. Then there's the unexpected appearance of Solomon Grundy who looks like a nightmarish Frankenstein's monster and who is even bigger than Killer Croc!In summation, Arkahm City is anther step forward for an already revolutionary game franchise. There are the usual shortcomings, however. You may find yourself wandering around, not knowing what to do until you trigger the right event to move the game forward. Figuring out some of the new controls may be a chore even to veteran players. And the boss fights still feel like, well, boss fights. Run around, dodge attacks and wait for the inevitable weak point to expose itself. Standard video game stuff, really. Of course, that's just all part of the experience. If it was too easy we wouldn't enjoy it as much, would we?There's no reason for anyone who liked Arkahm Asylum to not like this one. If you didn't like the first one then I don't know how I could recommend this to you. It's the same game, just much bigger. If you don't like sandbox sandbox games and prefer something linear you can still focues on just the main mission. On the whole it's the same game, just with more stuff. That may be good news to some and bad news for others. For fans of the first, it definitely delivers. We finally got the new Batman Game, now just three more weeks til Skyrim!**Update**Some people may compare this game's story, not unjustly, to Escape from NewYork. Maybe they're just nitpicking, though. Even if that's the case, there are still plenty of twists and turns to keep players genuinely surprised right up until they get to of the end main mission.I'm afraid I can't comment much on DLC since they have it in such a way that different people get different things. I've heard after a certain point, though, we'll all be able to download the same content...for a price.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2011"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City.

{"product_name":"B001UEN67Y","reviewerName":"Matthew A. Schneider","summary":"Slightly lacking on fun factor.","reviewText":"This games is so beautiful to look at, and you can tell that people worked very hard to  make such a polished gaming experience.  The realism is actually what takes away from the game for me, though.  The vehicles control so realistically, and everything feels like it's almost real world.  But it just doesn't feel fun.  It's more for the realistic racing sim fan.  If you like gran turismo games, you would feel right at home with this one.  The only thing that makes it feel a bit arcadey is the rewind feature when you crash.  You get a couple icons per event that allow you rewind time after you crash.  It's kind of like the sand dagger in the prince of persia games.  That does give you at least one feature that I really enjoyed.  I will say, though, that there is definitely an audience for this game.  Alot of people will enjoy the realism, and awesome graphics.  But if you're looking for an arcade type racer, with cool crashes, and an insane sense of speed, this title doesn't really deliver.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2010"}

From there it's basically a whirlwind of a nearly 40 minute setpiece involving characters on a massive scale, an epic boss fight and some light platforming to break up the action. In a way, this sequence sets up for what you're going to be playing for this roughly 10 hour game (the save point before the long final boss/ending sequence has me at 9 hours 31 minutes) which is graphically gorgeous, refined gameplay from previously and an impressive sense of scale. From there, game doesn't quite match the heights but it's still an incredibly solid adventure but in a way that's kind of the problem with a massive opening sequence; the rest of the game just doesn't have it again but does perform really adequately with what it does show. So 3 years in the making, new director, new system...how does the 3rd installment hold up? Pretty damn well, have to say.Story: As I said before, the game starts you off with Kratos going after Zeus but naturally like God of War 2 or Metroid games, certain things happen that force you to essentially restart from scratch and we go into a tale of Kratos wanting to enact vengeance and near literally kills everyone who stands in his way. From there we will meet familiar gods, battle massive titans and go in and around Mount Olympus as we make our way back to Zeus. Best thing about the story is the pacing which like Uncharted 2, seems to do a really great job at making you feel like you're actually progressing in the game instead of hitting these weird slow areas (remember finding those stupid Sirens in the sandstorm in the first one?) but the opening sequence with Poseidon opens with a bang and it settles into a nice groove and while there isn't anything as jaw-dropping of a scene afterwards, game never lets up and you might find yourself playing longer than you thought you were.Graphics: I'll get one negative out of the way as far as graphically: this game didn't constantly stun me like Uncharted 2 which front to back looks phenomenal. In this game, you'll find parts that'll want to make you go \"holy ****\" but then other parts look pretty with nice detail until something pops up that makes you say wow again. There, can I talk about how awesome this game looks? And you'll see it right there in the main menu screen which now has the almost iconic Kratos staring at you only this time the detail on his model is really impressive. And there's my favorite thing which is the lighting, especially in low-light situations and having your weapons briefly illuminate the room looks amazing. One cutscene did stutter and lip sync on one line was off though it might've been because a trophy was unlocked at that point but it's easy to see why this game was highly anticipated on the graphics front.Sound/Music: Naturally the word \"epic\" will be tossed around here and for good measure in that while I won't exactly be humming these tunes anytime, the grandiose music perfectly sets the tone with its big choir parts, percussion and intense orchestra. Old familiar sounds are back, weapons and that loud bang you get when doing a big strong attack's still there though the Helios head still makes that bizarre scream everytime you take it out which can potentially get grating. With regards to voice acting, some familiar faces pop up making you go \"wait...did they hire...?\" so we have Rip Torn providing voice for Hephaestus, Hercules' Kevin Sorbo as who else but Hercules and Malcolm McDowell as Daedalus, father to Icarus. Would've been nice to see who did other voices as well such as Zeus, Hera, Gaia or something since only a select few are chosen in the special features.Gameplay: One thing I never liked about previous God of War games is that there's always these weird parts in the game that get put in to not necessarily ruin it but kind of make you wish other things were put in instead. None of the puzzles are that taxing to the brain which is good since I always felt God of War puzzles were too vague in their how-to-solve solutions. Combat feels more tactician based here where it doesn't require a real sense of precision but just mashing square and the occasional triangle will only get you so far and in fact certain enemies are way more vulnerable to certain weapons than others. That being said I still find the controls to not be as super responsive as I saw in Bayonetta. If I wanted her to jump, she jumped; dodge, she dodged but here you'll be tapping that right analog stick to get out of the way and for some reason, Kratos just doesn't move while other times he dodges out of the way. But the powerups and skills are actually useful and the battles, except for one duel involving a new unbelievably annoying enemy type and a dog that spits out other dogs grated on my nerves. The game also has some backtracking which is odd because I remember in previous God of Wars I did that very little and if I did it's because I went somewhere to give me something that'll turn on something but in this game you'll literally re-see areas more than once because that's what the story needs. Minor gripe but in God of War 1, I always felt like I was moving forward and seeing what else the game had in store for me; here it feels like a slight hub world.One improvement over previous games is how the QTE events work. Whereas before a big Triangle or Circle would show up in the center of the screen, the prompts now show up on their respective corners in relation to where they are on the controller (Circle is Right, Triangle's up etc) so thanks to your eye's weird peripheral vision, you can actually tell which side of the screen a prompt showed up in which keeps your eyes focused on the fantastically gory kills Kratos can do. Also the \"mash Circle\" prompts feel a lot more forgiving now and as an example, take the Minotaur. Remember how in God of War 1, you climbed on his chest and tried to run a blade down his mouth? Well I remember my hand hurting because regardless of how fast I was pressing, it still felt like Kratos took way too long to jab that knife in there but now it feels quicker and doesn't require insane amounts of speed to get done. My one issue is in regards to the R1 prompts in the levels themselves in that they either took me a bit of time to actually access them (I'll end up running around a save point until the prompt came up sometimes) or in one case, I had to open a door to rescue someone from being smooshed yet for some reason the game didn't actually let me grab that thing despite my pressing R1. Some might not notice it but that's what I saw anyway.Upon completing the game, you'll be rewarded with the super hard Titan mode, Challenge of the Gods where you got to perform certain tasks in an arena like killing everyone with no weapons used or making sure enemies don't respawn past a certain limit. They're kind of fun but there's only 7 or so and they can be potentially frustrating. There's also a combat arena which I assume is meant as a kind of testing area to hone your fighting skills though it would've been cool if it acted as a quasi-Horde mode where you had to see how long you can survive. Also unlocked are the traditional God of War making-of videos which I think seriously needs to become a staple in games since we never really get to see the talent or even hardships a team can face so for example in these videos, we see the sudden departure of Cory Balrog, director of God of War 2 and the \"promotion\" of new director Stig Asmussen, their jitters about unveiling an E3 demo which still needs to be reworked 2 weeks before the event and all in all, they're great looks into a game company known for talent but we don't quite see enough of it in other developers and if we do, it's usually those talking head interviews about all the cool stuff we're doing. Plus they're usually in Collector's Editions.Is God of War 3 the absolute best game of 2010? It's certainly one of the top ones but considering the almost wallet-busting array of games coming out this year, there's no doubt many will remember this game but whether it wins, it can be likely but keep in mind Mass Effect 2 came out this year, Mario Galaxy 2 and Metroid and possibly Zelda are out, Halo Reach might even be more than just a shinier Halo 3 and if the Last Guardian comes out this year than that's my automatic GOTY but whereas God of War 3 is pretty short, it's a pretty balls-to-the-wall experience that everyone needs to play at least once.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2010"}

Obviously that has its risk considering that WEP and Open router settings are vulnerable, but I will let you be the judge of your own Wi Fi security.

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"And we're back, baby!","reviewText":"Ah, it's nice to have the old-school MORTAL KOMBAT back.  MK VS. DC UNIVERSE was a fun game, don't get me wrong, but it just wasn't the same.  MK is meant to be bloody, it's meant to be violent.  It's meant to freak you out with how amazing it is.  MORTAL KOMBAT does that.The graphics (I'm going PS3 here, but let's presume for all systems) are spectacular.  No distracting 3D movement like on DC UNIVERSE (you know, where if you accidentally knock the joystick, you move out of place).  The Story Mode is much the same, though the one-liners aren't quite so trite (this could technically be a bad thing, depending on how cheesy you like your cheese).  The tag-team feature is pretty cool, except when you're on the receiving end of it (in which case, it's a nice, if sometimes frustrating, challenge).  The X-Ray attacks are spectacularly brutal, much better than DC UNIVERSE'S Rage Mode.  The list of characters you can play is lengthy and interesting, spanning all MK eras.  Their moves are fun if not as diverse as we'd like them to be (though how diverse can they possibly get)?The great thing about MORTAL KOMBAT is all the bonus features that come with it: extensive online gaming (I don't do online games, so I haven't checked it out; but a cursory glance told me there was quite a bit), plus various training features that teach you the basic moves and even all of the characters' fatalities.  As for the latter--oh, it's nice to have them back!Basically, if you've loved MK games since their inception, then you'll love MORTAL KOMBAT.  It isn't the greatest game of all time--but then, it was never intended as such.  It's a nice distraction, a fun few hours with infinite replay potential.  If you like fighting games, you'll love this one, guaranteed.Edits (now that I've pretty much finished it):The Story Mode is long and engaging.  Not all of it makes sense, but it's definitely in-depth, and dark--we're talking brutal in spots.  The tag-team gets annoying after a while (if only YOU could do it, which you can't in Story Mode), but it's still a neat challenge.  Shao Kahn is a pain in the butt; the final battle with him is incredibly difficult.  If you've done your research, you've seen that others have complained about it.  They're right to do so.  Not to sound like a whiny brat...but yeah, he's hard.  There are tactics, but unfortunately you have to fight him with two of the weaker characters (move-wise).  You'll know what I mean when you play it.The wide variety of characters is nice (for you PS3 users, Kratos is a welcome addition).  The Babalities are funny as hell, and the fatalities are properly gruesome.  Still haven't done online playing (probably won't), but my buddy and I had a great time kicking each others' butts in two-player mode.  Indeed, the only great downside I see is Shao Kahn's difficulty in Story Mode (and you can't change the difficulty level, at least nowhere that I can see).  Stick with it and you'll beat him...but it took me two days the first time, and I'm on my second day for the last battle.  Patience, I suppose.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}

Choose incorrectly and you will run dangerously low on ammo, probably at the worst moment! lol There is a simple remedy though, make a quick kill and grab the dead guys weapon and your back in business. I am glad they did this. In a realistic type game like FEAR, I hate having 8-10 different weapons! It is silly. In Serious Sam it is fun and a MUST HAVE feature...but not for a purebred FPS like FEAR.Overall, this game is almost a 5 in my book. There are a few things lacking and I wish the environments were more dynamic than a large corporate office building. DOOM 3 tried to be this scary and indepth but it failed. That game became predictable. It became easy to predict when a monster would jump out or when big boss monster were coming!!! What a waste!FEAR makes up for that, takes games like DOOM 3 out back, rips a hickory switch off and beats them across the rear to teach lessons and school game designer wanna-be's!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00004YRQA","description":"Building a better system from the ground up sometimes involves digging into even the most mundane components. Take memory cards, for instance. To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file. The 8 MB Memory Card allieviates that problem by organizing and storing files much more like a computer hard disk.","reviewerName":"G.

For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings.

McKenzie","summary":"The PS3 Can Handle The Box","reviewText":"There seems to be this undercurrent that \"The Orange Box\" --- a collection of five exceptional videogames --- could only be played on the PC.  For one reason or another, the X-Box 360 and PlayStation 3 discs haven't been given their fair praise.  The PS3 version, especially, hasn't been given a fair shake.\"The Orange Box\" is as perfect an experience on the PS3 as it was on a PC, if not better.  I don't say that because it's 100% perfect, mind you.  After all, \"Portal\" is very short, \"Half-Life 2\" is a bit unevenly paced, the \"HL2\" Episodes unfortunately don't have a definitive ending, and \"Team Fortress 2\" was always a strange bird to me.  I am declaring that \"The Orange Box\" is a superior product over the PC version because, guess what?...It's guaranteed to work 100% of the time.  A personal computer can't guarantee that for you.  If your computer's too old, then some of the more epic sequences might be too choppy, or you'll have to sacrifice high-res graphics for smooth gameplay, or the loading times might be too long because your computer's doing some background operations.  And if your computer's supernew, Valve's Steam support is here for you, but will it last?  Think about that for a moment...will Steam go away some day?  Now ask yourself, will the PlayStation 3 and a carefully used BluRay ever fail you?The PS3 version of \"The Orange Box\" seems to be picked for inferior graphics and slightly longer loading times.  First off, all 5 of these games look very good and run very well on Sony's system.  Do they look worse than a PC or 360 version?  Perhaps a little, but you're comparing a 9.9 to a 9.6....are you really gonna lose sleep over this?  As for the loading times, naysayers have picked on this way too much.  So I have to wait 10 seconds for a game to reload after I die instead of 4 seconds; Give me a break!Maybe \"The Orange Box\" was a vastly inferior product on the PS3 before the mandatory one-time software update (now THAT is annoying).  But as I play these 5 games, this BluRay has only frozen on me one time.  And quite frankly, every PC disc and PS3 disc I own has done that to me at one point in my time.Why not focus on the important story here?  \"The Orange Box\" includes 5 terrific video games!\"Half-Life 2\" is a true pioneer in the first-person action genre, and its quality hasn't diminshed since 2004.  The two sequel \"Episodes\" continue that gripping story, with a shocking conclusion that understandably has fans begging for either \"Episode Three\" or \"Half-Life 3\".  And as if \"HL2\" wasn't enough of a first-person, just take a look at \"Portal\"!  I don't begrudge fans who call it one of the all-time greats, because its brilliant concept doesn't let up for the 4 hours or so that it gives you.  To me, it's a little too short, but it's a true original.  \"Team Fortress 2\" is one of the more unusual multiplayer experiences I've encountered, with its diverse classes and matches.  But it's very entertaining should you choose to explore its intricacies.\"The Orange Box\" is a steal, even for the full asking price that most Amazon sellers are charging for this hard-to-find PS3 disc.  It's worth the investment if you don't have the confidence that your computer can run the games.  To be fair, my 2007 Dell computer runs \"Portal\" and \"Team Fortress 2\" just fine, while the three \"HL\" games have some framerate and loading hiccups.  The games are playable if you want to go for the less expensive route and risk it.You want my advice?  Play the original \"Half-Life\" on PC, and get \"The Orange Box\" on a console.  If the PlayStation 3 is your only option, I'm sorry Amazon sellers are taking advantage of your predicament.  But after forking the cash, the superior product will put your worries at ease.  All will be forgiven.  So take the dive --- \"The Orange Box\" is a most valued treasure!GAMESHalf-Life 2 (2004) = 9.5 / 10* This is a game that just keeps on delivering, even though it has some pacing issues.  But the genius is that it trusts you, the gamer, to figure out its puzzles and story without spelling it out for you.  It ends on a strange note, but I believe the intrigue will win you over enough, especially now that some follow-up Episodes have been released.Episode One (2006) and Episode Two (2007) = 9.0 / 10* Aside from being shorter and only introducing a few new gameplay concepts, the stories and action set pieces are equally as exhilerating as the epic \"Half-Life 2\".  These sequels step away cut through the Orwellian backdrop, and finally force the gamer to feel the impact that the interdimensional rift has caused the human race to endure.  Episode One ends with a bang; Episode Two ends with your heart wrenched.Portal (2007) = 8.5 / 10* I wouldn't be surprised if people bought \"The Orange Box\" just to play this nifty little gem.  While I think that's overkill, \"Portal\" is one of the true defining steps in videogame history.  Like other Valve titles, it trusts you the gamer to use your first-person intuition to solve the mysteries and puzzles laid before you.  GlaDOS is one of the most quotable, unforgettable characters in games, and the physics & logic create some truly amazing moments.  The game's pretty short, but then again, it always meant to be more of an experimental bonus.Team Fortress 2 (2007) = 8.0 / 10* To be honest, I haven't spent a ton of time with this one, because the only multiplayer shooter I truly enjoy is the more recent \"Call of Duty\" titles.  But I will credit Valve for not only thinking outside the box when they assembled this game, but for creating a new one.  The strategies you can implement with the different classes and match types really make each match a unique experience beyond the fragfests of shooters today.  I guess I admire \"Team Fortress 2\" a lot more than I enjoy it.  It simply wasn't a game meant for me, and after spending about 6 hours with it, I don't think that's gonna change.  But honestly, I always loved \"The Orange Box\" for the other 4 games on the disc, so having a less appealing 5th one is just a bonus.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2011"}

The reason I didn't want Gran Turismo was because that game wasn't fun to play its strict simulation, Forza 5 is the same way. Perhaps its just because I loved Forza Horizon so much (I know totally different games) but Forza 5 is a huge disappointment. Forza 3, or 4 were both way better.Personally I think the soundtrack of Forza Horizon was much better than in this game, and even Forza 4 seemed to provide more variety in songs (this one is straight orchestral music and there are only a handful of songs).Actual gameplay of Forza 5 isn't much fun either, it disqualifies your perfect lap for miniscule reasons (Aside from passing before you cross the starting line I can't tell some of the times it disqualifies my lap) which is really annoying.Not sure if this counts against the Xbox One or Forza 5 but the graphics don't appear to be any better in Forza 5 than Forza 4 or Horizon, kinda sad since it's on a \"next-gen\" system. Short of it, if you're buying the Xbox One just to get Forza 5... Don't.Also I should note that despite being installed on the hard drive, the load times between races are laughable. Sometimes a minute...I just feel disappointed with this game, it's pretty boring and unlike Forza 4 or Horizon where it was easy to get cars and customize this game really makes you grind it out (or pay real money) if you want the better cars, there's no hooplah when you level up driver or car... It's just all around boring.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

Newberry \"agent_47\"","summary":"Peel this Orange and be satisfied!!","reviewText":"One thing that struck me when I first put in 'the Orange Box' and played Half Life 2 original was how crisp the graphics are. The textures ,dynamic lighting all add to the beauty. And if you have a good HDTV , some additional minor tweaking of the picture makes Half Life-2 look rather stunning.Another thing I loved about the Half Life series were there are no pre-rendered cutscenes,except for the very begining and very end of each episode/game. All of Half Lifes story takes place in game while playing, something I wish more games did. The game is not riddled with mini-movies.Half Life 2  does show its age 'design' wise but as far as graphics and crispness of textures it looks about as good as it can on any platform. One great thing I love about all 5 games is the fully customizable controls. After playing HALO3 for so long I was comfortable with the (RB) reload . So if you want you can fully map any button on the 360 controller for Half Life-2 to suit your tastes, very nice indeed.  Multiplayer TeamFortress2 plays nice , there were some early lag issues but at the time of this writing Valve was working on the servers and trying to match people with simular LIVE speed, so the lag issue is nearly solved. Portal is quirky puzzle solving in First Person, if you played PREY the portals work in simular fashion , only with the Portal Gun you can put a portal almost anywhere the game allows,although you don't aquire the Portal gun right away. The (3) Half Lifes look and play great. It takes at least  26-30 HOURS  to complete all 3 Half Life-2 games (Not including Portal).I enjoyed Half Life-2's story and its nice to have all 3 chapters in one disc.There's  lots of gaming to be had with ' The Orange (5 game bargain) Box' any FPS fan should have this in there collection. (update) I  found out there is a lag patch for TF2 out now. You can get the patch via XboxLive. On another note:With the open-ended ending of Ep:2 will HL2-Episode 3 be available for download via X-Live soon? Most likely yes ,PEACE","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2007"}

However, Rise of Nations is unquestionably the best such game that I have played so far.  It is really not a revolutionary improvement over these other games, but simply takes the next evolutionary step and improves upon the formula in many different ways.  While the game does have a few tiny flaws, with the expansion pack (Throne & Patriots) installed, this game approaches a perfect rating of five stars for me, which would be a first for me since I have never given such a rating to any game.Gameplay: The formula is simple and familiar, but well done nonetheless.  You collect resources to build structures to build units to conquer territory (or create wonders) to rule the world. That simple.  However, you can customize much of the gameplay.  You can control the size and geography of the map, the number of opponents, the victory conditions, the number of ages played, and much more.  The real improvement that this game offers is the national borders concept.  Instead of having to build walls to keep out the enemy, national boundaries expand and contract based on the territory that you develop and/or conquer.  Also, unlike games such as Age of Empires, your civilization lives and dies based on cities, not just random collections of buildings.  This factor really adds a lot to the game, since some of the fiercest and most exciting gameplay can center around fighting an opponent over a single strategically placed city.  In my last game, I fought a computer opponent for over an hour over a city as it went back and forth between us.  Eventually, the computer's forces won out and I had to come up with a Plan B.By the very nature of these sorts of games, there is micromanagement involved.  You have to be aware of the new technologies available, when to jump to the next age, where your armies and navies are, what new resources are available, what the enemy is doing, and so forth.  However, the micromanagement has been streamlined and does not feel overwhelming to me.  Much of the technological research and age advances take place in the library.  Also, the resource requirements are pretty reasonable (unlike Empire Earth) and you'll be advancing through ages at a nice pace.  Resources don't get depleted, so a citizen can work that same farm from the stone age to the information age.  And there is a wide range of units available, including special units like generals, spies, and commandos. Additionally, the AI in this game is pretty good, but sometimes predictable.  Your citizens are usually smart enough to find work to do if you don't immediately assign them.  Also, computer opponents can be quite a challenge, even on moderate difficulty.  You can play this game as simply a technology race with no fighting involved. However, who buys these sort of games not to see what a row of trebuchets can do to an enemy city or to see flamethrowers go in action against tanks? (I certainly don't, but there is a pacifist option available.)I haven't played online, but this is an option, too.  I also haven't played the Conquer the World campaign, but I have played the Napoleonic campaign that comes with the Throne & Patriots expansion, and it is excellent.  It is the very best blend of turn-based and real-time strategic gameplay I've seen.Graphics: Rise of Nations is a good-looking game.  Unit animations are convincing and many look like their real-life counterparts.  That is, my Zulu warriors looked like Zulu warriors (at least in the earlier phases of the game), not like European soldiers.  The architectures are well done and the water looks more realistic than any I have seen in an RTS (until AOE 3, I suppose).  You can zoom the camera in or out, but there is really no reason to (having it zoomed out will give you a broader view of the battlefield). I wish that there had been a little more diversity in regard to how some of the terrain looks and perhaps even weather changes.  But this is a very minor gripe.Sound: Everything is great in this area.  All of the weapons sound as they should. I wish there was a bit more voice acting from the units; at least special units like generals and spies should say a few words as they go into action. However, the music is phenomenal.  It sounds passionate and triumphant at times, and when things go badly, it sounds poignant and downright tragic.Technical issues: The game was perfectly stable on my computer--no crashes, freezes, or other problems which are too common with games nowadays (I do have the patch installed).  I wish that the game had shipped with a more informative manual.  If you don't want to buy the Sybex strategy manual (which is quite good), there are a number of manuals for the game that you can download from the internet for free.Replayability/Value: Real-time strategy games are one of my favorite gaming genres largely because of the great replayability, and Rise of Nations is no exception.  You can have a unique experience every game, and there are many ways to customize that experience (you can even review games, which are automatically recorded in their entirety).  If you are even remotely a fan of computer strategy games, then I would consider Rise of Nations a must-buy.  I also highly recommend the Throne & Patriots expansion, which adds new functionality to the game.Rating: 4.75 stars (out of 5)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2005"}

Other than the first month I played Age of Empires, the Blizzard games (Warcraft and Starcraft) are probably the only RTS games I've found enjoyable as it seems that most RTS titles are the same thing with different options.  Even Star Wars and Lord of the Rings have their own RTS games these days with jedis and hobbits replacing archers, musketeers, or whatever else the most recent RTS has decided to include in its game.  So with all this said, you can imagine that I was hesitant to purchase Rise of Nations.  But darnit, I couldn't resist after reading some summaries of the game.  I'll give the game credit where credit is due, it's definitely an improvement over other recent RTS rehases and is probably the most complicated RTS to date.  You'll need to play this one quite a bit before you get used to the many technology trees your society can choose.  Speaking of technology trees, Rise of Nations is really nothing more than a real-time strategy answer for fans of the turn-based strategy game, Civilization.  If you're like me and sick of the RTS genre, you probably won't find anything to last you more than a week.  On the other hand, if you're an RTS junkie, you need to grab this game quickly because it's one of the best RTS titles out there!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Dave","summary":"Slight disappointment","reviewText":"If this was the first GTA I've played then I would be amazed and blown away.  I just kinda felt bored after a few hours with this one.  I never really had that feeling of \"I can't wait to see what the next mission is\" like in San Andreas.  Instead I was almost thinking \"I wonder how annoying and boring the next mission will be.\"The positives are definitely the graphics, although they're not flawless like Uncharted.  Getting hit by cars is a nice addition, and breaking the glass of locked cars is fairly cool as well.  But.....Niko's cousins accent gets really annoying really fast.  It seems pointless to bother having the girlfriend.  The combat system is annoying and slow.  Why is it that every person you pull out of a car can fight like Mike Tyson?  Are this many ordinary people professional boxers who are ready to throw down when being car jacked??  The police are waaaay too aware and quick to respond.  I attacked some dude on the beach in the middle of nowhere and the cops were on me in 5 seconds...in New York?  Please.Why do you have to hold X to run?  That's annoying because walking is soooo painfully slow.  The driving cameras are frustrating and move without you doing anything.  It's very difficult to see what's ahead of you because the camera continues to default behind your trunk.  Getting continuously double and triple teamed by pedestrians was cool the first few times but quickly gets old when you're constantly being chased by an angry mob for jaywalking.  I got knocked down by a car, then the driver gets out and starts hitting me along with two other guys.  What's that about??  New York is a rough place but give me a break.Overall, I think I've been spoiled by playing better PS3 games.  Rockstar maybe lagging a bit behind the times here.  It could also be that I'm generally bored with the premise of GTA seeing how I played San Andreas until I nearly crippled my hands.  Oh well, hopefully number 5 will wow me again.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2008"}

A dramatic tale of revenge sees Nariko, a fiery red-haired heroine, embark on a quest for vengeance against an invading King and his army. The story builds around the ancient Heavenly Sword, which once belonged to a powerful deity. It can never be wielded by a mortal without it slowly but inevitably draining their life-force.When the invading King (played by Andy Serkis) destroys the warrior clan that guards the Heavenly Sword, the clan leader&#x2019;s daughter, Nariko, takes up the sword in a desperate fight for survival.

In fairness to the developer, and in recognition of their great work, I wanted to post a review for their other PS3 game, \"Heavenly Sword\", which I loved. This game was a much-needed burst of game goodness when it launched, as there was a severe shortage of quality games available for the PS3 during its first year.The game still holds up well, even though it's five years old, and it's a lot of fun. Controls are a breeze and empowering, the graphics are fantastic, the story is solid, and the voice acting is superb. I actually prefer this game over \"God of War 3\" (which is also excellent), because it's brighter, not as gloomy, and it doesn't bog down the action with foolish backtracking and puzzles that simply aren't fun. \"Heavenly Sword\" is often likened to \"God of War\", and that's an accurate comparison - but it's actually more fun than the game that inspired it.The best part of this game is probably the involvement of Andy Serkis (best known as \"Golem\" and \"King Kong\"). Just as in the Lord of the Rings movies and the modern King Kong film, Andy Serkis provides outstanding motion capture acting that makes for a truly unique experience in gaming. He also provides some excellent voice acting, as you might suspect! I hope to see him back in another game some day.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2012"}

That legacy of a series was perfect until the 32 bit era, where Appaloosa screwed up Konami's terrfic series of the run 'n gun shooter. 2 Super Arcade games, terrfic NES conversions, a SNES masterpiece and a Sega Genesis game that made other games run home. Then came the 3D Contras for the PSX and Saturn and the once cherished Contra name went down the tubes.Enter the 128 bit sequel, Shattered Soldier. Playing as Bill Rizer, who has seemingly murdered his old partner, you are awaken from a prison sentence to once again run to the right, jump, shoot, and blow stuff up. Joining you is a female cyborg who takes Lance's place. With incredible 3D graphics, but tried and true 2D gameplay, this is Contra the way the 32 bit versions should have been done. Many people have blasted this game as being ridiculously hard. For some, it may be, especially those who grew up in the 32 bit era with it's 3D games and easy gameplay. Shooter, memory, and platforming skills are required here if you want to see the ending of this game. And rightfully so, because Contra was and is a tough series.There are some changes to the old formula, namely:No powerups: You have 3 weapons at the start...machine gun, grenade launcher, flame whip. You start with them, you die with them, you don't lose them. You can also \"charge\" up each weapon for a different type of blast. The machine gun launches a pod that spins and shoots out rounds. The grenades wind up turning into homing missiles, and the flame whip lets loose a strong energy blast. Missing in action is the favorite laser and most of all: Spread gun!! Too bad the spread is gone. While the weapons available work well, and each is suited better for certain situations, some will miss the old weapon system.Many have already reviewed this game, and I took my time getting around to it (had the game for months) so I'll stop here...bottom line is if you want a great Contra game like those of old, you would do well to pick this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2003"}

The only complaint i could possibly mention is the length.  But, what it lacks in length, it makes up for in difficulty.  Anyone who says this game is easy is either a master FPS player, or they're not playing on Difficult level.  (why play if you play on medium or easy? you might as well just play a disney game)In my mind, this is an essential element to the half-life series.  Mainly because you finally get that vital piece of plot that explains what was going on in the first two games.  If you've never played the first two half-life games (Half-Life, Opposing Force), i'd recommend playing them first, as this game won't make a lot of sense without a knowledge of the events that occur in them.If, however, you've played them before, and are holding off on this game because of all the negative reviews, i'd say just get it.

{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"C.E.","summary":"Disney? Squaresoft! You Bet!","reviewText":"I dont actually believe in writing a review of a product until I have played and finished it, that being said, I finished this game in 30 hours and enjoyed every moment of it.  The two entertainment giants, Disney and Squaresoft, have collaborated on a project that is genius in execution and fabulous in design.  This game is a captivating and enjoyable romp through some of the most colorful and memorable worlds that Disney has placed on screen.  We are taken everywhere from Halloween Town to the belly of Monstro the whale.  All the while, I was engrossed with the story and eagerly devoured the hints and clues that floated my way.Many will dismiss this game based upon the involvement of Disney Interactive.  Traditionally a gaming division that caters to children with cutesy characters, many will be quick to look over this title and forget about its offerings.  For those who choose to ignore the labels placed upon this wonderul piece of software, they will be pleasantly surprised with the high-quality of animations and gameplay that it presents.Although this game is developed by Squaresoft, makers of the popular \"Final Fantasy\" games, that is where all similarities end.  \"Kingdom Hearts\" is wonderfully refreshing in that evidence of its battle system.  It all happens in real time, and the action is everywhere on the screen.  The camera moves with quick and consice movements that only add to the action and immerse the players in the frenzied and wild battles.  This game is fun for children, familiar characters and lush visuals take care of that angle.  Yet it is also difficult.  I found myself pressing the \"continue\" button quite often, throwing myself into yet another heated battle with the Heartless.All being said and done, this game stands out as a unique and refreshing addition to any game library.  I am pleased and impressed with the quality of this product and hope to see a sequal sometime in the near future.  I highly reccomend this game to action/adventure fans, as well as RPG gamers.  Not really fitting into one category completely, \"Kingdom Hearts\" has elements and additions that will appeal to any gamer who takes the time to see past the boxshot and is willing to dive into one of the best adventures yet.  This game deserves all the accolades that it gets, and is solid in its design and execution...definatley deserving of its best-seller and 5-star status!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2002"}

Shadow is, in a nutshell, the darker, more mature, bad-@$$ version of Sonic. Weapon-toting and awesome, a bit of gameplay will get you used to Shadow's unique abilities. It's not quite as clumsy with the controls as Sonic Heroes is either. There's also a choice system with ten very distinct endings which unlock one big, final ending. Getting here can take awhile, and gives it a lot of replay value to unlock many other paths than just the 10 distinct endings.This makes the ending vastly better than, shall we say, a certain Bioware game that was recently released.Some would say that guns, vehicles, cursing etc. don't belong in a Sonic game. My reply? THIS IS SHADOW'S GAME, NOT SONIC'S.Even despite that fact, why not make it a bit more mature? Or have the Genesis fans not matured over the years? I like games with dark, bad-@$$ tones personally.I would highly recommend this game to fans of Sonic, Shadow, shooters and people who like unorthodox action games.

You have lot of freedom and each action you take will have consequences. Fighting is fun, no matter if you are using swords, maces, guns or magic. With the XP you get while defeating enemies you can level any attribute when you reach enough XP to upgrade. There are cool bosses in some areas. When you master and raise the level of your magic spells, is great fun, especially the spells targeting an area, when you cast them over multiple enemies. Even though is an \"easy\" game compared to others , do not underestimate the game, it is a great game, well done and with a superb story.I played Fable 3 first and then decided to play Fable 2 and my opinion is that Fable 2 is better by far. More fun, better story, you have bosses on different quests, and it is of course more challenging than Fable 3. Nice environments and great music (new age type). Ending story is cool, even the final fight was kind of a let down, but it is still a very good game. Great to get points for your Xbox Live Gamer score.Main story is around 10 to 12 hours if you play straight, but there are a good number of other Quests, so if you take your time and do them then you will spend probably like 30 hours with the game. You will never get frustrated with Fable 2, it is a light RPG, but still a good RPG.

Prostreet","reviewText":"After playing this game for an estimated 30 hours of playtime I just beat/finished the game earlier today and prior to playing this game I played NFS Prostreet which I just finished playing a few weeks ago. Prostreet seemed longer to me, it took me nearly a month and an estimated 40 hours of play time to beat that game. However I couldn't put Undercover down sometimes and played for 2-3 hours straight whereas Prostreet I kind of picked at it for an hour here and there. So while I think Prostreet was longer, Undercover had a good amount of playtime to it as well.However, a lot of Prostreet was repetitive - you kept running the same tracks with slight differences over and over. There is repetitiveness in Undercover too but it is not as noticeable since there are other things going on in the game like the story arch. In Prostreet you simply beat an event then moved to the next event in a very linear fashion. Undercover has a linear story, but when you unlock the next part of the story there are then many different missions you can do during that part of the story and you can do them in any order you wish. So while there is a certain \"linearness\" to the story, there also is freedom to chose several different events in any order you wish.Perhaps one of the funnest things I like about Undercover and I think this is a key advantage over Prostreet is just cruising around the city or on the highway in your chosen ride enjoying the sound of the car and the nice graphics. Notice I didn't say \"impressive\" graphics, but they are nice. And then at any time you can take your car and smash it into things in order to cause chaos which will get you money and eventually if not right away bring about the attention of the police, which then leads to one of the funnest aspects of the game and that is evading the police! Though it got frustrating in the latter part of the game as the police got a bit smarter and better about using roadblocks to trap you. You can also choose to smash up their police cars, but be careful, if they pin you and you get busted, you lose not only cash but after three strikes you lose your ride! I found that out the hard way early on in the game with my 1st pink slip victory car - the Lotus.Speaking of cars, this is where I think Prostreet has the advantage. Prostreet just has WAY more cars to choose from and it seems easier to get them. You earn cash a lot quicker in Prostreet than you do in Undercover, which allows you to buy more cars of course once they are unlocked. However, in Undercover you probably don't need as many cars as you do in Prostreet because in Prostreet you need a grip car, drag car, drift car, and speed car just to compete in events. Plus I found that I had to level-up to better cars several times to win races as the game progressed. So I ended up with at least 2 cars for each category just to compete in events. With Undercover I basically used the Lotus early in the game, then added on the Audi TT which I played with through most of the game until I could afford the Lamborghini and lastly the Pagani Zonda to finish off the final events. But you do drive other cars on special \"jobs\" that is part of the story arch. This is probably the coolest feature of the game, doing these special jobs that are part of the story arch which though is cheesy still keeps the gaming moving along.The storyline is reminiscent of something from the \"Fast and Furious\" and I luvv looking at Maggie Q (star of Nikita) and there is some nice eye candy with not only Maggie Q but also spicy Carmen! However, though I like looking at Maggie Q and Carmen, the cut scenes sometimes seem distracting from the game and probably need to be a bit longer. Sometimes they were so short, like 10 or 20 seconds it seemed that I barely heard what Maggie Q was saying before the cut scene was over!Undercover does seem to have a few more glitches in the game than Prostreet did and were so bad at times that it would cause me to need to restart the job/mission, not because it froze up (that only happened a couple of times) but my car would go careening off course or into a wall or something and the person I was chasing or racing would get away. It is frustrating why EA can't quality control these things a little better. I understand the game needs to be rushed and put out to compete with other games to make money, but why do the Japanese games always seem so clean and polished but the American games riddled with glitches?I find it funny that some reviewers said Undercover was too easy. The beginning stages of the game were very easy to win races and escape the police, but as you get deep into the game it is not so easy, though the use of the Zonda will leave you with little challenge winning any races! But certainly there are some jobs that you will need to try a few times before you can complete the mission. So those that said the game was way too easy obviously didn't finish it or probably used cheats or bought the fastest cars (Lamborghini and the Zonda) from the PS store rather than earning them through game play. Don't use cheats or shortcuts to get the fastest cars and then complain about how easy the game is!In summary, both games are enjoyable but I'm giving the edge to Undercover with my final grade of A- vs. Prostreet's final grade of B due to the more enjoyable story and \"fast and furious\" action. If you prefer the more precise driving game and track racing where tuning your car's performance is necessary to win then Prostreet is the better game. If you are more into the Fast and Furious style including evading and smashing up the police then Undercover is the better choice. I have enjoyed playing Undercover from the minute I put the disc in whereas Prostreet took more time to grow on me before I appreciated it. Both are great games albeit with some frustrating glitches.FINAL GRADE: A-","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2011"}

Somehow I don't believe they had rubber in that time period.  Or... or laser sighting systems.  I mean come on, can't I expect a little realism?The white Wolfos in the Ice Cavern is still hilariously easy (wait for it to attack, backflip, jump slash, done.)Okay this turned out to be a pretty tongue-in-cheek review and I'll admit that I'm just at the start of the Water Temple and this is the best handheld game I've ever played, and I sincerely hope that other companies get off their bums and make full, grand, beautiful adventure games so that the 3DS can flourish like a spring meadow in Imagination Land.Seriously, just buy this thing already, why are you even still here?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

The story basically involves miners on Mars revolting against an oppressive corporation. You play as a rebel working with the Red Faction (the underground resistance) intent taking down Ultor Corporation. While the game is quite dated by today's standards it still serves up a healthy amount of FPS fun. My thoughts;Pros+ Sizable and varied environments. Not too linear, just enough direction so you still know where you need to go to complete the missions.+ Geo-Mod Technology (the ability to destroy just about any surface in the game) is a fun concept and adds depth to an often overdone genre.+ Interesting story.+ Nice blend of creatures and humanoid opponents.+ Some great minimal ambient music.Cons- Limited ammo which can really make it difficult to take advantage of the Geo-Mod Technology aspects.- Some music is the typical, annoying, cheesy guitar action rock.- Some overly difficult levels.A solid FPS for its time that has held up over time pretty well.

It allows you to sprint at high speed all around Seattle, up the sides of buildings and over cars, leaving behind gorgeous streaks of hot pink neon in your wake. This is one of the most visually impressive, exhilarating moments I've had with a game in a while. Every time a new upgrade is obtained gives the feeling of excitement as you anticipate what cool stuff you can do next. There are four main powers (Smoke, Neon, etc.), each as complete as Cole's electricity power from the first two games, and \"Second Son\" does the smart thing by letting us use them how and when we want. There's no mixing and matching (shooting Smoke while sprinting with Neon), but there's plenty of opportunity to switch between them quickly by finding a nearby power source (neon signs, smoke stacks, etc.). The city of \"Second Son\" is full of things to do, and some of it will depend on which moral route is taken, making either good or evil karmic choices, which in turn ends up being a great reason to play through a second time. Story-wise, it doesn't take itself too seriously. There are some interesting parallels dealing with an occupied/surveillance state and the idea of wanting to lock up people who are different. The superb gameplay, visuals, and shear technical qualities are the real standout, and boy do they shine bright.--- 5 STARS ---","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-23-2014"}

The original Wii Sports was a great little tech demo that didn't much show the power of the Wii remote as it did its potential. Enter Motion Plus, and now we have the game that Wii Sports SHOULD'VE been. These 12 minigames are fantastic. Simply put. They're all simple enough for a \"pick up and play\" quickie session, but they're also challenging enough that you'll easily find several hours have gone by without you noticing. Moreover, the graphics may look simplistic on the surface, but the textures and water effects are really good as well...better than most Wii games, in fact.Of all the minigames, I found myself really liking the jet ski, archery and bicycling the best. However, all of the games are definitely worth your time.Now the game is not perfect. While I'm definitely not disappointed, there are a few features that I found myself wanting. First off is some sort of online play. Some of these minigames just scream for it. Also, while the Table Tennis game is pretty neat, I would've rather they included the original game's Tennis, but with Motion Plus capability. That's the tennis game we all envisioned when we played the original Wii Sports. And finally, with Archery, I found myself having to re-calibrate the remote WAY too often. I'd get off a good shot, but come my next one I'd have to aim towards the corner of the room instead of at my TV. Not sure what the deal is, but at least the rest of the games seemed to work fine.All in all, this Wii skeptic was rather impressed.

Ranzoni \"Da Killa B\"","summary":"A Civilized Remake","reviewText":"When it comes to entertainment, I'm a blood-and-guts kind of guy-and video games are no exception. But the first game in my alphabetized library is not *Half-Life* or *Max Payne*. Since I enjoy epic games as much as shooters, I bought and played *Civilization III*, the latest in Sid Meier's brilliant world-strategy series. Not exactly a sequel, I find *Civilization III* a polished and streamlined remake of its predecessor.What do I mean by remake? Well first let's take a look at the series. The original *Civilization* put the player at the head of a human pre-civilization. His or her job was to lead the people into recorded history, across 6,000 years to the present. The player could choose governments, build a war machine, control emigration, and develop science. Back in my day, *Civilization II* ruled the roost of intellectual strategy games (mainly because my computer could run it). But it also expanded greatly upon the original game, by increasing the types of units and concepts, by improving the existing units and concepts, and by adding various editor programs and expansions. After *Civ II* Activision developed a separate series-*Call to Power*. *CtP* added an entire future age; complete with a story and timeline. In other words, *Civ II* and *CtP* came that much closer to being epic and diverse.*Civilization III* does not step forward; it runs in place and shows off its muscles. And I have to admit; this game looks and plays pretty good. *Civ III* initially loads a bit slowly on my 1.05 Ghz and my 256MB. In-game reloading is quick and animation is generally smooth. The graphics easily surpass the previous titles, and includes unit animation as in the *Call to Power* offshoot. Looking at the map window is like looking at a real satellite image, and the terrain tiles blend together. I can't complain about the interface; the multiple menus of *Civ II* have folded into a single screen here. Handy buttons allow all unit commands to be quickly and easily issued by point-and-click (only the appropriate buttons will appear for each individual unit). I can complain that even on my gaming platform *Civ III* crashed several times, particularly when I was using catapults to bombard a rival city.The programmers at Firaxis don't bombard the player with features either. The watchword around the office must have been \"slim and sexy.\" Homogenizing the menus and adding a unit orders panel seems to have led to a complete revamp of the previous SOP. Trade no longer depends on special units; instead it is handled through the diplomacy screen. Diplomacy is accessed directly from buttons on the main map screen. Speaking of diplomacy, embassies and spies are also handled by buttons instead of units. Military units also no longer consume resources from individual cities; instead they simply cost gold from the national treasury. By the way, the player must now take extra caution when choosing city locations-terraforming doesn't exist in *Civ III*. Finally, the numbers of civilizations, government types, and victory time limits have been reduced.All the reductions and subtractions do not allow this game to step forward, at least when compared to the considerably longer and more developed *Call to Power*. But Firaxis doesn't let Civ *III* step back either. Many important additions make *Civilization III* relatively dynamic, and the most important to me is the concept of Culture. Previous games lacked political boundaries, which meant the player's civilization was always a collection of city-states. Any rival civilization could walk right in and start planting its own cities. In *Civ III* your cities still claim personal resource squares, but they also generate a Culture influence. Each city's culture grows if the right improvements are built. The areas of influence not only overlap to claim an entire mass of land and sea, but neighboring cities may defect if their own culture is too weak to resist. Along with the concept of Culture is the concept of Strategic Resources, which are needed to build certain units and improvements. Civilizations will automatically collect any resources falling within the culture boundary, provided said resource is connected by road or rail.It may seem to the reader by now that *Civilization III* is more realistic than its ancestors. Many of the changes and eliminations have been balanced out by concepts such as Culture and Strategic Resources. The manual explains most of the revisions and additions.And yet the world of *Civilization II* remains. From the graphics to the game play, *Civilization II* is polished and revised to make this current incarnation. I was a bit disappointed at first, when I realized that so many concepts and units were cut back. But once I realized *Civ III's* place as a classic remake, I relaxed and just played the game. For a shoot-`em-up guy like me, that's pretty civil.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2001"}

Here are my opinions of the various aspects of the game.  It has some unique mechanics and features, but unfortunately the developers did not take them far enough.  That being said it is a solid brawler and contains some interesting ideas to make for a average to above average gaming experience.-Brawling: This is the best part of the game. There is not a ton of variation of enemies but enough to keep it interesting. You are presented with situations where you have to think about what special abilities to use to succeed and in what order to kill the enemies. The unique aspect here is the combo customizer. It is more than just customizing a series of attacks, but it is creating combos for specific situations.  Certain moves do more damage while others will heal you or reduce cool down time for special moves you have used up. Because healing and cool down are highly relevant to battle you will often opt to create lower damage combos to yield those benefits.  The developers could have really made combo customization amazing and should have been game defining.  The feeling however is that they were afraid to explore this mechanic too much and it remained fairly shallow. That being said, they could have done worse, as the game went on and i unlocked new moves I appreciated the thought that went behind the system.-Exploration: This is a very linear game.  That is fine for a brawler in my opinion. The only issue I have with this is that the city LOOKS like it should be explored.  It is a very cool backdrop and you tend to feel constrained. Aside from a few secret rooms you won't be able to deter very far.-Platforming: There is a lot of this. maybe that is another reason I felt like more exploration would have been justified. The platforming is basically like fallowing a series of bread crumbs.  The game tells you where to jump next and you do it. There are some exceptions here and there are some \"puzzle\" aspects to platforming at times.  One unique feature I liked is allowing the character to speed up ledge crawling speed and making it relevant to progressing in the game.  I don't want to spoil any specifics so I'll leave it at that. At the end of the day the platforming is ok.  It can be fun at times albeit restrictive.- Memory remixing:  This is a very cool concept.  Basically you change a character's memory to change their motivations in real life. You are given a cinematic that you can alter by changing certain aspects of it. Most of the time the things you change are simple, but can have huge impact in the outcome of the sequence. At the end of the day it is an interactive cinematic where you play guess and check.-Story: The ideas in the story are interesting, but the execution was not what it could have been. They do not develop the characters very well overall. It is more about ideas in the end rather than characters or plot. Often, characters sound like they are talking at each other rather than with each other. Most of the plot twists seemed to lack impact. I still drew some enjoyment from the story, but it is not as compelling as it thinks it is.-Final thoughts: This has all the makings of a great game, but the developers did not exploit the best attributes to their maximum.  It is still a good game and will be a decent diversion for fans of brawlers. The linearity may feel too restrictive to many, but I did not feel it was major detriment.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004QEWVTO","description":"","reviewerName":"Moviedude","summary":"A franchise that truly stands on its own","reviewText":"A few years ago Volition had a dream: To make an open-world crime sim set in the gritty urban environs of hip-hop videos and John Woo movies. That game was Saints Row, and it was totally overshadowed by the similar, completely insane Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. But Volition has soldered on with its franchise, and while Rockstar's games have grown increasingly brooding and story-driven, Saint's Row has grown ever more over the top and ludicrous. With this installment, the series shakes off any pretension of seriousness and dives into a self-aware riff on itself, action games in general, and American consumer culture. Your street gang is also a media franchise, you rob banks in branded disguises, and you fight cops with hellicarriers and laser-shooting space jets. In other words, it's the game that GTA 4 would have been, had Rockstar NOT decided to grow up. And consequentially it is MANY times more fun.Once you've mastered foot combat (really excellent on the PC; mouse aiming is smooth and intuitive) and created a face for yourself using a truly insane character builder that makes Sims look rudimentary, you are thrust into the city of Steelport. This crumbling metropolis (lorded over by Burt Reynolds, voiced by Burt Reynolds) is a veritable cesspool of crime, and demands your unique combination of heroism and bloodthirsty mayhem to turn it into a... well, like a gold-plated toilet of crime or something. To that end you will murder, rob, vandalize, and murder your way through all sorts of lunatic opposition, pausing only to perform idiotic stunts for kicks and dress yourself like whatever kind of themed crimeboss you want to be (pantsless anthrocon attendee and Gothic Lolita cosplayer are good options). At no point does the game take itself remotely seriously, and while its flagrant violence, drug abuse, demeaning of women, and overall middle finger to good taste would be appalling in a sincere title, here it all comes off as a bit of a laddish joke, a gigantic Benny Hill sketch about ridiculous crime adventures that's a good laugh for everyone involved.That said, it's TOTALLY not for kids. But of course you probably already knew that.There are some weak points. You need a beefy rig to see the game in its full glory. Driving with the mouse and keyboard is as bad as shooting is good, so you may want a 360 controller on standby. And the animations the game forces your character through don't always match how you've designed them: my thrash-rock queen crimelord looks totally hot standing around but a lot of the cutscene conversations make her face look weird. But understand that the cutscenes I am whinging about are fully in-engine and use one of 6 voices that you choose. Even when this game fails it's sort of impressive.PROS-Looks good-Hilarious-Open world means tons of replay value and fun-Very competently ported to PC (or developed across platforms, I don't care)-Shocking degree of customizationCONS-Wears its crass streak very openly.

Unlike usuall ninja games, this ain't stealth, it's straight up Kick ... action game.Anyone familiar with the Dead or Alive Series will notice 2 characters from that series on this game, Ryu Hyabusha(Main character), and Ayane, but they're younger(Cuz Ayane's 14).If you love Devil May Cry, and have a Xbox, by all means in the book, get this game!  If you have a Xbox, then pick this game up, cuz right along side Halo, Splinter Cell Pandora Tommorow(Which is definitly a excellenr sequal), and Grand Theft Auto Double Pack, this is one of the best games on Xbox, better yet, it's one of the greatest games out there!peace","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2004"}
{"product_name":"B002ACFZ10","description":"Split/Second is an intense action racing game set within a reality television show.  Competitors will vie to be the first to the finish line in a made-for-TV city set rigged to blow with the ultimate goal of becoming the season champion.  Players in Split/Second don&#x2019;t just collide with other vehicles to knock them from the track, but can also trigger devastating events that drastically alter the dynamics of the race.  Players must use pinpoint timing to obliterate huge structures and towering TV set pieces to tactically alter the track or create entirely new routes.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A summer blockbuster on your gaming screen","reviewText":"I have a confession to make: I haven't played a racing game in a long time, not since the days of Extreme G-2, Star Wars Episode 1: Racer and San Francisco Rush 2049 in the Nintendo 64 era. Sure I played a Mario Kart now and then but as far as a true blue racing title, they've been pretty absent in my consoles though I couldn't tell you why. Partly because most of them are trying to be simulation titles with the most realistic physics, handling and near fetishistic attention to detail on the cars and partly because it's not quite exciting as when you're actually driving. But for some reason, May sees the release of 3 big releases: Split/Second from Black Rock Studios (Pure), Blur from Bizarre Creations (Project Gotham Racing) and relative newcomers United Front Games doing the user-generated content focus of Modnation Racers. The battle now has become which of the 3 do you pick up and worth your time? For now, we'll take a look at Split/Second, a game in which your main focus is not only to outrace your opponents but to survive the onslaught of the track itself but that is kind of the game's main problem: the selling point is immediately noticeable and it starts to slowly wear a bit old, not enough to make it boring but not enough for it to be constantly engaging.Story: Most racing games don't really have a \"Story\" per se as you tend to play a new racer making a name for his or herself and racing to your heart's content to win cash, new cars and fame and glory. Split/Second doesn't so much have a story as it has a basic premise: in what's sure to remind people of Death Race, you play as a contestant on a game show named you guessed it, Split/Second, as you play on massive stages in episodes. But of course to keep things and the show exciting, several different special races and events are provided that you have to win so you can win the whole show. While it's a nice idea, Black Rock didn't really do much with this concept like for instance: do we get any kind of specialty rewards for blowing up the most stuff? Or even the least, proving you're a better racer by not causing mayhem? However they did put in some \"next time! on Split Second!\" kind of videos which offer a nice teaser for the next batch of events. Not the must fully realized concept but certainly fresher than \"you're a dude, go win\".Graphics: Racing games tend to be all about really smooth and realistic graphics, from the sheen of the paint jobs to the light refraction, it's essentially car porn and the more gorgeous it looks, better reception game gets as far as racing enthusiasts go. Split Second is certainly no slouch as this game is flat-out gor-gee-yus with some stunning lighting, a great sense of speed and the destruction caused looks beautiful, as odd as that sounds. The HUD is also nicely designed with your position, current lap and power meter displayed near the rear bumper and trunk which keeps the clutter away from the rest of the screen so you can enjoy the rest of the game's vistas more. Pure was also a very nice looking game and same goes for this game as well.Sound/Music: The music well, let's just say I barely remember any music. From the loud car engines to the explosions, it becomes really easy to not remember the music with all the sonic chaos that goes on. As far as the score itself, it's very much like summer blockbusters which is loud and bombastic and it rears its head now and then and it sounds nice sure but given the loudness of the main gameplay itself, it's kind of easy to overlook. One thing that isn't a slouch is the sound design as the car engines and even that light \"whoosh\" you hear when passing under street lights or bridges overhead is a nice touch and of course the explosions sound amazing as well.Gameplay: Split Second in a sense has a gimmick: blow *** up. When you do drifts, drafts, jumps or narrowly escape being wrecked it fills up a meter with 3 segments. These are called \"power plays\" and they function like this: get close enough to a racer till a blue icon appears and press the A button in which something on the track will end up triggering which can range from simple bus explosions, a garbage truck backing up or a tractor spinning its claw along the track. The red icon tends to be that times 2 with some bigger explosions and in some cases, huge environmental destruction such as a helicopter dragging a huge steel stone through a tunnel, not only hitting any cars in front but blowing the roof off as well. And then there is the route changers, catastrophic events that literally change the course of the race which can range from a 747 crash land on the runway you just so happen to be driving along, a Space Needle-looking building collapsing in front of you, allowing the spire to act like a ramp to go to the rooftops and some others that I don't want to spoil. These are easily the highlight of the game and the first time they happen, you can't help but exclaim \"holy ****\" as the game becomes a racer by way of Jerry Bruckheimer. Narrowly being hit by a flaming bus that's flipping along the road creates a huge sigh of relief and demolishing a building that not only causes it to cave in but wipe out one or more drivers but then a problem hits: it becomes too familiar. You'll start to memorize the pattern and the location of each power play and although you might not know exactly when they'll be triggered, you'll know that on this particular piece of road, stick to the right since that giant falling metal beam doesn't hit there, even if the event is triggered or not. It doesn't become boring since a crashing 747 is still damn intense, especially when you juuuust drive under its wings but that unpredictability of not knowing how to react or deal with an exploding...something wears off and it starts to become pattern: things blows up, turn right here.One thing that I'd recommend you do is that you hold off on going online with the game. See, the more you race and win in the story mode, the more cars you unlock which can be used online. Going online doesn't mean you have a full roster of cars but rather what you've unlocked is what you use and it can become frustrating and to a certain extent unfair since if you just want to go online, be prepared to be absolutely manhandled because they have way more faster cars than you. The online experience was pretty smooth I felt, if a tad slow to get the match started but the matchmaking is generally an issue as well. You don't necessarily rank up like you do in shooters or even the upcoming Blur so you can unlock the entire roster of cars but you're rank 99 with rank 1 being the top rank to aim for so just because you have a fast car, doesn't mean you'll fly right to the end. However, the game doesn't really take into account either the amount of cars one has unlocked and the story progress, or their rank, and my second match online was literally against a rank 1 player who naturally won the match thanks to his super hyper car with the high car ranking while I might as well had been driving a pinto compared to his Batmobile or something. I'd recommend either playing against your friends or play about half or 2/3rd of the storyline to unlock the cars and then hop online cause if you go play multiplayer right away, it might be a tad too annoying.One problem that has plagued a couple of racers, namely the recent Mario Kart, is the concept of \"rubber band AI\". What this means is that opponents will suddenly get a massive burst of speed and overtake you despite the fact you're in a faster car or as in the case of games like this and Mario Kart where you can damage and stall other car's progress, they bounce back remarkably fast whereas you crash and go into 6th place, it's remarkably difficult to even come in 2nd let alone first. The AI in this game has a remarkable habit of overshooting you frequently and more than once, I'll see a car that I literally just wrecked with an exploding bus and it's like \"wait are you that 'Robinson' driver I just crashed?\" While online it's not as pervasive, the more you play Split Second, the more the AI just seems to be programmed to drive faster than you regardless. I understand the fun of the game is being in the middle so you can power play the hell out of the front drivers but when the goal of the game is obviously to come into 1st, the game makes it remarkably difficult to even make this happen when they can outrace you at any point when they shouldn't have.The question still stands of course: should you buy Split Second or get Blur instead? Since Blur's not out yet, you'll have to rely on a rental for this game. For some people, the destruction caused by the drivers will be a delight the first little while but then it might wear thin. What would really make the game have longevity is not to take the Forza 3 route and just do car packs one after another but rather to do map packs or \"track packs\" if you prefer. This way, the main selling point of the game can have some fresh ideas and I'm sure Black Rock can think of more \"holy ****!\" moments on the tracks but after awhile, you'll be playing on the same tracks where you'll memorize the same trap placements and it might become a bit too old hat so I definately recommend renting. You might find it a game that takes you by surprise and thus necessitating a full purchase or you might be like me and call it a great game that I certainly wouldn't say no to if it was a gift but I'm not sure if I feel I'd get enough mileage (pun very much intended) out of it if I bought it myself.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Frantz 2.0","summary":"Assassins Creed 3","reviewText":"While not as good as Assassins Creed 2, this is still a very awesome game. We move on from Ezio and into the events of a new \"Assassin\" named Connor. Connor is a deadly force to be reckoned with but his character was not well developed in this entry. Connor is stale, emotionless, and left me not really caring about him once it was all said and done. This goes for all the characters in this game. You don't really get to spend the time with the historical figures here like you did in the other games (i.e. Da Vinci) and that goes for all NPC's included here.The Story and Environment make up for the lack of character development though. The landscapes are beautiful. The weather changes make it even more so. The sound of the rain and your footsteps crunching the snow bring a new level of realism to the experience. The ability to hunt and free roam through the frontier is a wonderful addition. I can't express enough how beautiful the graphics in this game are. It is something you have to see to appreciate.The story is well told. a lot of historical events are highlighted in this game. While detail is lacking on some of them it is still a great experience and should rouse anyone familiar with this time period.The game play as many have mentioned is \"dumbed down\". Controls are very simple, almost too simple and it does not take much effort to get into the feel of how things work. Though while simple, it can be fun at the same time. You'll likely be less aggravated since controlling the battle will take little to no effort and you will be able to enjoy the visuals of the battle and the events surrounding it more.There are a LOT of glitches in this game. From floating weapons, quest entries not being competed as they should be (i.e. Encyclopedia of the Common Man), to npc's walking backwards and stuck halfway into the ground. I once jumped and for some reason was launched into the sky and fell to my death. Many bugs, but I assume a patch will be the way to address these issues.In conclusion this is a very well done game for the most part. A graphical work of art. AC fans should appreciate it as well as some fans of other games such as Red Dead Redemption. There is a lot to do. I was able to get over 40+ hours of entertainment and would not hesitate to do it again. If you are looking for something different from the FPS over saturation in the current game market, give this game a shot. Its a breath of fresh air in a FPS filled venue.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

GTA III is heavily indebted to Mafia movies such as Goodfellas and The Godfather, as well as to the cable television series The Sopranos. Vice City is clearly influenced by Miami Vice and Scarface, while San Andreas draws a great deal of inspiration from Colors and Boyz N the Hood.Episodes from Liberty City carries on this tradition by transforming Grand Theft Auto IV into an homage to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon. As in Kurosawa's film, a set of events is seen from multiple points of view, leaving the player to decide which perspective he or she believes is the most credible. Niko Bellic, Johnny Klebitz, and Luis Lopez, the main characters, each bring a different experience and interpretation to GTA IV's story line. Niko is an immigrant, forced to assimilate and adapt rapidly to a world completely new to him. Johnny is caught in a classic master versus apprentice situation. Luis, who is the only character with any kind of insider status, must choose between building his future and honoring his past.These are all familiar character situations in videogames, of course, but Rockstar creates deeper and richer stories and characters than most other game developers. The majority of games stick to the bare rudiments of character motivation and development. Rockstar has given us THREE strong stories in the GTA IV series, each with a complex and compelling main character. It was ambitious of Rockstar to release Niko's view of the story first, in isolation, without any indication of what was to come later. Many of the events in the Niko version of the story, in fact, aren't fully explained until the Luis and Johnny episodes. Compare that to the usual rote or clich&eacute;d story arcs found in too many games, even multi-episode games. There are a few studios that consistently produce well-written games in addition to Rockstar--Bungie, Valve, and Kojima Productions are three standouts--but the vast majority treat story and plot as afterthoughts.Story and influences aside, the bigger question is whether or not Episodes from Liberty City is fun to play. The answer is YES, even though it is clear that Rockstar devoted a lot more development time to Luis' episode than it did to Johnny's episode. TLAD feels somewhat stripped down and is similar to GTA III in many ways. You'll spend most of your time following the main story, driving or riding to combat missions. If you fully explored Liberty City in Niko's episode, there isn't a whole lot to discover or do that you haven't already experienced. On the other hand, TBOGT contains a much broader variety of missions, side activities, and minigames. Most players will spend more time with TBOGT than with TLAD--but now that they're both part of a value priced twofer disc, it's no big deal. The important thing is to play the series in the order in which it was released (GTA IV then TLAD then TBOGT). If you don't, you'll miss out on properly experiencing how the full story unfolds.Well worth picking up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2010"}

I have not even finished the game yet b/c I have been engrossed in side missions.  I have two different saves going one good and one evil.  I played the 1st hour of the vault about 5 times and each had something different about it depending on my decision.  I ventured on as my good guy and someone wanted me to detonate a bomb in the middle of a town and I thought the money sounds good but a shotgun blast to this guys face sounds even better.  Even though it took like 4 blast b/c my weapons condition I was living the life of my good guy with a vengeance against evil.  As my evil character I came to the town and decided to take the offer and leave the town in ruins.  After stealing a lot of stuff and making myself even more evil I decided it was time to go.  So I went off to his base and watched from a distance a amazing site of a giant mushroom cloud.  I did miss out on some side quest though since everyone in the town died.This is what I have been doing since getting this game and I don't want to rush through it.  This is exactly what I hoped this game would do.  My time thus far as been greatly enjoyed and I haven't even made an attempt for the main quest yet.  Though I have completed some side quests that really offered no real benefit and I felt like it was worthless to nothing.  In Oblivion I felt like what I did really made a difference and this game in a little way is lacking it in certain side quests.Is there any problems with the game of course the answer is yes.  I do wish character development was a little better and I think I prefer Oblivions system of leveling up over this one but its still awesome none the less.  Is this Oblivion with guns in some ways it is but it is so much more than that.  I could not bring myself to lower it down to that especially when I target someones head and watch it in slo mo as the guys head explodes in chunks all over the place or taking a laser pistol and severing someones head with it.  There is even more to this game than just exploding body parts though it is an enjoyable one.A few annoyances are that the graphics are great but not overly awesome.  The detail to the environment is kinda what I expected with a lot of gray tones and a overall bleak atmosphere.  I think some people think after a nuclear war there would be a lot more green or something b/c I have heard gripes about the look of the game.  The VATS camera can be annoying sometimes and there is a lot of slo mo so if you don't like that than you might want to get used to it.  The character models are kinda stiff and the voice acting does kinda overlap with the same people.  I think thats how it was in Oblivion though.  The whole part with a couple side quest not really benefiting you that much is kinda a let down.Even though I didnt find the gameplay as deep as Oblivion I enjoyed it a lot more.  This game should not be rushed through and do yourself a favor if you get it and take your time with it.  So much to do and see and there is something around ever corner most the time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2008"}

Witness the harsh realities of nuclear fallout rendered like never before in modern super-deluxe HD graphics. From the barren Wasteland, to the danger-filled offices and metro tunnels of DC, to the hideous rotten flesh of a mutant's face.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Covino","summary":"Best game I played in YEARS","reviewText":"For those who have ever pondered what the world would be like if humanity reverted to the Dark Ages in the near future, then let Fallout 3 reveal at least one possible outcome to man's inevitable destructive behavior: Nuclear War.This post-apocalyptic story begins with you growing up inside an underground vault that was constructed 200 years before the Nuclear Fallout to keep some of society's prominent citizens and their offspring alive while everyone outside was eradicated. Life within the Vault is like a small watered down version of George Orwell's 1984. Everyone is completely controlled by one man, The Overseer, who has indoctrinated everybody below him to indoctrinate their children with \"His\" rule. That is until your father, the vault's leading doctor, somehow manages to escape, forcing you to flee into the Capital Wasteland.It is here when the game truly begins. From here the producers of the game lets go of your hand and you are to follow no particular path but your own. The moment you step foot out from that vault and see the sunlight for the first time with the dismal wastes spread out before you, you feel the excited uncertainty of the burden you now carry. With no one there to make the next decision for you, whether it be the producers of the game, your character's father or the Overseer, you know one wrong decision could be your last. The Wastes are a brutal, unforgiving place of poverty, enlarged irradiated animal life and raiders who will kill you for the shirt off your back.But I still have not gotten to what makes this game so great. Probably what I find most attractive is the free-roam style of the game. If you want to travel to the west to visit the mysterious Radio towers that still transmit 200 year old pre-war signals, then you can; or if you wish to travel to the east and navigate the ruins of crushed cinderblock and bent rebar in the downtown DC area to visit what the future holds for the monuments, then by all means.Forget Oblivion. Oblivion had a great thing going with its sandbox style of play, but so much of it was just empty space and caverns with nothing in them. Not so in this game. In Fallout, everywhere you go you will discover fascinating things. Like one time my radio picked up a distress signal that was strongest near an old drainage pipe. It was a man's voice pleading for someone's aid, stating that his kid was dying. Inside the sewage pipe you find the skeletal remains of an adult and child interlocking hands. This other time in George Town DC I found a townhouse--the only one standing after the nuclear fallout 200 years ago. Inside the house was a robotic man servant. Of the 3 commands you can give the robot, one was to recite a poem to the children, where it would make its way to the kids room and loom over the bed where the burnt bones still lay, and recite a somber poem of man's ultimate demise. Another time I crawled inside an anthill full of benign ants in a world where most ants are hostile toward humans. The list goes on. Random surprises like this throughout the vast Wasteland really brought the world of Fallout to life. This is something every game developer should learn from. A game can have the best graphics and unbelievable action, but it's still boring if the video game world fails to have a life of its own.Following in your father's legacy of restoring Project Purity and to rid the world's water of radiation is not even half the game. If that's all you did then you obviously missed the big picture. The side quests and unmarked quests are numerous. To complete them all would take at least 50 hours. They are more entertaining than the Main Quest by far. Let me list a few that come to mind: Help some runaway slaves to restore the Lincoln Memorial, Establish a Communications Relay Disc at the top of the Washington Monument so Disc Jockey Three Dog can counter attack the Enclave's Propaganda on the wasteland's airways, or retrieve the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives and sell it to a guy who lives on a grounded Aircraft Carrier that collects Pre-War junk for 500 bottle caps, the currency of the future. You got to love this stuff.The game reminds me of a few post-apocalyptic films. The town Megaton reminds me of the town in Waterworld, put together by salvaged scrap to keep raiders out and the citizens inside safe. The clothes people wear are just patched together from several different materials. Traders willing to pay good money for a jar of dirt (hey, in a world that has nothing, anything can have a price). Just about anything you can pick up and carry with you in Fallout, someone is willing to buy. The raiders remind me of the Pirates in the film Cyborg, cruel and sadistic. The western wastes remind me of the old Planet of the Apes, a world with few traces of humanity left.With all that is great about Fallout 3, no game is perfect. The one major complaint I have is with the combat. No fool is just going to run out into someone's line of fire to shoot back. I can't understand why they didn't include a lean feature so you can peek around the corner of buildings with your rifle. They could even go further and allow you to put your back up against walls, like in manhunt, where every object is an opportunity to avoid someone's bullets and to aggressively return fire without getting shot so often.What's with level 20 being your maximum level? With all the enemies I've killed through my second play through of Fallout, I could have gained a level 40 character that perfected the skill of Big Guns, Small guns, Energy Weapons, Melee Weapons...everything. But it stops at 20, so you're not going to ever have a versatile character. You're only going to be able to perfect just a few of the skills that the game offers.Although the radio stations played an interesting and somehow suitable selection of songs as you wander the wastes, the selection is small and repeats itself for the 100 hours you'll be playing. Better to just turn it off. More songs added as you advance through the game would have been awesome.There's more, but creators cannot satisfy every need. These 3 though I felt were inexcusable, but they in no way will stop you from playing Fallout. This bleak and very possible portrayal of mankind's future is not just food for thought; it is something we can all look forward to when we finally do ourselves in. No game depicts the nature of human beings better. Even after the Nuclear War in Fallout, and our numbers in the world are few, people still tread a destructive path of conflict and kill what little are left standing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2009"}

{"product_name":"B004FYEZMQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Greg","summary":"Return of the Shepard","reviewText":"Ah, the trilogy.  A juggernaut of money making potential, a cesspool of rabid fan disappointment and, above all else, absolute proof that you will never, ever please everyone.As of the writing of this, Mass Effect 3 has a user rating of less than 3 stars, which blows my little mind.  This'll be a long review (more of a reaction than a review, really) because there's so much to talk about: hate and anger and hate and indoctrination theories and more hate and what have you.  So feel free to skip around, but know this from right now:  Mass Effect 3 is a brilliant game.  Strong, fun, emotional: it builds on the gameplay and story elements of the previous two, makes a host of improvements, and adds massive replay value to each game in the series.  I can't imagine not recommending it to anyone who's enjoyed the previous games.Even if it does have a stupid ending.So there.====The Gameplay; \"Ducking and Rolling and Omni-Blades - Oh My!\"====It feels sort of odd to jump into a gameplay discussion like it ain't no thing... but it really ain't no big thing (or thang, whatever).  If you've played the second Mass Effect (and seriously, who's played the third and only the third in this series?  That would be weird) then you're already familiar with how things are going to go down.  Its 3rd person, over the shoulder, and cover based gun combat, with some light melee sprinkled in.  You've got a series of skills to use, mostly science magic, to help you and your squad of two others survive waves of ugly, ugly space monsters.  It's an engrossing experience, smoothed out a touch from the its predecessor, but is still a little rough around the edges.  Shepard doesn't always stick to cover reliably, your squadmates are forever in your way - it's not as polished a shooter as, say, Gears of War, but it's still a really satisfying, compelling, rich enough experience.  There have been some specific improvements since the last chapter - Shepard can roll and dodge and has a much more aggressive melee attack.  Grenades are back (kaboom!) and squadmates are much more responsive to your orders.  Again, it's not mind blowing, but it's good; it's compelling and fun and doesn't get dull.We've got some new enemies to face and then shoot in the face - most of which can best be described as 'space monsters'.  This is probably my first point of disapproval, but also the lightest, so who cares.  BUT, I was a little disappointed with this: most of Mass Effect deals with pretty clear and mostly believable enemies (mercenaries, pirates, robots, robots, robots).  Anything that comes across as monstrous (like the Rachni, or the Reapers themselves) usually comes equipped with some kind of in depth exploration to explain what they are and where they come from.  But all of a sudden we have the of 'Reaper Forces', a slew of foot-soldier type monsters that the Reapers created to... I don't know, kill people better than the giant space lasers they have?  Maybe harvest bodies and such?  I guess that's probably it, though you never see any of that in action.  The monster designs are neat, and artfully pull elements from the species that the Reapers have been collecting... but it also starts to push things further from the science fiction realm and deeper into the fantasy realm.  The Reaper forces have odd shapes, glowing eyes, and are starting to look more and more like generic monsters or orcs or something.  ...In fact, they're almost EXACTLY like the darkspawn from Dragon Age: Origins.  They're even created in a similar fashion.  It's one of those little additions that start to stretch and blur the borders of the mass effect universe.  It works well enough and maybe it's just a personal preference, but still...Oh, also there are some ninjas.  With swords and everything.  I have this theory that if you're introducing ninjas into a world where they haven't already been established, then you're officially running out of ideas.  I guess I'll make this exhibit 'A' for that theory.  (Send me a message if you want to discuss the absurdity and absolute impracticality of bringing a sword to a gun fight)But that's it, really, as far as gameplay goes.  New skills, new enemies, same flavored sauce on top.  There are no vehicle type levels, no big risks taken with new gameplay mechanics and only a couple of truly cinematic-type fights; it's moslty just straight up, Mass Effect awesomeness.  It's tried and true and wholly enjoyable, but doesn't break new ground or even try to; they took what worked and ran with it.====The Design:  \"A New, Same, New Normandy\"This is probably the aspect of the third installment that I'm happiest about.  You could say delighted, titillated, ecstatic even.  The overall artistic design of the game has improved, grown richer, deeper, and so, so much prettier WITHOUT losing its integrity.  With the exception of the space monsters and occasional ninja (and those are only light divergences) it still FEELS like Mass Effect.  It sounds like nothing, but maintaining the tone of something, especially a video game, with all its variables, is really difficult and being able to do so is the hallmark of real a talent.The locations, especially the cityscapes, are gorgeously detailed and the visuals seem to go on for miles.  Reapers as tall as scycrapers do their death marches in the distance as you fight your way through incredibly detailed piles of rubble, hiding amongst disused vehicles and slabs of concrete.  Long gone are the generic levels of the first game, long gone are the small and blocky levels from the second.  You can see hints of those in the bones, in the basic structure, but it's such a mind bending improvement that I think I'm starting to figure out where most of the time and money went.Ditto, doubly so even, for the sound design.  Mass Effect has always had a quirky, ethereal quality the soundtrack.  The core has been retained but the body has been given a whole new life.  It's a truly lovely score that supports the action onscreen and makes for some seriously cinematic moments.  Everything, from the light & sad instrumentals that get punctuated by the horrific `roar' of the Reapers, down to the nuts and bolts of gunfire and ambient voices - everything is so artfully and splendidly done.  If Mass Effect 3 wins only one award ever, I really, really hope it's for sound design or mixing.Look at me, gushing away.====Exploring the Universe : \"Help, Help, I've Run Out of Fuel Again!\"====Oh, so we're still flying a ship around on this little map, are we?  Huh.  Am I the only person who misses the point n' click map from Mass Effect 1?  ...just me, huh?  Damn.I don't have a lot of complaints about this game, but I'll throw this one out there; exploring the galaxy map never congealed into anything more than 'servicable' over the three games.  They've kept the basics from ME2 - piloting a little version of the Normandy around a map and rationing fuel.  The 'Scanning for Resources' mini game is gone, as are the four resources from ME2, and it's been replaced by using broad scans (almost like a submarine's 'ping') to look for fuel and 'War Assets' - weapons, people, ships and such that can be used to fight the Reapers... or, you know, raise your 'Galactic Readindess' score, as you never see or use any of the assets you find.I suppose the big changes are that you no longer discover side missions by exploring worlds (most are orders from Hackett or come through your email... in game email, not real-world email, that would be creepy) and that the Reapers are actively hunting you in most star clusters (more and more of them, as the game progresses).  Do too many 'pings' and a group of Reaper ships swoop onto the map to pull the Normandy apart.  It adds a level of tension to the map navigating... but not really in a fun way.  More of an \"I'm just trying to EXPLORE here!  Argh!\" sort of way.  It's not bad, but it's really indicative of how they never quite figured out what to do with the necessary Galaxy Map navigation; they wanted to make it a more interactive experience, a more... exciting one, I guess.  And they did but... why?Fuel, also, is a much tighter resource, as the Normandy has a diminished capacity and the Reapers have leveled most of the fuel depots you relied on in ME2.  Again, it adds a layer of tension and planning, but not in any way I'd call fun.I guess it's also worth mentioning that there are very few 'new' systems to explore.  If you've played the first two, then you've more than likely been to every system you'll see in ME3 and read most of the planet descriptions already.  It is the same galaxy, after all.  I suppose this is why they cut back on exploring and gave us a way to quickly scan each system; I suppose that makes more sense than forcing the player to slowly dig through areas of the galaxy they've already been too, that is.====The Story; \"Hey, Shepard, can you fix our deep seeded social issues real quick?  Thanks!\"====(LIGHT SPOILERS AHOY!)Now we're talking - this is what we show up to Mass Effect for!  Deep, rich, variable plots and character development!  ...wow, it's pretty amazing these things are as popular as they are, isn't it?I'm happy to say that the story is a definite Mass Effect story.  An exciting opening - a dramatic turn around - a thrilling final sequence.  High points, low points, exciting reveals.  Loose-ends tied up, plot threads resolved, character arcs completed.  Everything you'd hope for and expected to see is in there...Relax, I'm not talking about the ending yet.  So calm down.  I'll get to it in a minute and you can be plenty mad at me then.  Just hold on.The bulk of the story involves Shepard circling the galaxy, trying to convince everyone that, yes, the Reapers are something that we should be working together to stop.  It sounds a little forced because... well, it is.  But it feels balanced in the end - you're asking species with deep, deep hatred for one another to open up all their secrets, get super-duper vulnerable to each other.  So that fact that the Krogans or the Turians want favors or promises of favors before laying it all on the line kind of makes sense... well, enough sense to justify the game anyway.  If nothing else, it's a wonderful excuse to tie up plot threads we've been dying to tie up while still keeping focus on the Reaper threat and, in the end, is far more effective than not.The Illusive Man devolves a little into something of a mustache twirling villain - but for reasons that make sense, at least.  And the good guys are putting all their efforts into a plot-resolving 'happy ending bomb' that makes all the bad guys go away at once... which is usually something I hate (thanks for that,Gears of War 3.  sigh).  But, again, it's handled with a little Mass Effect logic and some class, so it's not all that bad.  They're all tired plot elements, is what I'm saying, but I hesitate to say they're 'lazy'.  Nothing about this game feels lazy to me...Rushed, though, I'd say that indeed.  Sometimes really, really rushed.  \"Hey, Shepard, you're back for retirement or whatever, let's go talk to some of these folks who are in charge of something I guess - oh, look out, Repears!  Everyone's dying, probably!  Quick, go unite the galaxy, we'll wait here!  Oh, that's James, he's new.\"  I'm sure this is (at least partly)  the result of real world pressure to get the game out on time, and also partly because the dev team had a TON of ground to cover, storywise... but it's still a little disappointing.  Character introductions are rushed as are a few big story elements (wait... Thessia's gone?  just... already?  How?  What does that even mean?)  Lots and lots of things happen in this story (even before DLC) and, as a result, some of what should probably be the most emotionally compelling parts -all the stuff that happens on Earth- actually end up feeling the most hastily done.  I had a MUCH bigger emotional reaction the Krogan missions and to the Quarian/Geth struggles than I did with anything that happened on Earth because the writers really took their time with those sequences - they cover multiple planets in multiple systems, introduce new characters and bring old ones back into the fold.  They have action, heartbreaking emotion, gut-wrenching decisions to be made (that you feel the effects of) and some incredible cinematic moments.  I dare say, they may be the best sequences in the Mass Effect trilogy... and they happen in the middle of the story.  At the beginning and end of the 2nd act, I believe.  It's hard to believe, but  they stuck the best stuff in the middle, and left the beginning and the end feeling truncated, rushed, perhaps even... weirdHold on, I'm not there yet.  Soon, my friends, soon.===The Characters: \"Huh... where is everybody?\"===(S'MORE SPOILERS, Y'ALL)This is more of an observation than anything else, but the roster of characters feels small...  Which isn't true, really, it's about the size of what we had in ME1.  Bigger, even, with some DLC and, you know, provided certain people survived ME2.ME2 had a massive cast because the game was ABOUT that cast, learning about the characters and gaining their loyalty.  ME3 is much more about the plot and the bigger story happening but...  well, most of these folks we know arleady.  Liara, Kaiden/Ashley, Tali & Garrus (provided they're alive).  Even Edi we sort of already know, though not in this new, nude, weirdly proportioned form.  James is new but... who cares?  The only real interesting addition, the only one we have anything to learn about is Javik, the Prothean... available only in the day one DLC.  Which upset no one at all and only made people very, very happy, I'm sure.So, yeah, it's a little bit of a backwards slide, especially coming off the previous installments, when learning about your weirdo crew was a third of the game or more.  It is fun to see the old familiar faces on the Normandy, to celebrate the past or mourn the dead (both of which happen, as the events of the previous games are felt and weigh heavy on this one).  But it would have been good to through one or two new, interesting (sorry James) faces into the mix.  Javik certainly could have been fleshed out into a full, in game character... probably SHOULD have been, in retrospect.It's a small point to make and is ultimately overshadowed by the plot, but it was worth mentioning.====On the Ending... thanks for being so patient====Awwwwwwwww yeah, here it is!Far and away, without a doubt, the most hotly debated and fiercely hated part of the game is the last twenty minutes (or the last two hours, depending on who you talk to).  Never before outside of like, actual politics, have I seen such harsh polarization and so many angry, angry words thrown about.  I can only imagine the BioWare offices the day after release, when the reactions started flooding in.  They must have known there would be some grumbling, but could they possibly have predicted such a violent storm?With that said, I have to admit... I didn't hate the ending so much.  I didn't like it, I don't think it's the best way they could have gone, as way confused as to WHY they did, but I didn't hate it.Yes, it is weird.  Yes, it's a little out of place.  Like the beginning of the game, it feels hasty; rushed even.  And, yes, the last few hours are ultimately disappointing.  But it certainly didn't make me angry.Okay, here's my take on the last few sequences...(HEAVY SPOILERS, OF COURSE...)After a kick-ass assault on The Illusive Man (some people call him TIM, I like to call him Louie) and a disappointing fight with a magic ninja, we finally, FINALLY return to Earth... and things go back to feeling rushed (frowny-face).  We're in London... for some reason.  The Reapers have moved the Citadel to Earth instead of out into dark space or, I don't know, anywhere else for that matter.  Oh, and this is Major Coats, he's voiced by Mark Strong and seems really important, but don't ask any specific questions about him.In what should be the most satisfying, emotionally charged point of the game, we get a deluge of unanswered or half-answered questions.  Everything moves along so quickly, so haphazardly, so... so...Let's take a breather and talk about story structure... actually, that would take forever and no one cares.  So let's just talk about one aspect: the 'obligatory scene'.  This is something that can be defined many ways, but I'll sum it up as 'the scene your audience is expecting to see' or 'the thing that, if we don't get it, we'll be really cranky'.  It's essentially the orgasm of your story, if that helps.  And if we're left without it... well, you get the point.There are a couple of things that we were hoping to see in Mass Effect 3, whether we realized it or not.  Certain plot threads that had been introduced or ideas that were slipped into our minds.  Of the many over the course of three games, those that stand out to me are: massive armies of mixed aliens fighting together, the Illusive man coming to some kind of conclusion (the bloodier the better; I hate that guy), and a some kind of show down with Harbinger, the unofficial mascot of the Reapers that's been hounding us since ME2.  The events of the previous games have put these thoughts into our heads as the most prevalent, most important facets left in the Mass Effect universe.  These are the things that, whether we can articulate it at the time or not, we're EXPECTING to see get played out, one way or another, before the curtain falls.  These are the OBLIGATORY scenes, based on all the scenes that have come before.And, save for the Illusive Man (and even that one's up for debate), they are not addressed.  We get two quick scenes of Krogan-Assari-Turian armies together.  No Geth anywhere, no Quarian, no Salarian, Elcor, Batarian, anything else we've put time into gathering.  That's it.  Then Harbinger shows up, whoops our ass good, and takes off like he's got 99 problems and we ain't one.  And THIS, in my meek little opinion, is why the ending is so frustrating.  I honestly and truly think that all the star-child weirdness, all the plot-resolving explosions, would have gone over much better if any of these other expected outcomes had been delivered.This is why I say the team, the writers, the whomever, were HASTY and RUSHED and definitely not BAD or LAZY.  They know these things, clearly, based on the strengths of the other games.  The BioWare team doesn't need me to explain story structure to them; they know it better than I do and have delivered shining examples time and time again.  It makes me feel like the outside world pressed heavy in some way and they had to rush out parts of the game before it was complete.  I can't see any other reason for leaving out such obvious and pressing plot points (potential plot points, I guess).I would love a documentary on just what the hell happened but, sadly, we'll never ever get one.And, you know what?  The Star Child, being of light thing doesn't bother me.  It's an odd choice, granted.  Evertyhing after the final charge on that oh-so convenient teleporter beam is... odd.  They took the esoteric route, for some reason, the anachronistic route, for the first time in the series.  It was a brave choice and, again, I do think that if they'd spent more time satisfying the obligatory scenes it would have gone over better.  But it was really surprising, in a universe that is so specific and literal, to have a sequence that may not be what it appears to be on the surface.  That may or may not be a dream or that could possibly be a... parable?  Maybe a cipher of some kind?  I don' know, but it's not the sort of thing that easily fits into Mass Effect, which has been a very literal, very `on the surface' sort of game, without many unexplained magic or fantasy elements.  How Mass Effect Technology works, Biotics, Element Zero - all these things are laid out clearly and succinctly, mostly.  I mean... I know how many testicles a Krogan has... that's a pretty specifically laid out world.  But once we're back on the Citadel things become strange, dreamlike, as though there's something more going on - some grand point being made that lies just beyond explanation.My personal take has always been that, once we reach the endgame, we've entered into the part of the story that later becomes a fable.  For me, the most important part of the whole ending are the Stargazers, Buzz Aldrin (seriously, google it) and the little kid after the credits, talking about tales of 'The Shepard' (get it?  GET IT!!??).  They're talking about an old story, about the person who saved humanity.  It sounds like he's telling an origin myth, like the Garden of Eden or Noah's Flood and all that - a fable about why the world is what it is.  Seriously, after Joker and whoever get off the busted Normandy (have their Adam and Eve moment) and the Relays get blowed up, just add Buzz Aldrin saying \"...and that's why the world is the way it is today!\"  It totally feels like they tried to change everything we'd been doing for three games into an Aesop.  \"Once upon a time, humans could fly around the galaxy using magical devices called 'Mass Effect Relays...\" or \"Did you know, a long, long time ago, humans and robots were two different things?  And we used to fight each other?  Until, that is, the story of the Shepard...\"It works but it's... such an odd choice.  I like that it embraces the severity of Shepard's situation - things are much bigger now than winning or losing a battle.  The star-child is forcing him to deal with some high concepts; can organics be trusted with the galaxy?  Can they ever truly control what they create?  Will this peace between the Quarian and Geth really last beyond the fight with the Reapers, or is it a pipe dream?  It stretches beyond the battle raging out the window and acknowledges that Shepard is at the apex of a cycle that has existed for epochs unknown and, in fact, unknowable.  That's a lot of pressure for one person.It's weird, it's potentially heady, but it's not the worst thing in the world.  Nor is it the worst ending I've ever seen.  I think it could have played out if a) it hadn't of been so rushed and b) the obligatory scenes were delivered.====The Epilogue and An Invitation to Suck It====None of this, as weird and unbalanced as it turned out, undoes for me the hundreds of hours of quality entertainment that the Mass Effect series has brought.  99 to 99.9% of the series is among the most well thought out, most imaginative, bravest stuff I've seen in the past ten years.  I've dreamt of the concept of a connected series of games, where the choices I make in one carry over to the next, for ages now.  And someone managed it - honestly and truly pulled it off.  And it's glorious.And now it will never happen again.Seriously, why would anyone bother?  With all the work that it takes to connect the games in a satisfactory way, the thousands of variable scripts that need to be written and accounted for, the hundreds of hours spent writing and recording double and triple dialogue for each scene - why would anyone do that again after BioWare tried it and all it got them in the end was a pile of bad player reviews and a page of youtube hate videos.  I would have been so much easier to just make three straight narratives and, in the end, the fans appreciated exactly NONE of it.  So why bother?  EA will make the exact same amount of money pushing out another Madden and will have to deal with ZERO grief from spoiled, unappreciative fans.So... to all those who cry for boycotts and send hate mail... just... just suck it.  You're ignoring thousands of hours of effort; hundreds of hours of lovely gameplay in a world that is more than worth revisiting again and again, in a series where the sequels are better than the originals and each adds replay value to the ones before simply by existing (name me one other series where that's true).  You're dooming us to years and years of more modern warfare clones and Halo sequels because, as soon as a company takes a risk on something unusual, you smack them in the face as hard and as loud as you can if you find any failings at all.  The amount of hate I've heard, from fans \"demanding\" the ending they \"deserve\", like petulant children, is going to frighten anyone from taking any risks again.  So just... just suck it already.Anyone who's bothered to read this far is bound to hit me with and 'unhelpful', or whatever it's called, and I seriously don't care.  Leave angry messages, whatever, I don't care.I fully appreciate the Mass Effect series: the ambitious writing, the solid action, the heart-felt story, the diverse characters, the excellent sound and music design, the unique world.  It's a series of games built with love and affection and devotion and I cannot fathom throwing all that away because the very last part of the very ending is disappointing.And it IS disappointing, I freely admit that, there's no denying that it doesn't work.  But to ignore all that has come before, all the work and all the love, is the pinnacle of immaturity and the epitome of the spoilt, selfish, childish gamer.

Nathan Hale.View larger.This sequel introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers.View larger.Resistance 2 takes up right where Resistance: Fall of Man left off. Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs. Most impressive are the stand-alone, class-based, online co-operative campaign mode that can accommodate up to eight players, and the mind-blowing, 60-player, squad-based online competitive multiplayer battle fest. This unprecedented 60-player option could revolutionize online multiplayer game play and is sure to provide countless hours of action-packed fun.Resistance 2, set in the United States, is loaded with new weapons, enemies, and an unprecedented online gaming experience.","reviewerName":"Ivan Tovar \"Ivan0072\"","summary":"Disappointment In 2","reviewText":"This Game Sucks The First Was Better.

Also depending on how you set your difficulty allows the game to be very forgiving or unforgiving in where you aim.What many players will miss is the open world sandboxes that we are used to getting in GTA, RDR, and LA Noir but thankfully as I mentioned, the story gets you past the action sequences as well as the variety of weapons.One thing the game also does to keep you busy is push you to find 'golden guns'.  You find parts of a weapon and you get it as well as whatever bonuses imbued in the gun so that can be a fun distraction also.I haven't had time to play the multi-player yet so I will edit later but so far Max Payne while not hitting it out of the park is still a solid title.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-16-2012"}

Both are independent games, but when they're linked between two Game Boy Color consoles via the separately sold Game Link cable, players can share items, uncover story elements, and unlock hidden areas in each game.InOracle of Seasons, players help Link embark on a quest to recover the Essences of Nature. To do so, he must first find the Rod of Seasons, a magical item that lets Link transform the landscape into the season of his choice, helping him overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. Ricky the kangaroo, Moosh the winged bear, and Dimitri the dodongo accompany Link on this adventure.Using the Harp of Ages, Link must travel through time and space to save Nayru, the eponymous prophet inOracle of Ages, who's been kidnapped by the evil sorceress Veran. By learning new melodies to play on the harp, players will travel to the past and affect changes in the present to solve the game's varied puzzles.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"An enjoyable Zelda you can take with you","reviewText":"I notice a pattern with Zelda releases: when they're on Nintendo's main machines likes the Nintendo 64(Ocarina of Time) or the Wii(Twilight Princess), there's an unbelievable amount of hype and press that kicks in. The handheld stuff though gets raves from fans yet they barely register in terms of hype. Originally planned as a trilogy, Nintendo decided to make Link's next handheld adventure be a dual deal with Oracle of Seasons and Oracle of Ages released simultaneously. Essentially they're the same game with minor alterations but boy do you have fun regardless.Story: Each game revolves around the need to rescue a princess and in this case it's Din, the Oracle of Seasons. With her kidnapped, the seasons are thrown out of balance which can potentially mean that there could be endless winter or quick shifts from summer to fall and back again. And of course it's up to Link to rescue her from Onyx.Graphics: Keep in mind that this is Game Boy Color so it probably won't have the dazzle that Minish Cap managed to pull off. Hell, it doesn't even look as sharp as Link to the Past. What it is though is vibrant and colorful and this game in particular just looks so rich. The game also has some anime-style still cut scenes to tell the story which is a nice touch.Sound/Music: Obviously no voice acting since this is GBC, not to mention a Zelda game. Where the game shines though as the series always has is in its music. While it probably doesn't have that instant purchase that Ocarina or Link to the Past was, it's nonetheless an enjoyable soundtrack that fits the mood for places perfectly.Gameplay: Zelda games on the GBC are pretty much the same as something like Link to the Past but in one sole difference: your inventory. While in LttP, you had to actually go to your screen for each individual item. Ocarina and onwards made it so that you can carry 3. Here it's 2. While it's weird to get used to, some bosses require you change items on the fly and I had no problem. There's some new items such as Rod of Seasons which you can use to progress in the game. An example is something is only accessible if you freeze a lake and provide a pathway then go back to spring and get the item.The big thing here is the password system. Essentially Seasons and Ages were meant to be bought at the same time; unlike Pokemon where you bought one and a friend bought the other, in order to get the most of Oracle series, you beat one and you get a password. Jot it down, start up the other and input the password and continue from there. Also, NPC's can give you passwords which you tell to people in the other game to get special items. While it gets slightly tedious to have to go back and forth all the time, the items tend to be well worth it.Now for people who are wondering, Seasons is the more accessible in terms of new Zelda players or in difficulty. This is more action-oriented and it's a bit more forgiving. So if you're more of the action type, pick Seasons. But in the end, you should just buy both since you'll probably think \"well since I beat one of them...\"","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2006"}

It just didn't have enough...Wiiness if that makes any sense. While there are wonderful ideas and elements in the game SMG is nothing original. The game has you flying across planetoids and what not to save Princess Peach from Bowser once again. With the addition of collecting star bits by using the cursor of the Wiimote and using them to stun enemies and feed Lumas, this is just one of many elements that makes SMG great.You can flick the Wiimote to make Mario spin, and the controls are very well thought out. It's not really the controls or anything that makes SMG unique but its the style of the game. For example there is a galaxy where you'll have fruit planetoids and you need to smash wood plugs to make a worm come out of the apple planetoids to cross to the next. With this coupled with bright colorful (and actually somewhat next-gen) graphics it's total eye candy (for the Wii anyways). The game also sports charming and wonderful music. What also makes the game unique is how you explore the levels. The game uses gravity tricks a lot such as switching gravity on you at certain points, using gravity spotlights, being able to walk around a planetoid instead of falling off etc. You can also change into Bee Mario, which lets you fly and cling to walls, there's Fire Mario, Rainbow Mario, Ice Mario etc.All these things are just so cleverly crafted together and it gives you that warm fuzzy feeling inside. There's no way to express how cool this all is unless you just play the game. While this is good and all it does have its flaws. There are occasional frustrating platforming segments that have too much action going on, or things move to fast for you to figure out what to do. While the game does sport a co-op mode it's nothing really special or interesting. The story is the same as every other Mario game and has a confusing and disappointing ending etc.The only people who don't see this are the Nintendo fan boys and die-hard Mario fans. I wouldn't consider this a winner for GotY but definitely for best Wii game of the year. If you have a Wii please pick this up and if you don't then this is a good enough of a reason to.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

I bought this entire package off of steam for like 15 dollars.  They are having a huge christmas sale right now and you can get a full company's catalog of games for like 75 dollars.  It's like a 400 dollar value you get for 75 dollars.  Anyways, for the price, I got a ton of cool games.  Half Life 2 was the prime graphic contender when it came out, I was shocked at how nice it looked.  Then Crysis took over that spot.  But the good thing is, you don't need a monster of a computer to make Half Life 2 look nice.  Anyways, the real reason why I wanted to create a review for this is because of Portal.  This is a fantastic puzzle like game.  I'm sure you've seen videos of it.  You shoot portals that transform you to the other spot in the game.  Each puzzle is tricky.  I'm getting to some really hard ones right now, but eventually I will beat them.  Some get you stuck, others are easy.  Anyways, I was going to rate this bundle 4-stars, but for the price and amount of games you get I will give it 5.  The reason for the 4-stars was because of the updates.  You have to update each game and they take forever, it took me the better half of today to do it.  Also, the games won't run with the shortcuts alone.  You need to go into steam to launch each game which is kind of dumb, but it's fine.  I am really happy with portal, and I feel I got my money's worth alone with that game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2010"}

It's just as addictive as the PC games, but eliminates a lot of the micro-managing.  City management is more streamlined, and the workers have been eliminated.  The games are much shorter than the PC version, I often finish games within about 3 hours if I'm not at war too often.  The length is good in some ways, because it makes it more of a pick-up and play kind of game.  The drawback is that I wish I had a bit more time to use some of my best technology and weaponry at the end.  Another thing is that I wish there was the option to raze a city.  Often you'll capture a city in a useless position (especially if you're playing as the Mongols), and you're forced to either keep it or leave it empty and let somebody else take it from you.

I truly couldn't find any; just a bit of motion blur which was a bit annoying on the PS3 side.  Below if my review of the 360 version with a few add-ons for the PS3 version.We received this game(PS3 version) on Monday morning and we had the opportunity to tinker around with it for the last two nights.  Rather, I should mention that we completely stopped unpacking and went straight to our new living room to connect our Plasma, 360/PS3 and surround sound so that we could play this game.  Moving be damned!!  Yeah, we are addicted.Very sweet game!  This is an intense and competitive game that I highly recommend for all ages.  The real-world environments are visually stunning and impressive.  I was so surprised to see a Disney logo tacked on the front of my box, but I went against my better judgment and decided to give it a try.  We are very glad we did!The controls are fluid & intuitive and tricks that can be performed make the game so much more fun.  If you start to get cheesy and perform the same tricks over and over (my case), you will start to get rated: TAME OR STALE.  The nicer and more andvanced the trick than you can get a nice FRESH logo!  The \"fresher\" the trick, the more boost (nitrous) and points you will receive.At first you will find that you are gunning it because you want to stay ahead of the pack... when that tires you start to dig deeper so that you can truly perform the \"freshest\" tricks possible.  The downside... the load times were a bit slow and since up to 16 players can play online there was a bit slower load time than the usual that we are accustomed to.Overall... great game, great fun and totally worth it.  We did not see a difference between the 360 and PS3 versions; both beautiful and both intuitive with standard controls that are assigned to each of these systems respectfully.Another negative on the PS3 version is that it seems to be a bit more unforgiving to mistakes in a real world environment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2008"}

AI controlled players are much more aggressive in going after the ball rather than how they would often just stand there and let an opponent intercept a pass or reach a ball in space first. The other is the ability to better hold on to possession. Instead of having a defender all over the ball-handler constantly, those defenders can be better maneuvered around and the opponent made to pay for being out of position or taking too many risks.Will expand on these thoughts and other areas of the game within the coming days.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2013"}

Urban \"U2fan4ever76\"","summary":"A Worthy Next-Gen Sequel, Flaws Aside","reviewText":"I am surprised to read so many negative reviews of Mercenaries 2: World in Flames. (I don't recall the same number of negative reviews for the equally buggy Assassin's Creed, released last year.) It isn't a perfect game (what game is), but it is very enjoyable, just like the first Mercenaries on PS2.Mercenaries 2 expands on the \"playground of destruction\" theme, allowing players to use even more vehicles this time around (including some very large warships), more weapons (all very highly detailed), more ways of destroying nearly everything, and more types of terrain.For those who say the graphics aren't much better than a PS2 game, I have to say, that is just not a fair statement. It isn't as refined as Metal Gear Solid 4 in the graphics department, but then what recent game is? The graphics are sharp and detailed--yes, some buildings are generic and not high-textured, especially in shaded or dark areas, but the character models, weapon models, and vehicle models are all top notch. The day and night cycle are a welcome addition, especially with how great the reflective qualities of the water in the game are. To see some of the buildings (or a castle in one mission) come crumbling down after one of many choices of airstrikes, is just amazing. The level of destruction is very impressive.The storyline is b-movie, but many games' storylines are no better or worse. The actual story part of the game can be completed at about 75-80% of the overall progress which is a little disappointing, especially when the first 20-25% of the game progress happens pretty quickly, then slows down for awhile. What's left are any side missions and unfortunately, while fun, there isn't a big incentive to go back after beating the game. MY ADVICE: Do yourself a favor and do side missions as you see them or as they become available and balance them with the story missions--you will get a longer, more rewarding playing time than I did.The AI is no worse than the first Mercenaries, but not of the level you'd expect in a next-gen game. Often enemies will spot you miles away and are crack shots, which is rather ridiculous, especially when you are trying not to tick off a particular faction at the same time. They also just stand there some times or do erratic things like walk into a building corner and apparently get stuck walking. Now this is where the bugs and glitches come in, as mentioned by other reviewers.There are several, such as poor collision detection (i.e. your character or AI characters seem to be able to move through solid objects at times and sometimes get stuck), poor targeting (sometimes it takes a whole clip to kill a generic bad guy), iffy vehicle controls (flying helicopters is tedious and usually ends in a crash), the red low health screen sticking (when your health drops to near death, the screen goes red, but sometimes it stays red and all of a sudden your health is back to 50 or higher after the screen returns to normal). All in all, none of the glitches or bugs were bad enough to get me to stop playing or to really take away the enjoyment of the game. Basically, in the next-gen age, we are all becoming used to cross-platform games being rushed out and then they try to patch them or correct them later. This is what PC gamers have always had to put up with.In conclusion, Mercenaries 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game that takes the foundation of the first game and updates it to the next-gen of gaming. You will enjoy it despite the problems. Don't let the negative reviews keep you from giving the game a chance. Again, Assassin's Creed was a very glitchy and buggy game and many of these negative reviewers said nothing of that and only praised it. (I consider having the patience to complete Assassin's Creed a great accomplishment of mine! I returned it later to the store as a defective game, which even Ubisoft agreed on their website.)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"geertmatthys","summary":"Fun enough","reviewText":"I've never before played a GTA game, I saw some friends drive a car around and clubbing pedestrians back in the 90's and they said it was 'da bomb'.So for everyone that hasn't touched a GTA game, it's kinda hard to categorize it. You're basically driving a lot and get chased by cops a lot, meanwhile you can engage in sandbox activities, many of which are a fun passtime and at the same time the main storyline unfolds in a Tarantino intertwine scenario (though nowhere near as good)All of this is happening in a very beautiful open LA-copy called Los Santos, full of highways, little mountain roads, cakewalks full of innocent people to molest and even airstrips and some ocean. Everything is laid out in a manner so the already colossal world feels even bigger. You'll pass the same building frequently but it feels different many times. Clever layout of the area.You take control of 3 main characters. Unfortunately Trevor unlock takes a long time so you're basically stuck with Franklin and Michael for 10 hours. These characters each have different personality and slight variations in ability and side missions and work well individually, but are rather awkward when being put together for the storyline. For instance, Franklin is a cool dude but turns sissy around Michael. It would have been better to have access to these 3 from the main menu and allow option for individual completion of objectives without co-op.The main storyline isn't always clear an occasionally you feel a bit lost. The game handles it well though 'cause you'll usually get a phonecall at that 'Lonely in La'-moment. Plenty of sideactivities, (shooting ranges, car customization, surprisingly awesome tennis games, diving, strip clubbing), so in the sandbox category a nifty and well-crafted gameThe driving and misbehaviour is ok, though I'm not a big fan of endlessly driving a car around while the radio wails some crappy song, but that's what a GTA game is all about. The cars handle good and driving takes patience and skill. I do find it annoying that cops are alerted really fast when I assault a pedestrian, even one who is all alone and being stealthkilled will alert the cops. That makes no sense. You'll also notice the complete absence of children in GTA. Stupid censorship at work again. The game is not very violent, I kinda hoped for exploding heads and dismemberment but it's all very wholesome unfortunately, certainly compared to Last of Us.It is also worth noting this game runs bugfree and lagfree, so big kudos to internal testers. This is how open world on ps3 are done.The multiplayer begins in 2 weeks, I'm looking forward to some fun deathmatches, I hope it's good.All in all, a great game, much attention to detail but if you're like me and count Mass Effect, Skyrim and Dragons Dogma among your more popular games it may be more interesting to pick up Diablo 3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0009ENA2W","description":"In Meteos you're the last line of defense, in a bad case of planetary overload. As blocks drop down on the lower screen, you must use the DS's stylus to match up blocks of the same color. Once you have enough blocks connected, they'll shoot back up into the sky to form planets on the upper screen.","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"Incredibly Overrated","reviewText":"THE GOOD: Great presentation featuring catchy tunes and vibrant, colorful graphics; cool interplanetary theme; provides some challengeTHE BAD: Puzzle aspect isn't brain-based but twitch-based; lots of modes but most feel the same; gameplay can get old rather quickly.DIFFICULTY: MediumWhen Meteos was released alongside Lumines for the PSP, they were both hailed as the two \"must-have\" titles for both competing handheld systems. Now, while I haven't played Lumines, Meteos doesn't have much relation in the gameplay theme (if at all), so this one really stands on its own as sort of \"THE\" puzzle game for the DS. Now, while first playing this game was fun, things became old and tired a little too quickly.The main gameplay aspect in Meteos is rather simple: blocks (or shapes) of various colors (or designs) fall from the top a la Tetris, and using the DS stylus you must move these blocks up or down in order to match 3 or more like colors or shapes in one row, therefore they'll shoot upwards, along with any other blocks that may be resting on top of them. The point is to be as quick as possible and not let the blocks pile up to the top, or else, you lose. Various little trinkets exist within the game to try and keep things fresh, like weapons, such as a hammer or bomb for example. These can add more power when touched, therefore eliminating more blocks. There is also a feature where you can speed the drop of blocks by either holding one of the shoulder buttons or rotating an icon on the bottom right of the screen with the stylus (I don't really see the point in this). It all makes for a very colorful and flashy action sequence with the game's interplanetary theme at work using the top screen. Basically, the more blocks you shoot up, the more \"attacks\" fly out into space on the top screen thus destroying whatever planet you need to destroy.Various modes make for some replay value, like a mission mode where you can choose a pattern for which planet you'd like to head to next, or simply challenging planets individually.All this may sound exciting (well, depending on how well I write), but the problem is that no matter how pretty or cute the various stages and backgrounds may look, you're really doing the same thing over and over - moving blocks up and down with the stylus. This wouldn't be so much of a problem if the action weren't so straightforward. By that I mean, the game doesn't really feel like a REAL brain teasing puzzler, but more of a twitchy action frenzy. You have ONE objective in mind, and if you're simply not fast enough to catch a pattern SOMEWHERE, you're as good as dead. This isn't like Tetris where you can plan out some sort of strategy and rotate various blocks according to what YOU think is best, build a pattern and try to up the bonus points. This gives way to different people playing different ways, using different patterns and using blocks differently. In other words, Tetris worked according to how YOU work. Meteos is simply look and react, and this means that no matter who you are, everyone will be playing in the exact same fashion. Of course this becomes old once you've beaten the mission mode various times, by then you'll find yourself playing but not getting excited about it.Another huge letdown is that at times you'll beat a stage and not even know how you did it, because the blocks will simply fall into place THEMSELVES and earn that extra punch to pass the stage. This is incredibly dogging, because many times you feel like you're not the one causing your victory. In simple terms, this game isn't about thinking, it's about reacting... and sometimes getting lucky. This is NOT a puzzle formula in my opinion.The game does try to keep you coming back, because the more stages you beat the more little unlockables you can open, like a mixing sound mode. Here you can open up new tunes and mix some sound effects together. You can also do this wierd purchase-planet and elements mode, where you can fuse elements together. Where you use these elements and how they actually affect gameplay, I have no idea, it simply feels like it's there to give you something completely unnecessary to do.This game has gotten a lot of ridiculously praised press, which in my opinion is most definitely not deserved. It's not addicting, it's not all that exciting after you've beaten the mission mode ONCE, the extras are presented well but ultimately tacked on, and lastly, although the game does use a cool space theme to go with its gameplay, for some reason I just feel like it's lacking a personality of its own.BOTTOM LINE: This feels more like a puzzle game for the casual gamer who wants to feel smart. Real puzzle fanatics will wonder where the hell the real thinking in this game comes in.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2006"}

{"product_name":"B000A0EFJC","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great Game for the Action Game Lover","reviewText":"This game is clearly associated with the 2005 movie. How can we tell? The full name of the game is Peter Jackson's King Kong - The Official Game of the Movie. Subtle!The game was made with complete cooperation of Peter Jackson - he let the gaming team have access to the CGI and sets from the movie, and the game was made at the exact same time.The game plays very much like being in a movie, with smooth slides between cinematic scenes and action sections. That being said, the game of course is FAR more action-oriented than any movie would be. In a movie you might fight off a group of creatures for a short period of time. In the game, of course, the hordes come in numerous, almost endless, waves.This is more than just a beast-slaying game, though. There's a bit of thought involved. For example, if a gigantic dinosaur comes running at you, you don't have to try to slay it in straight-out combat. You can instead kill another random creature that is nearby, and the dinosaur will decide to go munch on it.There are a few levels that you can play as Kong, but really for most of the game you are playing as a normal human in a band of friends. The various friends around you can either be helpful or REALLY annoying, depending on their mood. There are many times that I was tempted to snipe at my \"friends\" instead of the Giant Centipede or whatever the monster of the moment was.The graphics are of course awesome. From the ocean waves to the murky dark caves, from the detail on the faces to the detail on the monsters' teeth, you get immersed in a high quality version of the movie. Again, this is to be expected, as the game designers got direct feeds of the movie graphic files.The sound is also well done, with the sounds and feel of the movie. You get an immersive experience, drawing around you what the movie is all about. Danger, gloom, crashing waves and thunderous primal screams.I have to admit that I found some of the puzzles a little tedious. Walking around and around a post to open a door was silly enough the first time, but for me to have to do it repeatedly was a bit much. Also, there were a few times that monsters seemed to get \"stuck\" in an area and I had to in essence go and prod them a few times for them to come out and properly attack me. I suppose not all monsters are highly intelligent :)The game is definitely one that targets adrenaline-rush types. The sounds are loud and pounding - from bellows to cries of panic to screeches. The video is always jumping between dark caves to dark stairs to fiery bushes and things swooping down at you. You're kept off balance and rarely get a moment to breathe.I did like how the game is set up like a movie. There aren't on screen health bars, ammo counters or anything else. You hit a button to hear a verbal check of your ammo. You talk to your friends to find out how they are. When you get hurt, your screen starts to go red and fuzzy, and you even hear \"angels sing\".If I'm going to have any complaint about this game, it's really a personal one - I like games with a balance between hyped-up tension and more calm puzzle/investigating. There was really no break here, it was just non-stop thundering noise and attacking monsters. I'm sure most people thrive on that :)Well recommended for those seeking a high action fix!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"C.

You get together with 4 other classic Mario characters, you get on a huge board, and you play a game, filled with Mini-Games. Who the hell is Waluigi anyway? It's kinda like Mariopoly, or a game of Monopoly, except with Mario. Now, the N64 titles were absurdly fun, and this one is too, but it's probably the worst in the series although it's not a bad game! Half of the mini-games are incredulously fun, while the other half are a waste of gaming time. The boards are a little bit more boring than previously, and the mini-games aren't as good as the earlier ones. The scheme this time is boring-you have to get back Mario's presents for his birthday. Overall, it's a tough decision. If you really love Mario or the Mario Party series, then buy this game now! If not, stay far, far away!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2003"}
{"product_name":"B000QW9D14","reviewerName":"Alessandro Viani","summary":"Better Than I Expected","reviewText":"Reading all these reviews, you'd think that the only monsters in the game are poo related, the only word spoken is \"bastard\", and that the game is a total cakewalk. This is not the case; well, mostly.Yes, there are certain enemies that are shaped like poo, and the characters make allusions to this fact, but they only make up a tiny fraction of the monsters in the game. After reading that the design was done by Akira Toriyama the creator of Dragonball, the poo stuff makes total sense. Having watched Dragonball, I can attest that Blue Dragon is basically a Dragonball game minus the tails. In Blue Dragon, you play as three children on the massive quest to save their village after it is attacked by a mechanical monster. Along the way, the normal RPG qualities proceed such as picking up new characters, and acquiring XP and SP to level up themselves and their dragons, (more on that soon.)Blue Dragon is a full turn based RPG in which you can see the turn order. There are also no random battles as you can see the enemies on screen. The children are able to use magic in the form of Shadows, which appear as shadows in the form of muscular blue dragons, which is assume is where the title came from. These Shadows are leveled up using SP, and in that progression acquire new skills. The Shadows also have the ability to change classes, which also changes the skills available. These classes can dramatically alter strategies used since you can change classes from a healer type to a mage type. And this is where I differ from the idea this game is too easy. Yes, this game is no Dark Souls , but in normal RPG fashion each boss has a weakness that must be exploited to win. Certain spells can be powered up, which is done by holding A when the meter appears. The longer you charge the more damage you'll do, but the longer it will take to cast. The meter displays how long it'll take in the form of turns. Thus you can choose to power up and cast after a certain character's turn, using that opportunity to use that character to power up your spell. This provides for a lot of strategy. However, if the wrong strategy is used, or the characters are the wrong class, be prepared to die. If You die, you must restart at a checkpoint, which are thankfully before right before the boss. I should also note that the Shadows do not come out of their butts as some reviewers have said, they are shadows at their feet.I highly recommend this game. Is it as hard as Dark/Demon's Souls? No. Is it the most mature game ever? Perhaps not, but I don't know about you but I play games to relax and have fun. Is Lost Odyssey better? They are different games with different strengths and weaknesses. Why not get both? Since both games have been out for awhile, they're dirt cheap. I hope anyone reading this will find this review helpful.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2012"}

Roman","summary":"Comfortable, but it still needs some changes.","reviewText":"Sony's stuck with their controller design since the mid-90s, and regardless of the criticism they've gotten for it, it's a design that works. The Dualshock is comfortable, light, and the buttons are all easily accessible. With this newest version, it's wireless, so no more cords in the way! The Dualshock 3 looks nearly identical to the previous two models, but with the obvious PlayStation button in the center, and the L2 and R2 triggers being more triggers than buttons now. But there are a few irks that I still have with the design that I doubt will be corrected, at least directly by Sony.Everyone knows how the controller is, so I don't really need to go into the pros. But I might as well just to seem like I'm not bashing the controller, even if it gets a good rating from me. Comfort, well-spaced buttons, pressure sensitivity even for the d-pad, and no lag (some wireless controllers have this still). The cons however, which seem to be only pointed out by me and a handful of people, keep this from being a perfect controller. First, I hate the d-pad. It sucks for most fighting games like BlazBlue and Street Fighter, like doing special move configurations. I still can't do Shoryuken motions without screwing up on a regular basis because the directional buttons are separate. How hard is it to connect the buttons together so you can get one smooth flowing motion? The Xbox S controller's d-pad was perfect, and playing Guilty Gear X2 #Reload was so effortless, you'd think Sony would've borrowed from that aspect of Microsoft's design. This is really the only genre, at least that I've played, that suffers from the d-pad, and it's good for every other kind of game. But my other complaint is that the analog sticks still feel too loose to me. Every other analog stick, from the Nintendo 64, Dreamcast, Xbox and even GameCube, feel perfect and tight, but Sony's tend to run on the loose side. Playing LittleBigPlanet, which uses the analog stick instead of the d-pad [like it should] was something that took the fun out of that game for me.There's one more con, but it has nothing to do with the controller itself. It's that no controller recharging cable is included. Yep, if you lost the one that came with your ps3, you're not getting an extra one here. Also, and this one's really minor and only for the super picky people, but someone's gotta mention it, the controls when watching a dvd and a Blu-Ray are different. I don't get why they did that, but if you watch a dvd and then go for a blu-ray, prepare to adjust to different settings for the buttons' quick actions without going to the menu.Some people complain that the Dualshock 3 needs to be recharged too quickly, 'only' lasting 4-5 hours before needing to recharge. I used to play games a lot, and now I'm down to -maybe- 2 hours per sitting, but 4-5 hours seems a bit long to me, so it needing to recharge after that much time seems reasonable. This is a good controller, and while third party companies have made versions with the d-pad design I like, the overall quality lacks compared to what Sony puts out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2010"}

Even with Battlefield 4 being out late last year, I still enjoy this game. The servers are still pretty good and has less bugs and problems than BF4 (and yes this is due to the fact BF3 is almost 3-4 years old while BF4 is fairly new).I bought the Premium edition of the game for 30 bucks at my local retailer and I do not regret it at all. All the map packs and some gun unlocks and etc. made the price worth it. Luckily for me, I already bought a &#34;pass&#34; for this game so I didn't have to worry about not being able to go online due to not having one. You will only face this problem if you buy a pre-owned game.Gameplay is a lot of fun and is very different to what I am used to playing. It is literally a Battlefield and the sounds + level manipulation really bring that aspect to life. I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants to try something new and maybe with some realism.

I have two words for you - deformable terrain!The game has amazing graphics, as you'd expect on a PS2, a decent soundtrack, and an involving storyline. You're in a mining colony on Mars. The colony has a mysterious plague wiping people out, and an underground movement is pointing out that the mining corporation isn't very ethical.So you get sucked into the revolution against the company, and are being helped out by the rebels. There's really cool glass-shattering effects, submarines to ride in, Ultor Corporation baddies to blow away, and the plague to figure out. Lots of weapons and levels to plow through.But what makes this game so much better than its HalfLife siblings is the TERRAIN. In say HalfLife or most other games of this ilk, you shoot a wall and it gets charred. You can leave bullet holes in things, or maybe shoot out the window. Red Faction brings this to an ENTIRELY new level by letting you MODIFY THE TERRAIN with your attacks.Yes, this means if someone has locked a door you want to get through, you blast out the wall next to the door and go through the hole you've made! Know that the room below you has something special in it? Blast a hole into the floor! Trying to negotiate across a room? Be careful, because your enemies could cave the floor in beneath you!It turns what was before a \"go through this maze in THIS order\" kind of game into a \"you have this huge 3D space, use your brain to figure out how best to reach your objectives.\" It's amazing how much this expands the game!There's a two player death match mode, and 20 levels of gameplay.

{"product_name":"B003O6E6NE","description":"","reviewerName":"HeavyMetalSushi","summary":"Simply Amazing!","reviewText":"Disclaimer:  This review does not contain any opinion for online gameplay, as I have not played any, but if & when I do, I will update my review.  This review is soley for the single player campaign.I remember having played the original Bioshock, and for it's time, it was a pretty awesome game...really redefined FPS games with it's innovative gameplay and and fusing of action and fantasy.  I completely missed Bioshock 2 altogether...been meaning to play it forever and still hadn't gotten around to it.  I will fix that blight in my gaming one of these days and finally pick it up.I was struggling over a debate in my head whether or not I should pick this game up on day one or not, but as fate would have it, I happened to have just over $42 in credit at a place, and after witnessing some amazing gameplay and screenshots online, as well as some amazing reviews, I decided I had nothing to lose and went & picked it up...and boy, and I can assure you friends that it was a worthwhile purchase!I have played through most of the campaign up until I decided to write this review (I believe I am nearing the end), and despite the 10-12 hours of gameplay it is listed at being (actually pretty standard for a shooter), I would have to say that it is probably the best 10-12 hours I have ever played in any shooter (approximately 9 hours in my case at the moment if my brain serves me right), that I can remember, aside from the glory days of gaming when shooters first came to be...such as Wolfenstein, Doom & Doom 2, Duke Nukem 3D, Quake 1 & 2, etc...games these days are amazing, but I don't think anything will ever replace the good ol days when my buddies and I use to hang out and battle it out on said classics.  But the glory days aside, I've played many a great shooter since then, but I think Infinite truly takes the cake in the shooter genre that I've played to date!The storyline is engaging and really makes you feel for the plight of the main characters, Booker and Elizabeth.  And never before have I seen such an amazing display of AI in a character as I have witnessed in Elizabeth...the way she and Booker interact during exploration and combat is some of the best I've seen in any game:  Elizabeth first of all doesn't come off as annoying such as getting in your way, whether during exploring or combat, and she knows how to hide herself during combat out of the line of fire so you don't have to be overencumbered with her protection.  The fact that she also find stuff for you while exploring, such as tossing you money she finds or pointing out items of interest such as lockpicks & supplies, and she is very helpful on the battlefield when you're in the middle of a big skirmish and are running low on health or salts or ammo, she is usually right there offering to aid you with salts, health, and ammo that she finds around the environment, and often right on time.  Truly some of the best NPC AI I have ever witnessed in a game.Graphically, the game is phenomenal...especially some of the landscapes and visuals around the beginning of the game when you first arrive in New Columbia.  The environment is self and much of the costumes and weapons and surroundings has a bit of a Steampunk feel...earlier 1900s, but with a few shall we say advancements from what you would expect to see back then, and obviously the use of such things as vigors & whatnot.  Looking around and over the edges of some areas around the city in the clouds is just awesome.  I think the one sight I saw that most took my breath away was the big angel off in the distance and the sunshine just poking through & around it from behind...truly awesome!  Definitely one of the best games visually at the current time.Gameplay is engaging and enjoyable, and sometimes keeps you on your toes.  The AI in many of the enemies is very smart, and they will flank you and try to outmeneuver you, so stay on your guard in big skirmishes.  There are some enemies throughout the game too that are a pretty big pain in the @$$ too, such as the handyman enemies.  Won't go into too much detail about it all, as you should experience for yourself, but yeah...s*** gets pretty real sometimes during combat.  Fortunately for the more casual gamers, there is easy mode, though areas of that will get pretty tough too no doubt.  Weapons and weapon & vigor improving is a fairly standard setup...find money and pay to upgrade your stuff.  I remember in the original Bioshock only being able to carry up to 2 \"vigors\" at a time, as they're calling them in Infinite, and you'd have to go back to machines to swap vigors in and out, but in Infinite they've changed all that and you can carry and switch between all the vigors you acquire as you go along, so that is a nice improvement.  (Again, I have not played 2, so I have no idea how they had that set up in that game, but I aim to finally find out eventually).  Many of the vigors are very neat too and have their own unique purposes.  I'd say I probably used Devil's Kiss the most, but they are all pretty unique and fun to use in various circumstances.  The real trick too is alternating vigors and shooting for some neat and efficient killing.  The Sky-Line edition is very cool too, and using your Sky-Hook to coast around on those is pretty fun, and it is always fun to take out enemies with Sky-Line kills when you are dismounting from one of them.The only ever so small, minescule little gripe I have is that there were a couple of areas in which there was a bit of a glitch and something you were attempting to do did not function at all, and on both occasions it cost me!  However, they were small little glitches that would usually fix by the time I attempted it again, so not a big deal.  It's still one of the most smooth flowing games I've played on current gen systems to date!  Frame rate is overall very good and I really had hardly any issues with it, even with controlls...it's all very free flowing and smooth.My fellow gamers, if you are into shooters at all in the slightest, I would highly recommend not overlooking this masterpiece!  Most assuredly in the running for game of the year for 2013.  The fact that the PS3 version came with the original Bioshock as well is a very nice added bonus, so if you have a PS3, you get that for free.  Even if you are going to play it on 360 or PC or whatever, don't let it disuade you that yours won't come with Bioshock...the game more than pays for itself in inovation, fantastic gameplay, stellar AI, and beautiful graphics!  You won't be disappointed, I assure you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}

Driven by pure revenge, nothing can stop Kratos from achieving absolution.","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Near Flawless","reviewText":"Do you remember that thrill when you played Devil May Cry for the first time?  That experience that was familiar in some aspects but so different in a completely bad ass way?  The opening moments of God of War exceed that thrill.  In fact it brings to mind what comedian Dane Cook would call a BAMF.  I'll let you do the math.The opening moments are filled with creatures both small and large that you can effortlessly kill, the game subtly teaching you the mechanics.  But all of that is just setup for a truly epic first boss fight against the Hydra that not only kicks the game into high gear, but also is better than practically any \"end boss\" fights of most games.  With context sensitive button pushes, the game incorporates a cinematic experience into your fighting.  By pushing buttons at the right time, you are dodging, climbing and killing each Hydra head thrown at you.  It is intense and immensely satisfying.  Never before have I felt this immersion in a video game.  Instead of watching a cutscene of Kratos finishing a Hydra, YOU are doing it.  You are swinging off its nose, jamming your blades into its eyes.  It is awesome.Graphically, the game excels.  I have been constantly surprised recently with the graphic quality of PS2 games.  God of War is almost seamless.  The game moves from gameplay, to cutscene, to gameplay, level to level without a load screen.  In fact, with the exception of the initial load, I don't remember ever seeing a load screen.  It is beautiful to watch, gruesome to play and just fantastic.Sound-wise, the game also is gold.  It has a fully orchestrated soundtrack that fits perfectly with the Greek time period.  In fact, the soundtrack is available for a free download if you buy the game and its definitely worth it to those who like this kind of music.  The voice work is well done and the lip synching for once matches perfectly.For all of the graphic prowess, there are some problems.  The biggest of which is a kind of scanning problem.  When the camera moves, sometimes the areas get...squiggly?...I don't how to explain it, but there's lines moving through the game because it can't handle it.  There's also a little bit of slowdown when battles get hectic.  Neither of these are major problems but it does detract from what really are wonderful graphics.The camera also generally shows the best angle for the action.  You can't control the camera, it's preset like Devil May Cry.  There are a couple instances, however, where you can get sandwiched between two or more huge brutes and you can't see yourself because of the camera.  It can be incredibly annoying when it happens but it is so rare that it isn't much of a complaint.Finally, the game isn't too long.  It's a 10-15 hour game depending on how well you play and what difficulty setting you choose.  They actually had to cut the game down to get it done on time.  You can check out the levels and monsters that were cut after finishing the game.  Along with the shortness, there aren't many bosses.  In fact, there's only three.  But man, when they throw a boss at you, they really throw a boss at you.Note of warning:  This game is definitely rated M.  The violence and gore is in your face as there are decapitations, breaking necks, wings ripped off, people cut in half, violence against women, etc.  And there's nudity and sexual situations.  Copious breast shots follow suit.I can't recommend this game enough.  If you are a fan of action games, this game redefines the stylish action Devil May Cry heralded back in the day.  Playing as Kratos gives you the same bad ass feeling Dante did, only God of War ramps this up to the extremes.  Play this game, you'll be glad you did.UPDATE:  I don't know if there's anyone out there who hasn't played this game yet, but if you haven't, why not?  At 19.99, this game is a complete steal!

{"product_name":"B0038MUCPK","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"A pretty solid platformer with some setbacks.","reviewText":"Yeah yeah, we all know how people review games based on movies. They start out with how the track record for them isn't very good, then tell you that the product in question is either just another waste of money, or something surprisingly good. Usually it's the former. Toy Story 3 here isn't one of those games, and the reviews have mostly been in its favor since it came out. It surprised me, and what surprised me even more was when I played it for the first time, and seeing how solid it is. But playing through the game, I noticed a few things that keep this from being up there with the likes of the SpongeBob Squarepants Movie game, Ghostbusters and several others. But even then, this is something that younger kids and adults can enjoy, and definitely a fun game for families to play together and help eachother out with.Chances are, if you're interested in the game, you've seen Toy Story 3, or at least know the plot summary. Woody and the others are worried about what's going to happen to them now that Andy's moving out and going to college, and they don't want to end up in the trash, but still don't want to be stuck in the attic for who knows how long. They end up being donated to a day care where things aren't as nice as they seem at first, and the whole thing turns into yet another prison escape kinda deal. The game is a platformer, meaning you'll be doing tons of running, jumping and collecting things. Most of the time you'll be able to play as Woody, Buzz and Jessie, each with their own unique ability to help you progress to the next level. Woody can use his pull-string to swing around, Jessie can do...some weird spin jump that lets her reach certain areas, and Buzz can do a cool tackle move and fly around in some levels and shoot his laser. Some levels will let you ride around on Bullseye, others have a kind of roller coaster design as you slide around on rails to get key items, and then there's the Toy Box mode, which almost counts as a second game. It's a separate area from the main game that you can select on the menu, and here you can customize a toy town, go on tons of little quests for other toys, earn new characters to populate it with, and unlock numerous trophies. It's very well made, and I spent way more time here than I did with the story mode.All in all, the story mode is pretty good. It tells the story of the movie with a couple of big parts taken out, or characters removed probably due to copyrights (the cymbal monkey is nowhere to be found in ANY TS3 merchandise, and the game continues this trend). A lot of the levels are based on things in the movie, like the first level being from the imagination/pretend opening in the movie with Woody trying to stop Dr. Porkchop. They're fairly simple to navigate through, but the camera is what'll screw you over more often than not, usually when you have to time a jump just right to a moving platform. It got so bad in one level to the point where I had to just stop playing for a while, cool down, then return a few hours later and try another 30 times before I made the jump. This doesn't happen -too- frequently, but when it does, it ruins the flow of the game. The camera will be positioned a little too high or low, and since you can't move it around with the shoulder buttons of right analog stick, there's no fixing it. The other problem I have with the game is that a couple of levels drag on for way too long. The roller coaster rail one where you play as Woody comes to mind immediately, and I slunked in my chair when I found out I had to collect more batteries to finish the level. Luckily everything in the Toy Box mode is problem-free, and like I said, I enjoyed this part of the game a lot more than the story mode. Time flew by when I first started my town there, and kids will have a lot of fun with this portion if they get sick of the couple of long levels in story mode.The graphics are as good as you can get for a game like this, and everything fits the Toy Story style perfectly. I rarely noticed any slowdown, even in some of the faster paced levels like those where you fly around as Buzz. The voice actors all did an excellent job with their characters too, and the music is recognizable from the get-go. No generic background filler here.I know I might sound like I'm contradicting myself by saying that the story mode is pretty good, but has big problems. But compared to a couple of other movie-based games I've played in the last year, I won't let those ruin things for me. As you can see, I'm giving this game 4 stars for fun, with the Toy Box mode being the main thing that kept me coming back for more. But that awful camera at the worst times takes off a star from the overall score, as does the overly long levels. If I could, I'd give Toy Story 3 a 3.5/5 instead of just a 3. It's definitely worth the money, especially with the recent price drop, and a good platformer for all ages, but it could've used a little more polish. At the very least, rent or borrow this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2011"}

Upon receiving it, I must say that it was very well packaged. No need to worry about any thing being broken while in transit. The guitar itself is very well made and feels almost like the real thing. It works very well with all Guitar Hero games and is also compatible with the Rock Band ones as well.Here are the cons though. My 13 year old loves the GH and Rock Band series but finds this very heavy, so it's not that perfect for the younger ones who love to play. The fret buttons are the same size as the GH buttons but are spaced more apart so it's more difficult for those with smaller fingers to play. The placement of the star power button is not where you'd expect it to be but if you usually tilt your guitar for star power then that shouldn't be a problem.Besides the cons above, I'd say this is a great guitar for adults. For the kids I'd stick with the plastic models that come with the game series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}
{"product_name":"B0045U4U52","reviewerName":"Chaz Ashley","summary":"Unngh","reviewText":"I was looking forward to this game, I really was but honestly it fell so short so hard that it hurts.The gameplay is pretty dang good, it pulls off shooting really well with the limited (1 analog stick) controls of the PSP, and the combat can be really fun. You can upgrade guns and acquire different gear which adds to the fun of combat.The unique gameplay mechanic is that you can jump from person to person controlling them. So if you're about to die, quantum leap to your buddy and you're still okay. Or if you need to get behind a weakspot or something.The issues:The story has nothing to do with Parasite eve and honestly poor regardless of ties to the series. The ending (no spoilers) ruins things even further especially when you consider the main character and the unlockable shower cutscenes that sorta paint a bad picture (when you tie the ending and it's meaning to this).The story as a whole comes off as a Sci-fi Channel movie, or basically: Poorly written to the point it's funny.Enemies are anonymous blobs with no character to them, they honestly come off like bullseye targets with how some of them are designed. And the other issue is; they have nothing to do with the Parasite Eve lore.The voice acting is a mixed bag with characters saying things that are useful and obvious and repetitive. Aya being the worst one by far, to me it just felt like another strong female lead being written as a weak scared little girl (much how Samus in Other M was written).I have no idea why they called this Parasite Eve when there's no ties to the original beyond a few call backs, if they called this Monster Shooter it'd probably have been better off and not gotten glares from PE fans and also might have had a better chance at a better story. But it's not even poor because it's lacking ties to previous games, it's just overall not good and lacks a quality story, good voice acting and a strong/likable role from the main character Aya.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2012"}

It is not a clone, but definitely draws from the original idea.First, the biggest WOW factor\" for me is the cross-play/cross-buy between the Vita and PS3 version. This is an idea that is fantastic. Not only is the value of the purchase significant, but the whole idea is something I've been waiting for awhile now.The character roster is doable. It is not going to satisfy everyone. You will always have those \"where is this character?\" and \"why didn't they include this character?\" people, but the amount of playable characters is sufficient for a first go-around. The characters feel like you took them directly out of their original games and put them into the battle arena. What I mean is that they characters actually feel like they do in their own games, which is something I can't say for Super Smash Bros.The story mode is lazy with really no substance. It's the biggest detractor. They had a huge opportunity to blow any Super Smash comparisons out of the water with a superb single player story, but entered the same pitfall and ended up actually considerably worse than its prime competitor.The unlockables are great, but still not as solid as Super Smash. I had spent many hours with SSB Brawl that had more meaningful and varied unlockables. The games biggest gameplay difference is the Special Gauge. Once this meter fills up, you perform your special which is the only way to get kills. This style will grow on you, but it makes character selection more heavy on their specials than the normal combat moves. The game seems to focus on online play, which is definitely fine by me. It's fun and connection is pretty seamless.Overall, I'd definitely recommend it. (At it's current price of $40, it is a must buy)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2013"}

It is loaded with a bounty of sports and mini-games that increase the replay value.Most activities are simple enough to learn that players of all ages can jump in and play. This makes it similar toKinect Adventures, which is included with the Kinect Sensor or the newXbox 360 Console. However, Kinect Sports game provides much more depth than Kinect Adventures. Our family of four plays Kinect Sports together for an hour or two before we need a rest.Families with young children (ages 6-12) will probably get the most enjoyment out ofKinect Sports. If you have teenagers in your home, I recommend Dance Central instead since older kids will no doubt recognize the songs and dance moves. I also recommendSonic Free Ridersfor gamers looking for a workout that resembles big wave surfing.Our ratings for the individual games:Beach Volleyball -- No surprise the most sweat-inducing game in Kinect Sports is also the most fun to play. Gameplay is two vs. two to seven points. There are two related mini-games, Bump Bash (dodgeball) and Body Ball, where the computer calls out a body part (head, foot or hand) and you need to hit the volleyball with the corresponding body part. Kids will enjoy these mini-games while their parents rest on the sofa after a beach volleyball match.  Rating: A+Soccer -- This shortened version of the game manages to cut out a lot of the running while still allowing the player to run the offense and defense. Like beach volleyball, this activity takes time to master and gets more fun the better you get. There are two mini-games, Super Saver (you are the goalie and you need to save 20 goals) and Target Kick (you must get your shots past a goalie to hit the targets). Both mini-games are simple to play and fun for kids.  Rating: ATable Tennis -- This game requires a lot of lateral movement, too. Surprisingly, this is my youngest son's favorite game. He was all grins when he successfully completed his first smash and, then, his first ace. The graphics and sound effects do a great job of pulling you into the game. There are two mini-games, Paddle Panic and Rally Tally, for this activity. Paddle Panic serves up a steady stream of balls for you to volley. The goal of Rally Tally is to maintain a rally, simple enough.  Rating: ATrack & Field -- The javelin and discus events are frustrating until you figure out proper form. However, be ready to \"get your knees up...up...up!\" for the long jump, hurdles and sprint events.  Rating: B-Bowling -- Older players who don't have the knees for the long jump and hurdles will appreciate the controller-less play. This game makes a nice break between track and field sprints. There are two related mini-games, One Bowl Roll and Pin Rush. The first mini-game is target-based as you knock down spares. The second game is a fun workout. Pin Rush is a timed game where you can use two balls to knock down as many pins as possible. Once players get the rhythm, their arms will be swinging in large windmills. Breaking a sweat is a certainty.  Rating: CBoxing -- This is the least entertaining sports event in the package. The winning formula involves making over-exaggerated punches and timing for a power shot. Players looking for a realistic boxing experience should look elsewhere. Kids will no doubt flail with both arms swinging windmills. There are no related mini-games to dress up this activity.

There are only a few kinds of people who are likely to even think about buying this game.  The first are people who want everything from the Final Fantasy series, and no matter how bad I tell you this is, it won't stop you.  The second are people who remember the games from the 8-bit consoles (well, one of them anyway) and want to relive that, and they'll be buying this regardless of what I say.  The last are people who, for some strange reason, like getting angry at people who disagree with them, and they won't buy this game, also regardless of what I say.  Then again, I've always had an enthusiasm for pointless pursuits...By any standard you can think of, these games are not going to compare favorably against a whole lot from the Playstation.  If you can only buy one game for your Playstation for the rest of your life, this one shouldn't be it.  That doesn't mean it's bad--it's just the fact that it's only two 8-bit games.Here's the bad:1) The graphics are terrible.  While the FMV sequences are good, there aren't nearly enough of them to make this worth buying to look at.2) I've seen pornographic movies with more (and more intelligent) dialogue.  These games just aren't the story-driven romps that you'd be used to if you started from FF7.3) Each game suffers from some gameplay problems, which I'll discuss below.The good:There isn't any.  They're 8-bit games, for crying out loud.  You buy them and play them because you want to complete the series, and they're good for that, but there are better games you COULD be playing.Truth be told, I liked these games okay.  The only thing that got me were the gameplay deficiencies.  Final Fantasy is hideously easy on the basic difficulty, and it's disgustingly hard on the hard difficulty, and there's no middle ground.  Final Fantasy 2 is worse--without a doubt, that advancement system must be the absolute worst I have ever seen in the history of video games.  There is absolutely no way for you to play the game competitively without \"cheating\" (exploiting a painfully easy-to-correct deficiency in the experience award system).  It took me perhaps twenty five hours to complete that game, and at least half of that consisted of 'Magic Spell->Target->Cancel.'  Fewer levels and a more intelligent advancement system would have saved it, but alas, those were not meant to be.Final Fantasy 2 is still a decent game, though.  I suppose I'm a little hard on it because I can see where adding dialogue would have made it better.  There are some themes involved here that Square has totally left behind in their more recent titles (namely the pointless loss involved in war) which I wish had been explored better.  Final Fantasy is still as you remember it--hard on normal, and far too simple on easy, but the same game dynamic, and still a solid title if you don't want a big story getting in the way of your game.Come on, people--these are great 8-bit games, but they're still 8-bit games.  That's going to limit their ratings.  Four stars is the best they could possibly have done, and the fact that I'm awarding them that should tell you what I think of them.  If you remember the days of 8-bit gaming fondly, you won't be disappointed.  If you're looking for Final Fantasy 7 with terrible (well, even worse) graphics, you probably will be.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2003"}

Sort of. Best of all, you get into the free beta of Halo 3!It's funny how many people are instantly buying this game just to get into the Halo 3 beta. We of course are thrilled about the Halo 3 part - we are avid fans of the Halo series - but Crackdown actually isn't bad on its own merits.First, you have to accept that it's cel shaded. The graphics are a little cartooney. They did this on purpose, and if you don't like being immersed in a dirty, swear-filled comic book, you might not take to this game. However, those who enjoy anime, manga and an alternate view of reality will appreciate the more-than-human powers you have here.You're an enhanced human in a future where three criminal gangs have taken over the world. You get the traditional types of enemies - a wisened old Chinese guy, a Hispanic drug lord and a Soviet mob boss. You get a variety of cars to jump into, a variety of weapons to shoot, and a fairly large world to roam around in.There are tunnels below the ground, places to jump across roofs, places that you can leap cars across, and much more. As you do things, you gain experience and better skills, meaning you can now shoot better or jump higher. This gives you incentive to build up your talents to get to those just out of reach areas.The game is pretty lenient - if you hide out for a while, your armor regenerates as does your health. When you die, they just give you another clone of yourself to keep playing with. You activate teleport spots around the world so you can get to places quickly.The soundtrack is reasonably good - there's a lot of variety here to choose from. The in-game sounds of local Hispanics chatting at you in Spanish, or the high pitched screams of scared civilians, all seem to fit in resaonably well with your cartoon environment.Graphics are, as mentioned, cel shaded. I enjoy cel shading and found it an interesting take on the GTA world. The HUD is esay to understand - it's clear what part of the body you're targeting and what is near you on the map. You get a mix of Kingdom Hearts orb-collecting with Vice City night clubs, Scarface swearing, and a bit of do-gooding in there, too. Assuming of course that you actually go after the bad guys rather than driving over the civilians.So where does that leave you? You're not getting top-drama and acting as in The Godfather. The cel shading might annoy some people. But really, for a fun jumping, shooting, roaming-the-world game, this is really quite fun.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2007"}

The enemy AI is hilariously bad--you can stand a certain distance away and lob fireballs or arrows at monsters as they (sometimes) stand there and take it until they die.Much of everything in the game is blurry (to mask the low resolution??) and the characters look like little action figures who're voiced by I guess you could call them \"voice actors.\" Voice sound files often are clipped, and sometimes a character may whisper for a bit, and when you turn up the volume to find out some plot point THEY YELL LIKE AN ANGRY DRUNK. Speaking of the voice acting, the main character sounds like Clint Eastwood if Clint was a just-released from incarceration sex offender. \"Heh-heh, gooooood,\" he growls, as he loots loose change from corpses in a blurry dungeon. Ugh.Initially, I was getting killed left and right by single skeletons, so I wandered the brush for awhile and hunted with my trusty bow: baboons, rhinos and ostriches, all coordinating attacks on me at once?? I didn't know ostriches hung out with wart hogs and cheetahs, but whatever. C'mon now, Reality Pump, this is a fantasy world. Come up with some fanciful unicorns, hellhounds, griffins or other weird stuff.Despite all of this, I got past the first few hours of disgust at the cruddy controls and lackluster visuals, and finally started enjoying the game as a decent diversion (until I eventually pay up and play some Skyrim DLC, or the Dragon's Dogma expansion pack). For 20 bucks, there's many hours of passable gameplay here in Two Worlds II. Actually, it's down to 10 bucks now--I can't wait to trade this in to Amazon and get 40 cents of credit for South Park: Stick of Truth!I'm eight hours in, and I'm particularly enjoying the music, as it's pretty well done, which is surprising considering the half-arsed way this game was ported to PS3. The crafting's kind of fun, and there are quite a few skills and spells to learn and upgrade, so you have a variety of ways to dispatch wolf-men and the like. I guess I'm going through a dry spell currently, because there's nothing new I want to play, and this game has somehow lured me into a comforting nightly ritual of janky fight scenes, bizarre and inappropriate voice acting, glitchy enemy AI, blurry scenery, and lame frame rates.

I played it way after it came out. I like the Assassin's guild and the fact that you can have your trained assassins assist you when you're being poked at by guards, or you can simply have them take out a target for you. The story i think is very interesting. I went from owning Assassin's Creed on XBOX simply because the trailer seemed cool to now actually seeing that there was more to the game than the kills or constant climbing--there is a story behind it all and also unfolding as you go along in 'present' day.Was fun.

In Rome total war, the quick battles, amazing campaigns, and customized battle scenarios gave me months of playtime, literally. When I opened up Medeival total war some of its aspects met par, but many were a huge disappointment. Medeival total war 2 takes place in the time period of just before the 1st crusade to the early colonial era. There are many factions in the game, but all of them pretty much fall into groupings (Italian city state, muslim, nomadic, eastern european, western european, northern european). To start off on a good note, I began the campaign and I absolutely loved it. note I am one to simulate all of my battles. The map is much more vast than before, with more detail and more agents. The option between cities and castles is a nice addition to the game, and the ability to recruit more soldiers at once adds much more fun. Also, the economics have been fixed from rome total war and are now accurate (big cities don't operate in the red). The inquisitors of the catholic church are annoying but the crusades are fun. Overall, the campaign sets the stage for a masterpeice of a game that comes crashing down when I reach the quick and custom battles. Continuing the fix of the rome total war's monotonous quick battles, the quick battles have much diversity. The maps available are great however I would have prefered more bridge scenarios. You can customize your forces as much as before which meets expectations. However, when you get to the actual battle you are left scratching your head. First of all, the AI from rome total war has gone from just plain stupid to mentally retarded in this game. The AI pathfinding is horrible, and worst of all the enemy will always send forth its missile troops to engage and have their main force just sit there until their missile troops are out of amo or slaughtered. Battles are stupid, senseless, monotonous, and tedious with this kind of AI. When you play in siege mode, the AI is even dumber. They don't use their siege equipment correctly and once again believe that their catapults and cannons should destroy every single wall of your city rather its gates, towers, and units. The enemy will have oppurtunities to enter my city and will sit there, and they will walk back and forth like idiots. I am appalled and the rushed and pathetic effort made towards the battles in this game. Even the new combat animations are not much relief. This game makes me sad because it had all the potential, but was rushed onto the market.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2007"}

{"product_name":"B003O6HDHA","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"An Electrifying Return to Form","reviewText":"It takes a lot for a game to be electrifying, and it certainly takes a lot for me to use that word in the title of a review. For something to be electrifying, it must consistently entertain and thrill, keeping whoever happens to be experiencing it in a constant state of enthrallment. Last year, if you were to tell me that the newest entry in my favorite horror franchise, \"Silent Hill\", would drive me to use that word, I would've laughed. This much-maligned entry in the franchise looked like it was heading for trainwreck status, considering that it was in the hands of a developer who had only made one middle-of-the-road XBLA title from Russia. That, and the fact that Konami has been almost intentionally killing the franchise for the past two or three years (see: the buggy mess of that is \"Silent Hill HD Collection\", or the PS Vita arcade shooter \"Silent Hill: Book of Memories\"). While I certainly enjoyed the last two entries, \"Homecoming\" and \"Shattered Memories\", nothing could keep me from being pessimistic about Vatra's take on the SH legacy. So imagine my surprise when I discovered it to be the best entry since \"Silent Hill 3\", which is personally my favorite game in the series. Yeah, it's that good.\"Downpour\" puts players in the jumpsuit of escaped convict Murphy Pendleton, who achieved his \"escaped\" status via a very convenient prison bus accident that left him stranded in the middle of a rainy forest. Convenient may not be the best word to describe his plight, however, because that very forest happens to border the abandoned mining town of Silent Hill. No sooner does he arrive into town than he is thrown headfirst into a world where women cry for help in the unreachable distance, troubled souls kill themselves before his very eyes, and grotesque monsters pop out when he least expects them to. Add in a haunting alternate dimension that threatens to consume him, which comes and goes as it pleases, and you've got yourself a convict who wishes he were still safe behind bars. But because he's not, it's the player's job to guide him to safety.Murphy, however, is more than just a simple character that you guide from point A to point B. Just like the protagonists in most other SH games, \"Origins\" being the bloody miserable exception, this convict has a past behind him that bleeds out in the town as you steadily progress. Vatra has done a fantastic job keeping up the time-honored tradition of making Silent Hill a broken representation of the protagonist's innermost psyche, with every bit of the town very related to Pendleton's past. With every optional side mission, every NPC encounter, every scrap of paper found in the town, we're given more and more hints about what kind of person the character is. He's a thoroughly intriguing protagonist with numerous issues, right up there with franchise greats like James Sunderland and Alex Shepard. Hats must go off to the writers for this wonderful addition to the pantheon of great SH characters.But just as many hats must fly forth from our heads to development team for making the best version of the titular town since the series' legendary second entry. There is simply so much ground to cover in the town that an average player isn't going to find all of it's twisted beauty in one playthrough. Various side stories expand upon not only Murphy's past, but the past of the locale itself. No developer has put forth so much effort into incorporating every bit of the series' mythos before, and that effort shows. It's enough to make one want to go back and play past entries, newly equipped with knowledge previously shrouded in mystery. The writers and developers both have made the old place feel alive again, spring-loaded with intrigue and scares waiting to pop out a moment's notice.Scares is what this game does best, though. \"Origins\" was a pitiful little whimper, \"Homecoming\" favored combat against unsettling situations, and \"Shattered Memories\" simply tried to make the player panic by stripping them of weapons and putting them into eerie motion control segments. Vatra instead takes a route that's not unlike the mentality of last year's \"Amnesia: The Dark Descent\". Enemies come when you least want them to, when you least expect them to, and when you're least able to survive an encounter with them. Many moments will have you frantically scrambling to bust down a boarded door as a foreboding beast attempts to rip you limb from limb, or rushing down an ever-expanding hallway as a vortex behind you attempts to suck you into an unknown abyss. The Other World is more chilling than ever before, constantly shifting and gradually turning into Rube Goldberg-esque death trap ready to spring at your first failing. Personally, a \"Silent Hill\" game has never scared me this much, and I might go so far as to say that a game has never scared me this much since the criminally underrated \"Rule of Rose.\" Horror games don't faze me easily, due to the fact that I've simply played so many of them, but \"Downpour\" is a chilling reminder of how nightmarish video games can be. The addition of a rear view camera aids the atmosphere, as seeing what's chasing you down is often more scary than actually fighting them. It's a deeply unsettling experience, much moreso than \"Amnesia\", \"Dead Space\", or \"FEAR\", and an average player can expect to be just a little more paranoid in the dark for a while.Equally as unnerving is the great score by series newcomer Daniel Licht, who has the Showtime television program \"Dexter\" to his credit. As much of a fan as I have been of Akira Yamaoka's scores, I must be candid in my opinion that I don't miss his music one bit in the series. Licht has a perfect sense of what made the previous scores so haunting and desperate, and implements much of the acoustic noodling and deep synths found in other SH entries. But what makes it so good is not that he emulates Yamaoka, but adds his own flavor to the music. If one has ever listened to his scores, then many of his signature quirks and tempos will be immediately noticeable in this fantastic soundtrack, and they lend themselves well to the overall atmosphere of the game. Some of the more radical series diehards may be up in arms about the talented new composer, but they'll simply have to face the music when I say that the series has found it's new regular musician.But much like Murphy's escape, not everything about this experience is joyous. My biggest complaint about \"Downpour\" is that, despite the excellent ideas at work in the environments, some areas of the graphics come across as dull and flat. The most distinguished of graphical flaws come in the form of character models with textures that often look pastel in their plainness, and they stand in stark contrast to the detailed environments. Although upon closer inspection, some of the outdoor environments are lacking in texture and have some glaring jagged edges. These are not bad graphics by any means, and by no means are they a game changer as to whether or not you should buy this game (graphics never should be, anyway), but it is unfortunate that this game is underfunded in the visual department. However, this isn't Vatra's fault as much as it is Konami's for not having enough faith in one of it's most loved franchises. That, lamentably, seems to be par for the course as of late with the bumbling company, and the fact that they're not pouring enough money into important games such as this shows their priorities lie elsewhere. Where that is, I'm not quite sure, but that's enough on that. This is a review, not a criticism on how truly dreadful the former game giant's practices are nowadays.Another source of contention for me is how cumbersome the combat controls can be when faced with multiple enemies. Getting Murphy to hit who you want or where you want can be more troublesome than it really should be, and often you'll flail blindly while enemies are picking you piece from piece. I've only run into this issue a few times, but those times were truly irritating, and made me wish Vatra had taken a few more cues from Double Helix's excellent combat system used in \"Homecoming.\" While on the topic, weapons breaking in mid-combat loses the atmosphere it lends when the game crams enemies down your throat in certain portions, and often leaves you cursing the developer's indecision as to whether they should have a fully-functional combat system or a bare-minimum survival horror combat system, stopping somewhere dead in the middle. It gives a sense of tension to most of the game, but sometimes it's enough to make a player shout in frustration.One more minor gripe should be directed at the post-production aspects of the game. The game's loading and saving mechanics freeze the game temporarily at times, which makes one fear that the game itself has frozen. Some textures take way too long to pop up, and certain actions (the opening of some doors, encounters with enemies in specific locales) produce a slight but still noticeable lag. The overall product is pretty, to be sure, but could've used a bit more smoothing out before going gold. For the last time, though, I must stress that none of these issues are deal breakers, considering that the overall game is one of the best of the year so far. In fact, it's one of the best horror games I've ever had the joy and terror of experiencing, with it's regular defying of expectations and willingness to scare you into submission. The designers knew how to approach the material they were given, and the result is gorgeously disgusting. And I mean that as a compliment.\"Silent Hill: Downpour\" is a triumph against all odds. Everything was stacked against this game, and in spite of a few meandering nags, it's a very good time with an excellent story and solid visuals. Konami, in the face of so many mistakes, has found a keeper of a studio in Vatra, and hopefully a new regular for the series. With superb writing and an atmosphere that's easy to get immersed in, \"Downpour\" is an game that will stick with you for a long time after a playthrough. It's memorable, terrifying and, most importantly, a darn fine game. In the end, all I can say is, \"Welcome back, Silent Hill. Welcome back.\"Story: A+Gameplay: B+Graphics: B+Sound: A-Voice Acting: B+Overall: A- (9.0)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2012"}

WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun.

Published by the same company (Rockstar - but developed by now out-of-business developer VIS) the game successfully cashed-in on Grand Theft Auto's success.  Featuring similar ultra-violent, mission based gameplay, State of Emergency actually plays nothing like GTA.The game takes place during massive riots, (the game's claim to fame being the more than one hundred characters on screen at once), and you play as one of a number of characters rebelling against The Corporation.  There are three levels each featuring about fifty missions to complete amidst the chaos.  Trouble is, the missions are all mindless and repetitive, and are virtually all just a slight variation on a basic formula: you'll either be sent to kill a target, sent to protect a target and/or escort him or her somewhere else, or you'll be sent to destroy a building, car, or area.  The missions are fun for a short while, but once you realize you're just performing the same task over and over again, it quickly grows tired.Some of the minigames are fun, however, and rather than being mission based, they are generally based on time and points - you'll kill people or destroy property while collecting extra time from downed enemies while racing against the clock, and you'll keep coming back for more trying to beat your best score.The gameplay, however, is still simple and boring; just a 3-D beat-em-up, with a few attack buttons and a handful of weapons to wield (though the ability to pick up some smaller objects floating around each level, like benches, is a welcome feature).  And yes, it is an ultraviolent game, despite the cartoonish visuals.  Blood sprays realistically as you fire in to crowds, taking down innocent civilians; pink blobs (guts) pop out when people are shot, limbs and heads come off (you can wield them as weapons, in fact)...  it's all mindless and gimmicky.Sure, it's really cheap these days, and if you're really interetsed I'd say go for it, but it really isn't even worth a rental.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2005"}

I was initially going to give the game 3 stars because of a gameplay bug that I felt made the entire BF3 experience broken. Then to my surprise, they released an update today that fixed (or at least diminished) the problem significantly. The issue was input lag. To see an example of the problem, watch this video [...]. The movements and aiming didn't feel percise with the slight delay, but they patched it, so it's not bad anymore. It could be fixed before the patch if you turned the resolution down to 480p, but then the graphics were awful! Overall, this game is great and it just keeps getting better! But it isn't as good as MW3 in 2 ways. 1) The campaign in MW3 is better. 2) The co-op in MW3 is better (especially survival mode!). But as for multiplayer, BF3 takes home the gold hands down! And since that's what most people only care about. The clear choice between the two is BF3.Also to all you \"noobs\" on BF3. There is a steep learning curve with BF3 multiplayer.

The original three on the Playstation were good, and the ones that would follow were always decent. I went back to play this classic and discovered it was just as great as I remembered. Still, it does have its low points.Graphics- 8/10On the original Playstation, these graphics were fairly good. The characters look blocky at points, but it sort of adds to the appeal. Voice syncing is pretty well done. Levels and characters are interestingly designed. The fact that most levels have another level that looks similar doesn't really bother me. They change the levels up enough to where it feels like you are playing a different level.Story- 3/10This is the part of the game that is a huge letdown. Neo Cortex, our antagonist, starts the game off exactly like he was left on the second game...falling from the sky. After failing to stop Crash Bandicoot from capturing all of the powerful Crystals, he plummets from his exploding spaceship and falls into a mountain. Inside of the mountain just so happens to be Uka Uka, a powerful witch mask that appears to have been giving Cortex orders all along. Uka Uka was trapped in the mountain by Aku Aku to keep the world safe. Now Uka Uka has escaped with Cortex. Uka Uka quickly recruits Dr. N. Trophy to build him a time machine so he can find the Crystals before Crash Bandicoot was even around.This honestly doesn't sound too bad. Until you see Crash and his friends at home. Aku Aku hears Uka Uka's evil laugh and senses danger. Then you suddenly appear at the time machine that Cortex is using and now you are using it. What happened to Cortex? I have no idea. How did you find your way there? Who knows? From there you use the time machine to get to the Crystals before Cortex.Sound- 8/10I love the music in this game. Every level type has different music, and it works for every level. If you are in an underwater level, you will hear mysterious sounding music. They just did the music very well. The voice acting is top notch as well. Sound effects are the same old Crash Bandicoot sounds though. It's not the best video game sound, but it's still really good.Gameplay- 9/10Gameplay can make or break a game. Luckily the Gameplay made this game. They added more variety than any of the previous games in the series.Crash Bandicoot is basically a side-scroller except the camera is behind Crash instead on the side. You are still on a fixed path that you have to follow. Sometimes you will even enter a part of the stage that is a side-scroller. The gameplay has always work very well like this.Warped is the third game in the series though, and they needed to add something new. They did just that by adding: Power Ups, Flying levels, underwater levels, jet-ski levels, and motorcycle racing levels. Power ups are gained whenever you defeat a boss. You get small things like double jump and belly flop at first. Later on you'll get a Laser Guided Bazooka and Running Shoes, which really change up the gameplay. One thing that I am happy about is that the Power Ups actually help you play the game. They aren't just useless add-onsThe new level types are just what this game series needed. The underwater levels play like a side-scroller underwater. It's enjoyable to swim around instead of walking. Jet Ski and Motorcycle levels are great vehicle levels. I admit that the controls on the Motorcycle levels take some getting used to, but that is what makes it fun. The flying levels are probably the coolest new things. There are only three in the entire game. You fly around in a plane and shoot down opposing planes. There isn't much to it, but it's a nice break from the other levels.Difficulty- 5/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)This game is extremely easy. You can go through the entire game without dying. Not just that, but the entire game only consists of around 3-4 hours of your time. One strong afternoon of playing, and you'll be done. The bosses on this game can become a little difficult, but it only takes a few minutes to learn their pattern. Also, I felt the final boss battle was too easy.Overall- 7/10The gameplay is extremely strong. The story for this game is just all out of whack. If you are looking for a quick game to pick up and play, this is for you. I suggest checking out the previous two titles first though. They areCrash BandicootandCrash Bandicoot 2.

Now you shoot them with a hack dart and then the hack screen pops up same as for vending, ammo, health, etc.  I haven't gotten too far into the story or played multiplayer yet.  The graphics are identical to B1, with the underwater scenes looking really good.  IGN gives it a 9.1 (Incredible rank).  This series is one of my favorites.  I loved B1 and B2 looks to be a lot of fun, too.  Peace!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2010"}

For this, the Director's Cut edition was produced, adding some content over the console versions (mostly rooftop action missions), and care was taken to make the gamepad to keyboard/mouse-transition as seamless as possible. For the most part it was successful.This is a TREMENDOUSLY BEAUTIFULLY GAME. The first thing that grabs you is how REAL the city environments feel. The graphics are just OUT OF THIS WORLD! You will need a very good PC to enjoy their full potential (minimum requirements provided below), but real skies, dynamic shadows, facial expressions and realistically flowing robes are only beginning to describe it! Run on a roof and the other citizens will gather around and comment on your crazy behavior! Throw someone on a vendor's cart and he will come after you complaining about his ruined produce! And the city is alive well beyond your character. If only BIOWARE could take some lessons for its next BALDUR's GATE...Adding to this is the wonderful sound! From the crowd murmurs and the NTCs cries for help, to the whistling of the wind and the well-chosen background music, a good sound-card and speakers set is recommended to truly enjoy this game. If you have a 5.1 speaker system (I do not) I can imagine the experience to become even more immersing.As to the gameplay, you control Altar ibn La-Ahad (\"The Flying One, Son of None\"). He is a member of the Assassin Brotherhood that sides, well, with both...sides, during the 3rd Crusade. In a story twist, he is also your ancestor, the game being your/his flashback memories. This is a twist I could do without, but I would guess it lays groundwork for the sequels.The Third person perspective works beautifully and will never loose your interest. Most missions require sneaking and murdering in the shadows. Others will have you eavesdropping for passwords or pickpocketing documents to gain access into target buildings. Some will have you sharpen those sword skills. Still, the game does not avoid its share of stupid \"keep this...suicidal character from getting killed\" missions. Keep in mind though that ASSASSIN's CREED is rather a strategically thinking action TPS, not a hack&slash; fast-paced one.Controlling your character with a keyboard/mouse takes a lot of getting used to as you have to manage running, climbing, fighting as well as modifying your actions from low to high visibility. The keys are remapable but their complexity will never let you forget you are playing a game. Now for some bad news.These are the official MINIMUM Requirements:* Pentium D 2.6GHz (YES, Dual Core!) (or AMD equivalent)* 1GB RAM (WinXP) or 2GB (WinVISTA) (3GB RECOMMENDED!)* nVidia 6800 (or Shader Model 3.0 compliant or ATI equivalent)* Dual-Layer DVD-ROM (or BluRay disc)* 12GB HDD Space (although my install folder was no larger than 7GB)As one can see, this is worse than CRYSIS! What I cannot get is how on earth ASSASSIN works on only 512MB of RAM of the XBox, yet it is recommended to have...3GB of RAM on a PC! Sure, the extra content is nice but who did the porting, unpaid interns? Has ANY PC optimization been attempted at all?Keep also in mind that (as with CRYSIS) in order to fully enjoy the game, barely meeting the minimum requirements means you will barely experience the game. I refuse to deal with WinVISTA so, obviously, this review pertains to DirectX-9. The game is also DirectX-10 compatible, something I cannot comment on though. And now for some good news.UBISOFT has been recently hit with a $5million class-action suit for hardware (OK, \"allegedly\") damaged by StarForce bundled with its games. Since, they have announced to be abandoning its StarForce partnership - so let's all rejoice: unlike other UBISOFT games, ASSASSIN's CREED does NOT sport StarForce! Instead, a much milder SafeDisc is used.It is a pity it took litigation to finally listen to their own customers (suing StarForce would make much more sense, but try finding them in Russia!), but let's count our blessings.So, overall, this is a well made and beautiful, immersing (although quite short) game that needed more work in PC optimization (where it looses 1 star Overall) and character control (where it looses 1 star for Fun).As Altair himself would have put it: \"Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.\"Well, not everything - and certainly NOT StarForce.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002C0VNQQ","reviewerName":"James Hunt","summary":"Risen","reviewText":"In many ways Risen is a reworking of the game Gothic 2.  It has been several years since I played that game but I remember it crashed a lot.  Risen, however, never crashed or froze up a single time.Pros:1.  Your character speaks.  When you select your dialog choice you actually hear the lines spoken.2.  Nice little cut scenes with good sound effects for various actions like cooking, smithing, mixing potions, etc.  Helps with the sense of immersion.3.  Good economics system.  You never seem to have more money than you can use.4.  Adversaries are for the most part not leveled.  Sometimes you have to run away or avoid combat till you get stronger.  As you gain experience you actually feel like you have accomplished something.  you are able to face tougher opponents and the lower level creatures become easier to defeat)5.  Combat is fun and challenging.  You can't pause the game to take a healing potion.  You can't just stand there clicking the attack button.  Various strategies can be utilized.Once I levitated over a spike trap and was immediately attacked.  I was able to turn the lizard man by manuevering until the trap was behind him.  Then I kept blocking with my shield while \"pushing\".  Eventually he stepped back and was instantly killed when the trap was sprung.Other times I would fire an arrow at a creature to get it to follow.  I could lure it away to where I could climb up on a roof and finish it off with arrows.  although sometimes they could jump up and attack me)6.  You can climb.  There was one quest where I needed to get into a locked building.  I didn't have the Pickpocket skill to get the key from the guard but I was able to get in anyway by climbing up an adjacent building, jumping from roof to roof, and finally dropping down through a sort of skylight.  Fun.Cons:1.  Limited size.  Only one town.2.  Can only play as one character and no customization is possible.3.  No diversions as in games like Fable or Witcher.  You can't go fishing.  No gambling or skill games.  No boxing.  No \"close encounters\" except with one prostitute.  which didn't even have any funny sound effects)4.  Quest info is not as helpful as it could be.  For instance the quest map location indicator dots should change color as you complete them.Overall this is a fine role playing game.  I would rate it about 4.5 of 5 and will round up because of the stability.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2011"}
{"product_name":"B002C0VNQQ","reviewerName":"S. Griffith","summary":"Definitely not as great as Gothic 1/2, but still very good game","reviewText":"I am a great fan of Gothic series. My approach to gaming may be rather different - in games I strongly prefer an involving story, strong and memorable personalities of NPCs, and a strong concept as the basis. Gothic games (1 and 2) have it to the full extent. They are not just games, but more similar to interactive books or movies. It is very hard to forget such NPCs as Xardas, Diego, Lester, Gorn, Milton, Vatras,... and a lot more. So I expected from Risen even if not to reach, then to be at least close to Gothic level.Frankly, it did not happen. Yes, Risen tries very hard to be similar to Gothic, and A LOT of ideas and features are recycled. But still imitation is not an original thing. Concerning memorability of NPCs and how well side quests fit overall story Risen is somewhat closer to Gothic 3. Also the lack of good info at the beginning made it rather hard for me to really have any desire to join ANY fraction. When in Gothic you learn a lot about people, places, and ideologies of the world through (better developed) dialogue system, Risen kind of simplifies things. Probably, devs believed that not every gamer is willing to be patient, and actually cares.The world of Risen is SMALL, but in some points in the game you get restricted to an even smaller area (the harbor town, or the monstery), which makes things claustrofobic. I would not say this was a good game design decision.You cannot swim in the game, and this looks kind of dumb. The town is very similar to Khorinis, and to see a harbor from the shore and be unable to swim into it just feels ridiculous.The game is short. For a very average player it takes about 40 hours to finish, and some people finish the game in just 25-26 hours. A lot of people who completed it say that it feels short, and they wish it were longer. 60 hours will be probably if you search under every rock, and pick up every herb. But it does have a replay value, and I wouldn't be surprised if you play it 3-4 times.Don't take me wrong. Risen is definitely not an interactive book, but still it is a damn good game, worth playing a handful of times.I did not find any faults with visuals, and animations. Some people complain, but I am perfectly ok.Fighting system is an improvement over Gothic 3, with 3 difficulty levels.Exploration of Faranga is one of the most enjoyable parts of this game.To put my grading into perspective:Risen 8/10 or 83/100 - greatGothic 1/Gothic 2 98-100/100 - masterpieceGothic 3 without 1.72 patch 65/100, with 1.72 patch 75/100 - goodThe Witcher Enchanced 93/100 - perfection","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-02-2009"}

Possibly the biggest disappointment in the history of videogames since the Sega Saturn, 'Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness' is the first next-gen outing for the intrepid Ms. Croft.Stuck in development hell for the best part of 2 years, Core and Eidos should be very, VERY ashamed of themselves for allowing such a bug-filled, poorly thought-out piece of software onto the shelves, much less a game with such a rich and popular reputation to live up to.Put simply, 'Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness' is an absolute dog.First: The graphics just do not cut the mustard. Granted, the human characters in the Tomb Raider series were never graphically astounding, but here they're just badly done. Textures are pixelated and the frame rate is low. Lara's animations are smooth and her new costumes are diverting, but that's it. Characters like Bouchard and Carvier are not good enough for the PS 2, being underdetailed and very badly animated.Level design is very substandard for a TR game. And, horror of horrors, there's only one tomb, The rest of the game is like a horrible cross between Metal Gear Solid and a weak RPG, where Lara is forced to run about Parisian streets and warehouses with no real sense of raiding anything.Second: The control system is an absolute abomination. Lara is just not meant to be analog. Gone is the intuitive quad-style floor layout and now jumps and falls are impossible to judge, the upshot of which is Core have created a game which is insanely easy to beat. Lining up the camera, controlled by the right analog stick, every time you want to make a jump, is just annoying, and the collision detection is ridiculous.Third: This is such an easy game to beat. Although I should point out, you'd better get to like the phrases 'Overwrite Successful' and 'Load Successful', becuase you'll be seeing them a hell of a lot. Thanks to the ridiculous control system, Saving and Loading happens far more often than is acceptable, and when you do manage to make the jumps and climbs without the control system hampering your every move or the game crashing out (happens a lot, sound and event glitches abound) you wonder what happened to the rest of the level.A horrible, horrible game that yields no rewards, and will cause great distress to fans of the TR series, 'Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness' is something we should all forget.Core, never let this happen again.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2004"}

Bryant","summary":"While the G110 may be Logitech's entry model for gaming keyboard, it may well be more functionally efficient than its siblings.","reviewText":"Logitech offers a trio of gaming keyboards; the middle-of-the-roadLogitech G15 Gaming Keyboard (Black), the high-endLogitech G19 Gaming Keyboard, and the 'economy' model and the subject of this review -- the G110.  Despite being the less expensive entry into the family, the G110 offers at least a couple productivity and convenience minded features that it's siblings do not.  The most significant of these, in this reviewer's opinion, is the availability of an open USB port on the back of the keyboard itself.  This is a perfect place to plug in a pair of headphones (I have theLogitech G35 7.1-Channel Surround Sound Headsetin there now), although it's worth noting that this is a low power USB port.  Not having to fumble around behind my machine when I want to go to headphones rather than the speakers built into my monitor is a real boon, albeit one that represents a greater value to myself than it does others with better and more accessible USB options.  Nonetheless, it's one of my favorite parts of this keyboard, and it's a feature not offered by either of the G110's older siblings, the G15 and G19.The keyboard itself feels solid, there's little that feels cheap or slight about it, including the stroke of the keys.  Indeed, the only part of the construction that didn't impress me was the entirely optional palm rest, which is a rather flimsy plastic shell that snaps down from under the front of the keyboard itself, providing an ergonomically friendly but not entirely pleasing rest.I worried a bit installing the keyboard on a machine running Windows 7 64-bit, particularly because I have an ASUS motherboard.  I did some searching before installing and found a number of folks complaining about boot lockups related to the keyboard, but I was reassured when each of these threads (on the manufacturer's official site) each ended with the poster noting that upon a BIOS upgrade, their problems disappeared.  Happily, I encountered no such issues.  I downloaded the G-series software from Logitech directly so that I knew I was getting the most current version for this new(er) operating system, it installed in moments without a reboot, and was intuitive enough that I was setting the back-light color keys (M1, M2, M3 in the top left corner of the board) quickly and easily.  The backlighting is clear and almost entirely even, the only exception being a few keys with three rows of text rather than one or two (Tab and CapsLock because of the corresponding symbols, Scroll lock, etc.) which see the lighting fade a bit towards a top of the keys.  Not something you really notice unless you're looking closely, and even then it does not interfere with clean and easy key identification even in the darkest room.  I've been underwhelmed with key lighting in the past, and was very pleased with this implementation.The customizable G1-G12 keys along the left side of the keyboard are a nice touch, I'm certain I will find uses for each (they're currently functional mirrors of F1-F12, as default), but I am having to erase old muscle memory that assumes that CapsLock and A are the first and only keys starting from the far left of the board.  This is certainly not a complaint, just something (like the straight-flat layout) that I'm adapting to after switching the G110 in for an older ergonomic USB keyboard from Microsoft.I've had to stop and think about why I'm giving this four stars rather than five, because I really just don't have any substantive complaints.  It 'feels' good, it looks great, the extra ports are a huge bonus -- I suppose the truth of it is, and this may well be silly, that I'm withholding the 5th star knowing that there are two pricier alternatives in the family.  Perhaps the truth is simply that my hand positioning misses the 'mound', alignment break and more familiar (to me) spatial relationship between keys provided by the old ergonomically designed keyboard this replaced.  Either way, my point is that there's little reason to ding the G110, which is why I'm happy to glow about it, and recommend it, in this review.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2010"}

You just do one track & move on to the next (being bombarded with stupid annoying cut scenes each and every time which you cannot turn off).  I also find it beyond annoying how after playing a community level, the game takes you alllllll the way back to the main menu rather than back to the community level list where you left off.

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed.

When I sell the 3 games it will be like I bought a brand new 320gb PS3 for $200. I doubt any black friday deal will be better than that.If you see the bundle is still available you should get it, because these are in limited amounts so once they sell out, you'll never be able to buy one again (except from the idiots who resell for double the price)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005ME6N","description":"Resident Evil: Code Veronica Xcomes with a bonus playable demo ofDevil May Cry.Resident Evil: Code Veronica Xbegins as Claire Redfield leaves Raccoon City for the European headquarters of the Umbrella Corporation to search for her brother Chris and solve the mystery surrounding Umbrella Corporation's dreaded biotoxins. She is captured during her investigation and sent to a prison on a desolate island.InResident Evil: Code Veronica X, players control Claire at the beginning of the game, and later assume the role of Chris Redfield in their efforts to halt Umbrella's devious plans. One of the many features that makeCode Veronica Xdifferent from previous Resident Evil games is the Real World System (RWS). Now when Claire affects changes to her environment (opening doors, solving puzzles, storing items), those changes remain while you play the second half of the game as Chris.Resident Evil: Code Veronica Xcontains never-before-seen footage that focuses on battles between Chris and the enigmatic Wesker, and sheds new insight into the ominous Resident Evil story line. To her horror, Claire discovers Umbrella Corporation's insidious activities are not isolated to the remote Midwestern city. Flesh-eating zombies, horrific beasts, and even stranger mutations have spread on a global scale. Just how far does this twisted conspiracy extend? Nope.","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"Signatures are onerous.\"","summary":"The Black Sheep of the Resident Evil Series","reviewText":"Code Veronica is hands down the most frustrating, pain-in-the-butt Resident Evil game in the entire series.  The formula is the same, but the game is horribly imbalanced.  If you don't play through it in a very specific way, it is possible to reach a point where it literally becomes unplayable because you will run out of ammo.  That alone is bad enough, but there are other elements in the gameplay design that were simply not well thought-out, and cause the player a supreme amount of frustration.  For example, bats that will not leave you alone unless you have the lighter.  If you make a certain decision at a certain point in the game, Claire gives up the lighter, leaving you with no defense against the bats.  Then throw in the Bandersnatches, who have a completely unavoidable long range attack.  You end up standing there, trying to fire your weapon as they pound on you.  You're simply trading blows with them, and that's not good gameplay design.  The puzzles too are more convoluted than in previous games, so you often end up wasting precious resources like ammo and herbs as you run from area to area trying to figure out what to do next.  In Code Veronica, zombies regenerate after you've left an area, something which didn't happen in previous RE games.  So the more you run around, the more ammo you're wasting, and the more your chances of being able to continue in the game dwindle.  I've enjoyed all of the Resident Evil games except this one.  It's the stinker of the bunch.  Buyers beware!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2011"}

I've grown up in the SNES days and have grown to love each and every system in its time with all the great games offered on those systems. Their of course are handfull of titles that everyone can relate to i.e. Ocarina of Time, Goldeneye, Halo, FF, Mario, Counter Strike, etc...Games people grew up with and have stories of how these game took over their lives and changed how they felt about games. Bioshock Infinite is easily a contender for Game of the Year, and a must own title. Stop thinking about buying it and purchase it.I will warn you that the game has a few themes that may disturb a few, but the message of the game is brilliant and subtle and the ending of the game will make you want to play it again right away. I remember playing the original Bioshock when it was only released for Xbox 360 and still have my original copy and play it. The breathe of fresh air I got from playing I still remember the chills I got walking through rapture. Columbia doesn't have the dark vibe rapture did, but the vast size of the city will make your jaw drop and you will wish you had a bigger TV, and wish the game could spread out even more, I mean I found myself just staring at areas, thats how beautiful the city is. The gameplay feels just like a bioshock title, the music while you play is amazing as well. This game is a must own and once your done playing it will be a game you tell friends about, it is a pure classic and will be talking about years to come. Once you finish the game you will know why it is easily one of the best games ever made. So buy it, you wont regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"Wu-Tang_Assassin","summary":"Great Addition To The Series!","reviewText":"Being a big fan and avid player of the Halo series since its first release in 2001, I was really excited before the release of Halo 3. This game is ridiculously good in the single player and multiplayer but has some flaws.The graphics in Halo blow the other two out of the water. The scenery, the look of the environments, and the character models, the gun models, explosions and amount of things on the screen at once make Halo 3 great when it comes to graphics. I didn't really find any flaws graphic wise.The sound in this game is of course good once again. The sound in Halo 1 and 2 were both great, and they came correct once again in part 3. Also didn't find no flaws here.The controls in H3 are very very easy to learn. If you have played Halo 1 and 2, you will have no problem what so ever learning this game. Only difference is using the right bumper instead of the button \"x\". You use the right bumper to reload, and enter/exit vehicles etc. Besides that, easy.The amount of features in this game is really good. The single player has better and more fun levels. The enemies are smarter, and usually a mix of the covenant and brutes while fighting. Another good feature is being able to play the campaign with 4 people total, so for people that want to beat the game on Legendary, this can be done with ease :-) and also makes it more fun. The single player has a decent length and is basically comparable to Halo 1/2 in how long it is.The multiplayer is of course where Halo 3 shines! The maps are great, some are mediocre, and Bungie has already released 2 map packs. Just like in Halo 2, there is a number rank, up to 50. But this time in Halo 3, you get army like rankings which require you to get to a certain \"number rank\" before getting the tag. There is Recruit, Apprentice, Private, Corporal, Sergeant, Gunnery Sergeant. To get those rankings I just listed you have to get EXP, which stands for experience, each time you win, you gain 1 exp point! Next rankings are Lieutenant(Lvl 10), Captain(Lvl 20), Major(Lvl 30), Commander(Lvl 35), Colonel(Lvl 40), Brigadier(Lvl 45), General(Lvl 50). So I basically thought this ranking system they added is cool, and adds more to the multiplayer.Some of the flaws in this game come from the multiplayer of course. One thing I found that happened quite often, is when I'm sniping, I will hit a person, and it will show blood come out, but they are still at full shields/health. This has also happened after sniping them in the head which is very odd. Also, when there is lag in the games, some ridiculous and odd things can happen. Another flaw, is when using the swords. I have had a few times when I'd fly at someone with the sword connect with them and hit them perfectly, and it doesn't bring they're shields down one bit.So overall, is Halo 3 with the buy? Of course it is, the few flaws it has doesn't bring the game back too much. You'll have fun on the multiplayer for sure. Pick this up!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-08-2008"}

Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy.

On his 21st birthday, the Darkness awakens within Jackie Estacado, a mafia hitman for the Franchetti crime family.","reviewerName":"eternal now \"roejoerrer\"","summary":"Embrace the Darkness","reviewText":"Don't believe the negative hype surrounding this title, it is a spectacular Xbox 360 Next Generation release.I'm not sure how close the game resembles the comic created by Top Cow, but there are many treats to be experienced both visually and game play wise in The Darkness.Lets start with some of the positive aspects of this game:Graphically, this game is absolutely stunning in its graphical beauty.The dark gritty New York City streets really give off that \"real-city\" vibe.Garbage litters the streets and the subway systems, graffiti covers practically every wall (and this graffiti looks like actually graffiti that you would see in real life).So much detail has been put into the floors, ceilings, walls and in you general surroundings that it is very easy to get deeply immersed in The Darkness.Following in true Next Gen graphic style, all the wood surfaces in the game look like real wood, metal resembles real metal, concrete looks amazingly realistic. You can see chips in paint, cracks and chips in the concrete - its literally stunning.The Darkness relies on the use of shadows, and the lighting engine is superb. Light shines off of virtually every surface that would reflect light (including leather!). Every object casts a proper shadow.Since you are in a city, there are lights everywhere and in order for your Darkness power to work or re-charge you need to be in the shadows.Basically this mean taking out every light you come into contact with.Character models look really good. Not as good as Gears of War models, but the characters look believable, most of the time body parts move like they should, clothes look somewhat realistic. Cloth looks amazing. The bodies still look a little clunky, but nothing major.Face models are wonderfully detailed, you can see wrinkles and imperfections in the characters faces. Sometimes you can see facial expressions however not too often. The faces are probably the most detailed aspect on each character. The eyes in this game look full of life.The darkness powers look awesome. Your character acquires two demonic serpent heads on either shoulder and they look amazing. Each darkness power is represented very well graphically.Weapons look realistic, some of the most realistic depictions I have ever seen in a game.On a side note, you get to learn where the darkness comes from.The physics are downright cool. Everything seems to move as it should. With one of your darkness powers you can pick up objects and people and fling them around. This looks very cool and makes you feel like a real \"force-to-be-reckoned-with\".Some claim that the story line in The Darkness is clich&eacute;d and boring, but I beg to differ. While it is true that the storyline is steeped in New York Mob Scene and carries along with it the good ol' revenge angle and other Mafia generic-ness, the story is told really well and keeps you nevertheless engaged throughout. There are also some twists to the sotry line, and lets just say that New York City is not the only place you will visit in The Darkness. There is some twisted stuff here!Another great aspect is how the some of the main characters history is told. Instead of loading scenes, you are treated to monologues given by the main character. In these monologues he is either telling a story from his childhood, re-telling or elucidating on current plot elements, or just sitting there gazing at his guns.This adds much more to the whole \"cinematic\" element of The Darkness and gives you something to look at while the game is loading. Much better than staring at a flashing loading screen.More unique things include televisions that you can interact with. These TV's show five or six channels of real material. Some have Cartoons, others music videos and there are two movie channels. They show real movies and I believe you can watch them all the way through.The musical score fits each scene perfectly and ranges from Death metal(fight scenes), to orchestrated music(during talking scenes and in the subway). Also there are other areas where music being either played or listened to by NPC's can be heard (there are people who play the harmonica and Break dancers who will dance for you).Character development has been well done, you actually do care about the characters close to you and you grow to hate your arch enemy. You will grow especially close to your girlfriend Jenny. I grew really attached to her over the course of the game. By the way her face model is one of the best I have ever seen in a video game.Okay, lets talk about unique aspects:Summoning Darklings: In The Darkness you gain the ability to summon Darklings (look like little goblins) to do your bidding. Each Darkling has its own special ability and funtion.The darkling models look really cool, and they each have an attitude that could only be attributed to a darkling. They urinate on dead corpses and make rude comments.Control is done really well, despite what some reviewers may say. I find the controls easy to use. From summoning darkness powers to calling up darklings to using the regular weapons and moving: I found this all easy to understand and control.This is a FPS but with some role playing elements.Your darkness powers level up after a certain amount of hearts have been eaten (that's right, your darkness serpents eat the hearts of fallen corpses, only the evil characters though). With each level up you will gain a new darkness power.The powers really make you feel super-human.They range from being able to open up a black hole portal to suck everything in and kill all enemies around it, gaining control of an arm that can grab objects and impale enemies, to duel wielding guns that harness the darkness power into bullet projectiles.Each power has its use and is very fun to use, never getting stale or boring.Another RPG aspect is the side missions and some somewhat free roaming nature of this game. The game is basically broken down into streets and certain landmarks, with the subway system acting as a central hub. In the subway system you cannot use your weapons (this area acts as the \"safe-village\" that can commonly be found in most RPG's). The subway is where you get all of the side missions from NPC's.They range from simple to time consuming, but nevertheless add to the overall fun.The game is free roaming to an extent. You can roam the streets but they are visibly cut off at a certain point. You cannot walk into just any building either. But these constraints don't mean much, since The Darkness is meant to be more of a story rather than an open ended experience.Overall, the areas to explore of decent. There are even collectible items to collect throughout. You have to do some searching to find them, but its worth it. If your into that sort of thing.The developers incorporated a neat system for unlocking these collectibles too (which I think unlocks game videos and comic books, I think).The collectibles you pick up are actually phone numbers which you can call at any pay phone in the subway system (most of the pay phones out on the street are broken. Go figure!) When you call them you usually reach someones answering machine. And most of the time the message is a funny one.There are also secret numbers scrawled on walls and such, and when called will prompt another side mission involving you finding about 16 secret phone numbers to unlock a secret achievement.Speaking of achievements, there are plenty to be had. And they are fun ones too. I won't tell you what they are, but I will say that you can track your achievements via a pause menu.There is so much scripted dialog in The Darkness, the cinematic and realistic qualities of this game are further enhanced. Passer-by NPC (non-playable characters) that are not key to the plot or side missions don't really say much. But those that ask you to do side missions, key plot characters and enemies during battle all have plenty to say.I love it when the enemies that I am fighting talk trash to me or cower in fear when I am fighting them. It really adds to the game play.If you have ever Played Condemned : Criminal Origins, you will really like this game. The Darkness seems to be closely related to Condemned in spirit. However, The Darkness is much more fast paced in terms of action and fighting.I have yet to try the multiplayer Xbox Live deathmatch gaming.Overall, I recommend The Darkness. It is a true experience of Next-Gen gaming, you will not be disappointed. There are so many little nuances thrown into this game that just give it a realistic feel and liven up the game in so many ways. This is a real treat to wat","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2007"}

I had apparently traded it a while ago, but hadn't exactly meant to.  Each of the systems I own, I always wind up keeping or going back to recollect the titles I most loved on said system, and the Star Fox was one that I had meant to hold onto.  Now, however, it has been remade on Nintendo 3DS, which is pretty cool, because it was always a fun one to sit and play through.  It's notably not the most amazing game ever, but it's still a lot of fun, and is perfect if you want to sit and just play through a game real quick while you're killing some time, because it doesn't take too awful long to get through it...maybe 30-45 minutes.  Despite that though, it has definite replay value, because it really is pretty fun, and the more hardcore gamers can work at perfecting their art and making it through the harder side of the grid, without beind redirected to the medium or easy path.  I myself am perfectly happy playing through easy or medium path, but then again I am a more casual gamer.  Sound wise, the only real annoyance is some of the iterations and pleaz for help from some of your team mates, especially Slippy Toad...worthless frog!  That, and some of the boss characters are kinda dingbats.  All in all though, if you own a 3DS, this one is worthwhile to have sitting around, though I recommend maybe trying to pick it up for less than the $40 price tag.

{"product_name":"B00B67ZTUW","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"A review from a longtime JRPG fan who is new to the Tales series","reviewText":"As a fan of JRPG's for over 25 years, I had been hearing about the Tales series for a very long time. Despite their steadily growing popularity in the States over the last decade or so, I'm not sure why I'd never given the series a chance. With so many excellent JRPG's hitting consoles in recent years, combined all the great things I'd been hearing about Tales of Xillia, I decided to finally give this beloved series a try. And boy, am I glad I did.Tales of Xillia immediately charmed me with the quick introduction of its two main playable characters, Jude and Milla (the game can be played from either of their perspectives, which adds fantastic replay value to the game). Their dialogue was incredibly well-written and well-delivered by the voice actors, which gave the story a great sense of immediacy and set the stage for an epic adventure right from the start. And man, oh man, is this game an EPIC adventure. Tales of Xillia's story blew me away. It was so engaging, so emotional, and had so many small moments of humor, poignancy and charm, that trying to sum it up into a moderately short review would be next to impossible for me. Let me just say this...while I don't think that Tales of Xillia quite reaches the high peaks overall that Xenoblade Chronicles and Ni No Kuni: Wrath of the White Witch did (the two best JRPG's of the seventh generation, in my opinion), the story in Tales of Xillia not only surpasses the stories of those wonderful games, but is one of the best stories I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing in all my years of gaming. Kudos to the writers of this game. I am chomping at the bit to play the upcoming sequel.Aside from the story, the other aspect of the game that really grabbed me by the jugular was the real time combat system. It was simply awesome. It reminded me a bit of an arcade fighting game like Street Fighter II (streamlined, of course) due to its emphasis on combos and special moves. At the same time, the ability to link with other party members and do combined moves was amazing and added quite a bit of strategy to the proceedings. I'd never played an RPG with a combat system quite like this, and it felt fresh and fun throughout the entire 40 or so hours it took me to complete the campaign as Jude. The upgrade/skill trees were fairly simple to learn once you get used to them, and navigating around the menus was a breeze. Tales of Xillia is a very well designed game overall.Oh, and the music is phenomenal as well. The first 75% of the game or so had some wonderful, traditional-sounding orchestral music, but the last quarter of the game saw some of the most bizarre, yet most completely awesome, music I've heard in a JRPG. Mixing free jazz with heavy synths and shifting rhythms, the music in some of the scenarios is completely out of left field, yet works so completely well with the mood of the game. It's great stuff.So why is this game getting docked a star after all this praise? One thing was the graphics. Now, I'm far from being a graphics snob, but for the most part, Tales of Xillia is a sub-par-looking game, which is really a shame. What is really odd, however, is that certain parts of the game look great. The cutscenes are fantastic. The character models are detailed and well-animated. And the cities/towns/villages all look great. But the \"overworld\" environments are very, very bland, as are the majority of the dungeons. Not only are they boring to look at, but they are repetitive as well. It's almost as if two different teams designed the cities and the non-city environments. Structures in the environments look thrown together, and dungeon areas seem monotonous. For a game that clearly had so much care put into its story, mechanics and gameplay, this is a real shame. Another thing that was really annoying in Tales of Xillia was the side quest content. It was your typical boring \"fetch this\" or \"kill that\", and the characters giving the quests did absolutely nothing to make you want to help them. Again, it's an aspect of the game that seemed somewhat rushed, and wasn't given the care that other parts of the game were.But overall, these few flaws did little to detract from what is an absolutely fantastic adventure that you'll very likely always remember. Tales of Xillia is a great game, and as it was my introduction to the series, I can officially say that the game has created a new fan in me, and I'll be eagerly awaiting the next installment in the series. Anyone who enjoys great video game storytelling fused with excellent, enjoyable gameplay shouldn't miss Tales of Xillia, a game that sits comfortably with Xenoblade Chronicles, Ni No Kuni, and the other great JRPG's to release on seventh generation consoles.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2014"}

This is not a great game at all. It is above average, and that is about it, unless you think that good cosmetics like graphics and sound effects are all that's needed to make a great game.In case you weren't aware, this game uses a real-time action system, where you issue orders to the characters and they perform them all simultaneously with your enemies, in real-time. It adds a realistic element to combat that turn-based combat doesn't have. However, the real-time combat system isn't all that it's cranked up to be. Let's just say that it's a royal pain. It's impossible to manage your characters without babysitting them and pausing the game every five seconds to issue a new order. So, although it might be more realistic, it isn't any more exciting.  I had a lot more fun playing turn-based \"Fallout\" than I did playing Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale.  If you don't know what the word \"micromanage\" means, you will find out playing this game.Another drawback to this game is that it is almost a pure brute force game. Slash and hack. Don't get me wrong, I love my fantasy violence as much as the next guy, but it should be mixed in with some problem-solving too. Icewind Dale has almost none of that. If you like that stuff, on the other hand, then you might like this game even more.The worst part about this game though, is that the \"fight, die and reload routine\" is frustrating. You know that routine. You keep saving your game and playing an encounter over and over until you win. In Icewind Dale, this routine consists of...1. Entering a room guarded by beasts too powerful for your party to defeat(as an added twist for fun, the game sometimes puts your magic user at the front of the marching order when you enter a new room).2. Getting slaughtered.3. Loading your most recent saved game.4. Repeating steps 1-3, preparing for battle a little different each time and hoping that your luck is different. Eventually, you win.5. Immediately clicking \"save\". I hope that you like saving your game often, because you will find out how badly you really do need to do it. Icewind Dale has a lot of \"fight, die, and reload\".There are other little problems in this game as well. One of them is the automatic pathfinding function. You would think that in this day and age, someone could make a game where if you click a point on the map the game can figure out the quickest way to get there. Not so. You will find this especially annoying in combat, when you want one of your priests to heal someone, and you find him wandering around the room because of the lousy pathfinding function.But, like I said, I am satisfied with this game.  The visual and sound effects are truly stunning.  I usually don't care about this stuff, but it adds so much to the game (especially spellcasting) that it is worth mentioning.  If you have ever wanted to know what a magical ice storm, fireball, or noxious stinking cloud looks like, you'll get to see it here.  Icewind Dale is a game that is fun, but it is not addictive.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2001"}

{"product_name":"B000MJB0H6","description":"Pokemon Diamondis a traditional Pokemon RPG that takes place in a region called Sinnoh.In the Sinnoh region, there are two Pokemon that symbolize the region. They appear in the Sinnoh reigon's myths and old folklore. One is called Dialga, and is said to have the power to control time. The other is called Palkia, who is said to have the ability to distort space. The sinister organization called Team Galaxy is trying to rule the region by utilizing these two Pokemon's power. During your adventure to complete your Pokedex and become the Champion, these two Pokemon, and Team Galaxy, will intertwine into the story and lead you on a fantastic journey across the Sinnoh region.When you set off on your travels, you'll be able to play as either a boy or girl Trainer. You will also utilize the DS's dual slots to transfer Pokemon from the GBA Pokemon games and be able to link up withPokemon Rangerto access more special content. Pokemon fans have caught glimpses of Mime Jr., Lucario, Munchlax and Weavile in Pokemon movies, and these Pokemon will be debuting in this adventure.","reviewerName":"Charlie Brooks","summary":"The best Pokemon games yet.","reviewText":"While some may have dismissed the Pokemon craze as just a fad, it's still around and going strong after over a decade. Pokemon Diamond and Pokemon Pearl represent the most recent additions to the RPG line, and are the first non-spinoff addition to the game line for the Nintendo DS.The game plays very much the same as it does in any other Pokemon game. As a rookie trainer setting out of a small town, you've got a trio of goals: capture as many pokemon as possible, become the Pokemon League champion, and defeat an evil team who seeks to take over the world using Pokemon (in this case, Team Galactic). The game provides a number of different outlets for potentially limitless gameplay. Even after you finish the main plot, you can catch more pokemon, rematch people you fought before, and enter your pokemon in a variety of different contests. In addition, as with the other games, you can trade or do battle with friends. The features of the DS give a few additional options. First, you can import pokemon from your old games. Second, for the first time in franchise history, you can go online to trade and battle with people across the world. Those features alone, as well as the delicious improved graphics and mini-games, make Diamond and Pearl the best of the Pokemon games to date.Just the main plot of the game can easily provide a person with 30-40 hours of fun. The Sinnoh region is the largest area of the franchise so far, and provides a lot of different options. Unfortunately, it can also provide some redundancy. When you've caught a good number of pokemon, random battles become somewhat redundant. Especially in caves, wild pokemon will attack every few feet, and they aren't worth the time it takes for the battle animations to play out. Additionally, the proliferation of other trainers can make the game feel like a grind when you've got a large area to cross before getting to the next town. Nonetheless, these are standard drawbacks of any Pokemon game, and they're easily ignored in favor of the fun the game offers.If you're a fan of Pokemon, buying this game is a no-brainer. It has everything that made the Gameboy franchise great, and improves on the formula with more options and online play. If you're new to the franchise, start here. The game is an excellent hand-held role-playing game, whether or not you're familiar with the rest of the franchise. It's easy to get addicted, and soon you'll find out why so many people have gotten into the world of Pokemon.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2007"}

New items and assist trophies.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"The best party you threw all in one disc","reviewText":"Let's face it, Super Smash Bros Brawl was without a doubt one of the most heavily anticipated games of this year. With heavyweights like Metroid, Mario and Zelda, Nintendo's machine was sure generating some good momentum but those games were more for the hardcore single player whereas Brawl's strengths best come when you're amongst friends that can play. Maybe it was because of that that I was reluctant to purchase it since I always played the machine by myself with no one to really call or was not too busy. But first playing among family members, the appeal of the game/series became easy to see. The single player is fun but to best get the game's positives, bring some friends.Story: No real story to speak of unless you take on the main single player mission which is quite long but the game's more a party game where you and up to 3 other players can battle each other or team up in certain special stages. As such, the game might not be as fun if it's just simply you although like the others in the series, the unlockables which contain trophies to new stages and characters, there's a lot to uncover within the game.Graphics: Of course there's an upgrade from Melee with more sharper character models, flashy effects like lighting, explosions and such but when you stack it against gorgeous games like Mario Galaxy or Twilight Princess, it's not really the most prettiest Wii title but then when you're fighting enemies, you can kind of care less about whether something isn't as sharp as it should be.Sound/Music: The music quite surprised as the game kicks off with a big cinematic intro complete with huge choirs and heavily orchestrated arrangements and throughout the game you can hear music that resembles the stage such as the Overworld Theme from Legend of Zelda to even those quirky songs with strange singing from Animal Crossing. Voice acting is just stuff like laughing, grunts and catch phrases from various fighters.Gameplay: The game hasn't really changed from the previous incarnations as far as controls but you can decide how you want to play: the traditional Wiimote/Nunchuk combo, Wiimote sideways NES-style, the Classic Controller or a Gamecube one. The moves are still relatively similar with minor changes according to the controller. Once you get the hang of how to fight, it's just a case of choosing your fighters. And like a lot of sequels, it adds and adds though that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. With returning favorites like Link, Mario and the Ice Climbers, we also get newbies like Sonic, Snake and Zero Suit Samus. Some are incredibly fun to use (Meta Knight) while others don't really seem that exciting to use. Never did like the Fire Emblem guys in the last one and still don't.Game modes are a-plenty from the Classic Adventure mode to the long Subspace Emissary where you can switch to different characters depending on the next \"chapter\" and friends can even join in on the fly so it's not just a single player or multiplayer experience right to the end. You get traditional fights to tournaments to specialty stages like survival mode and plenty more so you're bound to be busy for quite awhile. And let's not forget the most anticipated part: the online feature where you can head-to-head against people hooked up to the Net. I haven't had my Wii hooked up so I can't really give any details but it sure sounds like fun.I'd very much recommend Brawl even if it's just you but to get the most out of it, it's best to play with someone. Who knows? Maybe your parents can turn out to be ***-kickers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0010EI6T2","reviewerName":"Raqel Redfox","summary":"I Might be Getting More Tom Clancy Games After This One","reviewText":"When you start the game, it takes a while to install the software and load. It took a little longer than other PS3 games I've played, but that's very minor. If your patient, you should get to playing the game.(BTW, I didn't play the first RSV) Here's a little review of what I thought of the game:--Guns: 10/10I don't know much about guns, but there's a wide selection to choose from. You have your shotguns, your machine guns, your sniper rifles, etc. and they all have different features that you would want in battle. You can also choose a gun that's equipped with a shield, which I find to be pretty useful even though it doesn't make you invulnerable. You're still vulnerable with the shield but it takes away a lot of damage. Then there are guns like sniper rifles. You can zoom in with these guns, obviously, and take out enemies that are farther away easier. I'm not going to start describing all of the categories, you get the idea.--Other Weapons: 10/10Again, I don't know much about grenades and all of that stuff but there are, again, a lot to choose from. You can easily use these weapons with the press of the circle button. There's a variety for this, too. There's one that emits smoke and covers up your movement. There's the classic grenade that just blows up. There's one that emits a dangerous smoke that damages your enemies a little. I don't know their names, but they're useful.--Character Customization: 8/10First you choose the obvious stuff like gender. Then you choose their face, their equipment, etc. You can even change the color of the equipment to match the environment (ex: woodland camo for a daylight area with some plants, black for those missions in the night, etc.). When I made a female character, there wasn't much faces to choose from and when she commanded the team to an area (\"go, go, go!\") she sounded sort of weird, like some monkey. I haven't played with a male character, so I don't know about them.--Graphics: 8/10You don't always get the feel of realism when it comes to graphics. They're well done, but I've seen better. I don't care much about graphics, though, so that's all I'm saying.--Other Actions: 10/10Other actions include hiding behind walls, using ropes to get into places, and commanding your team around. There were a lot of actions to use and I liked commanding a team of two people around. You can't do that in a lot of games.I just beat the game, and this is how I feel about it. I think it's pretty good, even if you don't have two people you can command around following you all the time. The end was pretty quick. Just shoot the guy at the root of everything, so there isn't any concept of a final boss in this game. Overall, a good buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2009"}

Now for the game....The first thing anyone will talk about this game is its graphics.  Well, they are just amazing!  The FMV movies are like the Final Fantasy movie....maybe even better.  The &quot;in-game&quot; graphics are also quite good.  It's much nicer to have great looking pre-rendered movies and great looking regular game graphics after the movies are over as opposed to the previous PlayStaion games.  Don't get me wrong....those games were nice to look at but compared to this, they're just.....old.  The characters look realistic.  The backgrounds are colorful and is a nice change of pace than FF8 or 7.  But, some character movement during the conversations are not that good and the lips don't really match the voices.Speaking of the voices....they're done pretty well.  This is a first for the game series so I was a little worried about how it would be done.  It really helps with the story because now you can hear the emotion in the characters.  I really hope Squaresoft continues with this so they can get better at it.  I was kind of getting tired of constantly reading the other games anyway when some of it is poorly translated.Now for the actual gameplay.  Final Fantasy X is really the same thing as the other games.  You have three people in a team and you run around and constantly have random battles to fight monsters.  The more you fight, the stronger you become.  You have to do this so you can fight the bosses.  Now, there are some changes to the way battles are fought from the previous games.  The ATB system is not in this game.  Instead, you have a bar on the side of the screen displaying the order of who's going to go when.  This helps a lot in battle because now you can see when the boss is going to get its turn so you can plan out your attack much easier.  Also, when you push the L1 button, you can swap in any character.  This doesn't take a turn so the character coming in can immediatly do his/her attack.  This helps in leveling up your characters because a character gets an equal portion of the experiece points for just doing one thing.  The experience points are not used as they were before though.  Instead of just gaining levels, you get points that you can use on a sphere grid.  This grid is huge and looks complicated at first but after 5 minutes, it's very easy to use.  You just follow a path and you &quot;activate&quot; little spheres that can raise your health or magic power or give you new ablities or magic powers.  Others say you can custimize how the characters fight but it's really hard to do that.  At first, you follow a given path and you then find branching paths that are locked and you need certain items to unlock them.  But it then takes a long time to get where you really want to go.  So if you want to make the main character a huge magic user, it'll take forever to get him to that part of the sphere grid.  Other than those little changes, the battle is pretty much the same.Now for the story.  The story has always been the key part of all the Final Fantasy games.  They have alwasys been long, interesting, full of surprises, shocking moments, and has some funny moments.  The good news is, FFX has a nice story.  Now, I don't think it's the best of all the games, but it's still good enough.  The main character is Tidus. He's a blizball player in the game world.  Blizball is like underwater soccer.  I won't get into the details of the story so I won't spoil anything for you but I'll just tell you it's fairly long.  It does have some dull moments at the beggining but then it gets better.  It defenetly is worthy of the name Final Fantasy.For my final thoughts, I would just like to say I slightly agree with some people saying this game is easier than other Final Fantasies.  It's probebly due to the fact you can swap in any character.  But that's not a bad thing.  The series was long due for a difference in the battle system.  But the game is not &quot;kiddy&quot; easy, it's still challenging.  But people who played the previous games will notice the change in difficulty.  But for people who have played the previous games, I just want to warn you of the following things.  There ISN'T a world map.  Instead, you just follow the path they give you.  You don't really get a chance to re-visit places until near the end of the game.  You get &quot;control&quot; of an air ship but you just select the destination and then you're there.  This is a disappointing feature in the game since you don't really have control of where you go until the end.  There are still some mini games and all the trademark FF stuff (Cid, Chocoboos...).  But I would highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in RPGs or is curious about them.NOTE TO ANYONE NEW TO THE SERIES:  You don't have to play the previous 9 games before you play this one.  The games pretty much have nothing to do with each other except for the summons, magic, and certain items and characters (EX: there's always a guy named Cid but he's not the same person).  But the story, places, and characters are always different.  Have fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2002"}

For a Final Fantasy to have so much depth and great battles (turn base beats FF12's system any day) this is the best FF on PS2.The characters work together so well and the summonings (AKA aeons, GF's, Eidolons, Espers etc...) are the best to be in a game because not only can you level them up, but you can actually choose what they do such as doing a regular attack instead of doing one massive attack and disappearing to there little summoning paradise. The levelling up system is also very good and is known as the sphere grid system. Although most characters have their own parameters and limited to learning specific abilities for masters you can teach one character every ability under the sun (except summoning which is restricted to one character) and you can switch between characters during battle. THINK OF THE POSSIBILITIES!!!Some people have said that the side quests are a down side to the game. I disagree completely, although there is no exact plot based storyline there are many things to do (some of the secret bosses are so hard you'll spend hours training until you can take off 99,999 in every hit...I know that's 90,000 more than usual you can take off isn't that great?) as well as many secret collecting quests and one of the most addictive mini game ever (ever heard of blitz ball?) where you buy and transfer players to great the ultimate underwater ball masters.Now I know, I know these games aren't as great as the PSone titles, but this game is definetely worth getting if you have money and a weirdly large amount of spare time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2008"}

Do you like Indiana Jones? Do you like James Bond? How about Casablanca? How about the classic Private Eye stories full of mobsters and dames? Crimson skies is a flying game backed by a superb action-adventure story line, and yes it's worthy of comparison to the above. Note: I don't have XBox Live, so this review is entirely based on the singleplayer. That said, I love this game enough to give it 5 stars for singleplayer alone. Live is the super atomic icing on the cake. And I'll try to keep this pretty much spoiler free.The story(10/10): You are Nathan Zachary, a former playboy who met unfortunate circumstances (along with the rest of the nation) and is fighting his way back to the top. Along the way, you form a rag-tag band of air pirates as you explore this strange quasi-America and unravel a mysterious plot.The immersion factor(10/10): Amazing. From the moment the intro cutscene pops up, you're going to be completely immersed. Segments like this do tons to push the story, and you're going to love savoring every moment of them. You're quickly thrown into the fray as you hop into the pilot seat. This game makes you remember why you always wanted to be a plane/ bird/ pilot/ superhero/ mobster/ pirate/ (you get the idea) as a kid.Controls(9/10): The first \"level\" is a mini-tutorial that's quick and fun. Controls are super natural and goals are (almost) always extremely clear, so you have tons of time to enjoy flying and rarely have to spend time wondering about objectives.Value(9/10): The singleplayer is long enough to please and worth every moment. I'm not even finished yet, and I would be 100% content if the game was only as long as I've played to. Very nice. There's not much replayability aside from collecting more tokens or exploring more areas, but for some (like me) it'll be more than enough to warrant a few more games.Overall: This game is FUN. The story needs to be a movie yesterday. The controls can be picked up instantly, but there's plenty of room to grow in skill. The gameplay ranges from frantic dogfights to free-form exploration. Yes, you will find yourself just skimming a lake to see the water splash on the camera, or buzzing through a canyon to test your skills. The combination of graphics, control, and gameplay combine for what may be the best flying experience ever. Sure, die-hard sim fans will gripe about the realism. But do you ever really want too much realism in an action-adventure? I think not.Bottom line (9.5/10): I think this game is going to start showing up on a couple \"Top games of all time\" lists. Not THE top game, but definately not far.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2004"}

I was shocked to see that the remote comes with a the glove and strap and batteries which is awesome! Aside from that the game is another fine addition. It is bascially a training game where you play nine games to test your skills with the remote and see how good you have control over it. The games are really fun. The price of 49.99 is just right because you are really paying for the game and the remote is free. Frankly, I did it more for the remote but when I played the game I knew it was a great buy!

{"product_name":"B003EH0BQ4","description":"","reviewerName":"The Gifted One","summary":"Nintendo Reconquers the Gaming World with a Vengeance","reviewText":"Though I had been a Nintendo fan since the original NES, the less than stellar N64 and Gamecube had diminished my faith in the company (as you can see in my older Gamecube reviews).  They had allowed Sony to come in and takeover the market with its Playstation brand.  However, Nintendo decided to go back to the drawing board and released a monster of a system that would separate them from the rest of the industry.  Enter the Wii.I was initially skeptical of motion controls as I had seen it attempted before in gaming but Nintendo hit the right spot.  They included a copy of the mega-popular Wii Sports with every console.  Wii Sports contained various easy to pick up and play, yet enjoyable sports games.  For the first time ever, my mom, girlfriend, or any of my non-gamer friends can gather around the TV and enjoy a videogame together.  The motion controls aren't 100% accurate but they are good enough to get the job done.  At first Wii Sports was the only game I owned for the Wii but as time passed more major releases came out.  Now there are many great games such as Mario Kart Wii, Mario Party 8, New Super Mario Bros., and my personal favorite, Super Smash Bros. Brawl.  All of these games are highly accessible to all types of people and provide a group gaming experience that the rival Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 are unable to match.  When I have friends over they always want to play the Wii.Another bonus for the Wii is the Wii Store.  Here you can purchase several older titles from past Nintendo systems.  From Mario 64 to Mike Tyson's Punchout, all the popular titles are here.  Since buying many of these titles can be rather expensive over time, I only picked up my absolute favorites.Now no system is without its faults.  So I'll go into those of the Wii.  Most faults will be in comparison to its rival consoles, the PS3 and 360.  The biggest difference is the graphics.  The other systems are capable of displaying games in high definition (720p/1080p), while the Wii is limited to enhanced definition (480p) at best.  The Wii also is the only one of the three systems to not include a built-in hard drive for storage.  The last major difference is the online.  The Wii has online play but the interface is not quite as fluid or user friendly as those on the PS3 and Xbox 360.  My only other knock on the Wii is the price of the controllers.  The controller consists of the Wii-Mote and and Nun-Chuk.  The Wii-Mote runs for $40 and the Nun-chuk for $20 so you're looking at $60 total for a controller.  A little on the expensive side.  While not a personal complaint of my own, I do notice many gamers complaining about the Wii's third party(non-Nintendo) titles, or lack thereof.  Major titles like Call of Duty MW2, Assassin's Creed, and Grand Theft Auto simply pass over on the Wii.  While it would always be nice to have a larger selection of games, the Wii is meant to provide a different type of gaming experience than the PS3 and 360.  For people who want those kinds of games, I think it's best to have both a Wii and either a 360 or PS3.  Most Wii owners seem content with Nintendo's own titles for the system and don't seem to care for most of the 360/PS3 library.  This is also why I don't judge the Wii so harshly for missing some of the features I listed above that the other systems have.Finally, on to this specific Black Wii bundle.  When I heard of this bundle's release, I sold my old Wii on eBay and purchased the black one here on Amazon.  This bundle includes all of the things that the original Wii had except you now get Wii Sports AND Wii Sports Resort.  I have yet to play Wii Sports Resort (been playing Super Smash Bros), but I've heard it builds upon the fun of the original Wii Sports.  I was mainly excited for the new color.  Everything else in my entertainment center is black, the HDTV, the PS3, my stereo and speakers, so that white Wii stood out like a sore thumb.  Now it's in matching shiny black and fits in perfectly.  This is a great bundle for only $199 and I highly recommend it to all gaming fans.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2010"}

I'm not going to repeat all the awesome things about this game, because they are in every review you read. I will tell you that all of the DLC IS on the disk, and all four of them are VERY VERY EASY to install. Each download took about 5 minutes, so that really is not that bad. The controls are super easy learn and you have the option to change them up to your liking (which I did). I personally like the cartoonish type graphics and they are very crisp and clean. It is an open world and you can do plenty of exploring for loot - which is what I do. There are plenty of enemies around, and they seem pretty smart. They duck and dodge and hide behind cover, so it's not too easy to take them out. I have played this game for about 4 hours now, and have already gone through about 15 different weapons!! Since I try to loot everything, I keep maxing out on my ammo, so there seems to be plenty of that to go around. This game is soo much fun, that I have actually put BioShock on the back burner until I finish this one up!!! I have yet to play any of the DLC, so I cannot comment on that. Plus, I'm not really into the multiplayer, so again, I cannot comment on that either. But the campaign has been a awesome so far, and I would recommend this game if you are into FPS and/or RPGs. I think $30 is worth the price, and I've seen that this game has 40-60 hours of gameplay. Enjoy and good luck!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2012"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"Atmospheric and compelling with a strong sense of freedom.","reviewText":"The city of Dunwall and its surrounding territories are ruled by the Empress Kaldwin, a fair and strong ruler. When she is assassinated and her daughter Emily kidnapped, her bodyguard Corvo Attano is held responsible and imprisoned. After six months, a brutal new regime under the Lord Regent has been established and the city placed in a state of fear. When Corvo is rescued by loyalists to the old regime, he is given the tools to carry out a series of missions aimed at removing the Lord Regent, rescuing Princess Emily and restoring justice to Dunwall. But a virulent plague and uncertain loyalties amongst the various factions make Corvo's job a lot harder as he must decide to take the path of blood-soaked vengeance or striking surgically from the shadows.Dishonored is a first-person action game developed by Arkane Studios, with several of the developers of the Thief, Deus Ex and Half-Life franchises working on it. It is a richly atmospheric game which, refreshingly, rewards you for avoiding violence, chaos and killing (though still allowing you to pursue that course if you really want to).The game places you in the role of Corvo, a bodyguard-turned-secret agent. You have a variety of tools at your disposal to carry out missions, including magical powers (the ability to blink - teleport short distances - is essential) and equipment including crossbows with sleep darts to knock out foes. You can also knock out unsuspecting enemies with sneak attacks and, if really necessary, use firearms and swords for direct combat. You can also use your magical powers to possess other creatures (including human characters) for brief periods. Each mission is set in a substantial area of the city of Dunwall, with you able to scale buildings using your powers and hide in the shadows from unsuspecting guards, or try a frontal assault option and wade through rivers of blood on your way to your objective. However, using violence and killing people increases the amount of chaos present in the city, which affects the number of guards (and rats) on later levels, and their alertness.Dishonored's biggest success is its setting, with Dunwall being a grimy industrial city with a tech level more like Victorian England than a traditional high fantasy location. There are echoes of steampunk and China Mieville's world of Bas-Lag in the setting, which is a fascinating place to explore. There are also numerous books, posters, notes and audio logs dotted around the city which unveil its history in some depth and add to a feeling of immersion in the game. The depiction of grimy tenement blocks, rich manor houses and immense official structures (such as prisons, fortresses and fortified lighthouses) is remarkable, giving the game a tremendous sense of place. These settings also reward exploration, with Corvo often able to find bonus items and cash by thoroughly exploring every area rather than blitzing straight through.The game's freedom has been its main talking point, with players having multiple paths to victory. This is true to a large degree, although there are still only a finite number of ways to proceed. The game is open enough to allow for two or three playthroughs using different styles (to unlock the several different endings), although arguably the game's freedom is not sufficient to justify more than that. With no multiplayer, the game's long-term replayability may be in doubt, though the (often difficult-to-achieve) achievements do help with that issue.The writing and the characterisation in the game is fairly solid, and there's much amusement to be gained by eavesdropping on conversations from the shadows or spying through keyholes (sometimes learning something valuable that opens up new ideas and objectives). The game gives out an achievement for 'ghosting', which is not only getting through the game without killing anyone but getting through the game without anyone being aware you were even present. Achieving this is highly satisfying. The game also allows you to complete it without ever having to kill anyone, even assassination targets, which is an improvement over the recent Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which was impossible to complete without killing at least three mid-game bosses.The game is well-paced, with missions taking anything up to three hours apiece to carry out if you are thoughtful and methodical. There have been complaints by some players about the game being too short, although to complete the game in much less than eight hours or so is only possible if you take the frontal assault option, which seems to be missing some of the point of the game. For my first playthrough I took a non-lethal course, methodically exploring each mission to start with and then picking up the pace in the later missions (where there is a much greater sense of urgency to events). This led me to completing the game in just under twelve hours, a very satisfactory amount of game for my money (and also leaving several other endings and playstyles available to be explored).Dishonored (****) is an intelligent and atmospheric game which gives the player a lot of freedom in how they choose to approach it and what they want to get out of the game. Surveying a target from a rooftop, coming up with a plan to get in without being seen and executing that plan successfully is great fun; when the plan goes awry and having to come up with a new idea on the fly even moreso. The game does falter a little towards the end, with a sequence set in a flooded part of the city going on a bit too long and the player being railroaded into the nearest thing the game has to a boss fight, but overall this is a rich and compelling game experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003O6E5OE","description":"","reviewerName":"stevie","summary":"Why did I buy this?","reviewText":"I bought it because Toys R US was offering a $15 dollar off deal and the improvements seemed legit.I have been an above average supporter of madden. I own 04-07 for ps2. I bought 08 on ps3 and was disgusted by EAs lazy port and inferior visuals. Bought 09 because they fixed this for ps3 but stopped playing after awhile because it wasnt as much fun as it could be. By that year, I realized what a joke next gen madden had become. I quit buying them. I only played one game at Walmart. So I never bought 10 or 11 and from what is sounds like I didnt miss much. My complaints of next gen madden are similar to everyone elses. I hated the weird/slow run animations, terrible graphics, cheap AI, and generally boring experience. Well, I played the demo and all of these things were fixed and I was pretty happy and surprsied. The throws felt a lot snappier with a nice speed to them. The scrambling and running were a lot better looking with foot planting and a good sense of speed. So I bought the game and ultimately now feel dissapointed. Why?1. The single player gets boring. I dont know what it is. Its either too hard or too easy and every match feels the same no matter what team you are playing against. THis is probably due to the fact that only high profile players look like themselves. Everyone else mine was well be rosie o donnell because there not enough close. MLB the show runs laps around madden in this way and NBA 2k12 is better to.2. New team entrances are a joke. I can't believe EA hyped these up so much. They are the same every damn time and add nothing to the game. The camera angles also look like tv, but not because they are the same exact angles EVERY TIME.3. Franchise mode is improved, but almost ruined from the awkward menu system and the improvements are not as fun as they sound. Firstly, the menu works where there is normal menu so you click on something say rosters. Well, in older games (and every other game ever made) this goes to a seperate screen where it shows your options. Here, it opens another menu in the main menu! This dosnt sound so bad, but it becomes somehwat of a chore flipping through all the options which you will do a lot in franchise. You can press R2 and L2 to switch between the main menu items. If you just press down, it will automatically go through the sub menus. But even with R2 it just feels slow. Ok so awkward menus arent so bad. Well some of the improvements are just no fun like the 75 man roster. Really, this just makes more work for you. They make it sound great cuz you can have more players on your team in pre season. However, most of these players you have are suck players you would never want anyways. As the pre season goes on, you have to make a certain number of cuts each week. Its just a chore you have to do as you scroll through your roster cutting the fat out. The game teases you with this mode by giving players a potential rating. Hey they could be good!!! Well some players dont have this so you dont know what their potential is. However, they may have a good rating, but these fluctuate every cut week. All in all, the mode is made to keep extra players to find that diamond in the rough, but its so simplistic and left up to chance, its just not fun and becomes a franchise duty. After that I dont know about the franchise, I never tried the free agency bid because the game itself is not that much fun to play.4. The game is not that much fun to play....alone. But the online is downright frustrating at times. Be ready to deal with madden cheasers who call the same play over and over. Fast players are always the best and the game becomes  button mashing fest calling audibles to set up your defense to cover flats and slants.5. gameplay is weird. Throwing the ball is near impossible with average qbs. Ball never goes where you want it to. Its never high enough (jumping linebackers still present) and too many long throws go out of bounds. The running is improved but not amazing.I realized how much i didnt really like this game after renting nba 2k12. I know its an entirely different sport, but these are sport simulators and 2k12 (mlb the show) are just way ahead of madden. That is the truth. The graphics in madden are improved, but still not as good as 2k12 or the show (ps3 version also looks more washed out than xbox, another port). There is no such difference in the nba version for ps3. The comparisons between nfl 2k5 and madden are inevitable but warranted. NBA 2k12 was developed by the same publisher and design team as NFL 2k5 was. So just look at NBA 2k12 and image that in football form and how good it would be. Then, look at madden 12. You have your answer to how good this game is.P.S. I have this game a fun rating of three because it does have its moments especially if you could play with a friend. However, nfl 2k5 is still fun to play to and I also have that game. I ultimately regret buying this though despite the deal i got on it. Its just not that much fun after awhile when you realize where football games should be at this point.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2011"}
