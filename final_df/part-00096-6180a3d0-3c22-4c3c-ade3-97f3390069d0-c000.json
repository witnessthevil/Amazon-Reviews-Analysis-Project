This is an amazingly beautiful game graphically and for game play.  We had given up on the Assassin's Creed franchise after the 3rd installment and vowed to never purchase another installment.  Luckily, I was offered this game for a review and am glad that it was available!Explore beautiful cities/locales while trying to earn respect from the other pirates.  Where the third installment was lacking, this one picks right up and allows you to play the way that YOU want.  Go on a mission or continue searching; whichever way you want to go you finally can.  It is exciting and graphically gorgeous.  All the adventures that were tedious, drawn out and lacking from the third one are here and waiting to challenge you.Highly recommend to mature gamers that love to be immersed into the games that they play.

This is one of the best \"Zelda\" games ever.  One huge thing that stood out to me was the controls.  (You will need Wii motion plus to play this game, but I guess that is no issue if you buy the bundle.)  The controls use motion really well in this game.  Link's arm actually follows the Wii remote, so you have nearly complete control of his sword.  Plus, the motion is used for other things like aiming, throwing things, and so on.  The motion's not always perfect, but it's still wonderful.  (It does get out of alignment, but centering it again is simple.)  The motion makes this one of the most fun games I've ever played.  They make really good use of the motion, such as making you have to hit certain enemies at a certain angle, so you're not just randomly swinging the remote side to side like you might do in other games.  I just love being able to do what I want with the sword.And that is not all.  I love the music in this game.  It is apparently fully orchestrated, so it sounds really good.  The graphics are more colorful and less realistic than \"Twilight Princess\", which I think is good, but some people may not like it as much.  This game also has a more interesting story than many of the others, I believe, and I very much liked the characters.  The game starts out on an island in the sky called Skyloft, but after a short time, you explore the land beneath the clouds.  There are three areas beneath the clouds, but there's a lot to do.  The game took about 52 or 53 hours for me.One more thing to mention.  I heard there's a glitch in the game that makes you unable to continue.  If you get this glitch, there's some free save data update you can download on the Wii Shop Channel to fix the problem.I would really recommend this game.  I loved almost everything about it, and it's become one of my favorite.When it comes to the extras you get with this bundle, there is a very lovely gold Wii motion plus remote and an orchestra CD that has 8 songs.  Apparently, you don't need to buy this bundle for the CD, though.  I think all the first copies of the game come with the CD (which is good, considering the bundle is so expensive now).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B006MBZZSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Tim Janson","summary":"Surprisingly entertaining","reviewText":"Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 is the sequel to 2010's Hyperdimension Neptunia (oddly enough) and is an odd blend of RPG and sexy anime action with a little bit of old school console gaming tossed in.  The storyline is a continuation of the first game which I admit to not having played although I didn't feel it hindered being able to jump right into this one.  You have to come to the rescue of the land of Gamindustri (okay, say it with me Game Industry) and save the CPUs (Console patron Units) from the evil group known as ASIC (Arfoire Syndicate of International Crime).  Ya...there's a lot of that kind of stuff in the game.  But at its core it's a nice little smirkish take on the gaming industry as a whole so I give credit to the developers Compile Heart and Idea Factory, and the publisher NIS America for employing a good sense of humor about the whole affair.IF and Compa arrive in Gamindustri to find Neptune . IF represents Idea Factory while Compa represents Compile Heart.  With me so far?  They manage to free Nepgear and together they must locate the mascots of the landmasses, who can provide the power to assit the captive CPUs. They, along with the other CPU candidates eventually join Nepgear's party, and together attempt to free the captive CPUs.  Silliness of the plot aside, and it is seriously silly but also a lot of fun, HN MK2 is an interesting little hybrid RPG.You move about the world through an old-style map that might take you back to the days of the original NES system, visiting various cities and exploring dungeons.  Cities are where you can buy and sell weapons, armor, and items for any character in your party.  As you progress through the game, even more items become available which can aid your characters in a variety of important ways such as increasing your defenses, attacks, HP, movement.  I was surprised at the level of item options that were available.Chirper (a play on Twitter) is your communications system.  This basically allows you to listen in on conversation between NPCs.  These can often be pretty mundane and tend to slow the game down but it's a necessary evil to discover random events that can help your party.  Guilds are located in each town that offer quests for the party that involve actions like defeating a certain monster or foe or collecting items.  Successfully completing the quest nets you a reward.The combat system is also an ode to RPGs of days gone by.  First of all combat is turn-based.  Yep you head me right, turn-based RPG combat.  Told you it was old school!  When its your turn your party members can move about the area up to the max of the movement points or perform a range of varied attacks.  These take the form of combo attacks that are performed with different button presses, attacks that can reduce the opponents guard meter, as well as finishing attacks.  On top of that, characters also have an SP gauge, which increases whenever they deal or take damage as well as when they end their turn. SP is used to activate special skills, such as healing spells and damaging techniques.  Combat is a lot of fun although quite easy.  Honestly the challenge is minor league at best.HN MK2 excels in its cartoon/Anime style graphics.  The game definitely earns an M rating with its skimpy costumes and highly suggestive comments, but it's all more cutesy and mature when it comes right down to it.  This isn't a game for everyone but certainly if you're an Anime fan or fan of RPGs from days long past, Hyperdimension Neptunia MK2 can offer a solid 20 - 30 hours of gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0044TD9HY","description":"","reviewerName":"Marcus Fenix","summary":"Awesome expansion","reviewText":"After finishing Red Dead Redemption main game I wanted more, so I decided to pick a copy of this game at another retailer. This is another full story, related with the original story, but completely different, like in a parallel universe to call it that way. Uncle has become infected with this zombie plague and infected John Marston's wife and kid, so John decides to tie them (wife and kid and not kill them), and leave them locked at home until he finds a cure.John needs to travel the same RDR world but infested with zombies and help survivors on each town and clear them out, while learning what is causing this plague and how to erradicate it. There is a main story, side quests and more stranger missions. This expansion is tougher than the original RDR because:1. You cannot fast travel unless you have cleared a town and as long as it remains on a \"SAFE\" status.2. Zombies can only be killed with headshots or by burning them with fire. You have very limited ammo, and there are no stores. Dead Eye is very very important on this expansion to survive, to make accurate shots.3. Unlike RDR where enemies try to shoot you but they protect themselves to not be killed, zombies do not care about getting killed, so all will jump at you. Need to have a horse to move faster than then4. Survivors really help you to kill them, if you help them. If you shoot at any of the survivors, they will also try to kill you.5. Great new weapons like the torch and tomahawk6. Great new horses (4 apocalypse ones), War horse (surrounded by fire) is awesome, because you can burn whatever you touch with it7. Single player is a whole brand new story (8 to 10 hours to beat). That is the lenght of many other top games available and this is just an expansion.8. Include all multiplayer maps9. You can play without the need of having the original RDR disc.10. Extremely fun and scary at the same time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

It was long enough to more than satisfy me and the graphics were really nice, although I do have a couple complaints.The characters are not very in depth, with the exception of Jansen. The rest of the characters are pretty dull in personality.Also, I don't feel that there was enough strategy.The only system of battle tactics that's basically needed to win consists of offensive and defensive buffing and powerful black magic spells. The hardest battles were few: like the snake at the beginning of the game, and the boss of the labyrinthe temple(whatever it was called). The battles were challenging, but the basic strategy never really changed, and the battles were overall kind of boring. All the spells were unoriginal and nothing more than light shows. I found the temple near the end of the game super tedious, and I was relieved when I finally found my way through that ridiculous maze. The biggest thing that let me down is the last boss fight. I fought him for what seemed like an hour or more, but he really didn't put a dent in my HP at all. It was so easy it was just dumb, but yet I'm still fighting for an hour through numerous cut scenes of rising tensions, waiting for the hard part, on the edge of my seat...but it never came. He just died. How stupid!I gave this a 4 because it was intriguing for the most part all the way through the game, with several interesting twists, and the ship reminded me of FF8, which I love. Definitely a time consumer, and that is NOT a bad thing at all. I do recommend this game for any rpg fans.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00004S9AF","reviewerName":"The_Scrutiny","summary":"You really haven't bought this game yet?","reviewText":"This is one of those games that gets mixed reviews from critics but great reviews from users. Where to begin? First let me say that I'm not an idiot who carelessly gives out perfect scores. But this game is just so good, it deserves it.Combat:This is a turn-based game with an innovative combat system. You can have 3 members in your party. When it's your turn, you attack, defend, use items, or transform into Dragoons (more on this later). The attack system is really the innovative part. You time input of the X button as rotating squares align with the center square on screen. If the timing isn't perfect, your combo stops. You keep up the perfect timing until your combo is finished. With every 20 perfect combo you pull off-called \"additions\"-your addition gets stronger. The perfect timing sounds hard, but it's really not. It just takes a little practice, and seeing your addition play out on screen is always fun. There are anywhere from 3 to 7 additions for each character, and you switch out additions whenever you feel like it. There's plenty to master here with the number of playable characters. You later gain the ability to transform into a Dragoon, a flying warrior capable of performing magical attacks. In this state your attack and defense power increase, and you can level up your Dragoon Level in addition to regular level. You have a threat indicator above you that shows when you'll engage in battle. It increases in threat level as you move around and the screen fades to battle. Some might find this annoying, but I liked having the chance to get stronger.Format:You play from a sort of backed-away view. It's third person, but not zoomed in like with Uncharted or Dead Space. You travel from area to area via the world map. Once you know what your objective is, you just go to the right area and go from there.Environments:You'll encounter everything under the sun: from underwater settings to expansive deserts. And every place is extremely diverse with its own interactions. In a dragon's lair, you'll climb spiderweb-like strings. On a snowy mountain, you'll slide down slopes. In the desert, you'll get sucked into sand-whirlpools. Then there's of course the cities to visit. Each city has its own feel; you can enter shops, houses, castles, hotels-you name it. The developers were really imaginative with everything.Graphics:Outdated by today's standards, but impressive for its time. You can still make out figures, so it's not too bad. Personally, though, I don't play games for their graphics.Story:Very well written. It starts off as a simple rescue-the-damsel-in-distress but evolves into so much more, and I really can't give away too much plot detail. Just know that there are a couple plot twists and that along the way you'll meet new party members that you'll come to know and love. This is one heck of a 4-disc story.Quests:There's plenty of things to do to occupy your time. Aside from the main quest, there's a few side quests that include freeing souls, battling an evil wizard, hunting a wolf, and collecting Stardust for items. Then there's even special enemies that drop special items. These are unusual foes you'll encounter on the world map that involve using a different battle strategy.Gripes:As I've said, the graphics aren't the best, but put yourself in the year 2000 and they're mind-blowing. Another minor thing is that the voice acting is absolutely dreadful. But take heart, there are maybe 3 scenes in the ENTIRE game that use voice acting.Overall:An incredibly awesome experience. It spans the length of 4 discs, is immensely fun to play, and is more than worth the $6 it costs on PSN. Do yourself a favor and play this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2013"}

Granted i may not be 6 to 11 years old again, but it definitely is a pure platforming experience that brings me back a long time ago(I was 1 years old or so when the SNES was out). Enough about my past, when i first started the main menu screen, i could not help but to love it, the graphics were High Definition even though i do not possess a LCD or plasma screen(it probably would be 10X more beautiful) with Kirby turning into a cute car and waving at the screen in a few seconds or so.The difficulty of the game is largely criticised(or so ive heard) because of how it is not in the league of Super Mario difficulty, and i am here to say that is not the case, yes it is easy to finish because you never die, but it does not mean you will not go back and see if you can better your collection of beads, and items etc. In a sense it is for younger children, but it can be challenging for adults who use to play old games like this, or adults who have not really played video games because the controls are simple and rewarding at the same time. This is fun on Co-op and is especially fun for the family, there is no violence in this game to be honest it is just a pure exciting game for children and adults.The levels in Kirby's Epic Yarn, is kind of set up like Super Mario World, or Donkey Kong Country in the sense that the levels are divided and you have to play the 1st level to go to the next, the basic formula of Nintendo Success. I am a little bit sad on the fact that there are six worlds, i wish there was two more because i really liked the game that much and it would auctully have made it more fun, but that is just my opinion overall.To me this is probably one of the games that at E3 people at first did not know what else to think, and Kirby fans were probably a little bit scared due to the fact it has been a long time since a legit Kirby game came out, but afterwards when all is said and done and it came out, i believe all Kirby fans,Casual Fans, and even hardcore Nintendo fans are enjoying this all the way.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-15-2011"}

Here, we have the opportunity to buy this as well as the never-released before in the US Final Fantasy V, along with bonus features, for 40 dollars!The games certainly lack the graphical polish of the games of today.  But that is irrelevant - they offer great gameplay, great music, and most importantly, great stories.  It is rather obvious that FF 6 is the more sophisticated of the two games, but FF 5 has its own charms.  In particular, anyone who has played Final Fantasy Tactics will recognize the job system.FF 6 represented a new path for Square in the RPG department.  There was a focus on more mature themes and, unlike most other RPGs, there was no main character.  Their stories interwove wonderfully and seeing how the characters related to each other was one of the highlights of the game.  The gameplay is solid - each character offers their own distinct traits for use during combat, unlike the later FFs (i.e., 7 and 8) and there is an incredible amount of stuff to do in this game.  The music is also considered by many to be the best of the FF series.FF 5 was also a great game.  While it lacked the in-depth characters and the complexity of the next FF, it does excel in all those areas nevertheless.  Plus this game has Gilgamesh.  It's worth playing just to see Gilgamesh.The bonus materials included on the discs are also excellent.  There wasn't much for FF5, except for the introductory CG sequence (and maybe the ending, I'm not sure).  As for FF6, they added a section where you can see dozens of pieces of artwork for the remake of the game, as well as convenient tables of skills and monsters in the game.The additional music CD isn't great, but it doesn't detract from the quality of the set at all.  If you're one of those that got started on the Final Fantasy series through 7 or 8, be sure to check this set out.  It's top notch.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2001"}
{"product_name":"B000038ABO","description":"Parasite Evetells the story of Aya Brea of the NYPD on a case involving mass  spontaneous human combustion, mutating animals, and the mitochondria revolution. Sound fun?  Confusing?Parasite Eveis both.It begins when Aya is attending an opera at Carnegie Hall. The soloist bursts into song and the  audience bursts into flames. Somehow, Aya is the only attendee who isn't affected. Not  surprisingly, she wants to know what's going on. This curiosity, coupled with her duties as a police  officer, grows into a full-scale investigation.Parasite Eve's mechanics are simple, yet elegant. From combat to level advancement, the  game runs easily and smoothly, making it ideal for someone new to role-playing games (RPGs).  Experienced RPGers should still enjoy it for its brilliant storyline.Technically speaking, the game's graphics and sound are good, but not spectacular. The full-motion  cutscenes are superbly done.Parasite Eveis a good game--there's just not enough of it.  While it doesn't feel crammed together, the story seems to resolve quickly.

As far as I am aware it seems that this game is a sequel of sorts to that novel, and alothough I do not believe the novel has been translated to English there is a movie based upon it that has been released state side by ADV films. The film is subtitled and not very good but does help to add more depth to the \"universe\" of Parasite Eve.I won't write much about the story, it is sufficent to say that the story is the driving force of this game which is a lot of fun, but like with other \"experimental games\" not without its flaws.The first flaw that this game has is that is controls seem a bit un responsive, and Aya moves very stifly. This game could have benifited from the motion capture techneques that were later used on Final Fantasy VIII. The next flaw is that the random encounters simmer down and eventually stop. You can \"wip out\" all enimes in a particular area making it hard to level up to riduculous levels of speed an power. Random encounters are a pain as it is, but if you're going to have them let me have enough of them to get up to level 99 and wipe the floor with the end guy.However the weapon mods are interesting, the overall gamplay is very innovative and over all this game was great. It is just a shame it was so short and impossible to make Aya an all powerful unstopable juggarnaut like you can with other RPGs.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2002"}

Its shape is very similar - which is good.  I really enjoyed my last DeathAdder.  I like the fluidity, motion, feel.  I use it for my work as well as for gaming.  It works well except for one very annoying flaw.  This latest DeathAdder is VERY sensitive to any static electricity.  It cuts out on me several times a day and has to &#34;reboot&#34; and be re-detected by the computer.  This process takes about 30 seconds or so, but is VERY annoying - especially when in the middle of something.  My last DeathAdder did not have this problem.  This most commonly occurs if I get up to get a copy off the printer or run another errand and return to the computer and grab the mouse to continue to work.  The cursor disappears and then about 30 seconds later I hear the beep of the computer detecting some hardware and then reloads the driver.  I am getting into the habit of touching the metal frame of my workstation before I touch my mouse - but even that doesn't always work.  This is the only mouse I have used that has had this problem with static electricity.  I installed my old DeathAdder as an experiment (even though the scroll wheel is worn out) and it didn't fail from static once.  I'm not sure what they changed about this DeathAdder over the last version, but it is a flaw that has forced me to knock several stars off the rating.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-04-2014"}
{"product_name":"B001ASJIS6","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"For a game that doesn't let you die, it's fun and great to look at","reviewText":"This is the first Prince of Persia game for the PS3, only it's a brand new Prince, whose name we once again do not find out. And no, you can't die in this game... more on that later. Set in a completely different time period from the Sands of Time trilogy, a young man who doesn't appear to be an actual prince loses his pack donkey carrying his most recent collection of riches from a previous adventure (amusingly, the donkey's name is Farah). After then getting himself lost in a sandstorm and falling down a canyon, the Prince comes across the beautiful Elika, an actual princess on the run from her seemingly pissed off father, the Mourning King, and his guards. After battling some of the guards and then helping Elika arrive at a temple built inside an enormous tree, the Prince battles Elika's father, who then ends the fight by cutting down a small, glowing white tree in the temple which brings forth an onrush of Corruption, spreading across the kingdom of the Ahura and turning it into a cesspool of tar-like darkness. Despite his tendency to readily admit that he hates the situation he's been involved in and would love nothing more than to find his gold-carrying donkey and head for the hills, the Prince agrees to assist Elika in healing the fertile grounds of the corrupted (yet otherwise empty) kingdom and stop the source of the spreading Corruption, the dark god Ahriman.Imprisoned thousands of years ago by his brother Ormazd, Ahriman is attempting to get loose from his prison, and Elika is determined not to let that happen. When the adventure begins, the Prince and Elika have the freedom to begin their journey in either of the four large areas dividing the kingdom, each of them now under the rule of Ahriman's four most powerful Corrupted: the Hunter, the Alchemist, the Concubine, and the Warrior. Half of the game revolves around hunting down these four Corrupted beings and eliminating them, but you'll battle each one about five times each; that's 20 boss battles, not counting the ones you have against the Mourning King as he himself succumbs to Ahriman's Corruption. These enemies all provide their own specific challenges; some are quick and tricky, some are big and can take a lot of punishment.Aside from them, you'll fight a few regular Corrupted soldiers who initially don't offer much of a challenge, but can at times surprise you with their growing combat abilities. Still, for the most part, combat in this game is 80% boss battles, which is unusual but somehow works in this game. The combat itself is also always the Prince and Elika against a single Corrupted enemy, although at times Elika can be temporarily removed from the battle, in which case the Prince must either wake her up or free her from a trap. This game actually pulls off one on one combat pretty well, although I believe that bumping up the maximum number of enemies to 2 or even 3 would have been better in certain moments. Regardless, the Corrupted offer decent challenges and usually cannot be beaten with simple button-mashing, requiring a specific move from the Prince or Elika in order to be countered: from the Prince it's either a sword strike, a grapple with his left handed metal gauntlet, or an acrobatic vault over the enemy; from Elika, well she only has her magic imbued pushes and kicks, but they're pretty cool. During regular combat, it's fun to pull off the many possible combos involving combinations of Elika's magic with the Prince's sword, gauntlet, and agility/vaulting attacks.Then there are the quick time events where the enemy performs a specialized flurry of attacks and the Prince/Elika must react to the correct button prompt and counter the attacks, or suffer damage should he/she fail. The further you are in the game, the more the Corrupted pull off these moves. As stated earlier, you can't be killed, but you still suffer penalties for letting your enemy defeat you. Should the Prince be knocked over, he has one last chance to save himself from a \"lethal\" strike, but should he fail that as well, Elika will desperately knock the enemy away with a powerful blast of magic; the Prince will get back up, but still be a little injured (his health regenerates gradually), and the enemy will regain a very large chunk of its total health, effectively making the whole battle start over again if the enemy had initially only lost a pinch of health.When you're not chasing and fighting Corrupted, you'll be exploring the vast landscape of the Ahura kingdom and collecting light seeds, glowing orbs of light that spread out over the land whenever Elika heals the fertile grounds with her magic. For the most part, in this game you have the freedom to choose in which order you explore areas and defeat bosses, so this game definitely gives you a certain taste of gaming freedom. When the Prince and Elika arrive in a Corrupted landscape, almost everthing will be covered in the inky, goo-like Corruption, and the whole area will look appropriately dark, forbidding, and overcast. When Elika heals the corresponding fertile ground, a cool scene will play with the Corruption melting away and the land coming to life with green grass, bright skies, and pools of water where there used to be pools of Corruption. You'll see this happen over and over again, but thanks in no small part to the beautifully detailed and colorful cel-shaded graphics, you won't get too tired of seeing these scenes play out... at least I didn't. There are few games in which I actually take the time to stand around for a couple of minutes and simply admire the view: the vast oceans, snowcapped mountains, towering palaces, and so on. The Prince, Elika, and the enemies all look great as well. Anyway, back to the exploring and light seeds.In traditional PoP fashion, the Ahura kingdom isn't big on floors, so the Prince will have to swing on poles, jump to ledges, climb up walls, and even slide down the sides of buildings and cliffs with his gauntlet to get to his destinations. There are also the required lever and switch pulling puzzles for the Prince to solve, but not as many as usual in PoP games. Throughout the entirety of the Prince's journey, the ever graceful Elika will be right behind him, using her own impressive agility and her magic to keep up with the Prince. Calling her an AI partner doesn't really do her justice; Elika's more of a secondary AI character. You control when she attacks and uses her magic, but she does everything else on her own. Should the Prince fall, which will happen a lot, Elika will automatically use her magic to grab the Prince from midair and quickly float back to the nearest stable platform (who needs the Sands of Time when you've got Elika, right?). So basically, this game rids the player of an annoying game over screen and sets you back only a little bit less than a standard game would for \"dying\". Elika can also teleport the two protagonists between healed areas, which cuts down on travel time and since there is a certain amount of backtracking required... well, teleporting is always good. She can also send a light beacon towards your next destination, after you've marked it on your map.After healing fertile grounds and collecting enough light seeds, the Prince and Elika will be able to access certain magic plates that will propel them to new areas previously inaccessible to them. For two of these plates, you simply press the magic/Elika button when you land on them and you bounce to the next plate or available platform. The other two actually involve careful timing and control. For one plate, pressing the magic/Elika button will have the Prince either run up and along walls and roofs to the next plate, and the other will have him grab onto Elika's shoulders and they fly to the next plate. In both cases, you only control when the Prince moves either left, right, up, or down, but you can't stop him from actually moving, so you basically have to make sure he doesn't slam into anything when running or flying (like the chariot chases in The Two Thrones). If you do, Elika will transport you to the closest stable ground, but some areas have these long \"obstacle courses\" with lots of tricky jumps, spots for wall-running, Corruption traps (tentacles and puddles), and magic plate runs. Some of theses courses have very few stable spots for Elika to drop you back onto...some don't have any at all. So if you mess up on these courses and fall, you'll have to either start from way further back or even at the very beginning of the course; see, this game isn't always that easy. One other cool and important thing about the game is the relationship between the Prince and Elika. When they start warming up to each other, they form a rather humorous team. You can initiate conversation with Elika whenever you want, and depending on the location or how far you are in the game, the Prince and Elika may either talk about their pasts, argue over what they should do next, or even play \"I Spy\" to lighten the mood.I like both characters, the Prince is kind of an arrogant jerk, but still funny and has a caring side (kind of like Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark). Elika is mostly serious and determined to complete her mission, but occasionally lightens up and shows she also has a sense of humor. It is this relationship that makes the story and the ending so memorable, as well as surprising when you see what you have to make the Prince do at the end. I'll simply say this... I never felt more strongly than I did in this game's ending that what I was doing was wrong. Plus, the ending has a MASSIVE cliffhanger. But then, the game's downloadable content called Epilogue continues the game's story after the cliffhanger. It includes two or three extra hours of much more linear and somewhat more difficult gameplay with a couple of useless extra combat moves, a new magic plate power, a new (sort of) enemy and... another cliffhanger ending, albeit a far less major one. I liked the main game, it's fun and beautiful. The Epilogue is fun too, but only if you truly liked the main game and are forgiving about repetitive gameplay like me. Some gamers will like this game, others won't. All I know for sure is that I want a sequel to this game. It NEEDS a sequel. With no sequel, we'll never know if the Prince will ever actually BECOME A PRINCE.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2011"}

Also, the final part of the final boss battle is anti-climatic, for if you use boom box and shiny super boot and three flashy hopslippers, you'll chew through the 500 hp of Bowser easily. This game doesn't have a point to battles, other then obtaining coins to buy more stickers. And the only bosses who did anything was Gooper Blooper, Kamek, and Bowser, the rest were just sort of there, unlike in other paper mario games where they did something-and thier design is not very creative, either, I mean, a giant goomba? A giant pokey? A bowser snow statue??? Play mario and luigi dream team if you want an RPG with mario that is challenging and has a good story and is creative, or Super Mario 3d land, which is a decent platformer.

The developer screwed up again, its not the first time, he went on a public forum to apologize.we where promised a much more open ended game, this game, its really not open ended at all.  You follow a set of quests, you can do them on your own time, but they are needed to further the story.  The story was lacking, uninvolving and uninteresting if you ask me.  I played the whole game and I'm still not quite sure what its about besides being a hero, save the world and all that Jazz, (or destroy it.) you can make a few choices that affect the game play, but not in any big way.  Basically, these choices change what people shout at you as you walk through town.you can ofcourse chose to be good or evil as is trendy in games now.  The armour and weapon selection I found unimpressive.  I am a huge Final Fantasy fan, they are big shoes to fill in that department I suppose, but honsetly you get most of your weapons from a shop, you can augment them with fire or lightening etc but eh... so what?The game was over before I knew it, it was only 20 hours or so long for me.  the final boss came around before I knew it.  It was fun while it lasted, entertaining enough and there was a bit of openededness as far as effecting what your character page said and what people said about you, also what bards sang about you... so that aspect was mildly enjoyable.  I wouldn't say its a BAD game, but its not a great one.  Slightly above average, its pretty, the spells are fun to look at, there is some adult content, so I dont recomend for children.  There is a brothel in the game for example, and you can have sex with your wife, (or husband if your character swings that way) it doesn't show anything but there are noises, disturbing noises...Its alright.  I say if you have the cash to spare and your that curious, go for it, otherwise save your money and get something a little more original.  ^^","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2005"}

There's a charm to Dead Air and Death Toll and No Mercy that I just don't quite feel with the new maps.  Maybe it's familiarity.

I finally had to just write it, because the game is so HUGE. This is a game you could literally play for years.First off, your character. You could literally spend an hour or more tweaking your character to fit your playing needs. There are numerous races, each with their own look, feel, strengths and weaknesses. You can be male or female. You have a TRILLION options to customize the eyes, hair, cheekbones, ears, skin tone, age, nose, chin, you name it. I doubt that any two players could come up with the exact same character if they tried. It's quite impressive, and it really helps you to relate to your character.You are thrown immediately into the story. You're in a jail cell, but are allowed to escape because of political intrigue. You spend the first few hours of the game in the dark cellars beneath the castle, learning how to fight rats and other smaller critters. Soon, though, you are launched into the outer world, and what a world it is!This is truly a spectacular experience, especially if you have a large, high definition TV. The world is \"real\" - there are tons of places to go, people to interact with, sunsets to watch, forests to wander through. All characters have their own schedules, their own lives. What you choose to do is completely up to you. Join up with the soldiers- or join the mage group. Become an assassin - or carve a path completely of your own.The world you're in feels \"real\". The quests you go on are different depending on your race, your background, the things you have already done. There's no need to speed through here - the whole point is to go slowly, to develop your character and your world. There is so much complexity to this game that you could play for months and still not have explored every corner, or tried every option.The sound is just as stellar - from the voices to the background noises, you really feel like you are there in the world.Highly recommended - a must have for any RPG fan.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2006"}

Bakehorn","summary":"Mario: New and still Super","reviewText":"Changing the forumla for a Super Mario game is like making building supports out of toothpicks. It's risky, it just might work, but chances are that sticking with what you know works is a better idea for everyone. New Super Mario Bros. is just that--a new Super Mario game with a few frills and all the Mario thrills you could possibly want.New Super Mario Bros. gives you as much of a story as all of its predecessors: Mario is out to save Princess Peach, who has once again been abducted by Bowser and his son, Bowser Jr. Why a mangy pack of reptilian predators would want to kidnap a human princess has always escaped me, but for 25 years it's worked and I'm not the type to start worrying about it now.Besides, have you ever played a Mario game for its story? Even the Super Nintendo classic Super Mario RPG didn't intrigue me in terms of story as much as it did the Mario-themed gameplay and Mario style. New Super Mario Bros. has that style with the perfect recreation of the 8-Bit gameplay that spurred a platforming revolution. That platforming style has yet to be matched by anything other than...well, other Mario games.What makes New Super Mario Bros. so great is that it's as easy to play as the NES phenominon and it's got some new stuff for old-school fans and fanatics alike. While it contains the flat feeling of Super Mario Bros., it's got the bounciness of Super Mario 64 and the seemingly endless amount of secrets of Super Mario Bros. 3. The world maps of the single-player mode mimic Super Mario Bros. 3, complete with travelling Hammer Bros. and Mushroom Houses to visit. Each level found in this huge world is chock-full of jumping puzzles, enemy patrols, hidden pipes, and everything that casual and hardcore Mario fans could ask for.Mario's new platforming moves include a wall jump and a ground pound. The wall jump was made popular in Super Mario 64 and is probably the most useful manuver in this title. Not only does it allow you to reach otherwise inaccessible areas and collectible Star Coins; sometimes it really saves your [...] from plummeting through many of those annoying pits that scatter the Super Mario landscape. The ground pound (also known as the butt-stomp, butt-pound, whatever perverted name you want to use) makes a return and serves its purpose very well against Bowser Jr. and other powerful enemies that would normally take a few stomps to defeat.There are also three new power-ups to the initial line-up of Mushrooms, Fire Flowers, and Starmen. Mario can now collect Blue Shells that make him curl up into a deadly shell while dashing. He can munch on Mega Mushrooms that make him grow to the size of a tower. He can also eat Mini Mushrooms that...well, I'm sure you can guess what they do. Special mini abilities like running on water (Jesus is jealous) and floaty jumping make the Mini Mushroom a valuable commodity. Using all three of these new power-ups will allow you to find hidden paths, Star Coins, and other secrets.The graphics mimic recent Nintendo platformers like Super Mario 64 DS, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Princess Peach. Mario, Peach, Bowser, Bowser Jr., and all of the enemies are rendered in 3D polygons. The worlds that you'll jump through are mostly 2D, but of course, they're colorful and have a common theme. World 1 has a grassy plain look, while World 3 takes you to the tropics and World 6 sends you high into the mountains. Though there aren't any revolutionary movements in handheld visuals to speak of, New Super Mario Bros. looks great for what it is and is impressive for a 2D platformer anyway.The music isn't as addictive or memorable as the original title, but 18 years of the Super Mario Bros. theme being hummed and heard through cell phone ring tones is a lot to compete against. New Super Mario Bros. has a soundtrack that is very similar to Super Mario Bros. and the same sound effects you've heard since 1987. The only real differences accompany some of the newer moves, like the wall jump and the ground pound, but that's the most change you'll notice from the sound effects.Theoretically, there isn't anything wrong with New Super Mario Bros. When one grows tired of playing through the relatively short single-player game (I clocked in about five hours and completed more than 75% of the game my first time through), there is an interesting multiplayer option where Mario and Luigi run through looping stages to collect stars and defeat each other. This reminds me of the Genesis classic, Sonic & Knuckles. Also, Super Mario 64 DS's minigames make a return with a few new distractions.Though it's not perfect, New Super Mario Bros. feels like what it should. It's a perfect platformer, a great DS game, and a good Mario game. That's a descending order, and it's fitting: New Super Mario Bros. won't make you realize all over again that Mario is gaming's greatest personality (though he is), but it'll make you appreciate the steps forward in platforming and gaming as a whole. It's a fantastic game that deserves more than anything to sit in your DS library.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00004S99R","description":"To say thatShenmueis an anticipated title is an understatement;  the game made huge waves in Japan upon its release, and American gamers have  been waiting since then to see what the fuss is all about. It's a game in which  the concept itself is the selling point. What if you could portray a young hero  in a fully realized Japanese city? Would you like to participate in and  influence an over-the-top kung fu-style action-mystery flick in your living  room? What if lots of combat, cinematic flourish, detail, and a dash of romance  were thrown in?The game itself is awash in small details, crammed into a confined space. The  city of Yokusuka circa 1986 is rendered beautifully in a short series of  neighborhoods that are long on detail even if short on variety. The story itself  is ripped straight from a chopsocky flick: you portray the young hero Ryo  Hazuki, whose father (a kung fusensei, naturally) is killed before his  very eyes by a mysterious and frightening villain. Ryo must uncover the identity  of the killer and fight his way through the city in an effort to avenge this  wrongful death.Shenmue's Yokusuka might be short on space--in total, it represents maybe  a square mile--but the detail is overwhelming. You can interact with nearly  every person or object that you see; 300 citizens go about their daily routines,  and whom you encounter is as much determined by where you are as when you are  there.Much of this interaction involves combat that ranges fromDragon's Lair-style reaction tests (such as timing a button press to  dodge an oncoming car) to freeform kung fu fighting. Further, each second of  real time equals about a minute of game time, and Ryo has to be home by 11 p.m.  each evening. The game moves at a brisk pace, and each challenge or battle feels  like a race against time. Some might say that gaming doesn't get shallower than  this (you are essentially performing tasks and exploring, instead of gaming),  but the game feels like no other and is ultimately satisfying by the time that  it all ends. In this way,Shenmueis more than a game--it's an event  that's worth experiencing.--Andrew S.

I'm not dissappointed at all.  The story mode will keep you interested and its a nice setup. It will give an option on what mission is available to go on.  There is usually 3 to choose from. You can purchase upgrades for your troops and base to make them stronger and more efficient.  For example, instead of having to build a tech lab in order to make a medic, if you get an upgrade, it will give it to you right away instead of having to wait for a tech lab to be built.  The upgrades are purchased in between missions.  The other things you can do is hire mercenaries and have them sent in during a mission.  Its nothing special but its nice to have when your running low on troops and you need some right away.  The game is really nice plays exactly the original. The complaints i have about the game is the $59 price tag and the game acting. It definately should have been $49 and not $59. The game acting is not great, especially for the non important roles.  They talk like they were advertising on a commercial.  I've seen games that done way better than that.Another complaint is the drm, while i can understand they are trying to reduce piracy.  They are crippling people who dont even have internet access available.  Especially, people in the armed forces, when they are deployed.  I'm in the navy and if i installed this game when i'm on the ship, it would be useless because it requires internet activiation. I wouldn't be able to even play the single player. The really need to figure out a better way.Overall, the game is really fun to play and it shouldn't be missed out on.  I'm really glad they didn't ruin it like other companies did with other popular rts games, such as CNC4.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Wow, it's pretty","reviewText":"\"Wow, it's pretty.\"Those were the first words out of my mouth when I saw a co-worker playing his imported PSP last November. I was still a Nintendo purist when it came to handheld consoles, so I didn't give it a second look and continued to keep a blind eye on the Sony PSP.Months later, and weeks before its release, I had to have one of those pretty Sony PSPs. And months after that, I sit with my PSP headphones on and type this review on one of the most useful, entertaining, and complete gadgets I could have ever wanted.The Sony PSP isn't just a handheld game console. It's a handheld DVD player, a handheld Mp3 player, and soon (with wireless updates) a handheld web browser. If I could figure out how to heat up the insides of my PSP, I'm sure I could use the UMD disc drive and use my PSP as a toaster. It's just that cool. From a technical standpoint, there's no competition with Nintendo's DS handheld. The huge screen is crisp and clear, and is most likely the first thing that onlookers will notice as you watch Spider-man 2 or play Ridge Racer.Speaking of software, the PSP is slightly lacking in this area. Five months after its release, it has more games than the DS but fewer games worth buying. For the most part, EA Sports and 989 Sports have loaded up the library with decent-at-best sports titles. Konami has two above-average titles in Metal Gear Acid and Coded Arms. Activision released a nearly-perfect port of Tony Hawk's Underground 2 and tacked on \"Remix\" to the name for a little flavor. They even added content. If that says anything about the UMD discs and the PSP, it's that they're both impressive pieces of technology. My personal favorite game, Hot Shots Golf: Open Tee, occupies more of my time than my home consoles and sometimes my home computer. The games will really pick up later on in 2005 when games like Death Jr., SOCOM U.S. Navy Seals: Fireteam Bravo, and especially Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories release.I'm a perfect example of a skeptic who was proven wrong. The PSP and the DS shouldn't be compared (come on guys, they're completely different things), but in the end, the PSP is (once again) simply the coolest gadget I could ever imagine. What's next Sony, a portable handheld gaming console with an ATV attachment and a jumbo-jet hangar?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2005"}

It has tons of tracks, vehicles, characters, and is probably the most re-playable version of the series because there is so much stuff to unlock.  I unlocked everything in the game using a stock character and vehicle so the unlocked stuff isn't overpowering like in past games.  The unlock-able characters and carts seem well placed and often help you with your playing style.  For example you unlock the fast characters while trying to do time trials or you get the agile carts from gold on the harder tracks.This game adds bikes, which I think adds nice diversity and feels very well balanced.  The karts tend to be faster with better mini boosts from jumps and corners.  The bikes can pop wheelies to get a mini boost on the straight stretches but are more vulnerable to being thrown off balance.  My wife likes playing with karts and I like bikes, and I think she usually wins.Another feature to boost re-playability is the manual drift.  All Mario Kart games had a power-slide around corners.  In this one they give the choice of this drift being automatic or not.  If you set it to automatic you don't get mini-boosts around corners.  If you set it to manual you have to time when the slide starts but it is much more difficult than past games.  It gives experienced players something extra to work on but doesn't seem unfair when somebody can drift manually well.I always use the nun-chuck.  I can't stand using the wheel.  I haven't seen a game that gets the remote tilt steering right yet.  Maybe I'm just used to buttons after growing up with them.The one thing I hate about this game:  the AI cheats with both hands.When you get into the harder levels in the Grand Prix it will be completely normal to be hit with two or three things in a row.  For example say you're a few seconds ahead, they will hit you with a pow, red shell, and a lightning bolt in a row to keep you stopped for several seconds.  The suspicious part is how did the AI time firing the red shell so it would catch up just after you got hit with the pow?The AI will also hit you at the worst times.  Right after you go over jumps, or boosts, or right after you get a power-up, or right before you go around a corner with no railing, or just as you get to the bottom of a hill.  Now some might call it coincidence but I just played for two hours and counted to make sure.  Every time I was in 1st and hit with something it was at one of those five times.The other thing that is suspicious is if the AI slows you down enough they have saved power-ups for you so the horde will hit you three or four times to ensure you get clear back to 8th place or so.Personally, I'm sick of cheating AIs and feel there is no reason game makers should be short-cutting on such a critical part of their game, but it's become standard among games anymore.So bottom line, like I said above, if you've liked the Mario Kart series, get this one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0016BVYAM","reviewerName":"Chutzpuh \"The last PC gamer\"","summary":"Bioshock 1.2","reviewText":"Bioshock 2 comes off as little more than extra content rather than a full on sequel to the first.  Basically, the story continues 10 years after the events of the first with the protagonist being one of the hulking \"Big Daddies\" you so loved.In the end, the story is simply not as good.  It could be that the first one had a character you could almost relate to, for a while at least.  The city of Rapture was new and interesting.  As you learned the history of the city, you started to piece together an underlying plot to it all that became something very good and sinister by the end.  In this one, you play as a character that you really don't care about.  I just never felt myself getting into it at all.Bioshock didn't hit game of the year for any reason other than creativity and story.  Unimpressive graphics, sound, control, exploration, nothing amazing there.  The second had little to work with, and it didn't even use what it had well.Enough with history though, I'll try to lay out what impressed and did not impress me.Graphics:Nothing new here.  Looks exactly the same as the first.  The water looks nice, but you can see the sharp edges on the shores and you can see how non-dynamic and 2d everything really is.  Bioshock couldn't compare with the games of the time (Crysis, Timeshift) and it still doesn't years later.  If you are looking for some nice eye candy, it wont be in here.Gameplay:Control is nothing new here.  Move around with the keyboard, point with the mouse.  Works well enough for me, and I still prefer it over a controller.  The biggest issue that I hated here was the killing of quick save and quick load.  I never used the respawn chambers of the first game, with a quick load there was no need.  Take 2 must have noticed this and broke that aspect of play.  More likely though, this is an Xbox port and they simply never added that function.  After all, your escape menu is still referred to as the \"Pause\" menu.  Other obvious carryovers from the console are still evident as well.I wasn't happy with the new weapons here either.  No pistol, just the rivet gun instead.  Takes about 5 shots to take something down with it and it doesn't aim well.  No machine gun, you get a gatling gun looking thing instead, that is somehow weak and horribly inaccurate.  Many portions of the game require you to hold an area against a flood of enemies, but the lack of good powers and weapons as well as near useless traps you set makes this a terrible chore to go through every time.Install:I usually dislike talking about DRM in reviews, I leave that to the other few thousand people here.  While Windows Live is about as broken as Steam, it isn't as invasive as other options out there.  One good aspect here, you can actually play single player without creating an account and doing that little activation dance.  Unlike Steam, you can make a remote account and handle everything on your computer.  Makes me wonder what the point of this DRM is if they practically built in a work-around.This is good for me since most of my gaming these days is done on the go with a laptop.  Internet is not always there and having to try to connect to play single player is a painful and spiteful chore.Multiplayer:Broken and bad.  If you ever tried the MW2 pc multiplayer, well just think of that.  No options, slow, painful and ends for no reason.  Don't expect to get anything multiplayer for your money here.Conclusion:In the end, I can't give more than 3 stars for this lackluster performance.  For everything here, Take 2 should have released this a month after the first as an expansion.  The story is unimpressive, the graphics scales with what I expect from 3 years ago and while some of the mini-games (hacking) have changed to be faster and less invasive, most of the other gameplay was broken in the trade-off.  If quick save and quick load are taken away, something better than the re-spawn chamber needs to be used.  Even the simple checkpoint system of Halo is preferable.  Even a timed autosave would be nice rather than a save at the start of each area (aside from the manual open the menu and save one).Grab this when it goes on sale in a month or two.  I see drastic price drops in the works for this.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2010"}

Yes, the scene would seem lame and underwhelming now, but to an audience that had never seen such a dramatic death in gaming up until that point in the early 1990s, it was incredible and it was only the beginning of the death scene or scenes of loss in the game.  Back in those days, such scenes made any gamer with a soul want to take the villain, string him up the wall and swiftly introduce him to a Falcon Punch... if only they were invented yet.And yet, the story was simple if not overdone now: an evil empire, once ruled by good, turning upon the citizens of the world forcing a former hero from that empire to rise up and fight against them.  It's the quintessential story that takes you for a ride and actually has a twist or two that just can't be done again.  Along for the ride are your typical colorful cast of characters with their own stories, development, and personalities that still hold their value today.In short the story, back in those days, was second to none and would only be usurped by other legendary titles like Final Fantasy II/VI, Breath of Fire, and the legend of legends Chrono Trigger.  FFII was the game that began it all with the Japanese RPG (JRPG) story-telling and turn-based gaming, of which has now been abandoned in lieu of more real-time action-based games like Oblivion, Fallout, and Mass Effect.Indeed, FFII sported a real-time turn-based battle setup that had good flow meaning it wasn't too quick thereby making it meaningless (Lord of the Rings: The Third Age) or too drawn out making it a complete drag (Xenosaga II, Persona).  The flow of battle was just right and the music to accompany it was nothing short of legendary.Nobou Uematsu, the musical composer of FFII, is a legend of his own right.  Hell, I would say he is to Japan what John Williams, Hans Zimmer, Michael Giacchino, and Steve Jablonsky are to us Americans.  Despite working with a 16-bit console system and its musical limitations, Uematsu created one of the most famous gaming compositions of all time second only to his later masterpiece in the FF7 soundtrack.  The composition has held up VERY well over the past 20 years (has it been THAT long, REALLY?!) as it has been redone in various formats including Celtic and still is performed at various gaming musical concerts.  Even Breath of Fire and my beloved Lufia franchises couldn't hold up their music this well save for a track or two.This brings me to my overall point of how well this particular game has held up over time, which it has done more than any other game in history.  Yes, FF7 is widely considered the most popular and has spawned two spin-off games (Dirge of Cerberus not staring Martin Sheen and Crisis Core) and the film Advent Children, which was OK, but FFII has been remade and re-released an unprecedented four times (Playstation 1, Gameboy Advanced, Nintendo DS, and Playstation Portable) with its soundtrack composed in even more variations.  It IS and has always been the gold standard of RPG gaming, the one which all others are based on.  The game put then Squaresoft now Square-Enix on the map as well as Nobuo Uematsu thus creating the ever-popular Final Fantasy mythos.Granted the Final Fantasy series is not NEARLY as dominant as it used to be for reasons best suited for discussion elsewhere, but FFII made it the juggernaut that it later became.  FFII also proves to be one awesome nostalgic piece that makes us 20-something year old gamers feel like old men looking back upon the good ol' days when turn-based RPGs were the standard and the 3DO had promise (HA!).All in all, FFII holds my highest score: a 98% as there could have been just one more sidequest to top it off but... those weren't entirely invented yet... but they could have been.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2012"}

Following Sir Drake's diary you will traverse exotic locals, solve puzzles, shoot it out with thieves and modern day pirates, and do a lot of platforming; and the genius thing about Uncharted is that all these aspects work seamlessly and perfectly.First off, the cinematics, dialogue and story line are top-notch; we're talking Hollywood stuff here, stuff you would commonly see in an Indiana Jones, National Treasure, big summer blockbuster film.

Sure, there are some hitches here and there such as pop-in, but any problems you may find are miniscule compared to the insane grahical detail. We're talking Gears of War level here.Now, an ambitious game like Uncharted, which meshes three different types of gaming together could easily fall apart if the controls were shoddy, but thankfully they are buttery smooth. As far as the combat goes, Uncharted feels a lot like Gears of War. The game takes place in Third Person, so you get the whole over the shoulder view, which really compliments the combat. You can take cover behind objects, blind fire, hip fire as well as aim, and it all works really well; surprisingly well for a platformer. I honestly am blown away every time I engage enemies in this game because the action is so well done; Uncharted easily rivals Gears of War in this aspect. The platforming is done amazingly well also; Nate can grab onto various ledges, pipes and platforms, he can climb, hang, jump over objects, and it all handles really well. There is some puzzle solving, though its nothing you'll seriously hurt your brain over; but it'll still keep you engaged and keeps the game from being boring.Oh yeah, there are also some driving missions to break up the shooting and platforming. There are actually two variants; you get to drive a jeep (and also get to man its guns at one point in the game), and you get to drive a Jet-Ski. Both of these driving missions are rather fun, and they control really well.The soundtrack is very fitting for an action/adventure game, with audio cues and climaxes during intense shootouts and other action scenes. Oh, and the voice work is simply amazing; some of the best in the video game world. Nathan's witty one-liners are delivered as if they were from a top paid hollywood actor, which gives the character a realistic personality.Overall Uncharted: Drake's Forune is a must own title for PS3 owners, and its one of those games that makes you feel good about owning said system. The PS3 has a limited number of exclusives, and Uncharted is definitely one of the better ones. With superb graphics, awesome audio, a great playing experience, and an overall package that reeks of polish and professionalism, Uncharted: Drake's fortune is an instant classic.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2009"}

The graphics are great, the gameplay is fun and the sound is very good.When I got the game, I popped it in to the PS3 and after an update was at the main menu. I went through the options and stuff, and found out there could be two players. My daughter quickly grabbed a controller and decided to play as the &#34;spirit&#34;.I played as the main character, doing things like walking around and beating people up. She played as the ghost or &#34;spirit&#34; Aiden(?) and could move stuff and do other supernatural things. Basically you switch between the two characters to get things done, CIA spy stuff or teen &#34;Carrie&#34; stuff, or even saving homeless people stuff. She got really mad when I wouldn't do what she wanted me to do, but I told her I play like I want and she plays like she wants.As Aiden she can be mean and vengeful or helpful and peaceful. Once we finish the game we will have to switch parts, I want to try being a ghost and totally poltergeist that party of rowdy teens!If there was more gameplay and less interactive movie, I would have given 5 stars. It's major funage, and even better with a friend (or relative). It's mostly like Heavy Rain; press a direction or hit a button fast. Sometimes I didn't know which direction to press in a fight, it was confusing a little, but I couldn't &#34;die&#34; so it was all good (after some practice I got better, but the fight sequences could have been a little more clear).So if you are looking for a good story (told out of sequence, yeah for nonlinear) and like interactive movies, this is the game for you. And it's cheap.And buy &#34;Heavy Rain&#34; too! It's also wicked fun, more so with the PS3 Move.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2014"}

It comes bundled with 1 controller and hookups. .","reviewerName":"Axel Law \"The Happy Seizure Kid\"","summary":"Nintendo at the height of gaming...","reviewText":"The Super NES is the best video game system by Nintendo, bar none. While it had a slower processor than the Sega Genesis (in which case future games had \"FX chips\" to enhance the games), it had better graphics and sound quality. Why is this system among the best? Obviously, the games are what count. No matter how advanced Nintendo gets, the Super NES has the most of the best video games ever made by anyone.Here's a list of some of the classics: Super Castlevania IV, Contra III, the Super Mario series, Super Turrican (a rare and often overlooked gem), Super Metroid, Final Fantasy II, Final Fantasy III, Tales of Phantasia, the Mega Man X series, U.N. Squadron, Zelda: A Link to the Past, Breath of Fire I and II, Chrono Trigger, Secret of Mana, Starfox, Super Mario Kart, the Donkey Kong Country series, Super Mario RPG, Street Fighter II (probably the best one to get is Turbo, but Super Street Fighter II is also worthy) series, Ninja Gaiden Trilogy (which is basically Ninja Gaidens 1-3 from the NES system), Ninja Turtles IV: Turtles in Time, and Rockman and Forte (a.k.a. Megaman and Bass). There are plenty more that are also worthy classics, but I thought I'd mention these above to get you started (although Tales of Phantasia and Rockman and Forte would be hard to get, considering they're only available in Japan for the Super NES). So don't vote NO because I forgot one game.Is this the best system? Maybe that's not true, but those times were the best; the rivalry between Nintendo's Super NES and the Sega Genesis was considerable. Both had extremely enthralling games that were of great quality (Nintendo had Mega Man and Mario, Sega had Sonic and Vectorman). So depending on your preference, you might want one or the other. As far as I'm concerned, both are a must-have. The days of Genesis vs. Super NES are the best in video gaming history. I say this as a true gamer; those were the good ol' days.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2003"}
{"product_name":"B001BX6JUA","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"The evolution of a platform","reviewText":"The prime difference between what the folks at Harmonix and the people at Neversoft/RedOctane are doing with their perspective games comes down to very important semantics.  Neversoft's Guitar Hero series is a franchise.  Harmonix's Rock Band is a platform.  It's a huge distinction and the truth is that Rock Band's method benefits the consumers a lot more.So when you're purchasing Rock Band 2, you'll getting a lot more value than you can imagine.  Sure there's the 84 song (all master cuts) list and the 20 additional free bonus songs coming really soon, but what's important to note is the promise that Harmonix is keeping with: Rock Band is a platform, meaning every song under the Rock Band umbrella (with a few unfortunate nixes) will work with their games.  So not only do all the songs you've been downloading for a year work, but also all but three songs in Rock Band 1 can be ripped to your hard drive (for a nominal $5 for licensing fees).  This is a phenomenal value that values the customer more than paying for individual \"expansion\" packs that have no connectivity to one another.  Platform versus franchise.Alright, so there's a huge value here.  But once you dig into the actual game, there's some good and some blah.  Harmonix revamped the touring mode so that, regardless of playing single or multi, you have one World Tour.  Previously, songs unlocked in solo play would show up in the multiplayer; here, though, regardless of whether you're playing by yourself or with friends, you're unlocking songs as you travel throughout the world.  It's a lot more fun and emphasizes group play.One of the issues I've run into is that the people I play Rock Band with aren't the best of players.  We do it for fun and we'd invariably run into a brick wall in the tour where they'd have to move up to the next difficulty and couldn't.  So far, we haven't run into that situation and have gotten a lot more out of touring that we used to.  I hope this continues as this is the most exciting and fun aspect of the game.Other game types have been included, as well.  Your band can do the \"Tour Challenge,\" which basically throws various set lists at you to get through.  These set lists can be songs from a specific band or songs difficult on a certain instrument or songs of a certain theme, etc.  A second game type is \"Battle of the Bands\" and puts your band against another band virtually, with a leaderboard to track your progress.If you're looking for more character customization options, you'll probably be disappointed.  There's a few more new hair types and a couple more faces, but for the most part it feels like the first Rock Band.  This is a common thread throughout Rock Band 2: it feels a lot like the first Rock Band.  It's more of a slow evolution.  By far the best changes are ones that should have been in place the first time around, namely the fact you don't need a band leader and that you can have one character play any of the instruments.  This is probably my favorite part of the new game (minus the songs).But the songs are the real showcase.  There's a lot of diversity here with a lot of new bands, some oldies and everything in between.  But most of the songs are a ton of fun to play, which is the most important part.  If you have Rock Band, this is a no brainer as the gameplay modes are more fun and you're not losing songs.  If you're new, this is a terrific place to start.  Many many hours have been logged so far and I can't wait for more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-29-2008"}

So if you already have other games of the series for the price this is going for I'd say it's a bargain to add to your gaming collection...Update 02-5-2013After playing the game for a few of the first missions I sadly had to lower the rating of the game not due to the story or characters but as many other gamers have stated the dreaded castle defense play in it. Unlike previous Ratchet and Clank this one mainly seems to have the situation where you must protect your bases generators from attack while at the same time going out and attacking and trying to destroy the enemies base.  I'm sorry but it got a little to monotonous when I had to keep running or rocket booting back to my base to protect the generators and set up defenses every five minutes. All I can say is hopefully the next game does not utilize this annoying scenario into the game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-01-2013"}

In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability.

I feel so bad for this game. It is so poorly advertised. When I watched the commercial for this game near its launch, it felt like a very redundant game. Hateful lies by the 360 fanboys did not help either. Nonetheless, this game received pretty good reviews from many different sites and with price lowering to $30, felt obligated to give it a try.Only after playing 4-6 hours into this game, I became of the variety it has to offer. I loved the game so much that after finishing the game, I felt obligated to finish it again. Why?Because in this game you can power up as a good or bad person. And your choices give your powers distinctive characteristics. An example, both as good and as a bad guy you can use power granade. But as a good guy your granade can trap enemies, but as an evil person it split into mini granades which cover more area and do more damage. This is only the tip of the iceburg. I think there are at least 6 different electric powers that have different good and bad characteristics and then there are 7 other powers which are shared between good and bad, but are still awesome none the less.Also your choices also affect the events in the story and of course the final outcome. To begin with this game has AN AWESOME STORY and having such variation with good and bad powers will make you play the game again to learn the flip side of the story.Also you have different missions as a good and bad guys. AND BELIEVE ME completing these mission will have huge impact on your story and make things very interesting. Being good and evil not only affect the story, but also how people treat you in the open world of this game. For example, being good with make things slightly difficult in the beginning, but as people love you, they will help you out towards the end. If you are bad guy, YOU WILL HAVE THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE POWERS, but people will be hostile towards you making the game harder towards the end.Needless to say this game has SMOOTH GRAPHICS and AWESOME OPEN WORLD gameplay. What you won't expect is VARIETY IN POWER, MISSIONS, ENEMIES and MOST IMPORTANTLY AWESOME JUST AWESOME BOSSES.With the lowered price and FREE GIGABLADES download, THIS IS A MUST OWN GAME.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-14-2010"}

My review includes pros and cons, and I hope you find it useful.--inFamous takes place in a ruined city--inFamous: Action, medium-sized open world, fast combat, upgradable powers.This review contains no spoilers.As stated above, inFamous takes place in a ruined city ravaged by plague and anarchy. You play the hero (or anti-hero, you later decide, based on your actions) Cole. You were told to deliver a mysterious package. About halfway through your delivery, you are told to open the package. Upon opening it, a tremendous and devastating explosion erupts from it, destroying everything around you, killing everyone - except you. After picking your way through the ruins to safety, you find that you have attained amazing electrical powers. As you progress through the story, you quickly gain new and powerful abilities. I will now list the pros and cons of inFamous.Pros:Engaging storyline - The inFamous storyline takes you through the triumphs and struggles that come with mastering your new powers. People in the story will try to dissuade you from your path, and many would like to have your powers as well, even if they have to go to dangerous lengths to get it. The ending, no spoiler, will blow your mind. Guarenteed. No one will/has ever seen it coming.Tons of things to do - While you always have the storyline to turn to for a good time, you also have multiple side missions that later define your character. (As discussed in a later Pro-con). You can also collect what are called Blast Shards, shards left behind from the blast that gave you your powers, to further enhance your powers.Good at making you feel powerful - Of all the games I've played (an unending plethora of them), none have made me feel as powerful as inFamous did. You can literally destroy everything in sight (besides buildings, of course) cars, crates, barrels, people. Your massive array of powers will undoutedly give you a feeling of almightiness. You can (maybe a tiny semi-spoiler) later unlock new powers as you progress through the story, some of which allow you to glide, throw shock grenades, and many more.Open World - inFamous doesn't have the biggest explorable world ever, but it certainly is fairly large. Again, plenty of things to do, improving your character, and blissfully wreaking havoc wherever you see fit.Good or Evil? - Many players like being able to decide whether their character is good or evil. The missions and actions that you complete throughout the game define the character you are. If you are good, citizens will cheer for you and praise you, but if you're evil they will throw rocks at you and certain evil bosses become fond of you. The road that you decide to ride on the good or evil interstate determines some powers that you can attain later on, each standing having its own power.Cons:Not the best graphics - Not the best graphics... Few games have really made \"best graphics\". The graphics in inFamous are a little shoddy, but not to the point of un-playability. Movements of the characters, such as tilting their heads or flinching in your presence are abrupt, quick. Anyone who has played Sucker Punch's earlier game, Sly Cooper, should have that recollection. Overall on the graphics, they could be better, but definitely meet the standards expected in a PS3 game.Comic book cutscenes - Some people may find this to be a pro, maybe for being a creative idea on Sucker Punch's part. I thought it was pretty cool, but I'm sure some people may have some complaints about the fact that inFamous uses what looks like flipping comic book pages for cutscenes. They have small blotches of paint in the sides, which fans of the cutscenes should like. The only noticable flaw in the cutscenes is that it steals away from the action, whilst normal cutscenes would make better use of explosions and such.Limited enemies? - While not following the storyline (i.e doing miscellaneous quests) the player will find special, character determining side-mssions. Upon completing these side-missions, the player will receive an occasional reward, but the area in which you completed that mission in will be cleared of enemies. This will definitely be fun until you actually complete them all. Eventually the entire game will be cleared of enemies, and when combined with the fact that you've completed all the side missions, you'll be left with only the storyline, if you haven't completed that, and the collection of Blast Shards. You can awlays choose to avoid these side-missions, though.Ending - This con (or a pro, can't decide) contains no spoilers. I doubt that the ending will disappoint any players, but it may baffle many of them. An interesting and certainly unexpected twist in the end will more than likely leave many players scratching their heads, though the sequel is coming out/has come out.This is neither a pro nor a con, but inFamous does not have any blood, very little cursing, and no sexuality. It earned its T for teens rating because of all the senselss (and eerily fun) destruction you bring upon unsuspecting citizens.Overall, I would give inFamous 4 stars, maybe 3.85% out of 5%. not the best yet still fit the request graphics, no maturity features aside from rare-swears, gleeful destruction with the use of insurmountably devastating powers, engaging storyline, limited (though limit-ness can be avoided) enemies, and an unbelievably astonishing ending. Now that the price has gone down a bit since release, inFamous would be worth a try, though it's probably not worth $60 (some people may say differently, it's how you determine it). I'd give it an 8/10 rating.I hope this review has been helpful to you.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2010"}

The downloadable patch didn't seem to help with the bugs either. God of War III looks like it would be a fun game, too bad I can't actually play it!I hope to return this soon and get my money back.And Sony needs to devote more resources toward quality control in the future.UPDATED REVIEWOk, so I received a different copy of the game after sending the buggy one back and it seems to work fine.GOW 3 is an incredible game, especially visually. The boss battles and puzzles are truly the highlight of this game.The main portion of the game, fighting off regular enemies you encounter, does get a bit redundant after a while.I might play through this game once again, but I doubt I will more than twice.

DO NOT BUY THE PS3 VERSION","reviewText":"First, let me say that I ended up with this horrible PS3 version because I couldn't stand the PC version's menu setup, which seemed to have been copied and pasted from one of the consoles at the last minute.Second... as much as I want to try and sell this horrible POS to someone on Amazon and try to get as much of my money back as I can, I'm afraid that by doing so I'd be just as bad as Bethesda, foisting broken, half-working crap on someone else and taking their money.What's so wrong with it? Have a look at the article on this site and the videos showing what happens after you play the game for a while.[...]Basically, the longer you play the game, the more you do in the game and the more quests you complete the slower it runs, to the point that it is completely unplayable. Imagine playing Battlefield 3 over a dialup connection. That's the kind of slowness we're talking about here. You can restart the system and play for another 25 or 30 minutes, but I hope you like looking at loading screens because those start going slow too. Right now it takes about 45 seconds for each screen to finish on mine. On my last 25 minute foray I let a stopwatch run on my phone every time I was waiting for a loading screen. Between the saving, exiting, restarting, re-loading and normal transitions from one area to another I counted just over 7 minutes worth of loading screens before I had to restart again.Bottom line, there is no fix yet and if their handling of Fallout New Vegas is any indication, a class action suit is more likely than an actual fix for the game. Save yourself the time and frustration and get it for a different platform or don't get it at all.If you have a PC with the specs to run it well you can use the motioninjoy controller drivers for your PS3 controller to alleviate the menu problems with the PC version, or get a mod to make the menu system work like it should. Otherwise, just play some other game. Don't give bethesda money for garbage.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2011"}

To provide larger storage capacity and faster access rates--PlayStation2 cards transfer data 200 times faster than cards for the original PlayStation--PlayStation2 developers have upgraded the technology for the new memory card. The 8 MB Memory Card uses Flash Memory, the storage technology that's revolutionizing handheld computers, digital cameras, and MP3 players. In contrast, the 128 KB memory cards that were designed for the original PlayStation use memory blocks. While large files can spill over several blocks, you can't store more than one file per block in that design, no matter how small the file.

{"product_name":"B000FW87AI","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"horrendous effort","reviewText":"Finally people are starting to see WWE wrestling games the way I've been seeing them for the last 5 years- they are nothing but a waste of time because each new wrestling game that comes out is almost exactly the same as the previous years version only with minor updates and slight roster changes.  Oh yeah, you may get one or two extra match options, but it's almost entirely pointless.  Not worth the outrageous price tag.Yeah, WWE Smackdown vs. Raw 2007 is extremely realistic, but the gameplay suffers as a result.  This game is the most boring wrestling game I have ever played in my life, WWE or otherwise.  It's painfully slow to deliver a move to your opponent (because of the realism) the loading times are horrible, and the storyline mode is ridiculously overrated and pointless because needing a reason to fight another wrestler makes no sense.  It never made any sense to me why I need some made-up story just to wrestle an opponent.  I remember the good old days when I only had to battle 10 or so opponents and no storyline was ever brought into the mix.  THAT'S how to make a world title run interesting.The loading times are really bad.  We're going into 2007, for crying out loud.  If loading times still occur in todays games, then something is seriously wrong with the thing.  I understand this is a big game with lots of options and wrestlers to sort through, but come on, you have to sit through loading screen after loading screen.Oh, and the control system is horrible, too.  It takes forever to deliver a simple move to your opponent because it's really complicated to figure out what to do.What a boring, boring game.  I really hope something happens and no more WWE games are brought into the world of video games.  Once I noticed how average they've become, I knew it was time for companies to stop making them.  Unfortunately this was back in 2002.  Finally people seem to be agreeing with me.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"jmpg","summary":"A surprising step back.","reviewText":"I'm sorry to have to say it, but: if this game did not bear the Final Fantasy name, it would simply go ignored by the gaming world as a poor, strange, glossy beginner's RPG. That is, if you can even consider it an RPG. FF13 has been in development for the latter half of the decade. With all that time, this is all we got? You'd expect the final product to be one that will help evolve the RPG genre, or even the FF series itself. It does neither.The game feels totally soulless and disjointed. Where exactly is the role-playing in this game? An RPG is not just about having free reign on your characters, but also requires the kind of environment that allows such a thing in the first place. This game, basically, is a series of pre-defined areas held together by cutscenes. These areas, for the most part, have a set of enemies to kill and particular items to obtain. Therefore, once you're completely done with an area, your characters are as good as you'll need them to get. Rinse, repeat, next area, next cheesy cutscene. The game is so streamlined that it feels like it's being spoon-fed to you. I felt that Square-Enix was trying to package an \"RPG\" in hopes that the stunning visuals and story will be good enough to sell the game. They put together all the trappings of a \"good game\". I fortunately don't fall for it.The battle system has some things I like, such as the fact that leftover hit points from a killed enemy carry on to another enemy, however the system doesn't help the game much. It's funny when people say that FF13 is still an RPG because \"you still get a menu to control your character with during battles\". Oh please, that's only one step of the whole point of role-playing. To avoid extending the review too long, I'll just say that it's a strange hybrid of ATB and FF12's Gambits. There are some satisfactory elements but it leaves you with somewhat limited reign within the paradigms and makes the already-repetitive game even more repetitive. It comes off more of an action game where you warp somewhere to battle. What's the point of role-style battling in a game that doesn't allow much role-playing in its very design alone? The whole thing feels so trivial.FF13 is a high-production, streamlined, lifeless game. With all of these fantastic (real) RPG's out there that have come out in the past few years such as Bethesda's Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion and Fallout 3, and BioWare's Mass Effect 2 and Dragon Age, here comes this hyped glossy shell of a game in FF13. As far as J-RPG alternatives are concerned, Sega's Resonance of Fate, the sleeper hit hidden in the shadow of FF13, wipes the floor with this game in pretty much everything except visuals. I suppose that if you play with an open mind and detach this game from the FF series, you will be entertained to say the least, just like FF12. The only difference is that FF12 is good as a standalone game and even contributes to the genre; FF13 is not such a game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2010"}

Marshall \"Geoffrey Marshall\"","summary":"One of the better racing titles out there","reviewText":"This is a fun racing game to play. I have both the PC and PS2 versions, i prefer to play the PS2 version. There are a few differences between them, but not much; I think the PS2 version is easier to play. The graphics are great, the gameplay is good, the tracks are beautiful with as much variety as you can get when using only 5 different base maps. Those are a Northwest-style forest, a Hawaiian-style tropical island (with urban and rural areas), a Mediterranean-style map with ruins and great jumps, an Appalaichian-style hilly map and a Southwest-style desert map (with an airbase on one track!) Each map has between 2 and 3 different circuit routes, not including reverse circuits and point-to-point tracks (linear track, not circuit).Most importantly, the cars. There is a distinct pecking order, each car has its own feel and style and you'll eventually find out what cars are in the same class. Don't try to beat your Mclaren F1 friend when you're driving an Opel Speedster, for example :D The computer opponents have their pecking order as well, with some of them being the drivers to beat and others being just road kill. This edition of NFS has the best gallery of cars ever in the series in my opinion, with the most choices and the best choices. NFS 2 was the supercar edition with wheels most of us can only dream of seeing in real life, and I was pleased that EA brought back the Mclaren F1 from that game. Too bad they couldn't bring back the Ford GT90 as well...but you have most everything else from the Lotus Elise and BMW Z8s and M5s to the Mclaren, Murcieuelago, Viper, and other high-end vehicles, about 20 in total plus the NFS editions. No Japanese cars though, now that I think about it...You have to earn the cars though, you can't just hop into your Diablo as if you're entitled. While various cars are available in the championship modes for each race depending on the rules, you have to either complete events or earn points to unlock various cars (49 total) for regular driving. In other words, if you just got the game and want to race your friend, you'll have only about 8 or 9 cars availale to you, and the highest end car would be something like an Aston-Martin Vanquish V12. Go earn your wheels.And finally, what really makes this game fun: the cops. Unlike the first hot pursuit, the cops aren't out to get you just because you're driving. In that game, i'd drive by them at 20 miles an hour and they'd come after me anyway. In this game, it's theoretically possible to slow down whenever your radar beeps and the cops won't come after you...but what would the fun be in that? They start off slowly enough, just trying to bump you and get you to stop, but when you get 3 stars or higher then the brass comes out and the gloves come off. Expect road blocks and spike strips and the worst of all, the helicopter. That lady in the chopper will drop explosive barrels, barrels that become spike strips, and will also shoot missiles at you. Do you have what it takes to outrun them AND your opponents?Now for the negatives which got this game 4 stars and not 5 from me. While the music selection is good and catchy, it gets repetetive after a while. Can't be avoided, but must be mentioned. Also, while the cops do go after your opponents when driving, the heavy equipment (roadblocks, spikes, chopper) seem to be aimed at you rather than them. All these will affect your opponents if they're around you when the cops pull them out, but the cops never pull it out for them. Plus, at times it seems that the computer opponent has access to some speed boost that you don't. I can't complain much about not being able to drive off road much when each track has some form of short (or long) cut, but I wish I could drive around a bit more :D Also, when in replay mode, you have a limited number of camera views, and there is no reset button if you have a major wipeout when driving, you gotta get yourself back on the road. Finally, maybe just one more base-map for a few circuits :D maybe something like Aquatica from NFS 3.In closing, I whole-heartedly recommend getting this game, especially as it seems to be going for under $15 at this point in time. This game will be one of the classics for PS2 and you won't be sorry to own it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2004"}

{"product_name":"B003VJNPPE","description":"In BriefThe second instalment in the RPG saga about the Witcher, Geralt of Rivia, features a thoroughly engrossing, mature storyline defining new standards for thought-provoking, non-linear game narration. In addition to an epic story, the game features an original, brutal combat system that uniquely combines tactical elements with dynamic action. A new, modern game engine, responsible both for beautiful visuals and sophisticated game mechanics puts players in the most lively and believable world ever created in an RPG game. A captivating story, dynamic combat system, beautiful graphics, and everything else that made the original Witcher such a great game are now executed in a much more advanced and sophisticated way.DEVELOPER: CD Projekt REDBrief Story DescriptionAfter helping to stop the rebellion undertaken by the Order of the Flaming Rose and saving King Foltest&rsquo;s life, Geralt became one of the central figures of political turmoil in the Kingdom of Temeria. Geralt continues to protect the King in the monarch&rsquo;s mission to bring peace to his state. The last bastions of the Order yielded to the royal army. The only remaining task is to pacify the rebellious castle of Baroness La Valette, who announced separation from the Kingdom. It&rsquo;s been a month since the attempted assassination of the king, when his army arrives at the gates of Baroness La Valette&rsquo;s fortress in preparation for the final battle. In the meantime, Geralt, stuck with Foltest, cannot begin his personal quest - to discover the origin and identity of the mysterious witcher-like assassin responsible for the attempt on the king&rsquo;s life - a quest that would answer many questions...Key FeaturesA truly epic, intense, emotionally charged adventure with non-linear game narration. Three independent plot lines with several alternative events are dependent on the player&rsquo;s choices and lead to multiple different game endings and several additional plot forks. This time gameplay time will be shorter than The Witcher 1, but more intense and packed with events.A complex, realistic and mature story touching upon subject matter seldom seen in other RPGs, told in a manner that is understandable and attractive to contemporary gamers. We investigate the assassinations of the rulers of the Northern Kingdoms and follow Geralt&rsquo;s personal theme, in which he&rsquo;s looking for his own identity. Gradually we learn how powerful forces influence our situation and what role they order us to play.Rich, mature dialogue as found in Andrzej Sapkowski&rsquo;s book series and The Witcher 1, presented in highly filmic cutscenes and dialogues sequences, thanks to a new game engine.New, improved system of flashbacks. Now the reminiscences of Geralt, in which we observe the link between our past choices with current actions, are realistically and smoothly woven into the gameplay.Sex and eroticism will be introduced in a much more realistic, involving and mature way, thanks to which sexual relationships are presented more credibly than in TW1.Unique, deep, consistent and rich game world established in a series of best-selling books by A. Sapkowski and recreated in the game to provide an incredible, believable story-driven experience.Believable, true-to-life characters with their own motivations and goals. During our journey we meet ordinary men, soldiers, rebels, powerful mages, rulers and their assassins. Depending on our decisions we meet different game characters, and our relationships shape further actions in the game.Highly varied, breathtaking locations, which thanks to the new engine create a cohesive, fully accessible world!Rich, living world in which every character has their own way of life and unique occupations. Our actions modify the relationship with the game-world population and, in the case of the main plot line, open or close the possibilities of interaction with the game world.Greater freedom of exploration to provide increased game realism and a wider range of new tactical options. Geralt will surmount barriers, jump over fences, scale walls and ascend rock formations.Premium Edition ContentsGAME DVDThe Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings game DVD.MAKING-OF DVDAll the cinematic materials related to game - trailers, dev diaries, gameplay footage, interviews and making-of exclusive video.OST CDAudio-CD with in-game music.ETUIBox with all the contents of The Witcher 2 Premium Edition.WORLD MAPA map of the game's world.GAME GUIDEThe Witcher 2 strategy guide for both novice and experienced role-playing fans.GAME MANUALA rulebook and interface explanation to help you get started.PAMPHLET AND COINA physical representation of one of the in-game items.PAPERCRAFTSTwo papercraft dolls - Geralt and one random character for collectors.DLCExtra in-game feature for download: The Ultimate Swordsman SuitSystem RequirementsMinimal Requirements:CPU: Dual-Core, 2,2 GHz.RAM: 1 GB (Windows XP), 2 GB (Windows Vista / Windows 7)GPU: nVidia GeForce 8800 / 512 MBOS: Windows XP / Windows Vista / Windows 7","summary":"Gaming Art.  Will make you a Born Again Gamer.  Lots of flaws, but a patch can fix that.","reviewText":"After only a few hours I realize that The Witcher 2 has destroyed and remade my life as a gamer.  The Witcher 2 has bumped me up to a totally new level of expectations for what an RPG should offer.Many flaws.  Oh so many.  I am only a few hours into the game (in ACT 1) so I encourage you to read some of the other reviews here on Amazon.  You will see what others have pointed out as well.  Here are some highlights but again reading more reviews will give you a deeper picture of what people are disappointed about.  But don't let this stop you from getting the game.Boxing is stupidly boring.  This is one of the mini-games.  To box you simply wait for a key to be shown on the screen, and then you press that key (A&lt;S&lt;D&lt;F).  Sometimes another key will follow the first one.  But you as the player do not actually direct the boxing of Geralt.  Instead if you successfully press the right keys in time, you get to watch Geralt perform a boxing / wrestling move on the opponent.  Neat from a \"watching a movie\" perspective but crappy if you wanted to actually BOX in some fashion.No more Collectible Chick Cards???  Maybe I am missing it so far, but there are no beddable wenches to be found anywhere.  Yes you can still find a brothel and buy them for the night, but the ladies here are way uglier compared to the ladies of the first Witcher game.  And \"the act\" done with one of them, although sometimes dressed with a naked brest, is in my opinion less appealing overall than even the censored version of the first game.  Too bad.  One of my favorite side tasks in the first game was finding all the beddable wenches.In game encyclopedia is poor.  Yes you can find stuff.  But the window dressing is bad.  It is done way too IT-ish in nature.  You get a window pane of sorts with a list of text, rather than what appears to look like a book from a page.  Disappointing as this interrupts the ambiance of the game every time you do something with inventory or merchants etc.Map is only moderatly useful.  The tracking feature does not appear to work with many of the quests.  Sometimes this is not so bad.  It means you have to pay attention to dialog and game details.  But also this makes completing some quests very hard.  Maybe a hint or reminder feature could deal with this.  For example, I am currently looking for a Troll's Head.  After looking in the journal I was reminded to talk with my friends and got a hint from one of them.  But even with this hint, it seems I will have to search every house in the village to find it.  It is taking way too long.Documentation on practical game play is very very poor even with the game guide and user manual.  For example, I only figured out by accident how to apply a mutagen.  And no where does it tell you that once you use a mutagen on a slot, that slot is used up and you cannot overlay a better mutagen later.  This sucks.  One of those things a patch may fix later.  Glad I read this in another review before I started filling up with low level mutagens.  There are other game control issues too.  Read other reviews to see.With only about 10 hours of gameplay behind me, I am still up in the air about how character development will work out.  I am dissapointed however with certain aspects.  For example, you must meditate in order to drink a potion.  This means you have to know before hand who you will be doing battle with and take the right potions at that time.  It is not possible during combat to pause the game, refer to your encyclopedia for help on a particular monster, and then drink the appropriate potion and use the right blade oil.  Too bad.  This would have made the use of potions and enhancements and books much more meaningful to the game.  It would be worth while to buy books and read them and to make lots of potions and oils.  Now you just reload after the monster kills you and fix your character before starting the encounter again.  Simlarly I am not convinced that the dialog options are really options yet.  It may be I do not fully understand how these options really work, but so far there has been few if any real choice points that I have found.  During most dialogs it seems you go through all options anyway regardless of the order in which you pick them.Gameplay is different.  This is either a plus of a minus depending upon where you sit.  Some have said the gameplay is more \"action rpg\" oriented.  Well, this is so I suppose.  They have suggested that the game was designed for the XBOX 360.  Well maybe that is true too.  If so I can't say it is a bad thing.  Having a more action oriented game at least during the fighting seems better than before.  After a little playing I am much happer with the basic fighting concepts in the WITCHER 2 vs. the orignal.In spite of its obvious flaws (which decent beta testers should have found) The Witcher 2 lives up to its ideal of being a mature gaming experience, and by this I am not referring to the SEX in it (not much so far to my disappointement).  I mean by its darker story line and mature relationships between characters and the questing which seems much fuller than your typical go here, get that, bring it back crap we see in other games.The graphics are the best I have seen in any game.  Yet movement in the game is fluid, without any momentary hesitation or jerkyness when moving the character.  However I only play at 1280x1024 resolution because of my older monitor so keep that in mind.  And the long load times are a thing of the past.  I have a better rig today than I did when playing the original but still not the best rig in town.  I am playing on high everything and have no game slowdowns but again my resolution may account for this.And maybe best of all, there is no DRM any more.  I can play Witcher 2 without internet and without the CD in the drive.  This was a big deal for me recently when my cable modem crapped out on me.  Thanks ATARI and CD PROJECT RED.  Good call on removing the DRM.  I hope you guys come out with lots of DLC for this one because if it is priced right, I will be buying it.As I said in opening, this game has me Born Again to gaming.  The Witcher 2 has bumped me up to a totally new level of expectations for what an RPG should offer.  Consider this: I recently downloaded the game NUMEM from Steam.  It was on sale real cheap and looked OK so I figured what the heck.  But you cannot compare that game to The Witcher 2 in any way whatsoever.  Both wield the label RPG yet NUMEN seems fully childish in nature compared to The Witcher 2.  It makes me realize the same about so many other games I have played.  In one way I am saddened by this, because it means I will never be satisfied again by the limited types of RPGs I have played so many times before.  There will never again be a quick fix for my RPG itch.  In that sense the Witcher 2 has destroyed my gaming life.  But at the same time I now see what an RPG can be in today's world of PC gaming.In the end, The Witcher 2 is a masterpiece, destined to take its place among the greats, sitting aside the likes of FALLOUT and Planescape Torment, which after my 20 years of gaming on the PC, are the only other games I consider to have achieved the status of ART rather than game.  The Witcher 2 makes me look forward to how the RPG genre will evolve in the next 20 years.Hail Flavius!For Reference, here are the relevent aspects my rig's specs.  I play on high and have no performance issues with The Witcher 2, but my screen resolution is rather low (1280x1024) so keep that in mind.1090T CPU (early amd six core (3.2 GHz not overclocked) (not sure if the multiple cores are doing anything))Geforce GTX 480 (early version and only one (no overheating issues if the ambient temp is good))Windows 7 Professional1280x1024 resolution (yep, small monitor, this low resolution may be the reason for my excellent performance)Generic 7200RPM drive, motherboard sound, 16gb of generic memory","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2011"}

The AI is frustrating,  in five you had more control of what ammo and weapons the AI had,  I have yet to be able to have any significant influence,  I think this is to push people into co-op but I have an open game and no one has joined me yet and I waited for ten minutes before I started playing.2.  The game is dark so far,  I think that people want to see what is on the screen,  and that games that are too dark are missing the artistic merit of what the areas in games should look like,  Dark does no equal scary it just means you have trouble seeing things on screen,  I tried putting the light up to the max and still can not see anything.3.  The guns so far are weak,  and you burn through ammo like it is on sale,  the games seems to push people into melee,  and their are not enough bullets,  you spend time with no enemies only to be over whelmed,  and then run out of cheap ammo, resident evil five had better guns.4.  The AI is stupid,  you jump over a bench to avoid a metal detector only to have your AI blatantly set it off.5.  Health is hard to keep up and when your low you slow down and the already dark screen gets even darker.6.  I can not seem to pause the game,  I am not sure if it is because I have an open gaming session but even borderlands two allowed you to pause the game.I am going to add more positive stuff as I play the game,  but right now the game is just frustrating me,  it is a triple A tittle and it is a good game,  but good games can still frustrate you,  I think it is worth buying even if it is not perfect,  maybe the developers will listen to us and the next game will be more in line with Resident evil 4 and 5.I dont one star a game just because I am not getting it right away, but I wanted to give people the information so that if they do buy it they are not surprised as I have been","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWUTQ","description":"","summary":"Cut to the chase","reviewText":"If you've played previous Dead Space installments, than I am sure you did your research and reading about Dead Space 3 and do not need the whole spiel about how revolutionary this is to the franchise and how it's a breath of fresh air to be able to have a co-op campaign. I'm just going to jot down the quick facts for you, with a little of my own opinion for flavor:+ Combat has added a few little changes, such as ducking and a more responsive and useful dive/dodge feature.+ Weapon and suit customization is fun and has plenty of attention to detail.+ More Zero-G Environments, which I'm sure everyone enjoyed before.+ Since most sequels almost ALWAYS have a larger world to explore, this is no exception. Largest by a leap for the franchise.+ \"Static\" visuals, such as backgrounds and surroundings are beautiful and eerie when they need to be.+ A fully orchestrated soundtrack is excellently utilized to highten the intensity of the flow of the game.A few cons:- Aiming is more erratic and harder to pinpoint a necessary target when on the move or stopping a necromorph in it's tracks. Stasis use to slow down enemies to make a good shot will be used more than ever.- While the graphics of the central characters and the surroundings is superb, the look and movement of the Necromorphs is a noticeable step back. In previous titles, the movement of the enemies was something that looked dangerously vicious and feral. This time around, it looked like generic pre-programmed \"bad guy lumbering\" and almost STIFF. Coloring and texturing on some enemies looked like something seen from a Playstation 2 title.I understand that larger-scale games sometimes take up a massive amount of space, which can lead to some standards of quality to drop (Just look at Assassins Creed 3). On the level, this is an awesome game that definitely pulls its weight; I'm sure Visceral is proud, as they should be.**UPDATE** I just remembered one PRO and two CON's I forgot to mention earlier:+ The most beautiful change to the gameplay is ALL AMMO now falls under one type that works for ALL WEAPONS! Wow was I glad to see THAT finally happen!- Melee combat (swinging and kicking) is essentially useless outside of breaking open containers. If you allow yourself to get caught in a corner during an Necromorph ambush (it'll happen), swinging and kicking will do next to nothing to free yourself up, and from what I've experienced, will not kill any baddies crawling around ground level.  Make sure you have a weapon on hand that has a 'push-back' element (Force Gun, Shotgun, etc).- While it IS awesome to have hundreds of options when creating your weaponry, this installment of Dead Space only allows you to carry 2 guns at a time. Sucks a bit, but not a hindrance necessarily. Starting off with 25 item slots sure takes the edge off!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2013"}

The brilliance of Super Mario Galaxy 1 inspired me to buy this game, but it dissapointed me. SMG2 is not a horrible game however- i did enjoy it. Nintendo really amped the graphics in this game, and the addition of yoshi added new things. One thing that really changed my mind if this game was the world selections and the spaceship home planet area. I thought that the idea of changing the world select screen to look like a SMB3 select screen was poor, as i liked the idea of the pull stars and looking up into the sky- then choosing a planet to go to in SMG1. Also, the home planet where you return to after a mission really threw me off, i did not like the feel of it, and every time i passed the captain, he would always say \"Why not take a break?!\"- which got annoying every now and then. For one thing i did like was the story. SPOILERS BELOW!!!!!!-traditionally, mario saves peach and defeats bowser, yes- its the same, but in the ending i did like the twist where you had to fight him twice, although it was way too easy flinging asteroids back at him. Bowser also didnt seem to have any new moves in the first boss fight,  even though it was more challenging.*end of spoilers*I still enjoyed the music, and the gameplay- although i did see similar worlds like in SMG1.In conclusion, this game did not come close to my expectations as a better game than SMG1, however, it was still pleasing to play a mario game on the wii.

You can't have cutsie cartoony characters swear and pass it off as not being kiddie crap, and I'm sorry, but that's what this game was. It wasn't even an epic kiddie game like Mario, or Pokemon, what this was wasa mediocre last ditch attempt to try and sqeeze some much needed cash out of the franchise, and while it wasn't entirely unlikeable, it was such a throwback to older games that it was completely unoriginal, and there in lied it's problem. It's plot, characters, etc were all rehash from past FF games. There are moments of silliness that will force a smile out of you, but I found myself anxious to have the game overwith, and never bothered to dig into side quests, bonus Eidilons or any of that. Had FF IX been FF VIII maybe I would have liked it better, but to spoil me with FF VIII's graphics, then expect me to be happy with the super deformed kiddie garbage is unfair. Thankfully FF X takes the series back into a progressive state, unlike this one which was more rehash than nostalgia.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2002"}

While an effect only felt upon intense reflection, it is still pervasive.  This effect doesn't detract from the gaming experience, 7 and 8 are worthy games in their own right, but it seems to detatch these games from the series' roots.  Final Fantasy 9 firmly grasps these roots, and tenaciously clings to their nostalgic promises.  Perfectly pervasive and overwhelming in its effect, nostalgia floods from the screen while playing Final Fantasy 9--promising, reminding, revealing long surpressed emotions of the beleaguered old-time gamer.  This I felt upon my first time through, and I can't shake the feeling that this kind of game will disappear for lack of support and shivering nostalgia.Perhaps I am paranoid, but that feeling remains.  Please, gamers, don't let this kind of game disappear.  You may not have played the old RPG's, but they became much loved for a reason.  This reason, great design and simplistic charm, is one that must not be supressed by myriad graphical enhancements and gameplay so &quot;innovative&quot; that it eliminates the necessary and unadultured fun that makes RPG's so very appealing.Okay, rant over.  Final Fantasy 9 reveals the life of Zidane, an enigmatic and zany character--benevolent womanizer.  He becomes, through an expertly penned story, the main character in a fight to end the reign of a malign queen--the story eventually elevating to galactic proportions.  With an involving storyline, slick graphics the best of their time, and a simple management system that truly &quot;works,&quot; Final Fantasy 9 offers one heck of a gameplay experience.

The ones I do play typically aren't first person shooters.  As the owner of a Wii, Xbox 360, and PS3 the Wii simply isn't my go-to machine for hardcore shooters.However, with the release of \"Goldeneye\" for the Wii, I simply had to have it.  The original \"Goldeneye\" on the N64 was the game that really got me hooked on the genre, so when I first heard it was being remade, I knew I would have to get it.I'm glad I did.The game is really good.  I really liked how it all felt so familiar, yet different at the same time.  The story was tweaked just a tad to fit more with the times, but it still followed the story of the movie and the original game pretty closely.  I loved coming across something that I remembered so fondly from the original game.I will say that the only thing I didn't really like about the game was the controls with the Wii Remote and Nunchuck.  I ended up having to buy a Classic Controller Pro to really have fun with it.  If you are used to using the Wii Remote in first person shooter games, this probably won't be an issue for you...but if you enjoy using a standard controller for your FPS games, then know that the Classic Controller Pro does a great job of controlling this game.Overall, this is a must have package for any FPS fan and any Wii owner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2010"}

It is being developed by a team led by several people who worked on the very similar Medal of Honor series. The game is also being published by Activision, so it plays similarly to Castle Wolfenstein as well. However, while Medal of Honor tended to focus on simply playing by yourself in the field, Call of Duty emphasises teamwork. Throughout most of the game, you fight alongside your squadmates, which is very cool, and makes Call of Duty even more realistic than the Medal of Honor series. The sound was not phenomenal, and the graphics needed a MAJOR facelift, but by the time Call of Duty is released these small features should have been modified. I am a huge Medal of honor fan, so i am very excited for Call of Duty to come out later this year on the PC. Keep your eyes open for this one!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-07-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00004SQPD","description":"While inheriting the basic functions and design philosophy of the current PlayStation 2, the internal design architecture of this newly redesigned PlayStation 2 computer entertainment system model has been completely overhauled. Slimmer and more lightweight,  its internal volume has been reduced by 75 percent, overall weight has been halved and the thickness trimmed down to 2.8cm (thickness of current model is 7.8cm). Its size is almost as small as a hardcover book, making it easier to carry around. Equipped with both a modem port and an integrated Ethernet port for network gaming, the new PlayStation 2 sets new standards in the fusion of design and functionality.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Gaming excellence, made smaller","reviewText":"This re-designed Playstation2 is truly a sight to behold, literally.  Just pick this thing up and you'll marvel how Sony ever managed to shrink down the PS2 in size and keep virtually all it's features intact.  Just about everything from the original model PS2 is still here, including the features to play old PS1 games and DVD's, as well as a built in modem for online play.  The long abandoned Firewire port is not here, as well as the plug in for the PS2 HDD hard disc drive, which as a previous reviewer mentioned, will likely never be supported by Sony again outside of the Final Fantasy Online failure.  The sliding disc door, which was subject to malfunctions, is also gone here, replaced with a top loading feature.  As for the system itself as a whole, the PS2 stood as the best home gaming console on the market a few years back, but things have changed.  These days, that claim can't be so sure.  Sure, the graphics aren't as superb as they are on Microsoft's XBox, and the online play can't compare to that of the XBox Live either, but the system's exclusive library of game's were at one time second to none.  Since then, Rockstar's controversial Grand Theft Auto series found it's way to the XBox, and some of the past few first party games, particularly the sports titles, have dwindled in quality.  Right now, Microsoft's money making machine has the advantage, but with the upcoming next-gen systems set to flood the market next year, who knows who will come out on top.  That aside, if you have yet to purchase a current console system, the PS2 is an excellent choice to purchase, considering that the system has a huge library of games and possibly the most third party support of any system today.  So if you're looking to buy a current system, you really can't go wrong with this super sleek, newly designed PS2.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-28-2005"}

Some of them are wonderful, some were pretty awful, but THIS is the one I have to tell you about.  In the beginning, I was fascinated by this long, glossy, Final-Fantasy-looking cinematic.  But once the gameplay starts, it's a hideous awful disaster.  This Sonic game doesn't know if it wants to be a role-playing game or a 3D action game, but both are unbearable:  \"missions\" to wander around and figure out who to talk to (there's a \"puzzle\" that has no pattern, for example--you just talk to everybody until one of them coughs up an answer...but he lies to you the first time to make you go around again), and worst of all, levels where you tear along at a high rate of speed, and then plant face-first into death.  Touch the controls and screw everything up.  Don't touch the contols, and screw everything up.  If I tried to make a video of the gameplay, it'd be an endless montage of death after death, many of which you don't even know what you did wrong.  The only way to get through is to be a robot:  \"I pressed the X button last time, now let's see if Triangle does anything.\"New Game?  2 minute loading screen.  Lose all your lives?  2 minute loading screen.

The game would appeal to a much greater consumer base and would have had much greater sales if it had 5 difficulty levels.The other major related problem is that one cannot save in the middle of a mission. Because of this one must repeat the same driving sequence over and over to finally get through the hard part of the mission (ultimately I could not pass missions and had to stop playing the game).Because of the two problems above, I find this game more frustration than fun.

PS2 was easier and more cost effective to produce games for, and thus has a multitude of games developed for it. It also has a buit in DVD player.  The only thing that the PS2 is lacking is online network (Next Gen concept) that was not around when the PS2 was developed...so this means no Achievements or Trophies to brag about with your friends.

Afro has set out to try and avenge his father's murder by a man named Justice. Justice murdered Afro's father to claim the 'Number One' headband, giving himself the chance to rule the worldAfro Samurai is based on the popular and stylistic anime of the same name.View larger.with powers akin to a god. The only one allowed to challenge Number One is the person with the 'Number Two' headband, but unfortunately for Afro, the current owner of the headband, anybody and everybody can, and does, challenge Number Two. But never fear, as this new title includes brand new material and background for fans of the series and newcomers alike to enjoy.Loads of Stylized ActionAfro Samurai brings gamers a balanced experienced, with stylistic combat and acrobatic platforming combined with the ability to dynamically slice and dismember enemies in unending ways. While gamers can hack and slash their way through many foes by combining heavy and light attacks with just two buttons, accomplished players will master moves like the Deep Throat Killer, where they pierce their opponent's neck and rip everything loose in a crimson splash.Players will also need to learn the Focus maneuver with its bullet-time effect. This allows the user to slow down time and designate a specific strike zone, which with the right timing and skill can allow Afro to cleave an enemy in two or slice a limb completely off. And since characters are not pre-rendered you don't just get a canned scene when you cut through your enemy, giving you endless ways and means to cut your enemies down to size. This ethos is applied game-wide, as Afro is allowed to interact with anything and everything in his environment to help him on his journey.Star-Studded Supporting CastSamuel L. Jackson reprises his role as both Afro and Ninja in the game, and the same striking art style that made the anime series so popular provides the unique look and feel across beautifully animated open environments. And for those of you who are wondering, developers Namco Bandai let Jackson ad-lib a lot, so be prepared for his branded vulgarity and the M rating it helps the game earn.Meanwhile, Ron Pearlman and Kelly Hu continue on in their roles as Justice and Okiku, while RZA of Wu-Tang Clan fame has created all new tracks for the hip-hop inspired soundtrack. And thanks to an innovative gameplay system, the enemy AI and tone of the game are affected by the beat of the musical score, for a truly immersing experience.With its visual stunning graphics, and fluid and graceful movements, Afro Samurai will provide hours of entertaining, balletic action. Add to this ground-breaking elements like health that is represented by the blood on your clothes, or your enemies', and you have a game that simply can not be passed up.Slice and dice your enemies in a glorious number of different ways.","reviewerName":"N. Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"A fun, but flawed, bloody action brawl","reviewText":"Because being a fun, ultraviolent anime blast wasn't enough, Afro Samurai makes the splash into the video game world courtesy of Namco Bandai.  Samuel L. Jackson returns to lend his voice to the revenge-driven Afro as well as his foul-mouthed sidekick Ninja Ninja, in a storyline that more or less follows the plot of the first Afro Samurai flick, as you take on hordes of enemies and dish out bloody punishment.  The fighting is mostly fun, as are the boss battles which are orchestrated wonderfully, but the best part of the game is undoubtedly the graphics and art design.  Afro Samurai looks and moves fluidly and beautifully, and the game's soundtrack and voice acting are excellent as well.  What really hurts the game however lie mostly in its controls and platforming.  You can't really string together attacks, and the game's platforming elements are disappointingly clumsy.  The game's schizy camera doesn't help matters either, and the fact that you can adjust the Y-axis but not the X-axis is mind-boggling.  Still, there's a lot to admire with what you get here in Afro Samurai, but it's just a shame that a little more polish wasn't put on here, otherwise we could have had something really great.  Still, the game is worth a look despite its flaws, and if you're a fan of the anime, you'll definitely want to check this out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-29-2009"}

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"thebluedevil","summary":"The best first person shooter on the PS2","reviewText":"This game is the epitomy of all evil.

I frankly didn't know it even existed until not to long ago when I saw it on sale brand new for like $5 on the PS3, and so I picked up a copy of it since how can you pass up a game that cheap? That's less then food. I beat this game, and I liked it so much that I went on Steam and bought a copy for the PC just to send more money towards this game since I truly believe it's an amazing game.The game plays like a mix of Uncharted (due to the jumping around and acrobatic stunts you have to perform) and a God of War style of combat that we all know (Square light attack, Triangle heavy attack, ect). They also have an upgrade system for different ways of improving your character, which is really solid. You get a sort of disc hover board that you get to use from time to time, and that thing is a lot of fun to mess around with. They give you the use of it during a few boss encounters which are really cool, and it helps that you can jump on and off it very quickly. Also your staff that the main character has as a weapon can shoot projectiles from it, and there are damaging and stunning projectiles, and that's really useful.This game is my first encounter with proper motion capture in a video game. They had the voice actors actually also doing all the physical stuff in motion capture suits (I saw the video). I have to say it really makes it all feel more real. Like how many times have you played a video game where the main character is talking to someone, but he's standing still and looking as if he's not even looking at who's he's speaking to? That's never the case with this game, it always looks as if the characters actually are making eye contact and actually moving around naturally when conversing with each other. That really stood out in my mind while playing it since I don't usually see that in video games, and it's a new thing games are starting to do. This one did an amazing job with it.The voice acting is amazing. There is a LOT of dialogue between the characters so you always have something to listen to, which I thought was really cool. And there is a fair bit of comedic elements to it all, so it is enjoyable to listen to.I'd say if your looking for a game with a genuinely unique story to tell and that plays fun to pick this one up. I didn't have any problems with the game, and I'm a fairly picky gamer. I usually put a game in for about an hour or two, and whether I like it or not I generally tend to never pick up a game 75% of the time just out of lack of interest. I was able to stick with this game for days and played all the way through it and am about to do so again on PC. So it's definitely capable of keeping my interest.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2014"}

But although it comes in a small package, this is a full-fledged game that stands on its own. With an all-new, deep story that approaches the familiar sights and sounds of the infamous Liberty City from a different perspective, an innovative control system and multiplayer options,Chinatown Warscaptures the tone and flavors of the long-runningGTAseries in unique ways that both longtime players and those coming to it for the first time will find hard to put down..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Grand Theft Auto:Chinatown WarsPlayers:Offline: 1; Online: 2Gameplay Modes:Single player; competitive &amp; coop multiplayer via Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.Kick some tail as Huang Lee.View larger.Use the DS stylus like never before.View larger.Reconquer Liberty via PDA.View larger.The Story: Left for Dead in the Worst Place in AmericaFollowing his father&rsquo;s murder, Huang Lee is given what seems a simple mission: to deliver an ancient sword to his Uncle Kenny to ensure his family retains control of the Triad gangs of Liberty City. Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

The drug trade minigame is entertaining enough and the main system for income. The missions are challenging (Especially when the racing missions appear) but most of them are not impossible.The dark humor of GTA is present and a refreshing development. The theme is dark but not heavy, and the comedy is funny enough to make you smirk.The graphics are great for DS. The music is not. The sound effects for traffic, people shouting, guns firing, and ect are perfect.

{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"\"matrixman1\"","summary":"Mario's back on the Cube!","reviewText":"Mario finally returns to the world he once ruled in Super Mario Sunshine.

The greatest 3-D weapons-based fighter will provide non-stop action, excitement and surprises as you go one-on-one against your favorite challengers.","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Best PS 2 Beat-'Em-Up Yet","reviewText":"Soul Blade on the PlayStation 1 was a revolution for the fighting game genre. It had previously unequalled graphics, excellent sound, and a host of brilliant features that added months of replay value, as well as being a technically excellent fighting game. Ditto its sequel, Soul Calibur, on Sega's ill-fated Dreamcast. It was more of the same but polished to within an inch of its life, and even today, still stands up as an excellent beat-'em-up.Much was expected of the franchise's third installment on PlayStation 2 and, I'm delighted to say, Namco does not disappoint. The first thing you notice about Soul Calibur 2 is the extremely high quality of the graphics. ALthough not a million miles removed from the Dreamcast prequel(a testament to the power of that machine), the PS 2 has unexpected levels of detail - hair and fabric swing with previously unsees levels of freedom - and the intricate costumes and OTT moves, coupled with sumptuous (if slightly less-interesting than the original's) backgrounds make for a visually lush, uncompromisingly gorgeous game.Similarly amazing is the sound. In a return to top form, Namco has bothered taking the time to translate all character speech to English, with accents, so now characters like Ivy and Cassandra sound like they ought to. The cheesy charm of the announcer is back, and the addition of the Intro-Screen Taunt is a nice touch. The music is excellent too, full of stirring battle-anthems and excellent effects.The gameplay isn't that different from the first two games - perhaps a little faster, but that's it. Mind you, if it ain't broke, don't fix it, and I challenge anyone to be disappointed when they play this game for the first time. It's easy to get into and difficult, but rewarding, to master, with secret characters galore, and a host of special features and new backgrounds, weapons and costumes to be unlocked. Namco has once again proven their mastery of the genre - with literally hundreds of special items to unlock, and a shoal of new and favourite characters to unlock them with, you'll keep coming back again and again to Soul Calibur 2.There are two small complaints. The first is that there is a startling amount of slowdown in the game. When I say startling, I mean that it's shocking to see any game pushing the PS 2's power to the limits, and in relative terms, the slowdown isn't that noticable, nor that prevalent, but it does happen. The second quibble is that in Weapon Master mode, some of the missions are unforgivingly difficult, and if you haven't got a second player to sharpen your skills with, you'll find yourself frustrated quite often.Minor faults are all that's wrong with an otherwise perfect game. I can't recommend it highly enough, being more competent than Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance and a hell of a lot more fun than Tekken 4. Buy it and it will keep you occupied for many months to come.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2003"}

The game is super polished and plays like a dream.  I am not a big fan of take cover, wait for the enemy to reload and shoot kind of guy. It was fun the first time and then too many shooters copied to death. Infamous Second Son solves it brilliantly. Your shield is the ability to move and dash. You can dash, jump, up in the air, across the enemy to escape from bullets. You move, keep moving and move fluidly all the time.  You can just zip on the walls and reach heights in seconds and no need to worry about sticky platforming etc.  Every single mechanic works perfectly and I am sure will copied on the future games.  Absolute visual stunner, every puddle, street light is rendered meticulously.All of the AI and NPCs are mo-caped. Every expression including sadness can simply be felt without the character saying a word. Combat elements are very well thought out. It will require you to change the powers to handle AI effectively. Even with in a group, smoke helps with close combat while neon and other powers help in shooting down enimies far apart. Makes it for a dynamic and fun fights, with lots of re-playability.Also there is a 5+ hr extra content available for free. Sucker punch is going all out, and it is the best that has come out on PS4.This is the 'THE' most prettiest game released so far on PS4. Best part is it's dynamic lighting.  It creates a vibrant as well as moody atmosphere depending on the time of day. Now that main character has 4 powers, particle effects are crazy.  Neon effects during night are un-rivaled in games. Neon reflects on every thing and trails while dashing and moving are there just to hypnotize gamers. It is a true eye candy game.The game pace is fast, and fast I mean super fast.. After brunout 3, this is the game where every a movement is blinding fast. Climbing to the top of a building feels astonishingly fast like wise chasing AI or dashing across levels to avoid bullets are all so satisfying. Controls are silky smooth, encourages the player to move fast.  Any thing and every thing is a zoom and dash.

Valenti \"FireMarioGalaxy64\"","summary":"Now THIS is the best Zelda game!","reviewText":"Most people think Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game, but I have to say I like Wind Waker better (Ocarina of Time is still my second favorite). First of all, the cel-shaded, cartoon graphics are probably the best thing that ever happened to the series. They enhance the gameplay, they're absolutely incredible! There are also dozens of little improvements from Ocarina of Time that make the game very fun to play. Have you ever played a game where it was so fun fighting enemies, you had to stop and fight every enemy you saw? For me, Wind Waker is that kind of game. In Ocarina of Time, normal enemy fighting was boring, but now you can even make an enemy drop its weapon and have Link pick it up and use it. Also, I believe Wind Waker might have more side quests than any other game ever made, giving it EXTREMELY HIGH REPLAY VALUE!!! You can also interact with Link's environment more than ever (Too bad the sequel, Phantom Hourglass failed horribly in that department...). I hope they make a Zelda game like Wind Waker for Wii, something better than Twilight Princess (which sucked)!Good Things- Incredible graphics and sound- Interact with Link's environment better than ever before!- Lots of replay value- Tons and tons of side quests, just discovering them all will probably require a guide!- High difficulty, challenging.- Never repititive or boring.- Great storyline.- Lots of small things to appreciate when you play the game.Bad Things- Maybe a few minor complaints, but I can't remember them right now.Presentation- 98.5/100I was loving the gameplay of Wind Waker in less than 15 minutes.Graphics- 100/100The second best graphics of all time (next to Super Mario Galaxy's), they enhance the gameplay a lot!Sound- 97/100The sound has been improved somewhat from Ocarina of Time.Gameplay- 100/100Incredible, to good for words.Difficulty- Very HighThis is probably the second hardest game I've ever played next to Ocarina of Time.

{"product_name":"B001ASJISG","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"Don't miss the ledge!","reviewText":"From top to bottom, I absolutely love this game.The artwork is quite beautiful with gorgeous backgrounds, levels that seem to sprawl for miles and characters that look and move so smoothly that you can't help but appreciate their design.The sound in this game is pretty nice with active surround sound at nearly every step. The music is really nice as well, changing accordingly to what's going on in the world of the game and it sounds like something you'd hear in a film. What may be one of the three best things about the game in general is the voice acting. The Prince character is a bit of a smartass (and there's a lot of dialogue between him and his foil, Elika to be heard) but something about the delivery of the voice actor makes you love the guy. I think anyone else would've been a bad choice as the voice actor, Nolan North, plays it perfectly.As good as the voice acting is, it only serves to help the story and the story is definitely entertaining enough to keep you glued. It's pretty much a fantasy tale with some serious fantastical elements in it, especially when you take into consideration that the Prince is supposed to be just a normal guy. The man is an amazing bundle of energy and muscle and quite frankly, there ain't no one in the world that can jump, crawl and climb like this guy can. Controlling him is pretty simple and you get the hang of it pretty fast. In fact, it reminded me a little bit of Assassin's Creed, just that the controlling here is tighter and the game itself isn't as monotonous as Creed was, but that's a different conversation altogether. With the help of Elika, the otherworldly beauty at your side, she ensures that you get through the game without too much frustration by saving you whenever you screw up.Huh?! Are you saying you can't die in this game?Yes, its true and it seems to be the main problem that some have with this game, the fact that you can't die. Well, in all honesty, I'd just like to say that if it weren't for her, this game wouldn't be too much fun because you'd probably die hundreds if not thousands of times without her help. Because of the Elika factor, I feel that the game is made somewhat more casual and fun to play, simply because you don't get so stressed out from dying repeatedly. Oh, but don't worry, even with Elika at your side, the game's not a total cakewalk. You've got some sword fighting to do and bosses who can beat you easily if you're not on your toes. I don't know, I get a kick just out of seeing the two leads interact with each other and how fluid the animations are when they do things together. This coupled with the constant, playful bickering between the two make the Prince and Elika one of gaming's best team-ups ever.So yeah, I'd recommend this game wholeheartedly. There's downloadable content coming out in a week's time as of this writing and it promises an extra 4-5 hours of gaming as well as more bonus features. Even without this upcoming add on, I would still say this game is purchase worthy and sure to please even the most jaded gamer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2009"}

My second favourite subject is vampirism (vampire-tales etc.). And combining them like this game does is just great. The visuals are stunning, and the gameplay is very similar to vampire action-adventure games like \"Legacy of Kain: Defiance\" (lots of jumping around and hanging onto ledges), but it also has role-playing elements like collecting experience-points. I would say this a crossover of \"Legacy of Kain: Defiance\" and \"Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption\". The main character even looks a bit like Christof from \"Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption\".I totally agree with other people here saying that the score (music) here is similar to that of \"Lord of the Rings\". But it's not just the soundtrack. The dialogues between characters and the landscape are at times very similar to \"LOTR\", and some of the enemies you encounter look just like plain old orcs, trolls and wargs straight from \"LOTR\". It also reminds a bit of the 2006 movie \"Pan's Labyrinth\". You come to a level called Pan's Temple, and the visuals and characters in that level reminds so much of the movie \"Pan's Labyrinth\" it is almost ridiculous. There is a fairy there, and even a faun called Pan(!) Sounds familiar? That is too much coincidence to be a coincidence. I would say this game is 50% Castlevania, 40% Lord of The Rings and 10% Pan's Labyrinth. But this game being inspired by great movies is not a bad thing. It's a good thing. The result is great!If you are into vampire-games like I am, here are some others that I recommend(* = highly recommended):-Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines*-Vampire: The Masquerade - Redemption*-Legacy of Kain: Defiance*-Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver-Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 2-Castlevania (N64)-Castlevania: Legacy of Darkness-A Vampyre Story-Dracula: Origin*(I'm actually more fond of the Castlevania-games in 3D than the 2D ones)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Tested for a Full Month for this review","reviewText":"The Nintendo Wii U Console is finally a Wii which stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the XBox 360 and PlayStation 3. It offers HD video and can still play old-style Wii games as well.I played and tested with our Wii U for a full month before posting this review. I wanted to make sure that the console behaved well throughout that time, and that we could get past any normal breaking-in highs and lows that tend to come with new consoles.The console definitely is update-heavy. There have been several times that we've turned it on and had to sit through 20 minutes of fresh updates before playing a game. So it's important, when you first get it, to set aside time for doing those system updates. You can't always just turn-on-and-play. If you're planning to set aside an hour of gaming after dinner, it's a good idea to check the unit BEFORE dinner so you can update during dinner if necessary.The video quality is now on par with the XBox 360 and PS3. The old Wii had always gone with the \"poor-video-but-cheap\" mantra, which certainly worked for a while. However in our modern world where many people have HD TVs, it became a bit rough after a while. On the down side, the old Wii could play GameCube games. This new one cannot. So if you still have GameCube games lying around, you'll have to keep a separate system to play them.Speaking of things the WiiU can't do, it can't play any video DVDs - either standard or BluRay. That seems quite a shame. Half of what we use our PS3 for is playing movies. So again something to know. If you have a WiiU you'll still need a DVD player for your video watching.I definitely recommend you get the 32 GIG unit. It fills up quickly.Our set came with an included copy of NintendoLand - I'll review that separately. Suffice to say it had some fun mini-games and some less than fun ones, as most compilation sets do.The console comes with the special WiiU tablet but NOT any normal WiiMotes which you definitely will want. So make sure you get your hands on one or more WiiMotes. The old ones that went with the Wii work perfectly fine.The WiiU tablet is quite fun. It's an entirely separate screen and with some games you can play the WiiU games on it for times that someone else wants to watch the main TV. For many games you use that tablet as a secondary screen. For example in Zombie U you use the tablet to manage your inventory and map. In Super Mario a second player can \"build blocks\" for the main player to step on. In some of the NintendoLand games one player uses the screen while other players watch the main screen. This makes it especially fun to play \"hiding\" games like the ghost hunter one, because the ghost really can hide. He can see where he is on the tiny screen, and the others looking at the main screen have no idea.Like any other console purchase, much of it comes down to how you personally will use the console and what type of games you play. If you want an all-in-one console that also handles media center types of activities, the PS3 might be better for you. If you love the Super Mario series, that's only on the Wii. If you already had a Wii and had GameCube games, know that you'll lose access to those GameCube games. If you adore the Wii, love the Just Dance games on it and are OK with it just being a gaming machine, you'll probably love the extra quality graphics and extra features of the Wii U.We have both the normal Wii and the Wii U, as well as an XBox 360 and PS3. We use each of them for different types of activities. In terms of the Wii U, we do enjoy greatly the use of the tablet with games, especially multiplayer games. I think the tablet will be a big factor in upcoming games, and I'll be curious to see if the other systems begin to push hard in this direction as well.I'd suggest you think twice if you could only have one, single console and you wanted to be able to watch movies on it. Or if you really wanted to play GameCube games on your console. In those cases, other consoles might fit your needs better.Well recommended.Rating: 5/5We purchased this game with our own funds in order to do this review.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2012"}
{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Sally","summary":"Love it, but it needs more games","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying I am a long time Nintendo fan. I started out in the early 90's with an NES, followed by an N64, followed by the Wii, and now the Wii U.I love Nintendo for allowing backwards compatibility  on the Wii U and for allowing us to transfer our content from the original Wii onto the Wii U. I have to say this though, the instructions made it tough to transfer at first between the two consoles. I ended up having to go to a youtube video just to see how it was done and I finally managed to do it. Just make sure you have an SD card, as well as your original wii remotes ready (preferably 2 wii remotes if you have them. 1 will do the job, but that requires constant syncing and unsyncing between the Wii U and the original Wii console. If you have 2, then you just need 1 remote synced to each console, making it much easier and faster to transfer your content). Keep in mind, once you transfer your content, your original Wii is empty. Everything you did is now on the Wii U.Now, let's move onto the Gamepad. The gamepad is an interesting way to play. I personally did not think I would like the gamepad that much (I am very picky when it comes to controllers), but I actually do find it to be quite fun to play on. Some games, like Nintendo land, have you use it a lot. Then there are others, such as Super Mario U, that give you the option to use the gamepad or the original Wii Remote. With Nintendo Land, you can do fun things such as tilt the remote to move your character around. Then there are others that allow you to use the gamepad to look around, almost giving you that full 3D effect in a sense. It's definitely different from any other console out there!Furthermore, the gamepad makes navigation a lot easier in comparison to the original Wii. On the original Wii, typing on the keyboard required you to use the wii remote to point at each letter on the TV screen (this was a pain in the behind because it was such a slow process!!!). Now, on the Wii U, the keyboard is on your gamepad, allowing you to select each letter the same way you would on a tablet. This makes navigation so much quicker and a lot less frustrating!The TVii is a good tool to have as well. I have not played around with it too much yet (I rarely watch TV these days anymore), but I have checked it out. I do enjoy the TV guide they provide for you on the Gamepad, allowing you to scroll through it and select a particular show you want to watch. If you already have a TV guide on your TV to begin with though, then you probably won't be as amazed by this feature because you already have it. Personally, for me, I love it because we are old school in my house. We just have regular cable with no guide, so having it on the Wii U gamepad is really useful for me.Also, similar to the original Wii, you still have Netflix, Hulu Plus, Youtube, etc. Again, these things are FAR more easier to navigate thanks to the keyboard on the gamepad now.One thing that disappoints me so far is the lack of games. I currently play two games: Nintendo Land and Super Mario U. No other games really interest me at this moment, but I do hear they are in the process of making them later on in the year, which is good news. You can either be an early bird like me and get this console now, so that way you are all set and prepared for the new releases in the fall. Or you can hold off and just wait until the titles are available before buying the console. I personally like to be prepared ahead of time, so that way I'm not forking up all my money at once, but that is just me.Lastly, I want to talk about MiiVerse. This was another feature that I did not think I would use much, but I actually find myself posting quite a bit on there. MiiVerse is a way for you to connect with anyone worldwide. You can share comments, start discussions, give each other tips on how to beat a level, etc. You can even draw and post your drawings. I have hand written messages on there, as well as typed messages, and some drawings. The pen that comes with the gamepad makes drawing very easy and fun. You can draw just as good as if you were using a pen on paper. It is that accurate!Overall, the Wii U is a great console! As I said, it just needs more games, but the games will come as time passes. What we have now are just the launch titles. So again, either hold off and wait for the games to come, or get yourself the Wii U console now and just play your original Wii games on it until more Wii U games come out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2013"}

There's not much middle ground. For me, I absolutely adore the game! It's the bees knees and one of, if not THE best RPG experience on the PS2, and that's counting the Xenosaga series!The game obviously rips off FFX in terms of gameplay and graphics, but blends in the rich fantasy world of Lord of the Rings! It's a completely new story, that runs alongside the events of the film. So, actions that occur in the film, might impact your characters journey in this PS2 classic RPG.Now, if you hate LotR, or hate Final Fantasy 10, then there is a good chance you won't like this. However, if you like either, or even both, then you owe it to yourself to get this game and play it all night long!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}

I had high expectations for this sequel.Story: Set 1 year from the first game, still facing the black spider clan, you travel around the globe fighting archfiends that are attempting to resurrect the ancient Archfiend, Vazdah. You take on 3 greater fiends and Genshin (leader of the spider clan) before taking on the final fiend.Gameplay: Still a hack and slash very similar to 1, there are some added moves and the combat is a little different. You can dismember limbs of enemies, causing them to try and pin you down with an explosive. The sword techniques and combos are still there, with some added moves. Essence plays a big part in this game also. It is used to heal, replenish Ki, and for money. You can also do absorb special moves called ultimate attacks. Your health meter is also different. As you take damage, your health bar moves down, but you will replenish up to the red bar. When the red bar moves down, that damage won't heal without a save statue or herb. The cut scenes are amazing and the bosses are challenging. This game is more gory than the first. After each fight, Ryu performs what's called a chiburui, which shakes all the blood off his weapon. His weapons include the Ninja Sword, Scythe, Dragon's Claw, Tonfa, Kusari-gama and Falcon's Talons, Vigoorian Flail (from NG1). The ranged weapons included from NG1 are Shuriken, Incendiary, and Bow. The other attacks you can make are Magic Spells (called Ninpo). Some of these include the art of the flame, wind blades, piercing void and art of inferno (from NG1). The first game wasn't hard to complete using just the dragon sword but this game you will most likely want to use multiple different weapons. You can collect skulls in the game kind of like the golden scarabs from NG1, but they are more for achievements than anything else.Conclusion: While the story and gameplay are good, this game is lacking. Kind of the feeling of Bioshock 2. Same elements as the first game, a few upgrades, but still missing the wow factor captured from NG1. Definitely worth picking up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

In a small suburban town that's overrun by zombies, he escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be safe. Now it's a standoff, with zombies unable to get Frank, but him unable to get out & escape. Fortunately, he's got an entire mall at his disposal. Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"Michael Corona \"Nemesis Legion\"","summary":"Killing Zombies was never so much fun","reviewText":"Dead Rising - Circa 2006GOOD:- Use anything as a weapon, never before has this been truly done or done right in a video game, and when I say use anything as a weapon I truly mean it, from Frying Pans to Chainsaws and Hangers to Battleaxes you really have anything in the entire mall as a weapon, there are thousands of items you can use and that is not including your regular video game type of weapons like guns and swords.- Zombies, lots of Zombies and their all as dumb/deadly as you might hope for, although there more like the Night of the Living dead slow moving type of Zombies and not the 28 Days Later running at you screaming type of Zombies. Also note there are a bunch of crazies/terrorist running around causing havoc as well.- Lot's enemy's on screen with no real slowdown, wait till you get to the underground parking garage and you can literally run over hundreds and hundreds of Zombies with a car with no slowdown.- Lots of costume/clothing options, so you can make the main character (Frank) look like whatever you like, also note you can download even more costume/clothing options from Xbox Live.- This game also has a pretty good/original story and even multiple endings.- The voice acting is also pretty good.BAD:- Replaying the main game a few times just to level up and beat it is really not for everyone, and in order to complete the main game your more then likely to have save your stats and restart the game a few times.- Some might consider the plot underwhelming.- Shooting and aiming is bad I mean you can aim your shots, but your aim is soooo slow you will more then likely get eaten before you shoot anyone correctly. Now you can shoot without aiming (using the auto-aim), which is like throwing down, a pair of dice and hoping you gets 12 every time, needless to say your better off using one of the thousand of non shooting type of weapons. Also note that once you get the machine gun shooting and aiming is not as bad since you can throw-up a wall of lead and not worry about your target(s).- No online play, or any multiplayer, this is a single player game only.- Game should be considered short, unless you factor in the amount of times you have to replay it.- Most of the main game is spent saving survivors, which can be annoying because most of the survivors are as dumb as the Zombies they are trying to escape, luckily you can carry/pull-along most of them and if not you can always give them a weapon (to defend themselves) or even food (to heal them).- Text is almost impossible to read without an HDTV, which really sucks because most of the missions are giving to you in a text format.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- For people who really like replaying their games and getting the most out of there gaming experience.- This game is not really meant for kids or the immature, this game is pretty gory/bloody/violent and even has a few foul words.- Game has an oddball sense of humor, like the movie Sean of the Dead.- Game plays mostly like a non-liner version of a beat-em-up type of game (see Streets of Rage or Fighting Force).- The Mall of Dead Rising is pretty big which is good because, you never really get to leave it.- Killing lots of Zombies with countless weapons (fun!) and playing escort to dumb as dirt survivors (not so fun).GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Resident Evil (for the Zombie action)- Power Stone (For using almost anything as a weapon)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- Beating the main game (and getting the best ending) will unlock Overtime mode and beating that (with the best ending) will unlock a free play type of mode called Infinite mode.- When playing the game you can find the costume parts and also unlock the \"buster/arm cannon\" so you can make your character (Frank) look and shoot like Mega Man.- Right now there is talk about a Platinum Edition of this game coming for Xbox 360 that will come with a \"NEW\" Co-op mode, people who own the original copy of the game could also then download this new mode in XBL Marketplace, when the Platinum Edition is out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00000JRSB","reviewerName":"Trevor Cotton","summary":"The greatest game ever made.","reviewText":"I just finished writing a review of the excellent soundtrack to this game and realised I hadn't even written a review for the game, so here goes.  In my opinion this is the greatest video game of any genre, of all time.  The Final Fantasy series in general is probably my favourite series of games (awaiting XII eagerly), and VII is the best of all.What makes it the best?  It has to be the plot, which by gaming standards is superb, the angst driven main character is overdone in RPG's but it works to good effect here.  Sephiroth is another reason, he is the best bad-guy in a game ever, he is just pure evil.  He causes the plot to be more unpredictable than your average RPG, who honestly expected him to kill Aeris, when they first played through?  Main characters rarely die in these sort of games.  It is just a joy to play in every sense, the mini games compliment it well, including in the Gold Saucer.  The soundtrack is great, of course the graphics are now dated, but it doesn't detract from the gameplay at all, a true masterpiece, if you don't own it already, you couldn't do any better than to buy it now!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXOW","description":"","reviewerName":"Sreenadh","summary":"Amazing Addition to the Series","reviewText":"As your mind drifts on the commute home you'll find yourself humming favourite sea shanties. Walk down your local high street and instead of the usual array of familiar shop frontages you'll see potential handholds.On rainy days you'll stare out of the window and remember that time you were braced against the starboard breeze under a blistering Caribbean sun. Assassin's Creed IV, while by no means perfect, is video game escapism at its finest.Edward Kenway is your piratical guide through the Golden age of Piracy, and he makes for a much more palatable protagonist than ACIII's Connor. It's clear, right from the explosive beginning, that Edward has but one doubloon-flavoured aim in life. Much like eternal crowd-pleaser Ezio, he's fleshed out with character flaws to go with the bad-assery. There's more to Ed than grog-guzzling and wench wrangling. One of Edward's key characterisations is that he's a pirate first and foremost.He might wear Assassin robes and wield the iconic wrist blades, but for a hefty chunk of the game Edward is unfettered by character breaking philosophies and cringe-worthy creed adherence. In fact, it's only when these familiar series tropes infringe that his otherwise winning personality takes a musketball to the gut. An early indicator that Black Flag is a better pirate game than it is an assassin game.Edward's is the behooded face on the box but for the first time in AC there's more than one main character. She may be made of timber and barnacles, but Edward's ship, the Jackdaw, is every bit as integral a part of the Black Flag experience.Her briny decks are your access point to the many sultry shores of the Caribbean. Though historical cities like Kingston, Nassau and Havana provide ample playgrounds for land-lubbing action, the Jackdaw allows for a wider variety of wildernesses and seascapes to explore.New experiences aren't relegated to side-quests. Many are placed front and centre, with all the explosive bluster and memorable potency that you could want. Prime examples - without sailing into spoiler infested waters - include dunking down into the deeps with a diving bell to recover sunken medicine for your hygienically challenged piratey brethren.The Jackdaw also acts as a content gate-keeper. Each section of the map contains so many treasures to seek out, sea beasties to harpoon, sunken wrecks to loot and uncharted islands to comb that it's easy to get distracted. In fact you're supposed to get distracted. There's a right way to play through Black Flag and that is to let its world draw you in.Each chunk of the map can be unveiled fully by taking out land-based forts. These grand undertakings often require the Jackdaw to be upgraded with stronger cannons, armour and weaponry the further into the game you get. As such you are actively encouraged to pillage your way to power. It's essential to spend some time drinking in the world before you plough into the occasionally over-cooked Assassins/pirates/Templar plot bloat.The story, however improved over ACIII, is front heavy with quality. The first 15 hours or so are mind-blowing. As each facet of the world unlocks you're treated to a narrative focused on the era, the personalities and the intrigue of the age. The modern day barely infringes at all, and when it does it is mysterious enough, brief enough and focused enough, to actually benefit the over-arcing plot.The cracks start to show come hour 20. Suddenly Ubisoft forgets to frame its narrative experiences. Characters come and go too quickly for you to get a sense of who they are. As a result, it's hard to really care for them when the grog turns sour and the blood starts spilling.There are too many moments of brilliance sprinkled throughout for this occasional saltiness to spoil the overall flavour, however. Boarding is seamless and wickedly fun. The atmosphere during these flowing sequences is hectic, as multiple ships weave in and out of range looking for the perfect broadside firing opportunities.Get an enemy ship's health low enough via cannonade and mortar fire, and you can board her quickly and without so much as a cutscene. Like the best AC slices, these situations host tasty free-form player choices. Will you climb up the masting to air assassinate the opposing captain? Dive into the drink for a stealthy approach? Or perhaps swing right in via handily placed ropes? The choice is always yours, though is incentivised by ship class-based objectives. Bigger ships will need their flags destroying before the crew loses their thirst for battle. Others will submit once cargo has been suitably exploderised.It's clear that Ubisoft heard fans' cries of woe as they played through criminally guided portions of ACIII. Many of the stealth sections of Black Flag are satisfyingly open-ended. You're often given an area full of guards, with nothing but your skills to guide you to your goals. It's a shame there are no palpable rewards for those of us that prefer going unseen/unheard, as it's a tad too easy to win in open combat. The fact that more often than not you're given the option to run away and hide rather than suffer instant desynchronisation (and failure) is a good thing, however.Not so good are the jarring and constantly recurring chunks of archaic AC that should be long buried with Altar and Ezio. Eavesdropping and tailing missions can do one. Instant fail states during chase missions are equally frustrating, though thankfully rarely take more than three or four trial and error attempts to get past.With so much game on offer it's not surprising that certain elements take a quality hit. Even finishing the story after around 30 hours you'll find your total synchronisation sits around the 50% mark. Assassin contracts, naval contracts and crafting distractions right out of Far Cry 3 fill out the experience.There are both good and bad types of collectibles on offer, mind you. Shiny amber Animus Fragments litter every map and gleam at you relentlessly. Collecting them all feels like a grind. Treasure Maps on the other hand are superb excuses to tear your eyes away from the mini map. Each parchment gives you vague clues as to a buried treasure's whereabouts forcing you to explore the stupefyingly beautiful surroundings around you.And the world really is beautiful. Sweeping vistas maintain every ounce of minute detail and quality, making the series trope of sync point 360 degree camera pans worthy rewards. Tiny details consistently thrill at their discovery. Sneaking into a fort during a squall, we were treated to individual droplets of water rippling on the cobblestones underfoot. We can't remember the last time we spent so long just watching foliage rustle in the breeze.Conclusion:Black Flag contains some of the best instances of pathetic fallacy i've yet seen in a game. When the proverbial poop hits the propeller, cyclones and rogue waves batter at the Jackdaw. In other emotive instances, ominous fog or dull twilight lends the Caribbean suitably disturbing hues. This visual resplendence makes us wonder: if the devs weren't keeping one eye on the current gen version's scalability, just how much more could they be capable of?The fact that ACIV is so good was by no means a foregone conclusion. There was a sense that, as the dust settled after ACIII, Ubisoft had missed a beat. Brows rightly furrowed as commentators pondered whether the series had already overshot its zenith. Much like the first Assassin's Creed, Black Flag isn't perfect. But the treasure trove of memorable experiences on offer here put all but the very best open worlds to shame.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000G7PMX2","reviewerName":"Tommy Sixx Morais","summary":"Doesn't hold up as well as other Wii launch titles","reviewText":"Red Steel was one of the most popular launch games for the Nintendo Wii back in late 2006 largely due to Nintendo's advertising for the game. The game was one of the more mature titles (rated T for Teen) of the Wii launch games. I didn't get to play Red Steel at launch because I couldn't get a Nintendo Wii until 2008. About two years ago I found this game used for $ 4.99 at a local EB games store; I figured I'd buy it since I've always wanted to give it a try. I probably would have been more impressed with Red Steel if I had played it at launch but today it still comes off as a fun launch title even though it suffers from a few flaws.The story was based on Japanese mobs, known as Yakuza. You play as Scott Monroe and you're engaged to some girl and just about to see her father for the very first time. The meeting is ruined by the mafia, you then have to save the father, rescue the girl and so on. As far as storyline goes this is acceptable and it works. The Japanese feel of the game is something that I thought was very cool. With Red Steel being one of the launch games you obviously couldn't expect to be perfect, and it certainly wasn't. The controls are fairly simple, you push doors with the nunchuk and shoot and aim with the Wiimote basically. The camera is flawed, sometimes if you move the Wiimote slightly too fast the camera will move where you didn't want it to which can get a little frustrating. You get used to the flawed camera, it doesn't ruin the game but it's not one of the best camera responses I've ever seen. In comparison to games that came after it, Red Steel has very poor controls. You get used to the shooting easily but the swordsfighting with the katana feels awkward because the controls aren't as responsive as they should be resulting in the fights having no realistic feeling whatsoever. The swordsfights aren't fun at all because you have to block your opponent multiple times before being able to attack in most cases, plus most of the time they are just too easy to beat. The graphics were at times good and other times bad, it's not one of the Wii's best looking games let's keep it at that. Despite all this the game manages to pull you in and you're kind feeling the intensity and the stress all the way trough.Today, more than four years after the launch of the Nintendo Wii some of the launch titles are still very good games, such as Twilight Princess and Rayman Raving Rabids. Unfortunately, Red Steel while providing good action fun is not one of those launch titles that stood the test of time very well. There was initially a lot of hype around Red Steel when it came out; it was one of Nintendo's most hyped games. For $4.99 I can't say that I'm disappointed, the game provides some fun and is entertaining but it's not one of the best Wii games. To the game's credit, it was one of the first Wii titles so it's understandable that it was basically a game that tested the Wii, it also must have been much better back then. The game is a bit dated and is not quite up to the Wii standards we've come to expect and does get a bit repetitive but it remains a fun launch title after all. I'm not all criticizing I'm being objective, so games stand the test of times better than others. If you're curious it's a game that you might want to rent before buying. Overall I rate it 3/5 stars.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2011"}

Games are often extremely ambitious and massive in scale. There are bound to be conflicts and problems. I get it. For example, I didn't complain about the bugs in Skyrim. It's a complex game and the programming bugs where of a complex nature - they did, however, get the BASICS right and they were solid from the start.In the case of Mass Effect 3, the BASIC ability to import your character doesn't work. It's not only the very first option offered in the game, it's literally one of the keys to the game. Mass Effect, as true fans know, is meant to be an immersive continuing story with characters and a universe that the player is meant to care about and become invested in - especially Commander Shepard. I mean what's more important then the player's identity in the game?The ability to import your Shepard was promised and NOT delivered. (Sorry, you get stars taken off for that.) Of course, we all know they can do it since they did it in ME2. We also know that accomplishing this ability requires only the most rudimentary and BASIC programming skills. Was it that they just didn't care? Really, look at everything else they are accomplishing in the game, only to have blown a simple yet important detail like this. It needlessly drags the game - probably a brilliant five star game - into average status - at least for the time being.They will probably fix this. I hope. I'm sure there's a first grader around that might have time to fix it after school or something. (I mean it's essentially just graphics that have been assigned a numerical value, then transferring these numbers and graphics from their own software saves to their own software.)The game and its true fans deserve better.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0001ADAME","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyableReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Goldenroom","summary":"Red Dead Revolver- How does it compare to GTA?","reviewText":"When I saw Red Dead Revolver, I thought it was Grand Theft Auto in a western setting. Well, to a degree it is, but it's also its own game too. Obviously you will notice that the graphics are in the Grand Theft auto cartoon style... Otherwise it's a new ballgame.One noticable difference from GTA is the lack of freedom. This game is very focused of action rather then walking around a giant environment. You do get to walk around town a bit and talk to locals, but don't expect to be free roaming and shooting innocents like GTA.Also, the controls are much more complicated then GTA. The most noticable thing is no auto aim. It takes a little while to get used to moving your character with one control while trying to aim with the other, but don't let that keep you from buying the game. The controls for the most part are tight and once you get used to them, the game will seem easy.If you love Clint Eastwood Style westerns or you just like bloody violent video games, then this is a essential title to pick up. You get to live all the quintessential and classic moments from western films, such as saving the train from being robbed, massive shoot outs in the ghost town, bar room brawls and more! This is the next best thing to actually being in the oldwest.Graphics=4.25Sound and music=4.25Control=4.5Fun Factor=4.5Replay value=3.5TOTAL RATING=4.2lets hope for a sequel!

For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Teco","summary":"The Luigi's Mansion for the bigger ones!!","reviewText":"Resident Evil is a very famous game because it has never failed in giving us a spook.

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs.

Really it's a good game (for $20 anyway) but boy does it annoy at times. The story is lengthy and engaging and the acting fantastic, but the main character's bout of depression and self destruction got tiresome. Gameplay is fun but glitchy. As many here have mentioned, you do occasionally get stuck while in cover, forcing a checkpoint reload. Another gripe of mine lies with the game being cinematic to a fault. Whether it be a lengthy monologue while strolling sloooowly towards your destination or a particularly long cutscene (of which there are many), the game is determined to ensure you experience every agonizing second of it, New Game + or not.The biggest payne though is the difficulty which tends to skyrocket at various moments, leading to retries after retries after retries. I'm not opposed to a game using health items instead of a recharging bar, in fact I prefer that to the tiresome blood-splatter-color-fading screens that accompany rechargeable health. But it takes so little to put Max down that you'll be spending most of your shootouts on the ground writhing in payne than on your feet.Despite these problems the game is fun, especially considering that it includes cheats which gives it high replay in my book. If you want a good 3rd person shooter and can find this for under $30, you won't be disappointed.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2012"}

Besides that, they all look exactly the same.-The prize fights were too darn hard.-Can't drive anything but cars.-Can't take a cab anywhere like in GTA IV.

Well, imagine if the game was separated into mini planets, and you see Mario soaring through the air as he was launched into the air. That, my friends, is Mario Galaxy.The game starts out with Mario roaming through a gorgeously detailed Mushroom Kingdom as he runs to Peach's Castle...for cake. But then, guess what? Not only does Bowser kidnap Peach again. He kidnaps Peach in a very epic cutscene! Unfortunately for Mario, a Magikoopa sends him flying into the galaxy, knocking him out.Now, the main game is playing through very big and graphical 3D worlds bouncing on Goombas, collecting coins, and all kinds of other stuff. But, like Super Mario 64, you must collect Stars. Collect enough Stars to be able to play in another world, or maybe have Mario tussle with Bowser. If you were to play the game, you'll notice that everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, is much, much deeper and more fun than I am describing it.The music is nothing like I've ever heard in a Mario game. I mean, seriously. Once I played the game until after I beat the first Bowser boss, I was thinking \"Oh, my god. These tracks are from a MARIO game??\". The music also breathes air into the spacey atmosphere in the game.The one major complaint I have with this game is that the 2-Player mode is stupid. There's almost nothing the second player can do to help the first player play through the game. Sure, he/she can collect Star Bits, launch them at enemies, and fling those...rubber..trees at enemies. But that's pretty much it. The second player doesn't even have his/her own character (Thanks, Mario Galaxy 2).But other than the 2-Player mode, the game is amazing.

Great story, graphics, weapons, missions, etc, etc. I cannot think of a negative thing to say about Far Cry 3. I completed this game on my PS3, and I did not have any glitches, freezes, or frame rate issues at all. I put about 40-45 hours into this game, and the only thing I did not complete was finding all of the relics. I found about half of the 120, and if you don't have the FC3 Game Guide, I don't see how you could find them all. I did have the guide, but I just got tired of looking for them.This was soooo much fun to play and it's completely open to play however you want. I always unlocked the radio towers and outposts before continuing on with the main missions for both islands. I thought it made it easier to play for me. I played with as much stealth as I could meaning I used my silenced weapons quite a bit as well as stealth kills. This is my kind of style, BUT, you can certainly play balls out with guns blazing if that fits your style.You just never know what is going to happen whether being attacked by a shark or leopard, or a jeep full of soldiers driving up right behind you! It was just a blast to play and I put it right up there as one of my favorite games. With that said though, I don't think I will find myself playing it again, because I would probably wind up going through the game just like I did the first time. So the replay value isn't that high for this game.I have played Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, BioShock 1&2, Mass Effect 2&3, inFAMOUS Collection, GOW Saga, Assassin's Creed Ezio's Collection, GTA IV The Complete Edition, and Arkham City, and LOVED all of these games.

{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"Stick To The Beaten Path","reviewText":"\"Knights of the Old Republic\" has been my favorite game for years now, and I've been eagerly anticipating any opportunity to indulge in a similar experience now that the series has sort-of dead-ended.After getting a 360 for Christmas, \"Mass Effect\" was the first game I bought for it. As of now, I've played it through twice just to make sure most of the experience wasn't lost on me. Does it live up to expectation? In a lot of ways, yes.For me, the big thing ME had to live up to in KOTOR's wake was the conversations. When a game is based on the ability to interact with your fellow party members as if you were actually there...it has be able to pull that off rather well to keep up the illusion. Thankfully, it does, as each crewmember aboard your ship has a very interesting story to tell.The actual combat system is, in my opinion, one of the most entertaining and enjoyable systems I've ever played in an RPG. Weapons can be upgraded with ammo enhancements, armor can be reinforced, and the \"magic\" system evolves into something that's almost a guilty pleasure to use. Lifting a baddie into the air and shooting at them with your poison rounds until they dissolve never really gets old, nor should it.The story itself is one that does echo KOTOR in some respects, but on the whole is very original for a video game. Gamers should feel like they didn't deserve such treatment when it all winds down. It's filled with plot twists and populated with very unique creatures with their own cultures and mannerisms (but all speak English, go figure xD). By the end of the game, expect yourself to be well-versed with many of the game's alien races.Unfortunately, if one tries to venture beyond this epic quest to save the galaxy, you might find yourself trying to decide why it should be saved. The sidequests (outside the Citadel, at least) are ridiculously cookie-cutter, aggravating, and very unrewarding. And there are a lot of them. Each requiring you to drive a very unmanageable land rover over extremely rocky and always-barren terrain. The most you might find on each of the dozens of interchangeable planetary surfaces are a few mineral deposits, probes, or colonies that are of the same exact construction no matter where you go. (To those who completed the metal/gasses quests, you have my eternal respect and admiration for dealing with that.)This was the aggravating part for me. It literally doesn't matter where you go outside the main storyline, you will find absolutely nothing of interest. Even when you are tasked to head to Earth's own moon, which is now inhabited by millions of people, you somehow managed to get stuck patrolling a barren crater.And for having party members with so much to say typically, on these sidequests they fall annoyingly silent. (I know were probably dealing with the limited disc space now, but still). It simply feels like this half of the game was slapped on at the last minute with little regard to content as long as it took up some space.Still, the only reason I'm giving this game 3 stars is because there is content within the game that just shouldn't be there. In an attempt to make this galaxy expansive, Bioware populated it with worlds that are as interesting and unique as billiard balls.If you decide to stick with the main storyline, your view of how RPGs should be made will be forever changed. But take a close look at the sidequests and you'll find that they haven't changed enough.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-24-2009"}

I start playing them, get enthralled in the historical context and parkouring around all over the place.  Then, I invariably get bored.  The systems in place never seemed to hold my attention.  The most I've played an Assassin's Creed game was probably the second one, but even that game I never finished.  Never even came close.  Because boredom.  With my new Xbox One, with its kind of depressing slate of exclusive games, I wanted to make sure that I had a game that I knew wasn't a rushed launch title.  So I sighed and picked up Black Flag, expecting to play it a little bit and then go back to playing XCOM on my PC.  I was shocked to find that I didn't hate Black Flag.Actually, I absolutely love it.The biggest problems with these franchises (see: Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed, Elder Scrolls) is that each game is released as iterations, in that the core game is remarkably similar to the first game, but each time they iterate it, refine it.  They change the story but you are doing pretty much the same thing you've done in Assassin's Creed or Call of Duty.  The story and settings might be different.  They might have given you a dog (or a Dragon Shout).  But you're still playing the same game.  In that regard, Black Flag follows suit.  You're still assassinating Templars.  You're still free-running across buildings.  You're still performing absolutely annoying eavesdropping missions or sometimes frustrating sneaking missions.  You're still caught up in some metaphysical story.  You're still being interrupted with annoying modern day Abstergo interludes.  But this iteration has a boat, something somewhat introduced in AC3, and it makes you a pirate.  And that has changed absolutely everything, for me, at least..  There's just more to this iteration that makes me want to play than any time before.Examples. Naval fortresses.  These are heavily fortified areas that turn into a mini-boss battle of sorts, between your ship, the Jackdaw, and the fortress's armaments.  Once you've destroyed the armaments, it immediately segues into sieging the fortress on foot.  It culminates in an assassination and the keep becomes yours and sheds light on the map of the area surrounding it.  These, so far, have been eminently thrilling for me.Sea battles.  The first time I fought a ship in a stormy sea, with rogue waves crashing into us, high seas causing eye-sight issues and complications for firing cannons, and water spouts spawning around us, I was entranced.  The epic scale, the graphics, everything was just so exciting.  And then when the ship was dead in the water and I could board it, swinging from my ship to the burning wreckage of my foe, before jamming my sword into an unaware British soldier was everything I imagined as a kid, growing up on pirate films.  It was exciting.  It was thrilling.  It was different.Hunting/fishing.  Yes, hunting is back.  Yes, it's still kind of annoying.  But it's tied to your growth (health upgrades, pistol upgrades, storage upgrades, etc.) and presented a lot easier.  Each island or area has a certain type of animal, marked on the map.  And it doesn't take a lot of skins to create new items.  But the game also introduced fishing and these little moments can be thrilling.  When you go harpooning, you're in a small boat and it's just you and a very large fish/whale.  There's a good variety between the whales (humpback, killer, even the mythical white whale) and sharks (Bull Sharks, Hammerheads and, of course, a Great White), and they add little wrinkles to the combat, depending on the animal.Later on, as these games do with breadcrumbs, Black Flag introduced the diving bell.  This device allows you to investigate shipwrecks on the bottom of the ocean.  These are both thrilling and terror-inducing, reducing you to a weaponless man in an often shark-infested area.  The first time a shark lunged at me from behind, spawning a QTE minigame, I almost leaped out of my chair.  It was so intense.  I had to yell \"Xbox record that\" to share the moment.  These shipwrecks are all different, with their own sets of obstacles and threats.  Some include sharks and rely on racing from wreckage to areas with heavy seaweed to hide in.  Some involve underwater cave systems, requiring you to be quick before you run out of air.  All of them are thrilling and add just a bit more to the game.The rest of the game is pretty much the same Assassin's Creed game you've been playing since the beginning, just refined and iterated.  You can upgrade your ship, the Jackdaw, by adding different cannons, increasing the durability, etc.  You can also purchase items to customize the appearance of the ship.  And of course, there's a home base that you can start sinking your money into, to upgrade it.  I just feel more attached to this part than I have in previous games, mostly because of the pirate motif.I don't really have much else to say on other aspects of the game.  I don't really care about the stories in these games; they are more of a means to an end, for me.  The graphics are awesome, but that's to be expected.  I don't know how this version compares to the PS4 (other than the PS4 version is rendered in native 1080p) or the previous generation, but I honestly don't care because it looks beautiful, particularly the open sea.  It is engulfing in its majesty and I haven't seen water effects look this realistic (though the boat sometimes seems to be floating through it, when you're in travel mode).  I will say that the on-land portion is mostly just okay, for me, but for fans of previous Assassin's Creed games, you'll probably find the same stuff to love.  What makes this game and what I wanted to focus on was how much different it feels because of the pirate theme.  Black Flag is the most fun when I'm on the open sea, destroying ships, fighting epic battles, tackling legendary ships and exploring the massive world.  I really hope that they will stick with this motif a little bit because this is the first time I've truly enjoyed an Assassin's Creed game and will be the first Assassin's Creed game I've completed.  Very much recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

I wouldn't call it a \"survival horror\" per se.  It's nothing like the Resident Evil series, but it does deliver plenty of chills.  I had to deduct a star because I would have loved to see some cinematic cutscenes interspersed with the storyline, which really doesn't develop until much later in the game.  It's not until the 8th or 9th Chapter when you're fully hit with what's going on (i.e. the Unitologists).  Also, the semi-3rd person view was a little clunky at times.  Maybe this would have been better in strictly first-person?  I don't know, but that's just my two cents on the issue.  Overall, it's a must-own title, so be sure to pick it up, especially at this great price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2010"}

I love that there are now three locations - New York, Florida, and Cuba, although I will admit that three cities also present a problem with immersion into the game.  I love the Don's View - the cities look really cool.  This game, however, isn't all great.  The graphics are good but not great.  The AI sometimes isn't all that smart or responsive.  It's a little too easy to swap out your crew in the middle of a mission - I like that members of your crew have specialties, but they should have made that more important to the planning stages of a mission, maybe.After taking all the negatives into consideration, I still think this is a very enjoyable game.

The graphics and effects in the game are very good and while the graphics of the characters is decent it doesn't reach the area range of other FPS games like Modern warfare 3 or Battlefield 3 but again that is to be expected since this game came out around 2008 and the other two previous games have had the time to use the more modern techniques and effects to give them what they have now.  If there is a flaw in the game it would be the voice cast, while not all are bad there are some in it that you wish you could censor out rather then having to listen to them throughout the game.  Also it does feel a little like the saints rows game as you can accept sub-quest assignments to booster yourself and equipment building up your equipment.  Also like one reviewer pointed out it seemed that the A.I. for the enemies was sometimes lacking, what I mean is you would be in a firefight but one or two would stop firing and I thought were reloading but when I came straight up to their faces it was only then they started to react but of course it was already to late.  It didn't happen a lot but when it did it was kind of unnerving and a little irritating as with some levels you pretty much just had to aim and shoot without worrying about the enemy taking you down as they just seemed to be in a daze.  Still for the price of the game and for the enjoyment I got from it all together I still say the games worth a look at for anyone either who enjoys FPS or is just starting to play FPS games...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000088KH1","description":"Taking place between the second and third movie in the motion picture trilogy, Enter the Matrix features a mixture of gunplay and martial arts that bends the rules. Insane driving and stunts and the chance to pilot the fastest hovercraft in the fleet proves that this isn't just a game that's set in the Matrix universe; it's an experience that's designed to be a true part of the entire Matrix mythos. Enter the Matrix is the story-behind-the-story and features slo-mo bullet time effects, never-before-seen live-action footage starring the cast of the movies, and plenty more. Also available for the Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Gamecube, and Windows PC.","reviewerName":"Nick Schwartz","summary":"Three and a Half Stars - True to the Matrix","reviewText":"When Enter the Matrix came out alongside the Matrix Reloaded, it got caught up in all the disappointment surrounding the movie sequel, and was bombarded with negative reviews from critics.  Well, neither the two movie sequels nor the game deserve all of the criticism they often get, and, at a low price, Enter the Matrix warrants a purhase.You play as either Ghost or Niobe, (two comparitively minor characters from Reloaded and Revolutions), through a story that begins before Reloaded, and weaves in and out of it, ending at the start of Revolutions.  Through exclusive movie cut scenes, (which the Wachowski brothers wrote and filmed with all the real actors exclusively for this game - you won't find many of them anywhere else) some of the events in Reloaded are better explained.As for the gameplay, it is played from a third-person perspective, and is generally quite fun.  At worst, it is an average third-person shooter/beat 'em-up.  At best, you ARE playing the Matrix films.  Combat is divided up between shooting enemies with a handful of weapons, and hand-to-hand martial arts combat, just like the three films.  By using Focus, (slow-mo, \"bullet time\") many more fancier moves become available.  Dive in to a gun fight, propel off a nearby wall into a kick to the head, and of course, run along walls, and jump off guns blazing.  Press against corners, and jump out to fire off a shot or two - the combat is generally fun, but the gunplay gets boring pretty quickly.  Hand-to-hand combat is awesome though, and the animation is top-notch.  During martial arts confrontations the camera will swing around to your side for a more cinematic feel, and rotate a bit like the fight scenes in the movies, but it won't interfere with the combat, since it's really just a button masher at its heart.  Fun though, and true to the spirit of the films.  Still, many of the moves, like hanging from pipes by your legs to shoot enemies below, will only be used once, if at all.Also, occasionally you will run in to some glitches, and might even need to reset the game.  Once it froze during a loading screen, and once my character got permanently stuck beneath the floor of an elevator I was supposed to be in.  Annoying?  Sure.  But the glitches won't ruin your overall experience.The graphics aren't anything special, but they certainly aren't horrible.  Some of the in-game cinematics (the ones that use the in-game graphic's engine) look awful, but some of them look picture perfect.What Enter the Matrix does best, however, is that it truly feels like the movies.  Right down to the details.  The green tint on all levels within the Matrix; the way pillars crumble when shot, and characters interact with the environment (throw a character in to a book shelf, and books will come tumbling out); the music, taken directly from the films, the costumes, and lighting; even the fitting (although boring) cheat system: computer hacking.  Everything comes together to make this a very believable Matrix experience.Some levels are far too short, and some aren't really fun at all, such as the sewer levels, but all in all, this is pretty much waht you'd expect from a game based on the Matrix.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2004"}

Besides better graphics, more realistic models and gameplay, not much has changed, for better or worse.Some thoughts* I like the play calling and ability to chose where you want your players to block. Being able to audible a player a certain route and switching another play to block is invaluable. It allows the gamer to read the defense and adjust accordingly.* As real as it gets. Although Madden has no competitor, Madden - to their credit - still does try to make this game as realistic as possible. Passing, routes, kicking the field goal are all realistic. However, there could be some improvement in the running style. Inside handoffs, pitches, counters are good, but the outside handoff and pitch seems awkward. It's difficult to make a quick reflex turn when running on the outside.* Fan and crowd animation isn't so good. You'd think by now that the fans and crowds of this game would at least look remotely good as the NFL players. It's not. Fans at the stadium just look terrible.For what it's worth, the game still hasn't improved that much in the past 3-4 years.

As heroes, they explore familiar battlefields, discover new lands, and take on epic quests and challenges in Blizzard's massively multiplayer online role-playing game. Blizzard has taken care to make the game accessible and fun both for hard-core 60-hour-a-week players and for more casual adventurers.","reviewerName":"Dmg","summary":"Best MMORPG Ever -- Buy NOW!","reviewText":"World of Warcraft is simply put, the best MMORPG ever created. Blizzard spent a good amount of time creating and testing this masterpiece, and it shows off. No matter what type of games you like to play, you'll like playing WoW. Even if your PC isn't blazing fast, you'll get perfect quality out of WoW. Everything in the game just feels right.Let me split my review into sections;GRAPHICS--------The graphics in WoW are a splendor to behold. The textures and geometry are excellent and really show how much detail Blizzard put into this game. The visuals aren't DOOM 3 or Half-Life 2 in extreme quality, but this is a MMO with quite a bit of people and low system requirements. The shadows, weather and particle effects, and 'bonus' graphical work (such as footprints in the snow, etc) are above average. With all the visual settings maxed out, along with my graphic card's hardware AA/AF maxed, the game does not stutter, even on my mid-range PC. I'm amazed I can have everything maxed, having my screen look gorgeous, and have perfect v-sync frame rates constantly.SOUND/MUSIC--------Music in WoW is, of course, spectacular. Blizzard is known for having awesome scores that are dynamic and suiting. There's a ton of different scores that dynamically change depending on where you are and what's going on, and they're all near-godly and memorable. The sound design is also great: each individual sound effect and voice sounds like what it should. No complaints in the sound department.SERVERS--------Blizzard has a good amount of servers setup. Quite a lot of them, in fact. Not only that, but there's specific servers for PvP, so you can be on one of those if you enjoy dueling. PvE servers can have PvP game play as well, but both parties need to agree beforehand. The servers are lightning fast and I've yet to have downtime.COMMUNITY--------So far, I've experienced a nice community in-game. I've played three different races and the communities in each of them (almost each race has its own starting location in the world of the game) have been very nice, considerate, and helpful. Granted, not everyone acts as they should, but I've had an enjoyable time with the community so far.INTERFACE--------I really can't think up a way Blizzard could improve WoW's interface. It's mildly complex and takes a bit to get used to, but once you get over those first minutes it feels like second nature. Chatting is simple and fun, with numerous functions. Everything about the game is clearly described, explained, labeled, and shown in the manual and in-game. There are also tips that help you with just about everything as you experience it the first time.GAMEPLAY--------The most important part of a game and WoW does it great. There's so much to do in the GIGANTIC world that you won't want to stop. Just a few of the 'professions' you can do: cooking, fishing, mining, blacksmithing, first aid, and alchemy. Besides all those you can just do the 2000+ quests, level up your character, join groups, create or join a guild, and more. It really is like an online world, and it's addicting. The quests range from extremely simple to very advanced, with plenty to choose from. The races are distinct but balanced, and each one has its own feel and flavor. The classes are well balanced also (except for Warrior, which is pretty underpowered, but Blizzard has said they're already working on it for the next patch). There's enough classes and races to suit anyone's taste, and there's definitely enough so that you can have multiple, different characters without feeling bored. The pace of the game feels just right; not too fast, not too slow. Death isn't a huge hassle, quest rewards are actually rewarding, the races are cool and different, the classes are exciting and aren't disappointments or unbalanced, the game is as simple or nearly-overwhelmingly complex as YOU want it to be, Blizzard's support is fantastic, and there isn't a single feature left out of the game. In a word: perfection.All in all, WoW is definitely one of the best gaming experiences I've had, and I haven't even come close to experiencing it all. If you like Blizzard's previous games, role-playing games, and/or other MMOs, you'll love WoW for sure. Even if you don't like those, there's still a very high chance of you falling in love with it, since it's just so damn fun to play.The monthly fee is well worth the countless hours of bliss you'll receive, and they provide discounts when you pay in bulk, like 3-months and 6-months.I recommend buying the strategy guide (more like strategy tome, it's over 400 pages!) if you're new to MMOs, since there's a lot to learn. The game's manual is thick too, and there's plenty of in-game and online resources available.If you can find it, purchase the Collector's Edition since for $30 more you get quite a lot (the game on 4 CDs, the game on 1 DVD, the soundtrack, a large making-of book, an exclusive in-game 'pet,' and more).World of Warcraft is a game I very highly recommend for everyone to buy and experience, even gamers who don't like online play.GET WORLD OF WARCRAFT NOW!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2004"}

It has everything the competition has plus brillant ideas like the mailbox system and auction house. The soundtrack is top notch as are the graphics. If you've played WC3 you'll feel right at home. It runs smoothly on a variety of systems thanks to the powerful video option menu, heh try running EQ2 on a sub par system.That being said at this current time there is some lag problems specially in capital cities. There are also some minor to moderate class bugs for certain classes which blizzard is being very slow to address. They seem to have incompetent patch people and there is very poor communication between the developers and the players. The board moniters never seem to know what is going on.All things said though, every MMO has lag and bug issues for the first few months. The lag of communication is even more vexing but I am confident that blizzard will streamline things in time as this is their first MMO. WoW is still the greatest MMORPG ever made and shall be for some time. I highly recomend it.Oh and please if your going to join an RP server, then RP if not thats what the PvE servers are for.

It's a lot of fun, but based on initial play I think that with only about a year's gaming experience with a Nintendo DS, we have a long way to before we will get out of the \"easy\" mode of games.The PS3 set up is very easy. You almost don't need the manual; the first time that you turn it on it automatically takes you through the essentials. I read the manual, but I'm old. I actually would have set up the System Settings, User Profiles and Internet connection faster if I had left the manual in the box. The thing comes ready to game.The PS3 game graphics are very cool in HD. We've played Tiger Woods 2007 (did pretty good too!), Full Auto 2 (we're horrible at this, but it's a lot of fun...we'll learn) and Call of Duty 3 (awesome game...my sons' favorite). We also tried PS2's Resident Evil 4 (Oh don't worry...I parentally guided), and while there were noticeable differences in the graphics, the PS2 game was immediately was recognized by the PS3, and the PS3 took me through the steps needed to make sure that PS2 format games could be saved to the PS3's hard drive.There are no overly long loading pauses...even at startup. Gameplay during each game chapter is continuous. It's absolutely amazing. The PS2 game does have loading pauses during gameplay that PS3 games don't have, but the lower quality graphics certainly aren't distracting.As I said earlier, the PS3 comes out of the box pretty much plug and play. However, I do have a comment about that:What do you call a company that raves about their new system as high definition, but then sends you only a standard definition cable connection? How about asinine? Or greedy? Stupid? Okay....You call the company SONY. No HDMI or component connection cable included.I should have known better. I mean, if most toy and game makers won't include batteries, why would I think that SONY would include a high def connection cable with the PS3? I guess I'm the stupid one.What irked me most about this was that I thought that I had the chance of this happening covered with normal component cables (like for your DVD player). But no. After pulling the PS3 out of the box I found that there was no red/blue/green video component connection on the back of the PS3. Only HDMI OUT, Multi A/V Out, Ethernet IN and Digital Audio Out. I of course would prefer HDMI, but the 2003 36\" SONY TV in the kids' playroom that I was attaching the PS3 to is only DVI or component compatible...not HDMI.The Multi A/V on the PS3 outputs high def, but the output connecter type is exclusive to PS systems. So it was out to the store to find a PS3 Multi A/V OUT component cable...(my explanation of this cable to the retailers was always met with the same response: Retailer: \"You mean you want an HDMI cable.\" Me: \"No. I want a component cable that has the Red/Blue/Green video and Red and White audio connections on one end and a USBish-looking Playstation connection on the other end.\") None of the major PS3 sellers had it in stock, but amazingly they ALL had 60 GB PS3s in stock! I finally found the correct cable at a major game retailer chain store (that also had PS3s in stock).So, overall the PS3 so far is awesomely fun. As far as the missing HD connection with the purchase? All the retailers seemed to have the SONY canned response, \"SONY was trying to keep the price down.\" But if I then need to go buy it anyway, what's the difference!!! SONY should have included an HD cable, and that's the only reason I took a star away from the overall rating of the PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2007"}

The first playthrough I watched all the cutscenes and most of the codecs. The second playthrough I skipped all the cutscenes and codecs. I experienced this game on a new 50\" plasma.The graphics are the best. I've played every major game so far on every system, and Metal Gear Solid 4 wins the Pretty Prize. Both with the art design and the technology. You won't find a more impressive game this generation. If you care about graphics at all, this is a must play.The gameplay is endlessly enjoyable with genuine depth. Every level is like a little sandbox. Snake starts on one side, the goal is on the other side, and you can work your way there with whatever tools and tactics you like. It all feels tight. Stealth, shooting, hand-to-hand combat. Play it your way. I like shooting the best. All of the weapons feel incredibly satisfying. A lot of shooter games feel generic and hollow. MGS4 feels genuine.The storytelling is insane. I've played every single metal gear game ever made. I appreciated all the inside jokes, and the comedy in general. Very few games have this much comedy, and this much fantasitc sci-fi military awesomeness. On my second playthrough, skipping all the cutscenes, it really felt like 75% of the game was missing. The cutscenes are crucial to the enjoyment of the experience. That said, the storytelling has a very bizarre Japanese-style circular-drama structure. A 15 min scene might have the same information repeated 7 times, with different dialogue phrasing, to reach different nuances. This is not like your typical Hollywood action movie. It's not paced like a Michael Bay movie. Of the 12 hours of cutscenes, there is maybe 1 hour of intense action and 11 hours of delicate character study. Some people love that, some don't. It's a personal preference.Most likely you already know if you will like MGS4. If you want to buy it, buy it now. You won't regret it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-05-2009"}

The online component is interesting in that you can customize your character, but the gameplay seems pretty standard to me (that's not necessarily a bad thing).  Overall, Guns of the Patriots is probably the best game to be released so far in 2008.

With games that really stretched beyond the imagination for fans like Super Mario Galaxy, which re-defined Mario alone in adventures, and the battle smashing action of Super Smash Brothers Brawl that dominated fans hearts all around the worls, Nintendo really shows what it takes to make great video games. But, that also can be said with the Mario Kart series, which finally makes it debut on the Wii. But, following the innovation that Mario Kart DS had from the Nintendo DS wasn't so easy, largely because it was the first DS handheld title to use the Wi-Fi online gaming to an outrageous excitement for gamers all around the world. Now, it is time for the Wii to take that on and race to the checkered flag.Mario Kart Wii for the Nintendo Wii, brings in all that fast-paced excitement racers have wanted and even more. The game adds a whole lot of new and exciting features to use. You can now race as many as 12 racers online through the online gaming, and bring the action over the top, and use that skill and excitement on over 40 different tracks: 10 battle tracks and 32 exciting race tracks that are both new and featured from the earlier Mario Kart games like D.K. Jungle Highway and Sherbet Land from Mario Kart 64. The new tracks are also exciting that will have you racing and bouncing on top of mushrooms from the all-new Mushroom Gorge, and have you crusing the shopping malls and racing down fligts of escaltors with the brand new Coconut Mall course, or racing across the tree trunks of the new Maple Leaf Highway. Every single track is great for beginners and die hard Mario Kart fans of all ages.The gameplay also has a few new surprises, as you not just rave in karts, you also get to race on motorbikes too, bringing more action and variety to each of the players delight. There are also a few new power-ups here too including the Mega Mushroom, from the DS game New Super Mario Brothers, which makes your racer giant-sized, so you can squash your opponents on your way to the checkered flag, and the lightning cloud which shrinks you down to a tiny racer, so you squeeze underneath your opponents and take them by surprise. There also are a few new characters here to unlock in the game as well. You can choose to race with the classics like Mario, Yoshi, Bowser and Luigi, and 6 hidden characters to unlock and master like Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy, Funky Kong and Diddy Kong from Donkey Kong Barrel Blast and even Bowser Bones (the skeleton Bowser boss from New Super Mario Brothers.)The control is also a bit new here, with the use of the Wii Wheel. The wheel is easy to setup and hooks right onto the Wii remote. You can steer your racers easily through each and every race by turning your wheel left and right, and performing nifty stunts like a wheelie or a 360 on a jump. While the control with the Wii Wheel takes a lot to get used to for veterans, there are others ways to control the game. Like Super Smash Brothers Brawl, gamers can also use the Wii & nunchuck controls, or the classic controller and even the Nintendo Gamecube controller, so veterans can feel more comfortable in anyway they want to race. The graphics here are also well-designed, by bringing new excitement in restoring the classic courses, and a lot of great surprising new features that are the delight to anyone who loves the Mario Kart games.All in all, Mario Kart Wii is definitely one of the best games I've ever enjoyed for the Nintendo Wii. I absolutely loved the need for plumber speed, and it shows in each and every race. This is definitely a must buy for your Wii video game library, that is sure to be a thrilling race and not even close to wiping out anytime soon. So start your Wii-motes, because the race is not ever going to stop.Graphics: ASound: A-Control: B for the Wii Wheel; B+ for the Wii & nunchuck controllers, A for the Classic and Gamecube ControllersFun & Enjoyment: A- for solo gamers; A for multiplayer actionOverall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2008"}

ONLY BECAUSE I STUCK WITH IT!","reviewText":"Dead Space 2 is good.  Best of all NO Mass Driver Cannon Mini Game in Dead Space 2.  The game play was solid.  The controls were reasonably good.  The battles were great on easy mode not so easy it was a cake walk but not so hard that the bosses and challenges were impossible to beat.  Oh yeah I struggled through Dead Space 2 even on its so called EASY Mode but; I have cerebral palsy so my struggles are expected even on EASY Mode.  Dead Space 2 was still text book creepy.  I could tell where some of the artwork was recycled from Dead Space the original.  I have no problem with recycling artwork but more effort should have been taken to change it just enough to appear fresh which is a small issue.  Dead Space 2 kept its fun factor high.  Its very easy to get fully engaged in the game so much that you feel as if you are there.  Few games do weightless space really well and Dead Space 2 leads the pack.  Also Dead Space 2 does zero oxygen environments in very convincing ways too.  The controller layout was better in Dead Space 2 but still needs a little refining.  The Dead Space 2 storyline was linear but solid.  The weapons were a little underpowered compared to the challenges they had to overcome making game play a painful chore at times.The only annoying near constant glitch I found in the game was the timing of cut scenes had a tendency to interfere with game play.  Cut scenes would end just as must do quickly challenges began and the handoff was seldom smooth.  The lag between when a cut scene ended and the gamer gets control again often made performing must do tasks difficult.  Dead Space 2 cut scenes are some of the best out there BUT, they should not impede game play.  The Dead Space 2 graphics and sounds were first rate.  The sound effects give a sense of dimensionality that just creeps me out.  Listened to at the proper volume you can hear subtle sounds of necromorphs moving about within the bowels of the ship.  You hear layers of sounds at different ranges of the sound spectrum that add what makes Dead Space feel so real and creepy.  Of course the blood and gore that is a Dead Space franchise claim to fame is very much in evidence in Dead Space 2.  Most importantly Dead Space 2 in both storyline and length remained a solid value.  Too often hit games cheat you on the later instalments because developers take their audiences for granted giving them a short intense game rather than a long awesomely challenging game.  Dead Space 2 built well on the strengths of the original Dead Space while dropping lame stupid impossible to complete mini game concepts like the ADS Cannons.Dead Space 2  was a tight interesting experience that did not feel like a video game.  Dead Space 2 was like a good movie.  Within five minutes I was so completely drawn into Dead Space 2 action, challenges sights and sounds that it stopped being a game and started being an outer space adventure.  I love it when I get lost in the action shallenges and creepy feel of a video game.  Best of all in Dead Space 2 there was usually enough ammo to get the jobs done.  I hate the new philosophy where ammo is made scarce in shooter games.  The real fun of a shooter game is shooting people, creatures and things DEAD DEAD DEAD!  There is no fun conserving ammo and searching high and low for the tools needed to do the job.  Give me enough ammo and health  so I can effectively kill anything in the game or its an boring waste of my time.  We live in an age where we must conserve everything water, electricity, time in my humble opinion conserving ammo is not fun it is just a tedious reminder of reality.  I think the Dead Space developers got it right in that if you play Dead Space 2 at higher skill levels ammo and health are less abundant.  But on Easy Mode health and ammo should be abundant.  Best thing of all about Dead Space 2 are the appropriate placement of Save Stations.  Only negative I have about saves happen when you die in battle with something the character is often thrown back to the beginning of a battle that has many difficult facets.  We should be thrown back near the point where we died and forced to redo the failed task until we pass it.  It often had to put the game down because; it make take me a hour to get close to the end of a challenge where I die near the end.  In Dead Space 2 I was often forced to replay an entire challenge investing another hour covering the same ground again and again till I beat it.  The game Rage has the best solution.  It allows in game saves anytime you are not in active battle or cut scene hence if you just completed a particularly difficult task or challenge you can save your progress so if you die after you are brought back to the point of your last save.  Just a thought.Anyway I am happy I brought Dead Space 2.  I enjoyed all the Dead Space 2 Downloadable content really adds to the game experience.  I took a star off because; a few bosses and mini games are still way to hard to beat in so called easy mode which means the developers got lazy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2012"}

You look like Chrono Trigger and Dragon Quest but you sound like Final Fantasy and you feel like an NES game crossed with a PS2 game yet you are on the Xbox 360.  Huh?I guess this is a simplistic and dismissive way to look at this game.  Blue Dragon has quite the lineage and pedigree associated with it.  Like I touched on above, the game was created by Hironobu Sakaguchi, composed by Nobuo Uematsu and character designs were made by Akira Toriyama.  This is the core of the Chrono Trigger team!!  But Chrono Trigger this is not.What we have here is Mistwalker's first release ever.  A simplistic RPG that foregoes non-linearity, complex equipment and magic schemes for linearity and overall easiness.  It's the perfect entry level RPG this side of a modern day Final Fantasy Mystic Quest.How is it for people who have treaded the hallowed halls of JRPG excellence in the past though?  Well...not that great.  There's no magic system outside of purchasing spells and about the only thing you equip is armor and accessories.  Sidequests don't come until the end of the game and until then you'll be going from point A to point B to advance the story.Speaking of story, there's not much.  Alien guy terrorizes small town (and the rest of the world at large), little Goku kid (Shu) doesn't give up and is fed up.  Pursues bad guy and wins.  That's about it in a super small nutshell .This is an early Xbox 360 game so it's not too impressive looking.  While it doesn't suffer the plastic look early titles did, it does look like a PlayStation 2 game.  Not a bad thing at all and I found the art design quite charming.The score is does the job but it's not Uematsu's best.All in all, I bought this game for $4 new on Amazon.  Frankly, with all my griping aside, this is a solid RPG for newcomers to the genre.  However, at that price, vets should consider it.

Allen","summary":"Connection lost, Cannot connect to server, Connection lost, connection lost, Cannot connect to server, Connection Lost","reviewText":"Battlefield 3 is a very interesting game. Many people call it the \"COD killer\" for some reason like when COD came out it was the \"Halo Killer.\" Whatever kind of \"killer\" battlefield 3 is, the only thing it killed was the internet connection. Some of the common messages you'll get are, \"Connection Lost\" and \"Cannot connect to server.\"Of course, a sane person might say, \"Now hold on there young fella, you just need to open your NAT.\" Well I would say that is true. A person is wise to make a reasonable assumption that when something isn't working, perhaps something is being done wrong on his own part? Well that isn't the case here. Every other game that I play works well and doesn't have dropped connections and they are reasonably fast. NAT is opened and everything is working fine.The problem isn't as bad as it sounds though. When I load up the game for the first time, I'm able to get into a game after the first two attempts. However, the part that gets me is when the game is going good and suddenly you're dropped back into the menu with the message, \"Cannot connect to EA servers.\"I don't know what is up with this but it certainly kills the experience for me.Besides the connection issue, what else is there to review? I haven't yet to play the single player so this review will mainly focus on the multiplayer. I already mentioned the connection issue, however, is there other issues? The answer is yes.I notice on one map, called \"Tehran Highway\" which is a relatively flat map, causes me to \"skip.\" I could be walking, and suddenly, my player bounces back a few steps for no reason. I thought at first it was a connection issue, however, everyone else is moving okay and it appears there is something wrong with the map itself. I'm unsure if anyone else has this issue, but it is the only map that does it for me.As far as other issues, there are. Sometimes when you're walking in the map, you can jump over railings, windows, etc. For some reason, sometimes you could go into the animation of where you \"jump\" over a railing, but yet you never make it across. This has caused me to die several times as I'm running across a busy street or corridor, and I need to jump through a window or railing, and suddenly it starts this weird \"jumping animation\" but you never go across it. You just stay on the side you're coming from. When I first started playing, it caused me many unneeded deaths. It has happened to me several times across different maps. It has caused me to play the game differently as I make an effort to not jump across railings.There are other issues as well. On some door steps, it appears you have to \"jump\" to go inside. You could be in a firefight and you need to get inside of a building, and suddenly you can't go inside, you have to \"jump.\" It caused me to die a few times while playing because I'm trying to run into the building.Other issues are rather minor. For example, sometimes I could be reloading and the animations don't occur. Other major ones include where you respawn without a weapon but you see that you're changing weapons yet nothing graphically happens. This causes you to not be able to fire, and in a few cases I died.Other issues include the map itself. I play Team Deathmatch a lot and what I have found is that the random spawn points is just that, very random and in some maps you spawn in the middle of where enemies are. So in some cases you can get kills and in other cases you can just jump in, die and have to respawn. It is extremely annoying and only a few times you can actually respwan next to your teammate.Enough with the problems. Even after all of the issues, is this game enjoyable? The answer is yes. You play it a bit differently than games like COD since those games tend to focus on one area of the map. In this game, the maps are very diverse so you can easily engage in fights across the maps.The game is divided up into classes: engineer, assault, scout, and support classes.Each class is unique in the types of weapons you get, and the type of gadgets. If you unlock a weapon in the engineer class, you don't get it in the other classes. There is a \"master\" level system where not only do you earn points to your class, but also to a global level. These can be applied to any classes and sometimes you get pistols and other neat stuff to add.As far as which class is the best, I think it depends on how you like to play. Personally I like the engineer class as you get carbines and you get a rocket launcher. My other favorite class would have to be the assault class. This is also the medic class in BF3 as you can heal and revive people. It's very neat and you get some cool weapons in both the classes.Inside of the game, people tend to diversify what they have. For some reasons, sometimes you get rather unlucky in that you face a team that all has scouting class. I don't know what is up with sniper rifles, but I think some newer players tend to like it because they can sit in the back and get easy kills. Unfortunately it only works if the rest of the team do well and if everyone is scout, you have to watch the slaughter fest. Of course it's fun when you're dealing with it, but when you're on that team, you feel down that you're going to lose.The game is very fun. It's not a simple, \"Go in the map, kill stuff.\" You get to do some cool things like blow up and destroy a lot of the environment. It's fun to be an engineer and blow holes all over the place with a rocket launcher. You can expose snipers and it makes camping extremely difficult in this game. So it's very nice feature and it's a lot of fun to play online.The game itself is very fun. The only thing that is holding it back from being my favorite game of recent years is due to all of the network problems and especially the rail jumping issue where it stays on the other side. If they can fix up the issue with the network connection and the whole issue with the railing, I would play this game for years (or at least until the next game in the series).* Additional note: You can install a 1.5gb texture pack to make the game visually better. It's a rather nice thing to see. Without the texture pack, the game still looks nice but it's rather \"muddy\" looking.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2011"}

With that in mind, you can expect a short game, a difficulty level appropriate for kids and a simple (yet kind of repetitive) gameplay.  The game is an action-adventure platformer that reminds of the style (but not the quality) of the 'Super Mario Bros.' games.  You are able to choose from a selection of Smufs available to play and rescue Smurfette. Part of the adventure consists in gathering Smurfberries while going through 6 different levels to reach your final goal while battling the Naughties, Azrae and Gargamel. The game is quite simple and I believe it does what is intended, kids will spend hours playing it through and will find it entertaining like my kid did. Based on that, I am giving this game 4 stars.I believe it is a little bit unfair to compare this game to more adult oriented titles out there, again, keeping in mind the target audience I can honestly say the game is good. To me, as an adult (who used to watch the cartoons when I was a kid) the game was really not that good and I even found it repetitive, but I didn't get the game for me. It has really nice visuals and the controls are easy to get used to.If you also consider the fact that the WiiU version allows your kid to play in the controller I would say this would make a great game for kids. If your kids are not into platformers or like challenging games that will have them spend hours trying to solve puzzles and the like, this game is definitely not for them.A well made game and spot on its target audience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-11-2013"}

It's an interesting concept, but it leads to some problems.  Anybody who has played a Shin Megami Tensei game will understand what they'll find here.  Lots of grinding, a battle system that rewards you with extra attacks for exploiting enemy weaknesses, and the ability to recruit demons by engaging in conversations mid-battle (and then fusing them together).  My issue with the game, however, is the fact that it is so slow and doesn't have much in the way of story.  Sometimes, this can be good, like in Demon's Souls for the PS3, but I found it made the game slightly less interesting.  Perhaps I didn't get far enough into the game to actually get the ball rolling, though.  I did play it for a while, but I don't think I got more than 1/3 of the way through.  Everything else about the game is fantastic.  If this is a problem for you, though, perhaps another Shin Megami Tensei game would suit you more.  Shin Megami Tensei IV for the 3DS has practically the same combat system, but with more narrative.  Persona 3 is also fantastic, combining turn based RPG elements with elements of a dating sim and a very involving story.Another issue I had, that I would like to point out, is the fact that my brand new, factory sealed copy, came with dirt and dust inside the case, had glitches and long loading times on the ps2, and wouldn't play at all on my 60 GB, backwards compatible PS3.  It's not a problem with the game, but the product.Perhaps if I could revisit the game (I no longer have my PS2, so I can't play this) I would enjoy it a great deal more.  However, as it stands I would give this a 3.5/10.  Since amazon won't let you rate a half star, I'm going to have to round it down, simply because of the defects.If you're looking for a deep, challenging rpg that is light on story but heavy on exploration, strategy, and demon collecting, this is for you.  If not, stay away.(Side note: The cell-shaded graphics look really cool, and I would love to see them in high definition.  The music is incredible, some of the best i've heard in a game in a long time.  Dante from Devil May Cry also makes an appearance in the game, so keep your eye out for him)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0000503MO","description":"The third title of the Gran Turismo series takes full advantage of the new PlayStation2 game engine, which is capable of rendering about 20 million polygons per second--roughly 10 times the number of total polygons of the series' previous installment,Gran Turismo 2. Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course. They don't drive perfectly, either; some will spin out and make other mistakes over the course of a race.","reviewerName":"gus-man \"Play nice.\"","summary":"Best racing game of all time","reviewText":"What can anyone say about GT3... it's the best racing game ever made, even better than GT4 (in my opinion).  The only things I can fault are that a few of my favorite tracks are missing (Red Rock Valley in particular) and there are some cars I would have liked to see in the lineup... the Saleen Mustangs and vintage Corvettes come to mind.  Also there are a few places where the graphics mess up, like when driving over the outside rumble strip before the last turn in Rome normal, the shadow under the car will disappear.  And in longer races (15+ laps), if the computer controlled cars get too far behind, they might drive off the course and crash into the wall, and just stay there.  It seems like they got mad and \"gave up\" and it makes me laugh to see it.  Otherwise the graphics are gorgeous, the sound is great, and the physics are perfect.

I've never felt more \"in the car.\"- Online:  Cat and most is some of the most fun I've had online.- Gameplay:  This isn't as \"arcady\" as you might think.  It's no Forza, but it seems a little more realistic perhaps than PGR2, for example.  It's a pretty satisfying driver, even for a Forza junkie.Things I didn't like:- Kudos:  Ok, that's just part of the game, but I'm into racing, not tricks.  Guess I'll have to wait for GTR or Forza to not have to deal with that nonsense.- Menus:  If you back out of an online game, it takes you back too many menus . . kind of wierd, and frustrating.- Online:  You can't tell if the game is in progress, so very often you're throwin in to a game where you're \"watching\" the other racers finish up.  That's not too big of a deal because most races don't last that long.- Load times:  probably a function of Microsoft's idiotic decision to not make a hard drive mandatory, so the game apparently isn't tuned to stream data to it.  You'll spend more time than you're used to looking at load screens than you did with the original XBOX.- Tracks:  the ones they have look great, would have liked some licensed tracks (Road America, Road Atlanta, etc), or at least more variety.Bottom Line:  Now at 29 bucks, probably soon to be a platinum hit (20 bucks), this is a steal, and if you're a racing fan this is almost a must-have, at least until Forza 2 or GTR comes out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2006"}

{"product_name":"B005UDTTQ8","description":"","reviewerName":"new Tron","summary":"Best Transformers game yet!","reviewText":"I absolutely loved Transformers: War for Cybertron (see my review). Despite its flaws, the game did a pitch perfect job of capturing that Generation 1 magic while creating a very competent game that gave Transformers fans their first worthy G1 experience in a long, long time. Developer High Moon Studios has returned to conclude the story of the Transformers' exodus from Cybertron with this title, another fantastic effort that really steps it up and delivers a stronger, more well-rounded experience than the first game.One of the main faults of the first game was that there was a certain degree of monotony that permeated the gameplay experience. Despite the different characters you played as, they generally played the same and felt the same. With Fall of Cybertron, this is no longer the case. Thanks to certain characters' abilities (cloaking, grappling hooks, controlling artillery bombardments, etc.), each section of the game feels distinct and fresh from the previous one, and the superior level design is structured to enhance this quality. You'll be able to transform into Bruticus as the Combaticons, go on a rampage in Grimlock's dinosaur mode, and destroy starship weapon systems with Jetfire. Not only is the actual level design very diverse, but they are also aesthetically unique from one another as well, a welcome characteristic after War for Cybertron's somewhat monochromatic color palette. The vehicle sections, while still not feeling quite right, are an improvement. Thankfully, Fall of Cybertron includes a an upgrade system for both weapons and character specs, making much better use of those credits that drop everywhere. And lastly, the storytelling is kicked up a notch, feeling much more urgent, dramatic, and climactic than the first game did. The ending is stunning and one of the best treatments of Transformers lore that has ever been seen in any medium.Like the best sequels, High Moon has kept everything that made the first game so good and improved on everything, creating an overall superior game. Transformers: Fall of Cybertron looks and sounds fantastic, and the great voice cast from the first game has returned, giving the game the authentic feel of a true Generation 1 experience. Both games should be considered essential to Generation 1 Transformers fans, but Fall of Cybertron is the superior game, and not only demonstrates High Moon's improving technical prowess, but also their fantastic ability to work with source material they are passionate about. Here's hoping we continue to get more G1 experiences from this talented studio.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

I did beat it a few times at the final level, defeating Bowser. But, the game crept me a couple of times. I could not fully control the buttons on the controller in order to figure out where I (Mario) was. Plus, there were some enemies that were scary and immortal. I could not stay in the water for too long or else I would die.

Therefore, this collection is outdated, and only of use to those who already own #3 and the collection that includes the PSP titles.However, as for the content of these two games, they are outstanding. I originally played them on PS2, and they were among the very finest titles released during that console generation. They've held up remarkably well, and I thoroughly enjoyed replaying them on PS3, remastered in HD. They look abysmal compared to the peerless GOW3, but by any other standard, they look darned good. An excellent job was done sharpening everything up for HD, and reformatting them for widescreen TVs. Most importantly, the gameplay has aged gracefully (which is why it's identical in GOW3), making this a game that's still fun to play and easy to pick up (few games age this well).The stories remain entertaining, and the journey through Greek mythology is a blast to revisit! the ambition of this series cannot be overstated... where else can you battle the gods, emerge victorious, and join their ranks on Mt.

{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"Laura","summary":"By far the best Zelda game ever","reviewText":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time may be difficult at times for some of the temples were designed to make you think but this game is the best game I have ever played in my entire life.I have been playing nintendo for years and I have played some of the older Zelda games before but I never owned any, as soon as I tried this game - I immediately loved it and I've played it millions and millions of times.

While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game.

Thanks to the Wii, there have been so many new gamers of all ages that know and love. Now, older gamers and younger gamers have been playing much more than they've even been. Thanks to classics like Wii Sports and Super Mario Galaxy, Nintendo has really shown the new way to play. But after a few years, Nintendo decided to shake it up a bit. After the success of the Mario Party series from the N64 days, all the way to Mario Part 8 a few years ago for the Wii. It really changed the way we played with Mario Party. But with the success of Wii Sports Resort and Wii Fit, it was only time until Nintendo decided to make the Wii Party, and here it is.Wii Party for the Nintendo Wii, brings all we've loved from Wii Sports, Wii Play, and Wii Fit, to the simple roll of the dice, all the way to play with the Wii-Mote. The gameplay is simple and straight-forward, as you and as many as 3 other friends challenge each other to 70+ mini-games. The games are simple and full of fun as you and your friends can compete against each other in games, from challenging games like Animal Tracker, where you simply put your Wii-motes down and scramble to match the right Wii-mote, with the actual animal sound, Balance Boat where you have to try to align your favorite Mii's and make sure they don't rock the boat too much where they'll all tip over and fall, all the way to word bomb. A game sort of like hot potato, where each player has to spell out a word that fits a category, before time is up, and the word bomb explodes. There are also some unique boards here to play on like Globe Trot, a colorful board that you can play on in a miniature world and collect the most coins, and Spin-off where 4 players compete on a giant wheel, and gamble their way to break the bank.All in all, there is so much to play and love about Wii Party. It is definitely a real treat for anyone who wants a great party to call their own. While it will appeal to anyone who loves all the great mini-games, there is so much about it that just works well. Although the game isn't distinctive to the appeal and love that made Mario Party the signature series of video board games, it still shows that Nintendo can really branch out, and make mini-games for everyone. If you've loved Wii Sports Resort and Wii Fit, than give Wii Party a try. It really gives the Mii's a nice turn of the board to call their own.Graphics: BSound: BControl: B+Fun & Enjoyment: B for solo play; B 1/2+ for multiplayerOverall: B 1/2+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2010"}

Fallout: New Vegas is a meaty, quirky, and all-around mean follow-up to Fallout 3. There's no touchy-feely parental relationship to weigh the plot down. And as a courier who got killed for the package they were delivering, players aren't trying to save the world. Rather, the game is about survival, revenge, and comeuppance. Serving up those particular dishes is more complicated than it might seem, thanks to a tangled web of quests and conflicting allegiances. Players could easily get lost trying to work out all the angles. That's the point.However, given that this is a Bethesda game, expect bugs, glitches, and multiple freezing. I initially completed Fallout: New Vegas and literally had to restart my PS3 nearly every hour to an hour-and-a-half. As such, my experience wass marred by jerky visuals, as the game strains so mightily to render the vistas of the Mojave that the image often grinds to a halt, threatening to freeze up, and sometimes succeeding. Load times are long, and seemingly none of Fallout 3's niggling glitches have been fixed. Still, technical nuisances don't ruin the delight of moseying through New Vegas and sampling the huge variety of depravity--and occasional glory--that post-nuclear Sin City has to offer.Even after I had beaten Fallout: New Vegas, I purchased Fallout: New Vegas - Ultimate Edition because I love the Fallout series but didn't want to pay $9.99 for the DLC. In this version, I didn't have many issues overall, but still had to deal with the occassional glitches. In terms of additional content, I must say that Old World Blues is worth the price of admission alone. In Old World Blues, you'll traverse THE BIG EMPTY as you find a satellite around New Vegas and are transported somewhere else with a new map to explore... but you wake up without a BRAIN!!! Blast lobotomized weirdos and cyborg dogs with some awesome new weapons and armor through a wild and wacky adventure that packs some great laughs and lots of action. Also, I recommend Dead Money, which was challenging, but a lot of fun as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B002BRZ9AG","description":"No More Heroes 2 Wii","reviewerName":"maskedgamer","summary":"You can play Shinobu?","reviewText":"Is there any other reason not to buy this game?No More Heroes 2 I long awaited for. Had the release date marked on my calender I really love this game. The first one took my buy surprise and the second one was more like desert after the main meal.Whats improved with the second game? Well... The characters have been touched up a lot everything is more detailed this time around (not that there was anything wrong with the original look), the Game has better music this time around that gets you pretty pumped, There's a lot more sexy female bosses for some reason (no complaints here), the goons you fight are much better. There's a lot more variety as far as the types and they do have different fighting styles, but they have nothing to do with the bosses you fight like in the previous game where they actually had a theme to go along with the level you were playing.... and well it looks like they removed and added some stuff to satisfy the complainers.I'll get into that. With the first game everyone nagged about how hard the bike was to control and nagged about riding around in the world so they took that part out the game(I never nagged it was if fun)now you just point and click on area's on your map and you go right to them. The side missions are old school 8 bit mini games. They have their charm, but since you don't have to grind on side missions to get stuff you're not exactly forced to do them. I kind of missed the old mission style because it added more to the game, but this was alright I guess...would of been more fun if it could of been an unlockable like the Bizarre Jelly game.Also the game doesn't have all the stores you used to travel around to. Obviously with Bishop gone there's no video store, but there's no guy to train you special moves anymore! That kind of was a let down. Dr. Nayomi is still there she looks like she upgraded herself its always a pleasure to see her, even if she doesn't have anything new to buy (I'm on the last boss and there's still only 2 katanas) so I guess she's been too busy looking for a bra to build Travis new weapons.The scary shop keeper with the mask is still there although his taste have gone down hill, because I haven't brought anything he offered yet. Compared to the first game, the new clothes and accessories look like a flee markets bargain bin.The fighting... ah yes the fighting! Travis has been touched up a bit. He has less moves than before and controls a bit differently. To be honest I really didn't like what they did with him. It took me a while to get used to the \"new\" Travis because I was so used to fighting with the old style that required more effort. This time he doesn't block so well, there's few \"wii-waggle\" attacks if any, and playing the other characters makes you regret going back to him. Travis is my dude, but they did him wrong with the controls and his skills. I guess he forgot everything he learned from the last game.The other characters.... you can play as Travis's older brother but who cares about him, lets talk about my baby SHINOBU! oh yeah! She's the reason I brought this game. When I heard you could play the baddest boss from the last game I had to pick it up. Shinobu was no disappointment matter of fact she made the game for me! she is just as fun to play as she was to fight. All of her moves are there except \"Sonic sword\" or at least she forgot to call it that. She's grown up in the past 3 years since her uniform is replaced for a dress and high heels. She's a fast fighter with both long range and aerial attacks. You can actually fight an entire mob with her and not be hit once. It's hard to play her and not say that she is a better fighter than Travis in the game, because she has such a wider variety of attacks and power moves. Sadly she's only there for a couple of levels then she breaks your heart by leaving.The bosses... there's a mixture of them although this time around you don't get to glimpse into their minds like you did in the first game (they said so much in their fighting styles very few words needed to be spoken about them). In this game there's no so much emphasis placed on what assassin your fighting they are just there so Travis can push them aside to get revenge. There's really not much mystery about them like who they are and what they are like in the first game. Their levels have nothing to do with them (excluding like 1 or 2), and they honestly are pretty easy. Much much easier than the first game you can pretty much get them on the first try. They don't seem to make you think as much about your attacks and defenses like the first game made you do.Overall...No more Heroes 2 is still a lot of fun. Me I brought it because I enjoy the style of the game and knowing your getting something that's different from all the other games out there. Although it doesn't offer as much as the last game it still offers a lot in its own way. Between the two games I can't say which is best. I like being able to play as Shinobu like in 2 but I also like fighting against her as a boss. NMH1 and NMH2 are just too awsome games to pick up they don't need a comparison!GET IT! PLAY IT! LOVE IT!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2010"}

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun. It bears repeating that gamers looking for anotherGTA  IIIwill not find it here: this game provides an arcadelike experience  that's excellent, but in a very different way.

The story line is out of control and the character(s) development is great.  But I gotta say, this game style just isn't my cup of tea.

Walk up to the box and stand in the right place and push a specific button to climb the box which leads you to a pipe you have to crawl across...and it is the only way to get where you need to go.  On top of it, having to sneak around everywhere kills me in games.  I hate it when you have to sneak around games where failure to stay hidden results in almost instant death.  A huge portion of this game is a sneak or die scenario.  Add to it the timed missions and you've successfully lost me.  But I am a rare bread of gamer, this game is very good and I would recommend it to anyone (with the aforementioned warnings of course).  I give the game a good rating because it is fun, it just lost my interest at what I would assume was the half way mark.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2007"}

{"product_name":"B003DNLDUC","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Ralsky","summary":"A Decent Hack n' Slash RPG Held Back by Bugs...","reviewText":"I am a huge Tolkien / Lord of the Rings fan so when I stumbled across War in the North I just had to have it.  Despite some annoying gameplay bugs and Co-Op bugs I do not regret my purchase one bit, but what could of been a decent 4 star titles sadly gets knocked down to 3 stars.  The Issues/Bugs I had with this game will be in a separate section ( CONS )GAMEPLAYThis is classic hack n' slash RPG here and the gameplay is one of the big elements that makes this game shine... but also hurts it at the same time.  The game is played in 3rd person, with ranged attacked handled with an \"Over the Shoulder\" style camera.  The camera transition is smooth and makes switching between melee and ranged effortless.  MELEE combat mechanics are handled in a typical button mashing fashion.  Weak and strong attacks essentially with no real combo system built into the game, with strong attacks used to break the guard of enemies or do increased damage.  One mechanic that I enjoyed, and never got old I thought, was the Critical hit / combo mechanic.  As you are fighting enemies be it melee or ranged, if you deal enough damage to a mob or stun them, leaving them vulnerable, a small arrow appears over their head.  This is your Hero move / Crit marker.  Rushing up to that enemy and hitting the heavy attack button (triangle) when the arrow is yellow will cause your Hero to perform a heroic strike.  This could kill the enemy (decapitation, dismemberment etc), knock them down making them vulnerable for a second crit strike, or simply shatter their guard completely.  Doing this grants bonus XP and puts you into Heroic Mode and starts building a combo counter.  During this time you will dish out additional damage and increases the chance of bonus experience being granted.Despite the simple mechanics to combat it flows together nicely, but gameplay is fairly linear.  Essentially you move from one area to the next, fighting enemies be it orcs, trolls, wights, spiders etc.  Despite the linear feel, the environments and pathing of the maps changes with each area; So despite a linear romp in the park, you're constantly making twists and turns along the path with scenery changing in each area.  It keeps things fresh.  There are also plenty of secrets to be found, most dependent on the class you are playing.  As the Ranger you might find tracks leading to a hidden chest (or even trigger a side quest), while the Lore-Master would uncover fake walls that are hiding treasures.  Two other mechanics round out the gameplay,  Side-Quests and Loot.  Side-Quests are obtained by talking to the various NPC's throughout the world and often inquiring in detail about various problems.  Many of these quests can be solved simply by progressing in the storyline.  Loot is handled in a rather simple fashion, with bosses / mini-bosses always dropping some loot with the rest randomly generated from chests and the occasional mob.  I was never really over burdened with loot, and it was rather rare that I found a piece of loot in the field of play that was worth keeping.The game also contains a leveling up system which is fairly basic, but gets the job done. Every level you get you will receive 3 attribute points and 1 skill point.  More skill points you invest in a tree, the closer you get to unlocking the next tier.  More points put into a skill the better it becomes.  You can also swap out characters after every major point in a chapter (or storyline).  This allows you to play as all 3 characters throughout the adventure.  The two heroes you do not play as will automatically level up and always equip the most optimal gear, even allowing you to give them gear you find.GRAPHICSThe graphics for War in the North were hit or miss for me.  I played this game mainly for gameplay and storyline, as I do with most of the games I buy or play, but the graphics did draw my attention a few times and often not for the best.  The environment and level details were amazing as was the graphics for the individual heroes and their armor. Spells and abilities look incredible, but that's where the praises come to an end.  The graphics for other parts of the game, such as enemies, and trolls all had a strange look about them.  Facial features on many of the NPC's looked rough and were rather distracting, which was strange considering many other textured characters came out rather nice including Beleram, and Urgost.  Overall the environment is what really shines graphically here and did a great job immersing you in the levels but was hit or miss outside of that.SOUND/STORYVoice acting was pretty strong throughout the game.  You could tell a great effort was put forth in the dialogue and voice acting.  Many of the special effects sounds from the movies make an appearance and sound as polished as the movies themselves (except this one horn that sounds at the end of a level that repeatedly sounds as part of the storyline-quest.  It gave me a migraine).  The story itself was a strong yet simple storyline.  Essentially while Frodo is going to destroy the ring it is your job to distract the army in the north lead by Agandaur all leading up to an epic fight with Sauron's evil Lieutenant.REPLAY/LENGTHMy first game took me around 18-21 hours to complete, this with doing as many side quests as possible and exploring the dialogue options a bit.  Dialogue is handled similar to Mass Effect, Dragon Age etc, where talking to people will sometimes bring up options for you to interact with.  Choosing the default option will present the game in a \"cinematic\" style in which you get the most Storyline-related elements out of the way. If you wish to inquire about locations or certain meanings you can pick other options, or investigate to ask questions about the Lore.  This is a great tool for those who are not familiar with Lord of the Rings as it essentially tells you about areas you might not be familiar with (Not everyone knows what Imladris is).  REPLAY is handled via a \"Gameplus\" style system in which after you beat the game, your save file is upgraded to the next difficulty level.CO-OPThis game also contains co-op, either  couch co-op for 2 players or 3 player ONLINE co-op.  I played Online Co-Op with a friend and it functioned as drop-in/drop-out style play, however any gear my friend acquired during their own play-through of the game was carried into the game. Any money, gear or EXP they gain while in my game is saved on their file which makes any Co-Op adventure beneficial to the player.  Only downside is if you \"jump ahead\" in the storyline there is the risk of disabling trophies for that play-through. If you don't care about trophies, then the Drop-in/Drop-out feature is almost perfect.CONS / BUGSSo far I've talked about mostly the positives this game has. By all means this is a very good game that is a lot of fun even on the second play-through. However on BOTH plays I've encountered similar bugs that keep cropping up that make gameplay annoying at times. Below are just a handful of the bugs I'd consider serious enough to talk about.** Targeting enemies **  While it is easy to mash attack and fight, when it comes to precision targeting this game is lacking.  Your own players can block your path from attacks even if they are just a pixel's length in your way.  Aiming while in ranged is also affected by this.  I would aim dead on at a mob only to find my arrow would somehow hit a mob to the right of me that wasn't even in my line of sight?  No biggie I got 39 more arrows it is just annoying** Glitched Quests (Offline and Co-Op)**  This was common.. as it happened multiple times.  OFFLINE: Finding Mithril for Arwen, after two areas I still had not found any (even destroying all crates).  I save and quit for a few hours only to reload my save file and.. BOOM the quest is gone!  Now the only thing Arwen tells me is to take the quest again.. which every time I accept, it does nothing. (Quest is permanently broken on that play-through).  Talking to Bilbo bugged also for me.  No problem talking with him to chronicle my quests up until the dragon. After the dragon's lair he stopped accepting my stories and the quest wouldn't complete.  ONLINE/CO-OP: Tons... multiple quests wouldn't even trigger items and when my friend would log off, quests would vanish from their log and the ones that did, bugged out my quests .** Quest Items randomly generated / Not visible **  Bad idea having your quest items \"Randomly generated\" out of crates laying around.  Don't destroy EVERY CRATE you might miss a gem, or a black pearl etc. Plus these items are no different than bags of gold. Or perhaps you need to gather herbs.  How is a player supposed to know that grey rock against the wall is really an Ore node, or that patch of green is actually herbs you need to gather.** Bugged out Interactions with NPCs ** Sometimes NPCs became unresponsive for me or there was no prompt to talk to them. Thankfully I didn't get stuck anywhere as a prompt appeared but it wasn't on the NPC but a few feet to the side of them (very strange)** Audio Bugs ** After watching cut scenes the audio cuts in and out... during dialogue segments character voices would be LOW on one character, to loud on the other... Some sound effects are bugged like crazy (like the chain noise during chapter 4)OVERALL 75% (7.5 / C )I could nitpick about the bugs on and on.  There are plenty of \"little things\" that crop up and individually aren't all that bad, while some (the quest bugs) can be game breaking.  There was a lot of polish that went into the gameplay and mechanics of the game but all that gets chipped away by constant bugs and poor implementation of Side-Quests which wasn't polished up.  While the storyline doesn't need markers to tell you where to go, gathering up items for side-quests should of had some kind of marker on it even if the item just flashed on your screen so the player doesn't have to worry so much about destroying every box or touching every herb / tree they see.  If you look past all the problems, Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a fun game.  The mechanics and gameplay are there and mixed with a good storyline and voice acting, you get a nice winning combination.  This would easily be a 4 Star game in my book, but plenty of bugs and some rather odd design decisions with Side-Quests and a loot system that was much to simple knock this game down to 3 stars.If you are a fan of Lord of the Rings and the Lord of the Rings games, this game is certainly worth picking up as it is the best Lord of the Rings video game to date (in my opinion)... But if you are looking for deeper RPG elements, or more to your Hack n' Slash (such as combo moves) a rental would suffice.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

The game fits the PS3 like a glove, and looks just as good (if not better) here on the PS3 that it did on the 360.  What's disappointing about this eagerly anticipated port to the PS3 is that there aren't any real new features to speak of.

You have the G19, the G15 and the G110.  Each keyboard shares similar aspects, with the only major difference being that as you move up the scale, you get additional highlights.  For instance, the G19, which I have used extensively, has a full color LCD screen that you can map youtube or other videos through, among other features.  The G15 also has a LCD screen, but it's not in color and it's more of a basic screen that will show you specific stats for games (like health bars, etc.).  Then there's this, the G110.  The G110 is both the lowest entry in this series and also a refresh of the previous G11 model.  So what does this newish keyboard have to offer?Honestly, it offers pretty much the same functionality as its more expensive siblings.  On the left, you have an area to create macros with a software package.  It works pretty intuitively, scanning your games and then automatically loading up the correct game when you load.  One of the complaints I have with all of these products (and the much superior Logitech G13 Gameboard) is that the software won't always recognize your games automatically.  Specifically Steam games have a hard time being noticed, for me.  A simple solution is included, however, allowing you to open up a program and then telling the software/keyboard that you want this program associated with a specific set of functions.  It's only a minor annoyance, but an annoyance nonetheless.  The macros are separated with \"M\" keys, meaning that for each application/game you can have three different customized sets of twelve macros (for a total of 36 macros per game).Another nicety is the addition of a headphone/microphone plugin.  It also comes with audio controls on the upper right hand side, giving you quick and easy access to controlling the volume of your programs.  It works with a variety of applications (iTunes and Windows Media, for example).  You can also use the other keys in the upper right to change through music selections.  This is a feature I love with the G19 and was glad to see it being offered in the G110.  The biggest difference between the two models in this respect, though, is that the G19 and G15 have the LCD screen so you can see what the song is.  The other features are merely gimmicky but enjoyable, like the backlit colors.Here's my biggest complaint with these models.  For the high price they run, you could, instead, purchase the G13 Gameboard.  Before the G110, the Gameboard was the cheapest option and, while it still is here at Amazon, it is around the same price.  Ever since I received the G13, I have used and loved it moreso than any keyboard I've used.  And it sort of renders the keyboard moot for gaming purposes.  My hand is always on the Gameboard and it offers much of the same functionality as the keyboard.  If I had to choose between any of the keyboards (G19, G15 or the G110) and the Gameboard, I'd definitely stay with the G13 Gameboard.  That said, for those looking for a great gaming keyboard, you can't go wrong with the G110.  It offers most of the same gaming-centric features as the more expensive models and it's the cheapest option.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B006YDPU48","description":"","reviewerName":"A. Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"Death Won't Do Us Apart","reviewText":"Ahhh... finally. Checked the date of my order: Dec 9, 2012 but the wait is over. And, after three days of playing Dark Souls 2, the verdict is in: DS2 is, in fact HARDER than the original Dark Souls or Demon's Souls. And it appears to be more fun too. But, again, harder doesn't not mean 'impossible' or 'unplayable'. It only means that planning, preparation and some practice involving a lot of dying is going to be part of your gaming experience. I will add some notes at the bottom of this review for anyone thinking to try DS2 but afraid of its impossible difficulty and for anyone who started to play the game and then abandoned it in frustration.GAME SO FARTo say that I'm impressed it would be an understatement. This third Souls title was not dumbed down or simplified in any significant way it seems. My first few hours were as good an experience as my first few hours of the first Dark Souls. Play is challenging and interesting in ways that got us to love Demon's Souls and Dark Souls in the first place. It's so... Dark Souls to experience the relief and joy of finally mastering the moves and tactics to beat your first significant enemy only...  to see yourself confronted by THREE of them around the next corner. In a few words, I love it.Getting a little into details and still under first impressions, the game plays in many ways like its predecessors. Most controls will get your toon to do what you'd expect it but there are changes, some subtle, some more obvious. So, here's what I've noticed so far:- Improved graphics: it's the first thing I noticed. Everything looks sharper, the color palette is a lot richer and... a couple NPCs actually move their lips while talking but that's only on cut scenes- No frame rate issues yet but let's see how this holds true throughout the rest of the game- New menus: everything appears to be better organized. But it's different from what we were used to so it will take a while- New items, some quite interesting. One of the starting gifts would allow you to raise the difficulty level of a specific bone fire area with the corresponding increase in rewards.- Non-boss enemies stop respawning after a while so you can't farm the same ones forever- Fast travel from the beginning: can teleport to any bonfire once it's discovered or this was the case with the couple I've got to so far.- More lore revealed explicitly but not a lot more at the very start of the game.- Loose central hub concept: not quite the Demon's Souls Nexus but,so far, there's only one place to level up so it's a hub- Hybrid healing: there is one Estus in the beginning but there are other healing items that heal in different ways. I expect to find some healing miracles as well at some point.- Classes: wanderer, hunter, pyromancer and thief are gone. DS2 classes are warrior, knight, swordsman (dual wielding), bandit, cleric, sorcerer, explorer, and deprived- Attributes: resistance is gone and won't be missed. Current attribute are adaptability, vigor, endurance, vitality, attunement, strength, dexterity, intelligence, faith- Max health: decreases as you keep dying and is fully restored as you regain humanity. One of the starting gifts is a ring that will increase your max health points when worn, not unlike the Demon's Souls Cling ring- Humanity: you no longer need to be at a fire to regain your humanity, not unlike old Demon's Souls.I can't say much about invasions, covenants and co-op play yet because I didn't go through these yet but I will update my review once I do. I suppose everyone is busy with early progress in the game so there's not much time for messing up with other people's games yet but I'm sure this is going to change soon, probably within hours. I also have no comments on the bonus pack because I decided that I will not take advantage of it because I am after the full game experience, as hard as it may turn out to be.IF YOU DIDN'T PLAY THE ORIGINAL DARK SOULSFirst of all, don't worry about it. You do NOT need any Dark Souls experience in order to play Dark Souls 2 so... enjoy. However, if you get a hold of the old Dark Souls, give it a try because it's worth it. Try Demon's Souls too. It's a PS3 exclusive and can be had almost literally for pennies these days.Also, do not believe anyone who claims that the Souls games are impossibly hard. They are not. I mean, they are difficult but not 'impossibly' so. Yes, they are different and to me they are unlike any other games but what that means is that patience, persistence and the willingness to learn from past mistakes will take you through the game because the game will make you get better every day while, true, quickly punishing you for your mistake or for getting too self-confident.The Souls games are some of the most innovative releases in a long, long time. I don't remember being so wow'ed ever since playing Ultima II as a kid, back in the 80's (yes, I'm THAT old). My first time playing Demon's Souls after a long gaming hiatus triggered one 'aha' moment that hasn't left me as I completed it, then played it again then moved to Dark Souls when it was released and it's still there as I just started DS2 and I was still playing the old Dark Souls last night. There's so much to say about the Souls games but let me just mention some of the more innovative aspects:- You are never alone, unless you play offline. You can see shadows or outlines of random other players as they progress through their world- The 'blood stains' of players who died can hint at how they died as you can watch their last few seconds and  that can hint at how to deal with dangers ahead- You have the ability to leave messages to no one in particular that will pop up in other players worlds and it's up to you whether they are going to be helpful or misleading or just cries of frustration- Other players can come into your world uninvited and try to kill you- You can summon other willing players to help defend against invaders or beat a boss- Things that happen to you or things that you do in your world have consequences in other players' worlds and vice-versa- You can join any of several covenants which grants you some benefits and may strengthen bonds with fellow covenant members- Most lore is to be discovered through various hints during gameplay - you talk to NPCs, read weapons and armor descriptions- 'Beating' the game is only the beginning or your journey. As soon are you 'finished' the NG+ (new game plus) starts which sets you back at the the beginning but with the benefits of acquired skills and capabilities and weapons and with much tougher enemies to confront. And then there's NG++ and so forth.Add to the above a most excellent combat system that from what I see has gotten even better in DS2, the freedom to grow your character almost any way you choose, regardless of your initial class, the most impressive and detailed art displayed on landscapes, architecture, armor, weapons. And that's not all. It's not only other players coming into your game world or you visiting or invading theirs. It's also the game invading our day to day reality through the several Wiki sites and us, real world players taking organized expeditions to fight in organized tournaments or join in some predetermined role playing scenario. The possibilities are limitless and it explains why I've been playing these games for so many years already.Enjoy. And don't let the inevitable setbacks discourage you.RATINGI'm not going to go pro-reviewer style and assign scores to graphics, replay value and what not. Playing Dark Souls 2 is pure joy to me thus far and that translates into \"I love it\" which means '5 stars' and that's that.______________________________________________NOTES ON PLAYING DS2Yes, there is no 'easy mode' in DS2 but there are ways to survive even if your reflexes are not lightning fast. You will need some time and patience. So, here's what may help flattening the learning curve a little.- Your initial class matters... initially. True, you can turn into whatever you want eventually, regardless of your starting class and there is one item that helps you rearrange your stats but if you started as a Warrior or Knight and can't make any progress, try a class that can do range attacks. Sorcerer is probably the best and you can develop your required sword-wielding stats as you level up and find some decent weapons too.- Level up a little. The cost of leveling up is not that great in the beginning so if you identify some area where you can successfully deal with the enemies, clear it several times and use the souls gained to level up your favorite attribute such is INT if you go with Sorcerer.- Bookmark the Wikis. There are several very good Wiki sites dedicated to the Souls games. They will eventually map the entire game, strategies, shortcuts and all. At this time you can learn a lot by lurking at the forums and don't be afraid to ask questions. Most people there are happy to help if they can.- Get yourself the officialDark Souls II Collector's Edition Strategy Guide. It's been written by some of the better Dark Souls Youtube contributors and it's very detailed.- Search Youtube for Dark Souls II videos that show you how to develop your character, where to go and what to do. EpicNameBro, ManufacturedOpinion, Lobos Jr, A German Spy are some of my favorite stars there and they all love Dark Souls.You will find that, once you go past a sometime painful and frustrating beginning the games opens up and, while still frustrating and painful you will also begin to experience joy and pride in your accomplishments.POST PLATINUM NOTESI had a lot of fun taking the game through NG++ to earn the Platinum and I promptly started a new character after that but I am a little worried about the games Soul Memory implementation - gamers are matched in PvP based on the amount of souls they earned during their playthrough - because a certain 'cheat' site which hall remain unnamed allows gamers to basically have it all: weapons, armor, items by simply installing a fake 'save' onto their console. And, since Soul Memory maxes out at 15 million souls, gamers who actually earned their souls through play and reached, let's say, level 250, are now matched with those who did nothing but copy the cheat and reached level 500 or 600 or 700 with no effort on their part and, believe me, it's very, very hard to level up past 250 in a legitimate way.For the first time, after playing Dark Souls and Demon's Souls for all these years, I am not often playing 'offline' because being invaded by super-high-level and practically indestructible characters that clearly cheated to get to that level is no fun and makes no sense whatsoever.It would be nice if FROM rethought the Soul Memory feature because I have no problem with players at level 700 being PvP  matched against other players at a similar level, whether they earned it or not but I do see a huge problem when I'm invaded by someone with everything maxed out when it took me a couple hundred hours to reach a level one third that high and it would probably require thousands or tens of thousands of hours to hit the 'max' legitimately.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU0NU","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"The Original Halo Trilogy Concludes","reviewText":"I didn't get introduced to the Halo franchise until much later than most people. HALO had been out for several years and HALO 2 had been released for over a year by the time I purchased an Xbox and sat down to play the campaign of HALO.  After beating that, it was about six months later before I had an opportunity to sit down and play through the campaign of HALO 2.  I understand that for most Xbox games nowadays, the big thing that many gamers look for is the multiplayer game play.  I'm not like that.  For me, first and foremost in a game is the campaign mode.  I love stories and in writing and filmmaking, story really does triumph over everything else and my experiences with gaming is no different.  If the story captures me, then I'm probably going to really enjoy the game even if the graphics aren't superior and the sound is low key and there aren't a lot of multiplayer options.I was really looking forward to playing HALO 3.  HALO 2 was an amazing second act to the franchise and it raised all sorts of interesting questions. The game play is also unique because for over half the game you play as the Arbiter, an individual who until then had been seen as an enemy to humanity.  However, the campaign of that game ended on a cliffhanger with the Covenant invasion of Earth.The campaign begins immediately where HALO 2 ended.  Master Chief crashes to Earth and joins the forces there to end the Covenant invasion.  They succeed, but by the end of the battle join forces with the Covenant to quarantine and eradicate Flood-infected areas of Earth.  Later a small group of humans and Covenant, including Master Chief and the Arbiter, proceed through a slipstream portal in pursuit of the Prophet Truth who intends to activate all the remaining Halo rings.  Along the way, Master Chief and the Arbiter join forces with the Flood Gravemind to prevent Truth's plan, but after stopping him Gravemind breaks his alliance and attempts to incorporate Master Chief and the Arbiter into itself.  Then there's Cortana, the AI with a personality.  She's captured by Gravemind and Master Chief has to rescue her. It all builds to a satisfying conclusion.As for as actual game play is concerned, I was disappointed with HALO 3.  The campaign provides a satisfying conclusion, but it's much too short.  So much of the build-up to HALO 3 was around the Covenant invasion of Earth, but there's really only about 1/4th of the entire campaign that is actually spent there.  Not only that, but the entire storyline really doesn't take very long to get through.  In fact, the most difficult part of the game, in my opinion, was the last part of the game and Master Chief has to drive over and around parts of the new Halo as it collapses around itself while he makes his way back to the getaway ship.  That part was like a giant puzzle and quite frankly I didn't like it very much.  In shooters, people like to shoot and fight and there wasn't very much of that going on.I was also disappointed that you are limited to playing with Master Chief. One of the most interesting parts of playing HALO 2 is that you got to also play as the Arbiter. That doesn't happen in HALO 3. In fact, other than his brief appearances at the beginning of some scenes, and a few cut scenes, the Arbiter appears nonexistent.  Master Chief is humanity's hero, but every hero has some side kicks crucial to his success.  You get to see a little of that in HALO 3, but you don't get to play it.There are several new weapon upgrades in HALO 3 as well as a few new vehicles.  There's also another group of objects known as Equipment that the player can use.  The graphics are great and sound quality is exceptional.I haven't played the multiplayer settings very often, but HALO 3 has some great ones. In fact, HALO 3 was probably the best multiplayer experience until MODERN WARFARE 2 came out. Personally, I just can't get very involved in multiplayer. I play a few times and it's exciting, but then the experience looses its luster for me.In short, though there are some good improvements in the campaign mode from HALO 2, the game is too short and lacks some of the improvements from HALO 2, such as the time spent playing as the Arbiter.  However, in terms of multiplayer experiences, HALO 3 is exceptional.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2010"}

The missing 2 player mode in the first GTA was by far the first thing that rockstar should have incorporated but didnt!Okay, the big question is \"Is this game worth buying if I already own Grand Theft Auto 3\"?. Well,....yes and no! Its pretty much the same game as before so GTA3 players wont be as amazed as they were when they first played the game, but its still got some new little things that make it better then GTA3. Now you can smash cars, go inside shopping malls and dance clubs, dive out of moving cars, wreak mayhem on a golf course and more. The new weapons like Chainsaws, meat cleavers, hammers and samurai swords are pretty cool too! So its the same game with some cool new features. On the downside, its all set in the 80's so you have to deal with 80's music as you drive you car instead of getting a variety of raggae, rap, techno, alternative, etc, etc...If you dont own GTA3 then I say get your hands on this game. If you already own GTA3 or have played it lots, then try and find a good used copy to buy or get it for a birthday present. No doubt its a 5 star game, but if you have already played GTA3, it just does not do enough new to warrant a full price purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2003"}

So yeah its a little late to be reviewing this game but this game is great.  Sadly I blame this game for causing me to fale my finals in math.  I spent my preciuse 12 hours playing this amazing game than study but I learnded my lesson.  Tommy vercity who is voiced by actor Ray lee ota is out of jail after 15 years in prison and meets his old boss sunny who he owes money too.As you progress through you meet more and more characters in the game.  Lance the ever so smart aleck black dude who helps tommy in his revenge for his dead brother I think.  You also meet many other characters such as avery carington and candy suxx the ever so loving porn star.  I gave it for out of 5 for some good reasons.  Same with other game mags.The graphics 4/5They were kina fuzzy but all goodGameplay 5/5AWSOME GAMEPLAY!Voice acting 5/5superb actingMissions 4/5Pretty much as 3 but more and added stuffover all it gets a 8.9 out of 10 for.GRAND THEFT AUTO 3 was waaaaaay better.  I dont know why though I think its cause it was more urban.  Or maybe cause it took place in a modern time of year that I can think of like the mid 90's.  One thing for sure was that 3 was more currupt looking thatn vice city.  The characters in 3 were also awsome.  Better If I might add.  Over all Grand theft auto vice city Is ps2 classic that every ps2 (adult/mature)owner should have.Might I add that grand theft auto with a shadow of a doubt is the most Mature rated Game out and ever made.Its the content.  The violence is little cheezy and the blood isnt as red or darker as 3.The sexual content shows nothing but gives you the sence of what is happining.  The language is over the top but no F-word in it.  If they added the f word atleast once it would have gotten really mature content for me but thats alright.I found 3 to be more mature than this though cause it seemed they were trying to hard at making vice city mature to the max.If you are a violent/Mature gaming lover...than try out these other games.......Grandtheft auto 3(the ground breaking original that set the standards of violent gaming...Maybe not setting but really violent)Manhunt(very graphic game)Postal 2Kingpin life of crime(Extreamly violent and filled with foul language)Conkers badfur day(see it for your self and youll see why it isnt for children...Dont let the cute squarl fool you!)Soldier of fortuneThe suffering(Monster decapitation filled with gore/violence/Very disturbing images and extreamly foul language)Max payne 2(Very violent with explicit nudity only on the pc versian)The thing (Hard core graphic violence)DoomThese are the more famouse and know games but there tons of em its just that most game mags dont review em or talk about em so they dont get all political.  I wish there was a first person shooter game were you can do some of the most outrages things like smathing a guys head open with a hammer or ect.  But I think they have made a game like that.  I just dont know what the game is called.  I wish most games were like manhunt and gta but then again it would become very, very boring.Over all vice city was a great experience that I will never forget.

Now I absolutely love this system!This is the new 'slim' system, which is indeed thinner than the original 360's.  There is an additional vent on top, which will help stop the system's overheating problem; if you decide to stand the system on end, it provides a vent to make up for the vent being blocked.  Having been burned (so to speak) three times by older systems, I choose to set it so all three vents are as clear as possible.  The black color also helps it fit in better with my DVD player and other home theater components.  It really does look great.It comes with a black wireless controller, with a great new feature: you can turn on the system by hitting the Xbox logo button.  Perfect if your system is in a difficult to reach position.  Even powering on is improved on the actual system, though, as the power and eject buttons are now touch-sensitive.  A quick flick of the finger give you a little beeping tone that lets you know the system is on without even having to apply any pressure.  The system is also a lot quieter than the old system.  My wife used to complain about how loud the old one was, but this one barely hums.  Loading a game from a disk is the loudest sound you will hear, and that is about as loud as your standard DVD player...comparatively negligible compared to the older systems.Overall, I really love this system.  It is a big upgrade over the original that fell prey to the red ring of death problem.  If that scared you off of getting a 360, I think the new chip and setup of this system can put your fears to rest.  If you are looking to replace an older system, I can't recommend this enough, to me it was like getting a new console instead of replacing a broken one.  It looks, sounds and even feels better than the older systems I have been playing for the last few years.  And yes, you can use Kinect with this system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2010"}

I have been PC-only for the longest time, and I even enjoy building gaming PCs. However, a new friend convinced me to join the dark side, so I bought a Xbox 360S because I have heard numerous accolades for Xbox Live as a multiplayer gaming haven.The Xbox 360S is very easy to install to your home theater equipment. I opted to use my 24\" Asus LCD monitor, which is 1080P native and has a HDMI input. The 360S works perfectly with the display, and it feels just like playing a PC game. For audio, I did not want to go the route of a full receiver and 5.1/7.1 system. I opted to go with the Turtle Beach Ear Force X41, which hooks up to the Xbox 360S's built-in optical audio link. There is a minimal number of cables running on the back of the 360S, but the included power brick is literally the size of a brick! Could Microsoft make it even bigger?The 360S runs quietly, and you can barely hear the single venting fan. However, the disc drive is noisy. I highly recommend you \"Install\" the games onto the HDD or else games like Medal of Honor will cause the disc to spin constantly, creating a buzzing noise as you are trying to concentrate.The wireless controller is standard Xbox 360 controller fare, and for PC gamers that love first person shooters, the joysticks are difficult to get used to but after a solid week of training, practice, and running drills in \"The Pit\" in CoD MW2, I have gotten more used to it. However, I still feel that a mouse offers slightly better precision. With the Xbox 360 controller, there is less margin of error and more reliance on your hand-eye coordination.The Xbox 360S does run pretty warm. The intake/case temperature would read 75F (ambient) using my IR thermometer, while the exhaust vent fan area read 140F-150F. The power consumption is MINIMAL. With my office on standby mode, the UPS reads 0.027 KW. With the Xbox 360S hardware and monitor running, it is only 0.135 KW. With my gaming PC (AMD Phenom II X3, ATI Radeon HD 4870), it is easily over .250 KW.Overall, I should have started with the Xbox 360 much earlier because the gaming experience is significantly better than on the PC. The thing they really MUST change in the future is allow the user to play the games with a mouse and keyboard, even if it is some type of standardized mouse and keyboard.Pros: Streamlined gaming experience, runs quiet, uses little power, easy to hook up, lots of modern features (no Blu Ray like PS3, but I don't have BD DVDs)Cons: No way to use mouse and keyboard easily for FPS games, noisy DVD drive, no way to run the Xbox Live chat wirelessly and ditch the talk back cable.Overall: 5/5 stars","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000930DOQ","description":"James Bond 007 : From Russia With Love will be the first game to put players in the universe of the classic James Bond films. Set in the original 60's Bond era, the game features movie-based missions as well as original, action-intensive sequences, a broad and deep variety of gameplay, fully-integrated vehicles, social multiplayer experiences, gorgeous women, and classic, upgradeable weapons and gadgetry with modern mechanics.","reviewerName":"Simon","summary":"Play as Sean...Sir Sean","reviewText":"EA finally landed the right mixture of Hollywood polish and fun gameplay two years ago when it released Everything or Nothing, a 007 game that not only featured the likeness of Pierce Brosnan and the entire movie cast, but also their vocal talents as well. Now, after the horrible bore-fest that was Rogue Agent, EA has released From Russia With Love. This game is an expanded version of the classic Bond film, and one-ups the coolness of playing as Pierce Brosnan by allowing players to become Sean Connery.Personally, playing as Connery is the coolest thing in the world for me as a Bond fan. Years ago Rareware's GoldenEye for the N64 teased players with an \"all Bonds\" cheat that would enable Connery, but this turned out to be fake. Now we get the real deal, complete with Sir Sean's vocals. He sounds a lot older naturally, and the accent is deeper and thicker, but would you rather have 007 himself, or some nameless actor doing an impersonation?The core gameplay has not changed from Everything or Nothing, just boosted a bit. You still get a mixture of 3rd-person action and stealth levels, and also vehicle missions. A notable new toy is the jetpack from Thunderball, and it adds a new level of mayhem. Some of the minor frustrations still exist with regards to targeting and aiming, but if you made it through the last game you should be fine here. There's also some nice upgrades and unlockable content to go through, as is now standard with all EA movie-licensed games. (Note that the original name of SPECTRE is still off limits to the Bond franchise itself, hence the new name Octopus).Overall I'm impressed with EA's effort here. The game does justice to the laid-back nature of the old 007 flicks while injecting doses of 90's-era explosions and effects along the way. It's not meant to be a huge, innovative game, and it shouldn't be compared to the next-gen stuff creeping around the corner. A must-buy to all Bond fans, and a very strong recommendation to anyone remotely curious about playing as Sir Sean himself.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2005"}

Nintendo has improved the graphics, added 3D, and gives you a choice of classic mode or updated mode. Don't let that give you the wrong impression, though, the game will look the same in either mode. The updated mode simply adds motion control for those who would like to tilt and turn their 3DS to victory. The voice acting is fairly similar but it does sound like the lines were re-recorded. Same voices, just a different tone at times. Glad I picked it up and hopefully fans that already have the N64 version will still give a look because it is worth it.

It was a good idea! The Wii Fit board is fun, and it can be a real work-out as well. I like to start off my work out with Yoga, then do some strength training, and top it off with a run in the aerobic section.The games are great too. They have a competitive edge as you are rated for your performances in all of the areas of the Wii Fit. If you get first place in your favorite game, and then someone plays it when you are not present, you might come back to it with someone having bumped you from your glorious first place spot and have to work harder to replace your good standings.When you get your Wii fit, pay attention when it says not to overdo it. You can wake up with sore muscles if you do too much!The Wii Fit has some great Yoga exercises and a lot of strength training moves to tone and firm up your body. You can work toward a goal of say, losing 5 pounds over a month or so, and you can see your progress from day to day. We have three children and everyone has enjoyed the Wii Fit board - it's also a great way to exercise during the cold winter months.It's been a great investment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2008"}

Lohrke","summary":"i have no prior experience with tomb raider and this is what i think","reviewText":"unlike so many other people, i've never played a tomb raider game before.  i think that puts me in a position to offer an unbiased opinion without any baggage or preconceived notions about what a new tomb raider game *should* be.  so, if you're new to the franchise, hopefully my thoughts will helpful to you.and here's what i think: this game is a whole lot of fun.  the folks at crystal dynamics have taken a page or two from the Uncharted playbook in this origin story and  if imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, the folks at naughty dog ought to be patting themselves on the back (yes, i know TR pre-dates uncharted by more than a decade).  but rest assured that this is by no means an 'uncharted' knock off.  in fact, i like this game much more than i liked UC3.lara croft isn't quite as dynamic as nathan drake, but that's a good thing.  the lara croft of this latest iteration of TR is a more somber heroine, a little more world-weary, a little more wise-beyond-her-ears.  camilla luddington is great as the titular character.  she excels at grounding lara croft in the real world, avoiding unnecessary histrionics and over-the-top moments you see in so many video game characters.  she's a tough-as-nails character, and not a caricature, and right from the get go you know who lara croft is and she stays true to it throughout.the world of TR is a rich and colorful and ripe for exploration.  it's not quite an open world game, but it's pretty close.  within each arena you're given plenty of room to roam about and find the innumerable collectibles.  each accomplishment gives you XP which you can use to upgrade Lara's skill and equipment.  another nice touch is to add specific challenges to each level (a la 'hitman'), giving you plenty of replay value once you finish the game (you can fast travel to locations you've previously discovered instead of having to restart a chapter or level).the only real gripe i have with this game is the use of quick time events.  it's 2013, developers.  you don't have to give us button-mashing moments.  they're tired and tedious and a few times i just wanted to quit the game because of them (or at very least take a break).  but that's only one quibble in a game that satisfies on so many levels.  I've not tried the multiplayer, nor do i intend to, but from everything I've read there's nothing there you've haven't done one hundred times before.in short, i had a lot of fun with this game and would wholeheartedly recommend it.  and maybe someday we'll get a lara croft/nathan drake game.  wouldn't that be something?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"Sky","summary":"Drake 2 the Rescue!","reviewText":"Wow. I'm a little hesitant to post my opinion on this one seeing as pretty much anyone that gives Uncharted 2 any less than 5 stars is getting the NO vote treatment. But just as Nathan Drake would jump in to the face of danger...so will I....I think Uncharted 2 is a really fun game, but I'm just not as wowed as the hype made me think that'd I be. I think that I had more fun withInfamous? Sure Uncharted 2 looks 100 times better than Infamous...Infamous was just, well, more fun. And if I had to compare Uncharted 2 to a more linear game, well thenDead Space, a 5-star masterpiece, is way above Uncharted 2 on the fun-O-meter.Why? Mainly it's just that the Uncharted 2 gunfights with the antagonist's mercenaries are super redundant...even more so than the repetitious gunfights with the pirates in the first one,Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. And some of these mercenaries in Uncharted 2, while 100% human, are virtually bulletproof. Not that I had much of a problem getting through them, but it was a little silly having to empty a clip into a guy--even after knocking off his bulletproof helmet--to take him down. Even more silly was hitting a guy with an RPG only to see him stand back up. The game excelled in beautiful, realistic surroundings and graphics...you never get tired of looking at this game. But some of the invincible human adversaries were just kooky.The story has Drake in search of a Mythical stone that potentially bestows great power to its holder. Of course there are others looking for the stone and its hiding place. Hence, you'll have to battle your way through obstacles, puzzles and worst of all mercenaries...hordes and hordes of mercenaries. There are even a few surprises along the way. One thing that's a little different from the first one is the climbing. Just like in the first game you'll need to navigate yourself through some treacherous territory and perform some death defying balancing acts (and you certainly won't defy death every time). But in Uncharted 2 there are a few climbs where you'd better be precise with the direction that you want Drake to jump or it's a deathly shout of yaaaaaaa as you plummet to your restart checkpoint. Man, I died like a dozen times in one of the early climbs before I realized that I couldn't move the L stick just side-to-side, diagonally or up & down....it had to be a precisely 11 o'clockish move. My bad...silly me. There are a couple of other jumps / climbs that'll have you wondering if you're doing something wrong because you'll die so much before getting through.Some areas require you to clear the enemies out before you can get through, and some you're better off just running for the exit; and the only way to figure out which way is which is by trial and error...you don't get a map. But not to worry...if the game senses that you're lost it encourages you to press up on the D-pad for a hint. There are about 100 hidden treasures that you can try to find and collect along your way marked by flashes of light.Speaking of treasures, did anyone get the Digital Trophy map from Amazon for their pre-order bonus? I did, and it's a map to only the first 6 trophies as far as I can tell. So it's either really lame or I can't figure out how to view any of the other trophies on the map other than the first 6. I get too consumed with treasure hunting anyway, so I'm glad that I just played my first playthrough without worrying about the treasures.You do get some pretty effective weapons that get you through the levels. You're allowed to carry only 2 weapons at a time: a pistol or mini-uzi like gun, or a machine gun or various shotguns and RPGs. You also get to carry up to 4 grenades. And you'll occasionally need to engage in hand-to-hand combat and stealth attacks.I played my first playthrough on Normal and found it to be very easy. I mean, there were times when I didn't even notice that two enemies were right next to me and I took 'em both out before taking hardly any damage. I should have played on Hard. One thing is for sure, playing Uncharted 2 has me yearning to play Uncharted 1 again to get trophies that only came out as an add on well after the initial game release. And I think that there's some connection where if Uncharted 2 sees that you've got an Uncharted 1 Cleared Game save you get some kind of bonus...I think?As far as the online aspects go...I've become kind of a story mode / campaigner gamer. Uncharted 2 has multiplayer and co-op modes, but the co-op mode is for missions designed exclusively for co-op...not the ability to play the story with a partner (likeResident Evil 5). So I can't say that I've given Uncharted 2's online play a fair enough chance to comment. What withModern Warfare 2coming out in a couple of weeks from the time of this writing, I'm not in much need of an online shooter right now anyway.So is Uncharted 2 a great game? YES! Should you buy it? YES! Even if you haven't played Uncharted 1? YES! YES! YES!Does Uncharted 2 set the bar for gaming? Well, maybe the graphics, the flow from cutscenes to game, and other technical aspects like that set some kind of bar, but is this the greatest game ever. I don't think that's accurate. It's very fun. And I'll probably give it another playthrough after Modern Warfare 2 and another trip through Uncharted 1. But Uncharted 2 seems to have circulated some \"greatest game ever\" Kool Aid and everyone's drinking it but me.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

The genre has grown pretty stale, with the same concepts rehashed over and over, albeit with prettier graphics. The last really creative shooter was Deus Ex, which blended the FPS and RPG worlds.  Bioshock is it's spiritual successor, really merging the two genres in a wholly unique setting.  One pro review I read said calling it a game is an understatement - I agree.  It is so much more because of the story, the stunning voice acting, and the underwater setting circa 1946.

IMO this game from the starting cut-scene (not CG which how SE usually start their games) to your first battle does not have enough spark to make want to keep playing. The battle system is choppy. Its basically identical to any FF games, you pick command, execute, then your opponent attacks, and your turn again. I wont go into detail. Cut-scenes are pretty lengthy and may I say boring because the characters to me are unlikeable in which I lose interest and end up skipping (thank God there's an option to skip). The graphics are OK for a game this age. While environments are more stunning and lush while in a town,city, or while traveling. they are poorly rendered while in combat. I've noticed that at the start of an encounter the ground would be blurry (PS2 kinda graphic) and then become more focused and detailed in seconds. Mainly (I think) due to loading times. Even though I've written mostly bad things doesnt mean you shouldnt buy it. This is MY opinion. Do your research, watch videos, maybe even rent before you buy.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VI","description":"While it's hard to see why some four-player games are worth the trouble,Gauntlet: Dark Legacyis one game that looks, at its preview stage, like  it'll have gamers begging for their PlayStation2 Multi Tap accessories and three  extra Dual Shock 2 controllers.The game is a port of the coin-op of the same name that hit the arcade in the  spring of 2000. Much of the setting, action, and controls have survived the  translation. The difference here is that there's just more of a good thing in  the PS2'sDark Legacy. You play as one of eight characters--four from theGauntlet Legends, plus a sorceress, knight, dwarf, and jester.Dark  Legacyalso features a larger selection of threads for each fighter. Once  your character is attired suitably, the game becomes a stab-and-jab fest. As inLegends, the single player game is good, but it's the multiplayer mayhem  that attracts people to theGauntletgames.Gauntlet: Dark Legacywill feature the four realms fromLegends,  plus four new ones and a fantastic new battlefield section.--Todd Mowatt","reviewerName":"Ted Del Prato \"technodemon\"","summary":"More than an update to Legends, but not quite a sequel","reviewText":"Gauntlet: Dark Legacy is Midway's update to Gauntlet: Legends. For those unfamiliar with Gauntlet, it's an overhead view, 3D hack and slash action game with a medievil theme. New features include 4 new realms, 4 new main characters, plus repolished graphics and gameplay. Rest assured, this PS2 version is a perfect translation of the arcade game. The designers have made some good decisions in adding helpful hints and tweaks to every aspect of the game. Each character can now perform a more powerful version of their standard attack to ward off stronger enemies, clues to find secret areas are littered across the playing field, and food items added to the shop all make this version of Gauntlet a more enjoyable experience. Even though the gameplay can still become monotonous after a while, there are more incentives than ever included to keep you playing. Lots of secret characters/items are available to search for, and certainly help add replay value. There are still a few graphical and hit detection glitches that could use fixing, but most are minor and don't detract from the gameplay. Dark Legacy isn't quite a true sequel, but I believe enough new features are included to make it worth buying even if you already own Legends.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2002"}

This is more like MK3!","reviewText":"This version of the trilogy absolutly stunk to high heaven. What the hell happend??? I first brought the MK Trilogy on PC. But after I upgraded to Windows 98 the game would not install anymore, it only worked on Win 95. So I saw the playstaion version, but I never liked the PS and I saw that it was exactly the same as the PC version.. so I figured the N64 version would be just the same.... wrong!!!! There is about 20 charactors missing from the 64 version for some unknown reason. They could well have included them but for some reason this game is more like Mortal Kombat 3 with a few extra charactors.I hope the PC version gets re-released some day. Or maybe i'll just get a PS version Rom, because MK trilogy is the best MK game ever... just not on the 64.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2005"}

{"product_name":"B0002SQ0AY","reviewerName":"Marc Ruby&#8482; \"The Noh Hare&#8482;\"","summary":"Did You Ever Wonder Where the Wonder Went?","reviewText":"I had very high hopes for Suikoden IV.  Suikoden III was one of the first games I bought when I shifted to console games from the world of the PC.  I liked it very much on the first play, when I didn't have much to judge it by, and in a recent replay, I found it still provided a rich experience, despite some problems that I now recognize as flaws.Suikoden IV is a return to an earlier time than Suikoden III.  To be honest, it is also a return to an older style of game.  For all its graphics and animation, this latest effort plays like a lot like a PSOne game.  One where they kept some of the flaws in Suikoden III and threw out some of the things, which gave that, game its special charm.  The only really new feature in this game is that is mostly a sailing based RPG, with a ship-to-ship strategy conflict element as well.Unfortunately, both sea and land experiences are slow-paced and battle-ridden.  Until late in the game, your normal playing experience will be combat every 20 seconds.  And until you are well into the game you not only walk or sail everywhere, but you go very slowly.  There aren't a lot of opponent types in this game, so leveling up can become excruciatingly boring.  Not hard, mind you, just tedious.  If you've played other Suikoden games you will remember that you have to worry about not four, but 108 possible team members.The story is straightforward.  Two boys are raised and become knights together.  One (the hero) excels at his tasks.  The other, Snowe, has the benefit of rank and privilege, but falls short in skill and courage.  The relationship becomes strained, there is a falling out, and a suspicious incident in battle results in you (of course you're the hero) and a few friend exiled from the knights and determined to prove your innocence.The real culprit is the Kooluk Empire, which has decided to spread its power into the ocean kingdoms.  Rune technology has reached the point of creating cannons capable of destroying whole cities, and the hero's only strength is the Rune of Punishment, which has great power, but inevitably destroys its wielder.  The flow of the game is pure Suikoden - establish a headquarters, enlist supporters and fight, fight, and fight,Other than the excessive and tedious fighting, the game's greatest weakness is poor character definition.  Suikoden III, offered three different key players, all with strong personalities and stories.  With little effort, you could make the game into something meaningful to you as a person.  Suikoden IV is a fill in the dots story with an almost generic hero, one who is supposed to be you, but who never speaks aloud, never has a line longer than 5 words, and manages to develop no close ties with other characters.  There are third person shooters with more compelling characters.The game starts out shakily, gradually builds momentum, but never reaches the heights of its predecessors.  For all that it covers an entire ocean, it really isn't a large game.  Subquests and mini-games are lightweight - my favorite was the fishing game, which is an interesting way to spend some non-productive time.  The game plays out shorter than Suikoden III and competitors like the Final Fantasy series.  To be honest, I'm not sure if that is a bad thing or a good thing.This is an acceptable game, but not one that will leave much of an afterglow.  Since RPG's of any magnitude are rare, many of us will play it eventually.  And as long as you don't expect something that sets the bar higher you will be passably entertained.  However, I recommend you wait until the price comes down a bit.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Jaha","summary":"Just what you would expect from Square and the FF series!","reviewText":"I basically bought my PS2 for this game and the ones schedueled to come.  I never was a big RPG fan until FF7 was introduced to me and I fell in love with the games and now I am always hours into a game of Final Fantasy or other similar RPG's.  This game is by far graphically the best one I have played yet.  The movies andinteractions are visually stunning.  Just watch the first 20 minutes of the game and be blown away.  The downfalls of the game I have noticed thus far are that the dubbing of the english voices has kinda made many of the dialouge sequences drag and seem awkward.  THe characters speak their line and then you have to wait a second or so watching their lips moving until the next character speaks.  FOr a few sequences this got really bad and to the point as that even grunts or sighs were delayed.  Another thing is if you don't like being engulfed in Story or movies then you might be frustrated with the first few hours of the game where basically all it is is STORY STORY STORY and you have little chances to move and interact or fight.  Eventually though you get going and I'd say after about 5-6 hours you reach a point where the story slows down and gives you time to explore manually.  It is kinda funny though how after all those hours of story you and your character still have no clue as to what the heck is going on.  Finally the last thing that can be a minus is that your character is a dweeb.  The first few times you hear him talk after the beginning I thought \"What a moron!\"  [...] his character isn't always linear.  Meaning sometimes he is smart and confident and then all of a sudden he is a clueless fool.  THis just doesn't help the character development flow since he changes all the time from one form to another.  But even with my nit picking I still love the game.  It has all the classic qualities of the Final Fantasy series and even though they always change the magic and development system after a short while you will pick it up and feel right at home when you see how similar it is to the old titles.  If you love Final Fantasy or are just a big RPG fan you cannot miss this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00BDS415I","description":"","reviewerName":"Andrew Gray \"Beezer Review\"","summary":"Quality reasonably priced headset","reviewText":"I have been a gaming headset user for quite some time now. From the moment I got my first headset I knew I'd never go back to a normal headset or ear buds. Just no where near the same quality. I have always opted for the more expensive models such asTurtle Beach Ear Force XP510 Premium Wireless Dolby Digital Gaming Headset, but I understand that type of budget is not for everyone.Enter the Turtle Beach PX22. It offers an affordable price, but doesn't lose any of the solid Stereo sound quality. This is not a Dolby Surround sound model, but it doesn't have to be. It offers solid volume control, bass and tremble sound is clear and crisp, Chat quality is also really good with controls on the control box.Easy to hook up and painless to understand. Sometimes, well most times really, simple is good and that's exactly what the folks at Turtle Beach have done here.This headset is the obvious successor to the PX21 and is better in every way. The PX22 feels much more sturdy than the PX21. A larger headband, more comfortable ear pieces, more crisp sound, and better chat quality. All wrapped up in a reasonably priced package.A feature that may be missed by some, unplug it from the little mix amp toggle thing and it's a standard headphone jack usable by MP3 players, phones, Playstation Vita etc. Sound quality doesn't suffer at all.Bonus for reading this review. If you are new to Turtle Beach headsets or just unsure about how they name their products. Anytime you see PX or a combination of that the P stands for usable on Playstation, X for Xbox so PX means it will work for both systems. I only bring that up because I didn't know that until a couple months ago. :-)Regardless, the PX22 is a fantastic headset and one that should certainly appeal to gamers on a budget that don't want to sacrifice quality.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Steven Herring","summary":"Best Game of ALL Time!!!!","reviewText":"Goldeneye set the standards for every FPS that has followed. It is the best of the best. The levels are action packed and extremely memorable. I can do the levels in my head I've played them so many times. The graphics are dull now, but back in the day these visuals were top notch. The music involves some of the best techno I've ever heard. The game is also surprisingly difficult. I took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels. The multiplayer is ahead of it's time with four player large arena style deathmatches. This game should be missed by no one, pick up a copy today and first hand see the best.Presentation- This game captures what it is to be James Bond. There are a great deal of weapons, cool menus, and music that still rocks to this day. All around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic. 5/5Story- The game follows the story of Goldeneye pretty closely, and there are two bonus levels that follow other Bond movies. Including one of the hardest levels of all time the Aztec based on the movie Moonraker. 5/5Graphics- This game looked amazing for it's day, now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of N64 looked liked. 5/5/Game play- This is the part that could be helped by a remake. The N64 controller only has one joystick. This is awkward sometimes, but the use of the c-pad to strafe helps. Nintendo please remake this amazing gem. 4.5/5Sound- Some of the best music in a video game ever made. Catchy music that I even have on my Ipod to this day. 5/5Lasting Appeal- I still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me. I can play levels in my head, need I say more. This game will never be forgotten or equaled. 5/5Rating 4.9/5","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2009"}

In this one, you get to shoot the lights out once again like the first.  The second one took that away, so if you wanted to be stealthy and in the dark, good luck.  Now you can shoot out the lights and keep your cover.Being able to commandeer vehicles is great!!!  One of the levels I managed to stop a truck after jumping into an enemy vehicle.  My team then took out the truck.  I also like the fact that the enemy will surrender if you do things right.  I noticed that the commands have been drastically reduced.  For example there is no more \"Attack To\", or \"Stealth To\" commands.  It's just \"Move To\".  I don't think there is even a \"Run To\" command.  So, although this is kinda sad they always get caught anyway.  I'm usually the one that tells the team to hold position and I move stealthily.  Anyway, the missions are cool too.  There is sure a lot of cool things.  Crosstalk objectives and Bonus objectives are hidden.  But, this game is so much fun.  I hope they come out with a 4th!!!
