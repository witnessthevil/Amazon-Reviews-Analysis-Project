{"product_name":"B00020BV2E","reviewerName":"G. Marshall \"Geoffrey Marshall\"","summary":"the world is a sandbox...","reviewText":"The leader of North Korea, General Kim Il Song has finally gone too far. A Royal Australian Navy ship intercepted an NK Navy ship that was carrying nuclear warheads intended for al Queda terrorists who purchased it, and that was the last straw. The Allied Nations immediately invaded North Korea, intent on removing him from power and bringing him to justice. The South Koreans also invaded, hoping to effect reunification with their northern neighbors. The Chinese invaded from the North, intent on getting a piece of the NK Pie, which the South Koreans do not really want to happen. The Russian Mafia moved in, hoping to make cash selling whatever to whoever would purchase. General Song immediately went undercover, a fugitive from justice, fighting against all invaders through a network of tunnels and strongholds, using his top 3 aides and their subordinates to wreak havoc against all invaders, with great success. With all this chaos on the ground, the AN finds it hard to deal with the other factors and the search for the aides and General Song, so they have placed a bounty on the head of all subordinates, with the grand prize of $100 million for General Song who is \"the Ace of Spades.\"This tweaks the interest of Ex-Ops and their three Mercs...You play the role of one of the three mercenaries: Chris the former US Special OPS agent, Jennifer the former SAS agent, or Matthias, the Swedish mercenary. Your mission: to get as much money as you can by blowing up stuff and accepting missions for pay from whatever faction you want. The ultimate goal is that $100 million payday, but there's quite a bit to do between here and there...are you up to it?This is one of the better games out there for the PS2 and is a good solo player game. You choose your player at the beginning of the campaign and you cannot switch your selection once the campaign begins. The manual says that each mercenary is different in terms of gameplay; having played through the campaigns with all three, I'm not sure that I buy that statement. The only significant difference is in dialogue between Fiona and your character, cut-scenes when you take down a card, and the ability to understand one of the other three factions when you go to accept a contract and they're talking in their native language before they give you the details of your current contract. Chris can understand Korean (his mother is Korean), Jennifer can understand Chinese (she was born in Hong Kong) and Matthias can understand Russian, but other than that, I have not seen much difference among the three out in the field. So, don't sweat too much about who to pick when you first play this game.The main aim of the game is to capture the 52 members of the NK leadership that the Allies have a bounty on, but the real focus is on blowing up stuff and getting money so you can buy stuff to blow up more stuff. The Allies have set up these 52 people as a deck of cards, and the game can be divided into 4 \"acts\", where each act focuses on your pursuit of one suit. In order of difficulty and position in the game, they are clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades. Each \"act\" concludes when you beat the \"Ace\" contract. To get this ace contract, you must capture/kill enough members of the current suit in order to get information to the Allies, who will provide you with the Ace contract once they have enough information. To capture enough members of the suit, you have to accept missions from any or all of the factions. Accepting these missions may require you to do things that will...antagonize other factions, but hey! It's all about the benjamins, isn't it? When you successfully complete a mission, the faction head will send you information on where you can find one of the current cards, and you can go hunt him/her down so you can head for your major payday. Cards may be be brought in dead or alive, but you only get half the money if the card is dead.There are 5 factions in the game:the Allies, South Koreans, Russian Mafia, Chinese and North Koreans. The North Koreans are always hostile to you (and everyone else), while the other factions' mood toward you will vary according to your actions. Basically, attacking any faction will put you in their bad books, while completing their missions and helping them out in battles if you see them fighting in the countryside will give you brownie points. There are other methods to get favor with each faction... If you find yourself in the bad books with a faction, you will have to bribe them in order to get missions from them again (and bring their favor back up to levels where they don't shoot at you on sight). Generally speaking, it is best to not tick off the Allies, as they're the closest thing to friends you have in this arena and they provide your most important missions (aces), as well as pick up any card that you capture alive. To call in a pickup and have the helicopter gunners shooting at you as you put your captive in the chopper...not good thing. It is also wise to not get on the Russian Mafia's bad side, because they provide you with all the weapons, vehicles and supplies you could ever want to order. To be stuck between North Korean tanks on one side and a tunnel entrance spewing out NK soldiers on the other side, and to frantically search for an airstrike only to see a denial of service message...not good at all. The South Koreans and Chinese...well, they're not so crucial to game play, and taking an SK mission usually means you're going to fight against the Chinese and vice versa. You will tick off one side or the other during the course of the game, but just have enough money to bribe them and you'll be fine.One thing to remember is that killing civilians lowers your ratings with all 4 factions, and attracts a $25000 penalty. You also pay that fine if you kill an Allied soldier.Weaponry is realistically set up. There are a good number of weapons to choose from, and while some may complain about the two weapon limit that your character can carry, I find it makes the game more challenging and fun. It is frustrating however, to see an enemy RPG head straight for you, while he can easily dodge the RPG you send his way; but that is my main complaint. Another issue I have is with the reloading of ammo; if you have used up all of your shots, then picking up a resupply only fills your supply without reloading the weapon. Any issues about the number of shots it takes for you to kill an enemy soldier is negated by the fact that our heros (or heroine) are among the toughest game characters i've ever seen. I have found myself using mostly the AK47 (ubiquitous among NK soldiers), M16 carbine (default weapon,  high ammo capacity, low magazine capacity), anti-tank missile (great to save your butt, but only three shots!) and sniper rifle. Other weapons exist however, so don't limit yourself to these.EVERYTHING in the game, short of the actual landscape itself, can be destroyed. Take that as you may, hahahaha.The vehicle selection is awesome. Almost every vehicle/helicopter in the game can be driven/flown/used in some way, so feel free to use whatever you can to get what you want. Also, you get cash for blowing up North Korean Vehicles, and you can sell any vehicle to the Russian Mafia, so that's some quick cash. There are also little side missions to get funds, races against the clock, delivery missions, etc.All in all, it is a fun game and will engage most people up until the last mission. The final mission, getting General Song, is the WORST mission in the game and is the main reason why I give the game 4 stars and not 5. Simply put, it is too long and very frustrating. The mission is divided into two parts, where the first part is 30% of the mission and the second part is 70%. If you reach the end of the first part, you get a small breather and a chance to get health and new vehicular support, but if you die at ANY POINT IN THE MISSION, you have to start from the beginning again. Furthermore, the first part is very difficult, and the second part is even worse! To date, I have not yet completed the final mission from beginning to end; I had to cheat by hijacking a helicopter and flying up to the final fortress instead of fighting along the ground.Besides that, this is a game that will be one of the PS2's greatest hits, and is a worthy purchase for $20. I don't think its sequel would be a killer app for any of the next-gen consoles, but I would purchase it if I owned one of them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-19-2006"}

{"product_name":"B001DYXGUI","reviewerName":"Joey Pimkowski","summary":"Why rent when you can buy it for 10 dollars?","reviewText":"I have to say all these negative reviews are relative to the game being full price.I for one watched the movie and didn't care either way about it but I really enjoyed the developer Grin's previous game Bionic Commando. Everything you read is true from the other reviews but I feel many of those reviews don't have the correct prospective.For around ten dollars, you get a really fun, action packed shooter. From the beginning, the game throws you in the mix of a huge firefight, going rooftop to rooftop gunning people down left and right.The tutorials are simple and to the point and flows well with the narrative showing Wesley's change from a normal guy to a trained killer.The game is short but some of the reviews claiming to have beat this in three hours are probably playing on easy. Wanted is everything a third person shooter should be with style to spare. Unlike games like Gears of War where you have to hid behind cover and slowly advance, here you'll find yourself zipping from cover to cover and sliding over obstacles in such a smooth natural way it's like chaining together combos in Tekken. The controls are spot on and the curved bullets, slow mo,and death grabs are a blast and make you feel like a complete assassin badass. So, yeah, the game is short but it's one great roller coaster ride and I have to say that I really enjoyed playing on the Killer mode to unlock more achievments.On the negative side, the cut scenes are kinda ugly despite the regular gameplay looking really good, it's a shame they didn't do these with the in game models instead of this prerendered nonsense. While the game is fun, the freshness wears off and the last half of the game could have added something to make everything less rinse and repeat. The one gameplay change they do have is two gun turret sections and a few sniper shootouts. The sniper sections are alright but the stationary gun sections are lame and it took me a couple tries to realize you have to look up to avoid the bullets coming at you. There's also a completely awesome airplane shoot out which was really gripping and ridiculous, I just wish there were more set pieces like this.All I can say is that I didn't particularly care for the movie, but the cool style and breezy gameplay won me over. I took me a couple days to play through this and what's here is really good. For the price on Amazon, you really can't go wrong. You can literally buy this for the price of a downloadable game and the airplane sequence is worth the price of admission alone.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-17-2010"}

Mullins","summary":"What Call of Duty 3 should have been","reviewText":"Call of Duty World at War (WaW) is everything that Call of Duty 3 should have been. I will be honest and say I expect this game to be a placeholder for me, something to do between CoD4 Modern Warfare and CoD Modern Warfare 2. Just as CoD3 was something to play between CoD2 and CoD4. That said I was pleasant surprised to find that WaW is a great game in its own right. The gameplay very much resembles CoD4 and the controls are tight and responsive. The gameplay is classic Call of Duty. You will fight hordes of enemies until you move past the trigger point and they stop spawning. The weapon variety is good and the level design, while extremely linear, is well laid out.The campaign is fun, though because of the time span, is very disjointed. You will not feel like you are part of a real story in the way you did in COD4. Since you will take the place of two soldiers in two armies fighting missions covering the entire war. I would have preferred that the game take place in a short period of time in order to tell a more complete and engrossing story. But I'll be the first to admit that many players want to shoot things and the story takes a back seat. Which brings me to the greatest part of the campaign, the ability to play through it coop with friends, either split screen or on Xbox Live. This was the one thing I keenly missed in CoD4 and I am glad to see it make its appearance on WaW.Multiplay is fun with a very engrossing upgrade/leveling system. I will be honest and say I play very little multiplayer apart from coop with friends, so I will not go into great detail on it.All in all I was very surprised and pleased with World at War. I picked it up expecting it to be okay and what I ended up with was a great game in its own right. With a series as good as Call of Duty every new game will struggle with the legacy it is expected to carry, I can honestly say that WaW is a great entry in the series and worth picking up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0030MQPQ8","description":"","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"Boring single player, surprisingly fun multiplayer.","reviewText":"Do I need to say anything about games based on movies? I think at this point, everyone knows that 90% of the time, they're garbage. Now and then you'll get something that surpasses the movie it's tied to (X-Men Origins Wolverine comes to mind), but it's rare. I didn't care much for Tron Legacy as a movie. It bored me, the characters were mostly bland, it had embarrassing fight sequences...I could go on. Yet I loved the look of everything and wanted to know more about the story that they barely touched on. The world of Tron appealed to me, so much so that I bought the game. I knew this wasn't going to be good just based on the few gameplay clips I'd seen, and sure enough, I was right. 10 minutes into the game, I could see that everything was a mess. Poor controls, a horrendously repetitive combat system and a story that they rushed out that only the biggest fanboys of Tron could care for.I won't touch on the story much since there's so little of it to talk about, but you're basically playing as a silent Monitor program named Anon, whose function is to take care of a conspiracy within the world of Tron. Kevin Flynn's imprisonment is also briefly explained, as well as the genocide of ISOs that was quickly mentioned in Tron Legacy. As Anon, you're going to spend a lot of time running along walls ala Prince of Persia, throwing your disc at the same handful of enemies, and jumping to and fro. Oh, and you'll get a Light Cycle now and then. Controls are basic- X is jump, Circle is melee attack, Square throws your disc, and Triangle does a special attack that uses whichever special disc enhancement you have selected. There are 4 types of discs you can use with this feature, though Square will always be a standard disc attack regardless of what type is equipped. Special attacks use up a single unit of energy, and energy can be recovered by defeating enemies or (get this) vaulting over control panel desks and lights. Your health can be recovered by running along walls that have specially lit marks too.There's so much wrong with this game, I don't know where to start. Gameplay got boring by the end of chapter 1, having to run along walls, make leaps of faith, pray that you're lined up with whatever you need to land on, and then going into a room and fighting a few waves of enemies for a couple of minutes. Running along walls isn't too bad, but there were a good number of times when I'd spend 20 minutes dying over and over again because of how poorly designed the 'grapple' mechanic was. In some areas, there are orange balls of light that you can grapple to with your disc, and then land on a nearby platform. In the beginning of the game, there's one of these that isn't lined up with right, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that I spent 20 minutes of dying before I finally lucked out and got it. I highly recommend leveling up in online multiplayer BEFORE playing story mode too, as even on the Normal difficulty setting, enemies have a lot of cheap attacks. Even when they throw a disc at you and it misses, the disc will do a magical series of maneuvers that even the Warren Commission couldn't come up with an excuse for, and still hit you. Checkpoints are placed too closely together or too far apart in some cases, usually whenever you have to clear a room of strong enemies. Be prepared to fight the same battle dozens of times if you don't level up a lot.Combat is so boring that it's insane. Press the square button a lot, or spam special attacks and restore your energy, repeating the process. That's all you need to do. There's a lengthy combo list that you can read in the menu, but why bother? Controlling Anon is a pain as well. Words can't describe how this guy moves- you just have to see it for yourself. I still can't believe that you have to restore health by running along lights on the walls. That's hands down one of the worst things I've seen in a game. With the magical tracking discs that enemies have, there -will- be many times when you're running away to get some health and then BAM! Disc to the back! Dead! It's not something that make the game challenging, but something that makes it not fun. When the game finally does mix it up with Light Cycle sections, it's not much different. Rather than giving you a good battle, like Light Cycles were meant for, it's just a simple race to the end of the level that lasts a few minutes. Cutscenes are long and a potential cure for insomnia, voice acting is average at best, and again, the story is one of those things that feels tacked on more than anything. It's like they finished making the levels and then went \"oh hey, we should probably talk about Kevin and them huh?\".So how am I giving this game 3 stars, which is a decent rating? Online multiplayer. When I reached chapter 3 in the Story mode, I was about to snap from boredom and gave this a go. I ended up playing for an hour straight, whereas I was sighing and looking at the time whenever I'd reach another room full of bad guys in Story mode. There's a good selection of matches you can have: Disintegration and Team Disintegration are your regular deathmatch modes, Power Monger is a kind of node control game, and Bit Runner is basically capture the flag. You can have either regular combat or a mix of regular combat with Light Cycles and tanks. Fortunately, the use of Light Cycles in multiplayer is much better than in Story mode, since you can actually derez other players with your trail. Controlling the Light Cycle is iffy but with practice it gets a little easier. Since you can level up Anon here, and use the upgrades in Story mode, it gives you another reason to play. If no human players are available, bots will be assigned instead, but it's always more fun with other people. There's only been a few times where the action got jumpy due to connection problems.Tron: Evolution is a game that hardcore Tron fans will eat up and force themselves to look past the faults in order to say good things about it. The game is a disaster with bad platforming, repetitive combat, slightly above average graphics (even for when it was released) and poor controls. I forgot all about the virus/infection that was going on through the world, after the first cutscene showed it, until later on when the writers seemed to remember it and threw it back in there. This is a forgettable game, but the multiplayer gives it some extra life. Buy it only if you're that big of a fan, and only if you can get it for a very low price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-20-2012"}

It sucks hard.  So hard.  In multiplayer, some of the maps are visually appealing, and others look tacky and thoughtless.  Some of the maps feel fresh, and others are reminiscent of MW3 maps, like Dome.  There are 12 player matches, instead of the usual 16 on PS4.  The guns seem powerful, but they don't have alot of detail.  There's a new weapon class, the long range rifle.  It takes a while to unlock accessories, as you aren't given many unlock tokens, and they go fast.  If you unlock a scope, killstreak or tactical that you don't like, you have to eat it while you wait for more tokens.  The perk system is kinda cool, as you can have 3, 4 or 5.  Each perk has a point value, 1, 2 or 3.  You get a total of like 8 to spend.  This is not a run and gun game, like BO2.  You need alot of patience to play this game.  If you play long enough to unlock everything, I can imagine it may be gratifying, but I don't think many people will be interested long enough to do so.  You may have some fun playing this game at first, but unless you're a multiplayer beast, Ghosts will probably leave you feeling unfulfilled.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

Comes in a nice plastic case, and a manual. Installation is straightforward. Install, replace CD, click OK, then wait, then put next CD.

All in all, pretty stable installation and game playingBug:Ok...now the bug. For some reason you lose items when you respawn after getting slaughtered. Now...it only happened to me once. After hearing other players about it, I realized it is an existing bug. So...my advice. Keep all your important stuff in the storage.Gameplay:There's no point in really trying to focus on who to target specifically when the fighting starts. You can get mobs thirty deep so all you can really do is squint and view the monsters, the special lighting effects, and a mass of confusing graphic paperdolls hacking away at each other. Getting mobbed by thirty baddies is almost downright impossible to see your team from the rest of the unforgiving hordes of baddies. There's a lazy fix to this. Go to Options and select: Auto Attack and Auto Defend. This puts your Dungeon Siege 2 act like it's Dungeon Siege 1. Remember the first Dungeon Siege where the game auto kills anything without mashing your mouse button? Well, you can do that here too through the Options menu.  Select both options, sit back and relax...throw a few heal potions using hotkeys and you have one automated hack slash festival.So....is the game any better than other hack and slash games? Umm...nope. In fact, DS2 borrowed so many concepts and structures from Diablo 2...from storage chest, teleporters,save a town only feature, skill tree, and separating the whole game into chapters. You can say DS2 is the 2005 version of Diablo 2. Structure and framework almost similar to Diablo 2.How's the fun factor? Well...let me put it this way. If you don't want to think too much and you basically just want to get your mind involved to do stuff (besides sleeping and staring at the TV), DS2 does the job well. It's one of those games where you just want to play it and not lose your mind over a brain-damaging puzzle. It's a pure hack-slash mindless romp across exotic locales. Sometimes it's good not to use your brain and just want to relax. Well...DS2 does. It's a good game. Good graphics...simple and easy to beat.

{"product_name":"B008PQU3E4","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Gordon","summary":"A Worthy FPS Collection","reviewText":"Back in the early 2000s, Bungie's console sci-fi first person shooter \"Halo\" was pretty much the benchmark for the genre on consoles.  Halo's slick controls and graphically impressive presentation helped keep the Xbox's head above water long enough for it to garner a decent amount of publisher support over time.  As one would expect, Sony, as Microsoft's main competitor, wanted its own answer to Halo, and in the years in-between Halo and Halo 2, Sony developed and promoted a so-called Playstation 2 exclusive \"Halo-killer\" called \"Killzone\".  The result was a game that had a lot of promise, but was too ambitious for the relatively underpowered PS2.  Killzone was actually not a bad game at all, but suffered from atrocious frame-rates, buggy presentation, poor draw distance, and a sluggish feel.  Despite these failings, Sony doubled down on the potential of a Killzone franchise, and released Killzone 2 for their next system, the PS3.  Despite the scandal of an early E3 presentation that was actually a \"target render\" and not real gameplay, Killzone 2 managed to at least get within striking distance of what was promised, and was a fair success.  Killzone 3 followed within a 2 year window, and established the series as a worthy Sony exclusive.  With this collection, not only do you get the PS3 entries, but you also get an HD rendition of the original PS2 Killzone on disc, and all for $40, along with a voucher to download the DLC for the PS3 games, for less than the price of a single new game.For those who haven't ever played a Killzone game, but like FPS games, this is sort of a no-brainer; it's easily worth the money for the reasons I'll outline below.  For those who already are invested in the franchise, and have both PS3 games, it's a trickier proposition, and your decision will probably hinge on whether it's important to you to have a hard copy of Killzone HD (as it's currently available through PSN).  In regards to the quality of Killzone HD overall, it's actually a pretty good update, all things given.  Like most \"HD updates\", much of the improvement comes down to using a natural high definition resolution, increasing clarity greatly.  In this case, it also appears that Guerilla Games used the original assets, that had been downgraded for the PS2 version, but are present here as they would've intended if the PS2 had been powerful enough to handle them.  Sure, the cinematic cutscenes, like most HD game reissues, are pretty wretchedly low-fi, but the gameplay itself runs at a very consistent framerate, with clearer textures, and markedly improved draw distance.  Occasionally, you'll still encounter the embarassing moment when hitting the magazine reload button or fire button glitches out, and nothing happens, but overall, this is probably the game Sony and Guerrilla wanted to release in an ideal world.Gameplay-wise, the Killzone trilogy may have been marketed as an answer to Halo, but is, in reality, much more akin to the Call of Duty series.  Killzone 1, which takes place mostly on the Earth-like colony of Vecta, feels much like a futuristic take on the first Call of Duty (and its predecessors, the early Medal of Honor titles), with a taste of the Red Faction franchise thrown in.  As you fight your way through the Vectan capital initially, and then through beaches, jungles, swamps, forests, snowy mountains, and whatnot, you end up building up a 4 person squad, and depending on the level, have the choice of which member to play as.  Each member has different abilities, which can effect which route you take through the level.  It's a pretty straightforward shooter which eschews Halo-esque vehicle use in favor of various types of infantry combat.  The AI is a bit dopey, but overall you'll get a fair amount of gameplay here.  There's also a botmatch mode, that allows the solo player to simulate a multiplayer experience (unfortunately, this version doesn't have true multiplayer, which would probably be redundant anyways).Killzone 2 is a much more cinematic and hard-hitting experience, taking place on the enemy world of Helghan during a botched invasion, and reflects the cinematic turn the Call of Duty franchise took between Call of Duty 2 and the Modern Warfare sub-franchise.  Obviously, as a PS3 native game, it's much better looking, although the environment is less lush and more harsh and hostile than its predecessor.  The game is much more focused on changing up the experience from moment to moment, and \"palette-cleansers\" such as turret shooting from a hovering battleship and using a mech emphasize the shift to a more \"produced\", if linear, experience.  The multiplayer has been revamped, but still includes a botmatch option.  This time around, a match essentially incorporates mutiple types of matches, that change each time a team wins.  Killzone 3 matches Call of Duty's eventual total shift towards impressive, but restrictive, cinematic spectacle, with set-piece moments littered throughout the campaign.  It's a memorable ride, but shorter and somewhat shallower than its predecessors.  Still, it closes the campaign with a memorable starfighter sequence, and for the amount you pay for the collection overall, it's hard to complain too much.  Killzone 3's multiplayer once again includes a botmatch mode for those who want the experience without being insulted by Mountain Dew-addled teens, and is a further refinement of what came before.While the series as a whole is pretty entertaining, there are still a few caveats.  The \"heavy/sluggish\" feel of movement can be a bit of a turnoff to those accustomed to the lighter, and frankly, more responsive feel of other shooters, while the fact that they didn't include the DLC on the disc itself is a real disappointment for those who want some permanency without relying on Sony's maintaining the content on servers for the next few decades.  The Killzone games are reliable fun, but always feel a bit \"off\" in the polish department, especially when it comes to the dunder-headed audio when characters speak.  In addition, the dingy/gritty look of the environments may be an aesthetic that is an acquired taste for some.  As a side note, you will need to install Killzone HD on your hard drive from the disc, so make sure you have enough spare room on your console.  Overall, though, this collection houses some pretty solid shooter action, and for Killzone newcomers who are intrigued, is a very safe bet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-12-2013"}

Nice mix of hack n slash play with gun targeting thrown in. The story is great, typical Deadpool fashion. Lots of snarky comments and crude humour. The only thing stopping me from giving this 5 stars is that the game is rather short (but typical length for this style of game) but there is no extra depth to play the challenge missions.

Most levels and some enemies also involve a little bit of puzzle-solvoing ability to decipher.  The story is not a new one to video games: the hero's girlfriend gets kidnapped and he blasts his way through Hell (literally in this case) to rescue her. By way of tone, let's just say an entire chapter is an homage to Evil Dead 2. If you're a fan of this film, you'll probably dig this video game. If you saw Evil Dead 2 and didn't like it, you'll hate this video game. If you haven't seen Evil Dead 2, my suggestion would be to watch it.  If you're reading a review of Shadows of the Damned, chances are you're the kind of guy who'll like Evil Dead 2.  Order it when you order this game.  But be warned, it's not much of a chick movie, (unless the chick happens to be ultra cool).  So if you're planning on having a girl over for a movie (and maybe a glass of wine or two) then order The Empire Strikes Back or Raiders of the Lost Ark when you order Shadows of the Damned and Evil Dead 2.  Most girls will watch either of this movies and really get into them.  If not.  If she insists on a film with Katherine Heigle or Ryan Gosling in it, then I can promise you you're wasting your time.  Not only is she your intellectual inferior, but she'll never let you play with her boobs.

He only appeared in a very small role in the last game, but he's all over Uncharted 3.  Glad to see a good character get back into the series.  There is also a new character who I think fans will like a lot.The game starts really slowly.  By about Chapter 5 or 6, I was not having a good time.  The Uncharted series built its success on a specific combination of platforming, story and gunplay, and the first part of this game doesn't hit that balance well.  Early on I decided that this was not an Uncharted game.  But if you stick with it you'll find that it really picks up, and the traditional Uncharted formula is going strong by the later levels.  I'm deducting one star from the \"fun\" rating because of the slow start, but you'll be having a blast later on.Another flaw with Uncharted 2 was the bad boss fight at the end, which seemed both silly and unnecessary.  This game doesn't have such a fight.  Some might see this as a negative, I see it as a plus.  This series does not need boss fights except for the odd helicopter or tank that need to be blown up.A lot has been written about what is apparently a new aiming system, and it does take some getting used to.  I think the difference is actually that the enemies move around more, making it harder to line up head shots or even to hit them at all.The best thing I can say about this game is that when I realised I was just about at the end, I was not ready for it to finish.  I wanted to spend more time in the game world and with the characters.  I suppose that's what the multi-player is for, right?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2011"}

A copy was in stock at my local video rental store so I picked it up and figured, \"Hey It's Xbox, I'll get some achievements\".  5 hours of gameplay later (spanned over 3 days) I beat the game.  It's an easy game to beat.  Especially the last few levels of hell.  Of course, the second to last level has 10 parts but they go by quickly.  It sticks pretty close to The Divine Comedy and sets up for some possible sequels but all in all I had fun.  It was repetitive and the environments all started to blend together after about 4 levels.Replay value on this game is very low.  Just because it's an easy game doesn't mean it's stressing at times.  To go through it again would not be a fun adventure.  I'm happy I beat it, happy it's over and glad it wasn't horrible.  The cut scene graphics look just like a real life movie.  They do great things with this game.  Creating a hell is no easy task but they do it quite well where I can see this game winning awards for effects over gameplay.

I'm a moderate gamer; the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review is for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) that sits on the couch and watches.So, let me get the fact that this game is totally gorgeous out of the way. I mean, really, it's just beautiful. The backgrounds, the characters, the enemies and villains, even the chocobos are beautiful. But, with games as with life, looks aren't everything.Once your team is assembled, the game pay consists of six characters with three playing at a time. (Side note: HELLO! SQUARE ENIX....I'm sitting here, I'm watching. Would it have been that hard to make those other two characters playable so I could PLAY and not just watch??) As is the case with all RPG type games, there is always at least one character that is just a tad annoying. One of the great things about this game is that it almost doesn't matter. All of your players gain experience points, no matter who you use in battle. So, you don't have to alternate players out just to try to keep everyone on equal footing level wise. For us, this meant that we hardly ever played Hope. Also, there were plenty of save points, which is great. So many games act like save points cost a fortune.So now the negatives....When watching a game, I like a good mix of game play and cut scenes. With this game, it seemed like it was feast or famine. Sometimes, the cut scenes seemed to last forever and happen almost too frequently. Other times, hours of game play would go on without a cut scene. Sometimes it would seem like such a long time, that I would forget what was going on. I think my occasional naps between cut scenes didn't help with my understanding of the game any. I found that at times the story was somewhat complicated, but I guess it was just me because Mike was able to follow it just fine. Of course, he was playing the game, not just watching it. (Thanks again, Square Enix. Dual player, not that hard.)Overall, it was a beautiful and fun game with a great, albeit complicated, story. I think the ending was good, but I'm not really sure. After we beat what we assumed was the final boss, about 2 minutes into the end story...beep beep beep and the PS3 goes dead. *sigh* If you're wondering, it was NOT fun enough for us to play again, just to watch those last few cut scenes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2010"}

Most had problems of random encounters much like Pokemon when your traveling along the grass, but difference is in all Final Fantasy games it was constant except a few. And FFXIII has changed the landscape and has excellent music, deep enriched storyline, landscape, battle schemes, it is a Final Fantasy fans dream come true. I know alot of people want to say this is bad or the worst game of all time because of the changes. I look at these changes as a step forward, i mean it makes logical sense to bump into a monster then go into a battle, instead of having a twirling screen, and some music then go into a battle right? or how about being leader and making your team mates automatically do what action is best at the moment with what they have in the battle? that also makes logical sense.To me the only few nagging things i have to state and trust me this is not a break or buy thing but it's small. The storyline is very cleverly written, and i wish there was more depth to each characters personality during the whole game. It is not that it is bad, but at times it can feel like the characters are bundled together without much backstory. Last but not least was the maps i wish there was more detail instead of confined paths just a little bit more to explore, i mean that is all this game needs really.In conclusion i find the negativity about this to be humerious and funny, because the creator of Final Fantasy wanted to change the series for the next generation, and he did not do much to it at all, it is still the same formula(trust me i played FF7 watched my cousins beat most Final Fantasy games). But to me it needed to happen because sometimes we can all live in the past with FF7,FF8, FF4,FF10,FF-12 but sometimes we need to realize what day and age we are in and not be pessemestic about the game do to the fact it changed a few things and reinvented itself away from the rest. To me it is a successful game, not perfect, but it is a step in the path of a right direction.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2010"}

XBOX owners truly benefit and to reward us for our wait and loyalty, Microsoft included a full length DVD movie of the first Shenmue game (awesome!!) and they went back and improved the game by improving the textures, adding voice dubbing (I hate subtitles) featuring the same voice actor who did Ryo's voice in Shenmue 1, and added hard drive support, faster load times, a rock-solid frame rate, and so much more!  And it's all on ONE DVD disc!  No need to swap discs during play like we were used to on the Dreamcast versions (the DC version of Shenmue consisted of FOUR discs!).  Needless to say, Microsoft and Sega did a fantastic job making this the definitive version for the true Shenmue fan!

{"product_name":"B003O6HLOK","description":"","reviewerName":"Tim Janson","summary":"oK FOR THE CASUAL GAMER","reviewText":"Asura's Wrath is an Anime and Asian mythology inspired action game that has a lot of promise but ultimately comes up a bit short as a must-own.  While not possessing a story that has much originality, Asura's Wrath still manages to get you interested in its main character.  Asura is one of eight Heavenly guardians who is accused murdering the Emperor, after killing his wife and kidnapping his daughter Mithra, the other seven Guardian Generals toss Asura out of Heaven and down to Earth.  12,000 years later, Asura escapes from his prison to find that his former comrades, now dubbed \"The Seven Deities\", have been using Mithra's power to amplify their own. Asura has to take on the forces of the other Deities to save his daughter and gain his revenge.Let me just start by saying I don't know anyone who truly likes quick time events in game.  Some of us tolerate them, some don't care for them, and a lot of gamers positively hate them.  If you're a member of the latter than you might want to steer clear of Asura's Wrath because there are a lot of them in here.  The combat system is literally built on a foundation of QTEs.  On the other hand...umm...wow Asura's Wrath puts on about the biggest, loudest, most over-the-top show you've ever seen, and I mean WAY over the top!  Heavily inspired by some of the more outrageous Anime, you'll see Asura hit bad guys so hard they'll go flying into mountains and threaten to bring them crashing down or go flying off the surface of the planet.  There's a sword that looks big enough to cleave the moon into two halves and someone's trying to slice Asura with it.  Rarely have I seen a game this bombastic.The gameplay is meant to feel like a TV-style presentation as you fight your way through 18 episodes which come with beginning and ending titles and credits.  Each one is a unique battle or test for Asura and range from all out beat-em-ups, to rail-shooters, to others that are truly sublime like the Hot Springs level.  That said Asura's combat system is almost simplistic to the point of becoming monotonous.  Despite his heavenly powers Asura is little more than a button-masher.  Even the quick-time events rarely require little more than the push of a single button.  Thus despite the often well done level design the game cannot escape its repetitiveness.  On the plus side it's probably a good choice for an entry level game for kids but for experience gamers it plays almost like an interactive cartoon than it does an actual game.An obvious fondness for Anime films and Manga is on display throughout the game and the gorgeous scenery never fails to catch your eye but this wears off quickly and you find yourself wanting more to do.  For $60 there's just not enough meat on the bones to this game to attract more than the casual gamer.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2012"}

I'm someone who's played every incarnation of the \"Castle Wolfenstein\" games, even a very strange kiosk that you could pay-to-play the older 486 PC version using a joystick and a VR headset.  Having recently re-played the \"Return to Castle Wolfenstein\", it was a real experience to pick up this newest entry in the series.\"Wolfenstein: the New Order\" is a great update to this classic series.  First-Person Shooters have changed a lot in the many years this series has been around, and the updates here really give a classic concept the feel of the latest & greatest that FPS games have to offer.  There is a good storyline, complete with top-drawer voice talent and the return of our hero B. J. Blascowicz.  We have weapon choices that include dual-wield, fast action with many a melee opportunity, and the same feel of collecting medkits and armor and occasionally overcharging your health for an upcoming rampage that made all of The New Order's predecessors so much fun.  Probably the best nod to the more recent games is the fact that there's more than one way to complete a level:  this isn't just a matter of being able to navigate the map through different paths, it's also that you can make choices that let you vary between stealth and run-and-gun.  FPS games don't often have the ability to view the map these days, so that makes for a nice bonus that is carried over from the earliest days of the Wolfenstein series.What makes the story fresh is that we are playing to an alternate history:  after an opening mission in 1946, our hero is out of commission until 1960, and it's a world where the Nazis won the war, all has been lost, and now B.J. is left to try to pick up the pieces entirely on his own.  Each level is a movie-quality step towards saving the world, and each level has a purpose that advances the main story.  The alternate 1960 is a mix of technologies that has a fairly believable look and feel, and some of the 'newer' technology mirrors the strangeness we saw in the depths of 'Return to Castle Wolfenstein' and the occult-driven more recent entry that was just called 'Wolfenstein'.As much fun as the game is, there are a few drawbacks.  I've had times where climbing a ladder is still the bane of Our Hero's existence and I spend time bobbling around looking for the grip point.  Switching weapons isn't a fast way to keep the firepower flowing when the bullets are low--sometimes it's just a trip to a quick death.  Changing ammo with the radial wheel can be clumsy.  I have a real problem with grenades:  sometimes I bump the shoulder button to throw (hold down means you want to select weapons) and nothing happens.  I won't spoil the story for you, but there is one particular mission that sounds like a great squad-based opportunity but by the time you reach the end you find yourself wondering what the point was.Still, \"Wolfenstein:  the New Order\" is a great title, and I think with time I'll come to love it as much as its predecessors, some of which I still play today.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-10-2014"}

But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"007 \"cmyth007\"","summary":"Solid but not as good as it should have been","reviewText":"I was thrilled to see the sequel to my favorite game in years, but a little dissappointed with a few things. First the pros...The graphics, textures and colors received a fantastic upgrade. The game seemed more vibrant and although I loved the first game, the second installment offered a serious upgrade in this area.Gameplay was smooth and full of action. I loved having the other marines with me through much of the game; it was a very nice touch.The Co-op campaign. When will other people follow suit and get a clue!! THANK YOU BUNGIE for putting a co-op campaign in the game. So many other FPS out there are great--ala Call of Duty 2--but they get stuck back on the shelf because I'd rather play with a friend than alone. Bungie earns high marks for this.Online--this is where Bungie once again shines and realizes what it takes to make a great game even better. Fantastic online options including \"party mode\" lets you play with--get this--your friends. Instead of being forced into games with strangers you can play with your friends. Amazingly, this feature has yet to be duplicated by other manufacturers.Now the Cons...The flashlight...for some reason it turns off automatically in the second game, which I don't like. Why? Because it usually turns off when you still need the darn thing, so what is the point of having it? Secondly, it illuminates about as well as a match even when it is on.Level design--they dropped the ball again, just like in the first game. The first three levels were incredible and I loved them, but later in the game they just got sloppy.Having to drop your weapon when you do a melee attack during dual wield is just plain silly.Personally, I could certainly do without the levels playing as the covenant. It was implemented well enough, but frankly I wasn't interested.The ending--absolutely horrible. I know the first game got bashed a bit for the ending, but i liked it. Driving the warthog out of the exploding Pillar of Autumn was cinematic and dramatic. The second game--worthless. The fight seems to stop right in the middle--the end--you're done.The weapons--although I thought the rifle in the first game was underpowered, I thought they made the problem worse with the 3-shot burst version in the second game. The punch of the gun may have been stronger, but you only had three shots per burst which in the end made it far worse than the gun in the first game. Lets talk about ammo capacity on it--108 rounds....are you joking? Its a useless piece of weaponry, drop it and grab ANYTHING else. And the shotgun wasn't up to snuff either. Do you mean to tell me that with all this space-age weaponry they can't offer a semi-auto shotgun?Overall a fantastic game but probably not quite at the level it should have been. Hopefully bungie will finally get the level design problem fixed for the third installment and really go all out. The replay value on this game is unsurpassed because of the online play, but I just couldn't give it five stars because even with all the improvements Bungie still repeated some old mistakes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2006"}

This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Richard Kiel \"theThing\"","summary":"ya, but NOT","reviewText":"WOHOOOOthis games first half (missions 1-5) was SWEETBUT H2 has MAJOR FLAWSman  sometime when i die, it is SO chunky it looks like MCs sut is made of nylon.the graphiics are so good, they look cheesy.its really fun, btu h1 was betterohand the endingSUKSBIG TMIE","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2004"}

In each level, the point of the game is to get from point A to point B. There are no specifics to each mission, there is very little to accomplish, nothing to gather, and there are virtually no goals. The objective is to \"survive the enemies\" and make it to each checkpoint, finishing each episode. There are a handful of bosses that are not that difficult to defeat. In general, enemies are not challenging, and the variety of enemies is lacking.  It's a very short game, with some replay value based on the way the achievements are constructed.The game is fun, though. The story is fairly entertaining, and the idle conversations between characters is sometimes funny. Parts within each episode are creatively titled, based on some common phrases used throughout the Bush administration. The story plays out like a typical low-budget sci-fi flick, so don't expect a lot of depth.  There is a good mix of gameplay types -- from gunning, driving, and manning a turret on a chopper. The music and voice acting is actually pretty good -- the music develops at the right moments and helps build excitement.  The controls are easy and once you figure out the layout, you won't need to consult the manual.Visually, this game is superb. The character models are excellent and are about as lifelike as we can expect at this point in time in gaming.  Most of the environments are extremely varied and well-rendered, with very little repetition in design and layout.  Loading is tedious sometimes, but bearable.I did encounter several problems. The game has crashed twice.  I also managed to end up between two doors without clearing a milestone, so I couldn't actually open either door, causing me to restart from the latest saved checkpoint. At one time, a member of my squad was floating above the environment, and I encountered several issues of \"cover crates\" that just floated in the air. In the last episode, large concrete blocks would bounce away at the slightest touch, so the physics engine is flawed.  Earlier levels are much more tightly-designed than later levels.Even with these flaws, I think this game has been overlooked and is a fun FPS that can be completed in a relatively short period of time by even the most \"recreational\" of players.  It lacks excitement, and you certainly won't feel immersed in it.  It gets 3 stars because it could have been better, but it isn't bad.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3PM","description":"","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Tons of fun even for adults","reviewText":"The Good: Great graphics, memorable characters, hilariously witty dialog, huge open city with a lot to do, lengthy story that's interesting, neat gamepad featuresThe Bad: Everything is overly simple for kids, nearly zero challenge, non-completionists won't find much interest beyond the storyLEGO games have always had a charm with large franchises like Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Harry Potter. While they were all easy, they were just plain fun for all ages and had humor for the grown-ups as well. Undercover is about as close as a kid friendly Grand Theft Auto as you will get. Being the spiritual successor to LEGO Island from way back in the day, LEGO City actually has a very memorable cast of characters and a fun story. The city is full of life and there's a lot to do here.You play as Chase McCain, a LEGO City cop who has to bring Rex Fury back to jail, but it's a bit more complicated than that. Chase goes undercover and works for various mob bosses to bring himself one step closer. In the meantime his shaky love for Natalia Kowalski drives him further as he needs to find her father. My favorite character is Frank Honey. He's the stupid comic relief for Chase and the dialog is just down right witty. The very first cut scene had me busting up laughing. Despite the child friendly LEGO sheen the game has humor towards adults. I honestly really enjoyed the lengthy story, but the gameplay satisfies as well.The game consists of having several different disguises. From a cop to a fireman, astronaut, robber, miner, construction worker, and various others. Each of these has abilities you need to play through the story and find secret hidden Super Blocks, costumes, and vehicles. You will see an icon on the ground for the tool you need. A fireman can chop down boarded up doors, the robber can pry open doors, use his stethoscope to crack safes, and has a color changing gun. The cop has a grappling hook, the miner can use dynamite and break open boulders. Every disguise has a purpose and by the end of the game you will be swapping them constantly to advance through the levels.Now, the game is very easy and simple, but it's still fun. Combat consists of just pressing Y and countering with X. You can throw enemies, but you need to cuff them with A once they are down. You can't really die in the game, once you lose all four hearts you just respawn in the same spot with no penalties like all LEGO games. Combat just gets tedious because of how easy it is, but it's broken up with lots of platforming. Advancing your way requires you to use your abilities, but there aren't any hard puzzles in the game at all. You just open this safe, take this key here, pry open this door, gather required amount of super blocks, build this super build, and various other platforming shenanigans. Nothing really complicated, but it's all just plain fun and relaxing.When you're not on missions you can drive around in dozens of vehicles, jack them from people a la Grand Theft Auto, drive around finding hidden items with your disguises, and that's about it, but there are dozens of hours of gameplay...if you're a completionist. Because the Wii U doesn't have an achievement system you may blow through the main story and never look back. There are 450 Gold Bricks which are gained by doing various tasks around LEGO City, some people may not have that kind of patience.What about the Wii U gamepad? There are some interesting ideas put into it like using it to scan the city for hidden bricks by holding it up to the TV, you can take screenshots, and use it as an audio scanner during the story. Your contacts will call you on your gamepad and they will appear and speak through it which is neat, but not necessary for gameplay. There's no gamepad only play which will disappoint some.This game is obviously geared toward kids, but adults who love platformers or even sandbox games will have a blast. The story has many references for adults like a Morgan Freeman sound a like during the prison stage just like Shawshank Redemption. Towards the end of the game a site foreman sounds like Arnold Schwarzenegger and uses his movie titles as puns. Kids wouldn't get this, but parents would and it's just hilarious.  There are other funny story elements like the Italian mafia deals in ice cream instead of drugs, and a Starsky and Hutch type duo show up half way through. It's all very funny and has some characters that have more depth than violent AAA games for adults.In the end, Undercover is just a fun relaxing game that doesn't take itself seriously. It has solid mechanics, dozens of hours of gameplay, great graphics, and a lively city to play around in. The characters are memorable, and while there's not much of a challenge, it's just fun and full of solid gameplay.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Daniel Garcia Montes","summary":"RIKIMARU LIVES!!!","reviewText":"That's right Tenchu fans, after suppossedly dying at the end of the first game, Rikimaru has managed to survive the cave-in when trying to get out of Lord Mei-ho's cave one year ago. Once he gets out, he goes back to Lord Gohda and Ayame and helps out with some of the problems that Lord Gohda faces daily. This game is very similar to the first one, in that it has the same old music and unfortunately, even worse voice acting. A big improvement however is the graphics; they have greatly improved, and now you can see clearly ahead into the background instead of encountering that annoying haze/darkness that was in the first two games which prevented you from seeing anything more than ten feet away. Also, like the first game, you perform only night missions.You get to play as two characters: our old favorites Rikimaru and Ayame. There's also a third character to acquire after beating the game with the other two ninjas, but I only play as Rikimaru since the characters don't have their own perspectives on the same story like in part two (you see what happens to the ninjas through their own perspectives in Tenchu 2). Another pasttime you get to perform in this game is fighting against ugly demons and disturbingly gruesome zombies (the same as in the first game) and you get a special sword called the Muramasa that specializes in killing the undead (but also slowly drains you of your energy). As far as the story goes, there's a new evil villain wreaking havoc throughout Japan, Tenrai: a sorcerer who wants only more power and guess who's at his side: Onikage! I know what you're thinking, why the hell won't Onikage just stay dead?! He died twice in part one and once in part two (back when he was Suzaku the Red Sparrow). Do your best to defeat him, he's as tough as ever.

The graphics looks very good and the gameplay is very smooth. The islands are mostly very big for you to explore. It will take you a while to go through the tutorial which I believe is necessary thanks to scale of content you can manage in this game. The control can be a little wonky sometimes but it's not a deal breaker at all. Also I'd like to have the ability to adjust scrolling speed across the map. Over all this game is not very difficult as long as you learned how to run your island profitably (which is why you should play the tutorial). I am very pleased with this game and I am not disappointed at all.

Ubisoft really managed to keep everything that was brilliant from the first game while fixing most of the issues and annoyances.The scenery is still brilliant and the characters in the cut scenes look so realistic that sometimes it felt like I was watching a movie. The voice acting is also brilliantly done; both of these aspects really help suck you into the excellent story that this game gives.The combat system is much improved from the first game; as soon as you get DaVinci to repair your \"wrist blade\" contraption, you can start stabing unsuspecting guards in the neck....even more fun than it sounds.The game starts out a little slow; you'll be beating people up a lot, but you don't get any weapons for a little while. This is all part of building a great story though, so don't give up on it too early (the blood will come).If you didn't play the first game, you might want to rent it or at least read an story overview online. The game presents a few back story cutscenes, but if you didn't play AC1, you might feel that the story is lacking a little. It is after all a continuation from the first game.Game ratings:Graphics: 10/10Audio: 10/10voice acting: 10/10Combat System: 10/10Controls: 9/10 (Sometimes I jump up on something when it's not what I intended; however, this is what allows you to scale building and run around so fast and easily, so it's an acceptable consequence. Once you get a good handle on the controls, this shouldn't be a big issue)All in all, I think that this was the sequel I was hoping for and I'm eager to finish it and see where the story goes.Don't usually review games this early in play, but I hate seeing 1 star reviews already bashing it and bringing down the rating. It's a shame to see such a great game with an overall 3.5 star rating.14Dec2009Update:I've since finished playing this game and I have to say, \"Wow\"! It was just great all the way through, and kept me wanting more. My only gripe would be a little bit of a rehash for the repetitive game play people loathed in the first game. If you don't collect all of those codec's, it will make you before you can finish the game. Don't worry though; they'll give you a map that tells you where they are at least. I'm still a little disappointed that I have to collect them at all though; it's all too familiar with what I hated about the first game.Despite the few repetitive monotonous game play tasks that surface, the game is most excellent. The story gets pretty crazy, but in a good way. Some things are explained, but many mysteries surface. Overall though, much better ending that the first game that didn't leave me feeling as confused and empty. It definitely should leave you wanting more; too bad I have to wait two years to finish the story...at least Mass Effect 2 will be coming out, and of course there's still COD.One question though: In this game it's explained that you'll learn to become an assassin in real life from the simulation you go through. How is it that you didn't learn squat the in the first game? Apart from eagle vision that is. I thought it was a cool aspect to incorperate into the game, but it's never really explained how you didn't learn to fight from playing as Altier.

The gameplay is original, as for the accelerator you pull the right trigger and for the brake you pull the left trigger! You start with three cars and earn nine cars in the game. The cars are based on speed, acceleration, handling and traction. So you pick your car and pick a color then pick one of four cities, San Francisco, New York, Tokyo and London to race 1 of 200 circuits. What makes the game so unique is rather than racing against other cars, you race along a street course, with cones set up and you must go between the cones to get Kudos points. You can get extra Kudos points by doing stunts by really tight turns, or fast turns, or doing donuts in the middle of the street. That's why the game is unique, that doesn't mean everyone will love it, because it can be frustrating going through the cones! If that's not for you then there are \"free races\" where you select a city, select a circuit and race against five other cars in a winner take all race! With all of that being said, the big feature is the music, you can record your music with the X-Box and play your tunes on the car's radio, so you never get tired of the music!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2001"}

Gann \"Video game junkie\"","summary":"Worthy of Console DLC status, not another game","reviewText":"When I heard Square Enix was making a fighting game with nothing but Final Fantasy characters, I was pumped. I couldn't wait to play it. I was somewhat let down due to the one person per side from each game 1 through 10 and the story board way of doing things. Let me be clear: Both games are fantastic fighting games and they look great. Visually speaking, you will be hard pressed to find a better looking game on the PSP short Kingdom Hearts: Birth by Sleep and God of War. But other than a few new characters, scenes, and arenas, they are the same game. Granted, Duodecim does try to address the board issue with an open world type of exploration which I enjoy but its still the same game not matter how you look at it. Yes Chaos is much, MUCH, MMMUUUUCCCCHHH easier to beat with a team of five characters than the one you go with in the first game but other than that, still the same. I guess the last good thing I can say about this game is in reference to the cover where allegiances are different. This is a very interesting political dynamic that the game uses.Pros:+ One of the best looking PSP games out there+ Great fast paced action+ Final Fantasy. Period.+ Story is OKCons:- Redundancy is EXTREMELY common- A few new things added to a re-releaseIn summary, if you are a die hard FF fan like me, BUY IT NOW!

Hitman supports Direct3D, OpenGL, 3dFx/Glide, I have played it on both D3D and OGL and they look really cool with no problems. The gameplay is orginal and it has a orginal story. You play Tobais Fleeper, He is assinged missions to kill gangsters. Who is he ?, Where did he come from ?, Play hitman and find out. HC47 has a very intresting gameplay, All the 12 missions are very well desinged with loads of admosphere. The game has high replay value, I played almost all the levels 5 times and i am still not bored, There is never a dull moment. The graphics are fantastic the guys at IO interactive have done a fantastic job. The sparks when bullets fly through with smoke comming out of the guns, The graphics depth and detail of the rain forest mission &quot;Find the Uwa Tribe&quot; is simply outstanding, Same goes to the atmosphere in the hotel mission &quot;Traditions of the Trade&quot;. Hitman has the best graphics engine ever. Hitman's physics is also superb they must be seen to be belived. The sound is also superb and the music is just right for a game like this. The charecters are well animate and look real and the voice acting is great. Hitman does not have a save game option but that was not a problem to me, Besides the mission &quot;Plutonium runs loose&quot; in which you need to complete the mission in a short period of time, It was almost impossible. Every other mission can be completed without saving, In this game you are not a terrorist, You are a hitman if you plan your moves carefully you will succeed in the game.Hitman could be a ground breaking game if it wasn't for all it's problems. The third person view is a bad choice for a game like this as the hitman's head and back block half of your view and it is not nice to see the bald head all the time. I dont know why people make action games in the third person view, Of all TPS games i have played only Heretic II and Tomb Raider were good and and a nice choice for the 3rd person view. HC47's keys are a big problem too, You need to both the keyboard and mouse to play the game. There are no hot keys for weapons or the inventory, The weapons and everything you pick up are kept on the inventory and to pick up a weapon you need to click on the inventory button, Use the scroll wheel and point to the weapon and press the action button to pick up. And besides this for just opening a door you need to right click on it and a small window would appear you need to use the scroll wheel to point on the &quot;open door&quot; option and click the action button to open it. When you kill someone you cannot carry the body like Thief, You need to drag the body that is very difficul as you have to bend and walk backwards and you cannot see clearly. The AI is not that very good, When you are dressup in hitman's clothes everybody gives you a suspesious look, When you have a weapon in your hand they are alert, That's good. But when you have a fiber wire in your hand people far away would scream that's unbelivable. Hitman's biggest problem is that there are lot of in game cutsences, And all in the wrong place, It causes a problem in the mission &quot;Say Hello&quot;, You are to kill pablo, When i shot him there was a useless cutsence, He said he is stronger, by the time i managed to get my controls and aim he shot me twice, Is shot him again and another useless cutsence, For every shot a cutsences. Haven't the guy's at IO interactive played action games before. Cutsences takes the control away from the player and by the time you get the controls you will be killed. What idiot would have cutsence in a middle of a firefight. It is really sad that it has all these problems, It could have been a very enjoyable game if it is in the first perso view, with no in game cutsence and a better controls. Still hitman is a great game and i would recommend it, It is really worth a look. Finally after the credit titles it is written &quot;Dont call us we are on vacation&quot;, What's that suppose to mean.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2001"}

The first open-world title exclusively for the PlayStation 3,infamousis a single player action/adventure that places you in the role of once regular guy, Cole, who in the aftermath of a horrific catastrophe finds himself not only alive, but developing a fantastic array of superpowers. Going from ordinary to extraordinary overnight isn't something to take lightly. With these powers does one exact revenge? Protect the innocent? Or perhaps, dabble in a little of both?

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

While that may not sound like much, it stands out in the arena of shooters that now days try to pass off a 4-6 hour campaign as a game. Unfortunately no coop in the campgain, so I knocked it down a star.It does have a coop mode that is not part of the campaign, which was great. So many shooters don't have anything beyond the campaign or competitive multiplayer. It is nice to see when a developer realizes that not everyone likes competitive multiplayer and gives us another option.Overall a pretty cool concept and a pretty solid game. Nothing innovative here, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. So many games try too hard to innovate and end up ruining their games.

{"product_name":"B004EW7LSY","description":"","reviewerName":"Tyler Johnson","summary":"The game of the year you never heard of","reviewText":"Sega has a problem. The Saturn was great, the Dreamcast was incredible, their games are amazing, and yet nearly all of their endeavors under perform, commercially. In an age where Gears of War is a house hold name, Binary Domain should have been a revelation. By now, we should have been hearing rumors of the highly anticipated sequel. Unfortunately, Sega just doesn't know how to market their products. Not only was there zero buzz for this game leading up to its release, look at the cover; it's terrible! The scene it depicts never even happens, and in no way does it even begin to get across how amazing the game truly is.Binary Domain is a third person, squad based shooter. While the concept isn't anything new, what elevates this game passed series like \"Gears of War 3, is something that rarely shines in modern gaming; its characters. Say what you want about Marcus and Dom, they are cardboard cutouts when placed next to Dan and Bo, the first protagonists you encounter in the game. It has always struck me how clumsy and unnatural in game dialogue has become, and that is what sets Binary Domain apart; the dialogue is incredible. I felt like I was in the middle of an exciting Hollywood blockbuster every time the characters spoke. Witty one-liners, catch phrases, sharp retorts, playful banter, casual flirting; this game does it all, and more importantly, does it incredibly well.Now, all that wondeful dialogue in the world doesn't mean a thing if the gameplay isn't there to back it up, and thankfully Binary Domain exceeds expectations. I jumped in on the most challenging difficulty first available, and I never felt overwhelmed. If I died, it was on me. Dan, the character you play, moves well, and while I found the cover/run mechanic to be sticky at times, I can honestly say it never once caused me to die, and that is a lot more than I can say for other games in this genre. Each character has a main weapon, which you can upgrade through the stores littered throughout the game, with scrap you have collected from your enemies. This is a point of the game that I love, and it ties into another big part of the games; how much your teammates trust you.Binary Domain features a system where you can use your mic to order you team around. My mic isn't working at the moment, but the game lets you use buttons just as easily so it isn't an issue. The more your teammates trust you, the more likely they are to listen to you when you ask for cover. How do you earn their trust? Well, there are scripted moments where you can speak with them, and provide common sense answers, but the best way to earn their trust is to be great at the game. Getting head shots, mulit-kills, meleeing enemies, and just being a beast in battle overall earns you respect with your squad, as well as nets you plenty of scrap to use on items, weapons, upgrades, and status boosters. It is so refreshing to play a game that actually rewards you for playing well. Be careful though; you can lose your teams trust through instances of friendly fire, or not holding up your end in battle.So, the dialogue is the best I have heard in a game in years, the gameplay mechanics are rock solid and reward players who do well; what about the story? I am happy to say that it, like the rest of the game, is amazing. In the future, after major flooding, humanity came to rely on robots. One day however, a man attacks the worlds leading robotics experts, and it is revealed that the man was actually a machine, and it didn't even know it. THe government labels these beings as \"Hollow children\", which they believe are being made in Japan. They send a \"rust crew\", the protagonists, to take care of the problem. From there, the moral and philosophical laws of humanity are questioned, but it never becomes preachy or gets in the way of the blasting of \"scrap-heads\". It is, far and away, the most satisfying story in a third person shooter, I have ever played.Now, for the handful of negatives. There is online multiplayer, but it is very bare bones, and there is hardly anyone online playing it. While your primary weapon is more than serviceable, the way the secondary weapons are handled could have been better. You will never find ammo for them laying around, not all stores carry ammunition for all secondary weapons, and they aren't upgradeable. Lastly, while the bosses are big and epic, the fights themselves drag out, on average, about five minutes longer than they should. Each boss has multiple forms, and certain weak points, but on the higher difficulty the amount of health they have is absurd, and the fights go from thrilling to monotonous very quickly. None of these minor quibbles are enough, in my eyes, to take away a star from the score, but they are there.For all you achievement/trophy hunters out there, Binary Domain is a mixed bag. The single player achievements range from story and chapter awards, a handful of skill awards, and lastly trust awards. The multiplayer achievements are more difficult than they should be just for the fact that so few people play this game online, and even fewer play seriously enough to get the achievements. Two achievements worth mentioning are \"Big Bo Rescue\" and \"Comrades in Arms\". The former comes towards the end of the fifth chapter, and on the higher difficulties is a pain, just because of how much health the boss has, so I recommend going for it on the lower difficulties. The latter achievement comes if you are trusted by a certain teammate, and for me, makes the ending much better.Overall, Binary Domain is incredible, and it is a shame that Sega did so little to promote it. The story is engaging, the characters will stay with you, the gameplay is fast and fun, and it is probably my personal game of the year. I highly recommend it. A new classic and a must buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2013"}

If you played Gears one, then you played this game.Do you all remember the big stink that was made over Halo 2 because it did nothing to expand the first game in the franchise? Well, I think we're there again with this game. That's not to say it's not a great game, but a sequel generally includes expanded and newer features. There is almost nothing new here. You still romp around with your teammates ducking behind barriers, taking potshots at baddies, tossing the eventual nade and taking down a huge boss at some point in the affair. The one major thing they changed is the lack of real boss-like enemies in the first game. This game adds a few more enemies that rival the size of an apartment building, but beyond that, I can't think of anything more of value to make this \"Gears of War 2.\" As far as the story as concerned, its hardly worthwhile. GOW story was just your usual end of the world fair and this game is simply the linear continuation of the last chapter in the first one. They easily could have made this the last 2 chapters in GOW instead of making you pay $60 more for it.If you loved the first game then you will undoubtably fall all over this one. I know I did way back when. Years later now, after having played the sequel and replaying the first one a few times, I think my initial reaction was a little exagerated. I'd easily give the first game 4 stars, but this one hardly deserves that. It was supposed to expand the series, not keep it in limbo.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000FW87AI","reviewerName":"bixodoido","summary":"The good and the bad","reviewText":"I have played the Raw vs. Smackdown series casually since it first came out.  For me the biggest issue is always playability, and I enjoy the casual matches with/against friends much more than the season modes.  That having been said, I'm sorry to say that this year's version of the game is not one I'll be looking to buy.  Here are some reasons why:-long and frequent loading screens -- the amount of load time is just ridiculous.-poor animation/glitches in some of the moves -- many in-ring moves frequently glitch.  Your character may be lying on the mat in the middle of the ring when suddenly he disappears and reappears lying in the corner.  Lack of smooth animation is a major problem for me, especially given today's technology.-Some of the matches are less fun -- I miss the weapons in Hell in a Cell mode, and hate having to use a special move to win a table match rather than just putting my opponent on it, getting on the turnbuckle, and jumping on top of him to break the table.-mundane and repetitive announcing -- the announcers' comments seem random and are repeated ad nauseum.  It's very annoying.-the music--a minor problem (though given all the time spent at a loading screen it's quite annoying), but the music is awful.That's not to say the game is without its merits.  While I'm still getting used to the new control system I can see the need for such a change.  I like some of the old superstars that can be unlocked, and enjoy some of the new animations and moves.  Still, I buy games for playability, and in this respect S vs R 2007 is a big disappointment.  When you get together with a group of friends to play the new game and end up throwing in one of the older versions because its more fun to play you know there's a problem with the franchise.  This, more than anything else, tells me this year's Smackdown vs. Raw leaves much to be desired.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-27-2006"}

This game is a terrifying experience that fans and newcomers will never forget.","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"The weakest Silent Hill game","reviewText":"This game is somewhat different from it's predecessors. The combat is more smooth, but not by much. You can use a first-person mode in the room, which is somewhat interesting, but I don't think it's any better than third-person view. There are a few things to do in your home, like peek in on your neighbor or look out into the hall. But it all gets pretty repetitive. And in order to save, you have to return to your room, which requires finding and going through a portal, and it just takes up more time than having a save point in the place of the portal. So, I wouldn't say that whole portal thing is an improvement, either. There are a few places to go, like a prison or a forest. You move through each area fairly quickly. The characters are pretty interesting, although most don't stick around long. Someone is killing people and the pattern is following a murder from the past, in Silent Hill. The story is decent. I look forward to seeing what happens next. Although, getting there can be a pain, because of some of the ghosts. That is the major problem I had with the game. You cannot kill them. They can do some serious damage to you if you stick around long. You can beat them down, but they'll just get back up. There is a rare item that you can use to keep them trapped, but you can only keep them trapped if you leave it there, and you only get a few. So that is not very helpful in the long run. The ghosts are just floating people, sometimes flaming. They aren't scary or creative. They are just annoying. That is the main reason that I don't like this game much. Other than that, it's a good game. And although it's not as good as Silent Hill 1, 2 or 3, it's still worth trying.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2005"}

The gameplay is a lot of fun with varied sequences and gives you the feel of being immersed into the WH40k universe as a single SpaceMarine. Third person melee with Over the Shoulder shooter elements and yes, Jump Packs. At the time of this review the MP is being worked on, but still offers a fun experience.Good:Great visuals and gameplay. The campaign keeps you engaged and is pretty fast-paced with a couple of lulls inbetween combat. The health system is different. You have armor that repairs itself but your actual health is only regained from being in combat and performing executions. You are still vulnerable during an execution, so you must time it accordingly. There is a FURY system that allows you to cause additional damage and you can either use it in melee or ranged combat (slows down time).The weapons from WH40k are almost all there, and make for a varied approach in missions. You have your selection of four and then if you find a mounted weapon you can yank it off it's mounts to tote it around as well.The character moves like you would think, with a number of different melee moves depending upon the melee weapon carried.The best thing is probably the jump pack. Death From Above is so much fun and gets you into battle all that much sooner, with devastating effects.Bad:Currently MP is twitchy. The P2P system needs some tweaking and THQ is working on it soon. That being said, there are only a couple of glitches during the SP Campaign that were evident.In MP, starting out can be difficult. Rank has its privileges and the more you use a particular weapon the better it's going to get after \"X\" number of kills, etc. Which is probably why the MP system allows you to CopyCat your killer's gear, helps those starting out have some of the more advanced weapons/perks.MP elements:There is a ranking up system that unlocks weapons/perks as you progress. There are weapon and armor challenges that allow for additional customization and damage/ability of that weapon. The staggering amount of customization of your character is quite something, giving you the ability to outfit your Marine / Chaos unit with millions of combinations.There are 3 classes to choose from Assault/Raptor (Jump Pack- Melee proficient), Devastator/Havok (Heavy weapons- Ranged proficient), and Tactical/Chaos (compromise of melee/ranged).Summary:Tons of fun.

It features updated graphics, from 2d to 3d.GRAPHICS / SOUNDThe visuals and the audio are decent for the DS.  The Cinematics are actually quite good looking.GAMEPLAYThis is an NES game, and it shows (not a compliment).  Little explanation is given to how things interact in the world (ie ice is better against fire-based monsters), so if you're not a JRPG or Final Fantasy veteran, this game is going to have a very steep learning curve.The first 5-6 hours of the game breezes by fairly quickly, but after that,  some aspects start to become annoying.  Status effects (and KO) linger with you after battles, and creatures start using more and more of these effects, which can deplete your resources very quickly.  KO is particularly problematic, since as far as I can tell, there is no way to purchase phoenix downs (removes KO status); you are at the mercy of the finite suppply given to you in chests.  Even resting at an inn won't remove this effect.Bosses can be extremely random affairs.  The same boss can sometimes be breezed by without a hitch, and sometimes impossible to defeat depending on your luck (ie it'll do its super move three times in a row, something you can't possibly hope to survive).This is compounded by the fact that there are no mid-dungeon saves.  This is suprising since I think every other Final Fantasy usually has at least a save right before the dungeon bosses.The much lauded JOB CLASS SYSTEM is also unexpectedly...lame.  This is even considering that this was the birth of said system.  There is absolutely no interplay between the different jobs.  If you level one up to 99 and then switch to another job, your previous accomplishment is non-existant.  I was expecting something more like FFV or FF Tactics where you could use an ability from another job with your current job or something.  No such luck.  With increasing job level, it just gets more powerful (melee attacks hit more times and spellcasters get more spells/day and spells are more powerful).PLOT/CHARACTERSI wasn't expecting much in this department, and my expectations were dead on.  The characters have a personalty that can be summed up in about 1 sentence for each (Arc is Bookish, etc).  I suppose it deserves some slack though; for its time, it was great.WITH RESPECT TO THE DSThe mognet addition is more gimmick than feature.  You can email NPCs (and get lame responses) or email other friends that have FFIII for the DS.  In fact, the latter is *required* in order to get the best class in the game.The one really good thing that this game has going for it (and the reason it gets 3 stars instead of two) is that its pacing is great for a handheld.  You can pick it up and play in small bits and it doesn't diminish the game at all.  There is even a save-state like function to save mid dungeon (though on loading that save deletes it so you can't use it as a permanent save in case you die).Its uncomplicated plot and unrobust job system are probably part of the reason for that as well.Bottom Line: Final Fantasy Enthusiasts are probably going to pick it up no matter what I say =).  For people like us, the game is ok, but nothing great.  Being its first appearance in the US, it doesn't even have a nostalgia factor going for it with me.  For those who aren't familiar with Final Fantasy, this is not the introduction to the series that you want.  Stay away.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2007"}

{"product_name":"B00004SWM0","description":"Though it lacks the dramatic intensity of theFinal  Fantasyseries--the crown prince of console role-playing  games--SquareSoft'sLegend of Manastill satisfies with its beautiful  hand-drawn sets and its innovative nonlinear gameplay.Billed as the sequel to the Super Nintendo'sSecrets of Mana,Legend of Mana's story contains more than 60 self-contained  miniquests, but generally the goal is to restore the world's Mana, or  life energy. Gamers won't need to be obsessive about winning all the  quests, but there are some challenges that must be completed if you  wish to reach the final showdown. The game begins as players choose  either a male or female lead character while a map displays the new  lands within the world of Fa'Diel. In each of these lands, players will  find items and clues they can use in other lands. The fragmented nature  of the game can be disorienting for gamers looking for quick  gratification. A diary can be used to keep track of current miniquests,  while an encyclopedia neatly organizes the vast amount of story players  uncover. Due to the vast nature of this game's plot, you'll likely need  these features to stay focused on your quests.Animefans will be wowed by the character design and beautifully  illustrated storybook backgrounds. The game includes aPok&eacute;mon-style monster-raising element, which is  surprising for a teen-rated RPG, but it works well.--Porter  HallPros:Pok&eacute;mon-style monster raising adds nice nurturing element to  RPG tasksNonlinear quest system makes story engrossingStunning hand-drawn backgroundsCons:Music is at times absurdly overdramaticSecond player controls character only during battle","reviewerName":"Carmilla","summary":"An embarassment compared to Secret of Mana...","reviewText":"The first Mana game, Final Fantasy Adventure, was awesome. So was its remake called Sword of Mana. And Secret of Mana, for the SNES, was an amazing classic beloved by many after all these years. So what happened with Legend of Mana?First off, this game doesnt have the free flowing world and fighting of the previous games. There is no linking areas to travel between. Each area/dungeon has its own little space and must be found by doing quests. After you have obtained the new area you can place it anywhere on the world map, for reasons not wholly known or cared for. Its a very strange concept at best.And the battles. Oh, what a terrible system!When you enter a battle, all of which are preset and cannot be avoided, your character moves in stutter steps. He/she moves somewhat like a fencer, a pace at a time. This makes for awkward movement. And if you want to dodge enemies you have to move up and down. Want to attack? You can only attack the left and right. This two-way dodge/attack system was totally uneccessary compared to Sword and Secret of Manas free moving combat.And the difficulty of the game... or lack there of.In battle you can hide in a corner and slowly replenish life. Have a teamate? Stand close to them and you will regain life about 3x faster then normal. And sometimes defeated enemies drop candy which replenish all or most of your life. Oh, and after every battle you regain ALL of your life.There are more ways to heal your character in battle than to attack!All in all this game is a garbled mess. Its a failed attempt of Square to make a 'unique' Mana game which strays from the original formula. I cannot believe this game came from the same company as Secret of Mana, the Chrono games, and the Final Fantasy games. Avoid at all costs.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-11-2006"}

Now it's years later, the aliens have taken over the Earth and placed collaborators in charge. You start the game out getting off the train at City 17, and quickly hook up with the human resistance.This is part puzzle game, part shooter, the pace changes every few minutes. Sometimes you're driving a car or boat, sometimes fighting futuristic troops, killing monsters, or trying to figure out how to solve a puzzle and get a door open. It's very scripted and linear, success or failure will depend on knowing when to fight, when to run, and when not to waste bullets on something you don't have to kill.Took about 12 hours.HL2 Episode 1 : Escaping City 17. Won't say much because that's a spoiler, but the gameplay is similar to HL2. Was surpsied how short it was, took me about 2 hours. Short and sweet.HL2 Episode 2 : Reach the White Forest research facility with data critical to the resistance. Pretty similar to HL2 but added a little romance that made things more emotional and interesting. You get a fun car to drive, and you better love it because you need it for the final fight which is HARD. I'm a 20+ year gamer and that was one of the most gruelling fights ever, and very satisfying once you finish.Portal : Strictly a puzzle game featuring a gun that shoots portals.

As much as I would love to give this game 5 stars I can't honestly do so.First the positives.  This game is a lot of fun for those strategy buffs who love to level up characters to insane levels.  There are so many optional things you can do in this game, whether it be during the actual story mode or post completion of main quest.  In fact,  most of the \"meat\" of the game actually occurs after you finish the story line for the first time.  Also, I do enjoy the story in this Disgaea, more so than the second in the series.However, what hurts this game in my opinion are two things.  The horrible camera and the graphics.  Why release a game on the ps3 if you aren't going to upgrade the graphics.  Heck,  the enemies look like carbon copies from previous games.  Basically the main story line is the only major difference between the three games.  Some minor game play differences exist but are overall pretty similar.Yes, I still enjoy this game,  and for those who love strategy games its a game you should check into.  However, if you are new to the series,  buy the first or second on ps2.  They are cheaper and essentially the same thing as the 3rdUpdate:(feb 2011)  Since the game is pretty cheap now I definitely would suggest getting it.  However, I do still stand by my review of 3 stars.  Fans of the series of course will enjoy this game.  I think those who are new to the series should play them in order.  Perhaps my expectations were too high since this was being released on a much more powerful system than the previous two.  When I saw the characters and enemies looked exactly the same as the previous game, I was a bit bummed.  The background visuals are a bit more polished in this version though.  It won't be long until Disgaea 4 comes out, and despite my letdown from this game, I still look forward to playing the next one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2008"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Surprisingly great","reviewText":"After being blown away by Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, and thankfull for finally getting a change of scenery, I wasn't looking forward to Call of Duty: World at War at all.  Really? World War II again after last year's smashing game set in the modern day?  Well, yeah, that's what you get here, but luckily, World at War isn't just a newer version of an old game with a semi-fresh coat of paint.  Thankfully, World at War plays very much like Modern Warfare, from the grim and gritty tone to the excellent multiplayer modes.  Alternating between the American and Russian POV's, World at War offers a compelling story and plenty of exciting (and violent) moments to be had.  The game looks gorgeous with some brilliant audio quality as well, and the four-player co-op campaign mode is a nice addition as well.  Other multiplayer modes are carried over from Modern Warfare, and are still a blast to play.  Not to mention that including new weapons like the flamethrower and bayonet, and the unlockable Nazi Zombies co-op mode is worth the price of admission alone, and is insanely fun to play.  All in all, even though Activision has taken the Call of Duty franchise back to World War II, don't let that put you off to Call of Duty: World at War.  It's the best WWII-based FPS to see the light of day in a while, and is definitely worth your time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-21-2008"}

There is also a special weapon that shoots in all directions that you can use by holding down circle, but it is not very effective.

{"product_name":"B003O6EDSM","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Sturgeon","summary":"Worth every penny","reviewText":"When Mass Effect first came out, I didn&#8217;t have an X-Box. So I just licked my wounds and figured this would be one more game out of a million that I&#8217;d never play. Even when Mass Effect 2 came out for PS3, I still passed because, really, from everything I&#8217;ve heard, there just wasn&#8217;t much point playing the second without playing the first. Ditto Mass Effect 3.But finally the entire trilogy came out for PS3. And all three games are in a package for the same price as any other single game you would get for the PS3. If you&#8217;ve ever been the least bit curious about Mass Effect, don&#8217;t hesitate to buy this. You get three games for the price of one and each individual game is worth the price itself.There&#8217;s a little bit of button mapping changes between games. Mass Effect 1 in particular has quite a bit of Early Installment Weirdness to it. But give yourself half a chance to get used to the different control schemes between games, you&#8217;ll be set in no time.I&#8217;ve played a lot of RPG&#8217;s and shooters. I&#8217;ve watched and read a lot of sci-fi. But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen anything quite like this. This is an amazing thrill ride that keeps upping the ante, and the ante was pretty high in the first game. Barring spoilers, there are so many &#8216;wham&#8217; moments that will leave you speechless. After getting to know and care about all of the characters over the series, I don&#8217;t think any game ending has left me so utterly shell shocked as I was at the end of Mass Effect 3. It truly took me a while before I could form a coherent sentence. And I&#8217;ve played a ton of emotionally riveting games in my life.Of course if you know anything about Mass Effect, you know about the choice mechanic. But I was surprised at just how deep this ran. A seemingly inconsequential side quest that&#8217;s done or not done in ME1 can have some consequences in ME2. If you&#8217;re not careful in the choices of how you treat your crewmembers throughout the series, you never know, it could cost them their lives.Now it has been said that the ending to Mass Effect 3 was disappointing because after three games where your choices had drastic consequences, the ending really went in a way that made it so your choices meant nothing. Fair enough. You&#8217;re choices still have a drastic effect on which of your squad members live or die. But past that, unless you really mess things up, things are going to end based on your choice between 3 outcomes&#8230;which all three still have pretty much the same cinematic, just with different coloring.So I do see the argument about the ending being disappointing. BUT&#8230;I personally didn&#8217;t mind the ending. If I hadn&#8217;t known (via the complaining on the internet) about how the ending made your choices not matter so much, I never would have known. It&#8217;s still a complete narrative with all loose ends tied up.Even more importantly than that, whatever you think of the ending, the journey itself is fantastic. As I stated before, I&#8217;ve played a lot of emotionally involving games before. But I don&#8217;t recall ever having been on quite the roller coaster that this game is.Of all the games I&#8217;ve played, I have never started playing one again the moment I&#8217;ve finished it. I usually have to have a breather afterwards. But this was so enthralling, the moment I was done with Mass Effect 3, I went right back to starting a new game with Mass Effect 1. It was that good.And to get all three games for the price of one, you better believe it&#8217;s worth your wile to get this now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00008DHNL","reviewerName":"D. Mok","summary":"Typical Activision game -- as many good points as bad.","reviewText":"Aside from the obvious Grand Theft Auto comparisons, this game reminds me of a recent Activision game I played -- X-Men Legends.  While their playability and quality are generally okay, both contain frustratingly crappy points that seriously chip into your enjoyment.True Crime is so much a Grand Theft Auto clone that accusations of imitation are futile -- if that is a problem for you, you shouldn't be considering this game in the first place.The pros:- good audio and visual detailing.  Pedestrians talk in a variety of characterizations, and their responses to your actions are pleasingly diverse.- Angelenos take note:  The geographical details of Los Angeles are very impressive.  They obviously used a real L.A. map down to street names.  In the game, I drove through two areas of L.A. I've lived in, and they nailed every single major street name (with the requisite modifications, \"Street\" for \"Avenue\", etc.).  While non-L.A. denizens won't appreciate this point as much, Angelenos will get a massive extra kick out of this -- they'll be able to get around town without using a map.- Michelle Rodriguez provides voice work.  Enough said.- I tend not to like driving games, but the driving engine in this game is simpler and a little easier to grasp.  And I think it was wise that the designers chose to forego many of the narrow side streets, widening them to accommodate game mechanics.  Too many narrow streets was one thing I didn't like about Grand Theft Auto III, and True Crime's street design makes getting around less of a pain, thus inviting you to more readily explore the city design.- The radar is a lot less confusing than GTA III's, so it's easier not to be confused while driving.- Good array of weapons.- The game keeps you in the know about how many story branches you've missed or acquired, and permits you to replay missions any time you please.  Also, you're given the choice to skip many missions and continue the story.  That's heavenly -- it means if you're not good at certain types of missions, you still have a game to play.Now the cons:- As in X-Men Legends, the camera is abysmal.  Activision somehow feels the need to make the camera a physical entity, and oftimes it will spin to behind a wall and refuse to move. I don't know why Activision always lets the game override your camera control (right analog stick), as in X-Men Legends, but this makes for some incredibly frustrating situations especially when you're fighting.  No player likes getting shot to pieces just because the game camera feels like being stuck at an angle that prevents you from seeing your enemies.- The auto-target is crap as well.  Sometimes you'll get enemies coming after you, but for some inexplicable reason they and their cars will end up in between houses, blocked off by a fence or a short wall.  And for some reason, you can't shoot through wire fences (?).  However, since auto target can't be stopped, if you have an enemy trying to shoot you from behind a fence, you'll be stuck aiming at him whether you like to or not, and unless there's another target to switch to, you'll forever be doing circles around an unkillable enemy.  Beggars the old question:  Did they actually bother to test this?- The hand-to-hand fighting system is boring and will give you Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.  Why?  Enemies are blocking 95 per cent of the time, and breaking their \"blocking stance\" is a matter of luck, not skill.  You basically hit the buttons as fast as you can and hope they unblock in time for you to connect.- The stealth missions are unengaging, and the controls seems to gel up during these missions.  You can hit the \"stun attack\" button and somehow not connect with an enemy one step away from you.  And the \"tailing\" missions, where you have to follow enemy cars not too close but not too far either, are overlong, forcing you to whirl round and round to follow an enemy car that does ferris wheels all over town.- Highways have good, realistic access ramps, but not enough exits.  I checked against the highways I knew in real life -- they got the entrances right but not the exits.  Why?- This...is...one...buggy...game.  I've owned it for a week and only played it for about three days, but it's frozen at least a dozen times by now.  And as one internet user complained, the \"manual target\" function often fails to respond, which makes certain missions (eg. the \"sniper\" finales) unplayable.- The manual target doesn't work well even when it's available to you.  When driving and shooting at the same time, you're required to co-ordinate about five buttons at the same time to shoot at enemy tires and gas tanks.  Feels like you need octopus limbs to pull off.  And having to hold down fire for manual target to kick in is a drag.  Grand Theft Auto III, Syphon Filter and even Thirteen had better manual-target controls.- Horrible, drawn-out, amateurish voice acting from Christopher Walken.  Just shut up already!As with X-Men Legends, there's enough fun to be had here to warrant three stars.  But I can't help thinking that many of the above issues are easily fixable.  I just hope that the strengths prevail and the problems alleviate come time for True Crime 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2004"}

If you haven't, you'll still know. The game needs no tutorial on how to play. It's the quickest way to just jump right into a game.3D Dot Game Heroes is about a legendary hero that has to save the land from an evil curse that has turned this poor 2D world into a twisted 3D abomination. You'll go from town to town, getting side-quest for the town's folks, while keeping on track with the main quest. What's the main quest? Visit several dungeons throughout the land, solving the riddles within, and then fighting the end stage bosses. During so, you'll collect new items that help you venture to new areas of the world. Afterwards, you'll get a heart-piece and a new magical ability that helps you restore the land. I hope this sounds familiar because it's exactly like the original Legend of Zelda.The game more accurately feels like a mashup of Final Fantasy (the towns) with Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the Super NES, while looking exactly like the original 8-bit top-down Legend of Zelda for the NES. The reason I feel it's closer to the Super NES is because the lands that you visit are really distinct. For instance, you might be in a dark forest in one area, but then with little warning, be on the side of a volcano. If you really enjoy the nostalgic side of gaming, then this will be nostalgia heaven. Even the music sounds just like the original Legend of Zelda! This game is just riddled in humor too. There's jokes about several 2D gamers from the past. Even jokes hidden throughout about their other popular title, Demon's Souls, and how hard it is.And this is a good thing. If you're expecting a deep RPG, then look elsewhere. This is just here for the fun of it.The graphics are actually impressive. For a 2D/3D hybrid, the game actually shines a bit and whatever Atlus used for their engine, they need to keep. It's not the game that's going to grab people's attention with it's HDR lighting and killer water effects, but it will probably grab their attention because of it's uniqueness.The gameplay is, again, just like the original Zeldas. You pick up a sword, block attacks, use a little magic, and move on to the next area. You actually do get to collect more than just coins and health. There's several unlockable swords throughout the game. Some of the swords are just flat-out bizarre. A little spoiler warning for this part, but one of the more hilarious swords you find is a \"beam saber\", which is a Jedi's trusty lightsaber in the form of pixel art. The magic you get to use is very helpful when fighting certain monsters, but ultimately, you're going to rely on keeping your health to max for that special full-fledge sword attack.If you tire from the grinding of dungeons, you can also do little mini-games such as a tower defense game, a time circuit game, and others. Truly, the tower defense is the best of the lot. These mini-games are required to achieve some of the trophies. And let's talk about this racing game. It's hard. It's probably the only thing that I dislike about the game a lot. The times that you have to beat seem to just be impossible. But alas, it's only a side part of the game.It's a new game for $39.99. It's a blast if you like these style games. If you can seriously go back and beat the old Final Fantasy games or Legend of Zelda games, then this is just another old school adventure. (Oh, and the create a character feature is nice.)+ Great price for old fun.+ Terrific style and graphics. Funny jokes.- Mini-games are hard.- Game is almost too retro in a sense.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2011"}

This Zelda game is without a doubt favorite Legend Of Zelda A Link To The Past Which for any of those who don't know was suppose to be called Zelda III The Triforce Saga. But since The NES was near the end of it's life span Nintendo decided to go for The SNES. If any game deserves the title of Zelda III cause I think of the 1st 2 Zelda games on The NES & A Link To The Past as a Triforce Saga. Now after Zelda II wasn't what everybody wanted even though I didn't mind it they decided to go back to an overhead view & drop The RPG elements go back to using Rupee's & weapons instead of using all magic attacks. If I could give this game all the stars in the world I would if I am a fanboy for this game then color me a fanboy. I played this game a lot along with Mario All Stars & Street Fighter II Turbo back in the day. Even now hearing about all the glitches & preforming them this game is feels fresh & this game is 21 years old. This game brings a lot to the table like the tone which would be used in Ocarina Of Time & big time in Majora's Mask as well for Twilight Princess. This game started the dark tone in a Zelda games. You have this character Aghnim he not only collects the money from The King for helping him he then kills The King & takes these Maidens that are ancestors to The Wise Men he seals them into The Dark World. The Dark World is the land where The Triforce is at people who go to The Dark World don't come back & they change shape. It's a twisted version of Hyrule. Link is framed by Aghnim a kid gets sick from the evil air coming from Death Mountain. You have this kid who plays the flute who is dead. The next reviews I do for The Zelda games will go more in depth this game was released in Japan in 1991 & a few months later in The Spring of 92 The name of this game in Japan is The Legend Of Zelda The Triforce Of The Gods. The story is Ganon tries to get his hands on The Triforce he enters The Golden Land The King has 7 Wise Men put a seal on the enterance to The Golden Land which it seems that he's been sealed there forever. Hundreds of years later a drought a famine & illnesses have spread through Hyrule The King thought it had something to do with The Golden Land but the seal was intact a Wizard or a Satanic Priest however you want to look at I prefer what Aghnim was in The Japanese version. Aghnim shows up & ends the problems with Hyrule, The King was looking for decendents of The 7 Wise Men Aghnim helped him find them then he got a big role in The Kingdom Aghnim's intentions came clear he murdered The King Of Hyrule put a mind control spell on The Guards had The Maidens rounded up & sent them to The Dark World which this is all told in the opening & it really showed off the power of The SNES plus that music by Koji Kondo is great which ALTTP is my favorite Zelda score Ocarina Of Time is 2nd the opening music where it shows Aghnim sending The Madiens to The Dark World scared me as a kid.[...]Princess Zelda is locked up she sends out a telepathic message 1 of the people who get it is Link & this is not The same Link from the 1st 2 games & this is not the Zelda you save from the 1st game or the sleeping Zelda from part II. Link's Uncle decides he's going to see what that Aghnim guy is up to he tells Link not to leave the house. Well he does anyway you head for The Castle & find a secret passageway where you find your Uncle has been badly injured he gives you his sword & shield he never finish'e his sentence & there is a lot of debate about what he wants to say he says Princess Zelda is your a lot people say he is going to say your Sister. Link might have a connection to The Royal Family cause in the novel his father was a knight but Zelda being his sister I doubt it. So the 1st thing you have to do is save Zelda & get her to this Church so she can be hid. You have to find 3 Pendants that will allow you to get The Master Sword this game introduces The Master Sword. You'll have a few side quests to get items you need to get to each dungeon or will help you complete it The Light World Dungeon music is another track that scared me as a kid[...]Also Aghnim has framed you for kidnapping Princess Zelda when you get The Master Sword Guards have taken Zelda killed The Priest so you have to head into the area of the castle where you weren't allowed to enter before cause The Master Sword can break the seal. Aghnim makes you watch as he sends Zelda to The Dark World. When you face Aghnim you can't fight him head on you have to play Dead Man's Volley as it's called. When he's beat Aghnim draws you into The Dark World & if you have The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera then you won't change shape into a bunny. Going back can be a hassle. This man you meet before the 1st Light World Dungeon Sahasrahla contacts you telepathically & that you have to free all The Maidens & Zelda & that is the only way defeating Aghnim & Ganon. The Dark World has no human's everyone has been turned into a beast or some kind of animal that represents what's in their mind & heart. It might be best to try to upgrade your weapons whenever you can like you shield & you can upgrade The Master Sword when you save this Blacksmith who is trapped in The Dark World. You can get a powerful Golden Sword near the end. The Boomerange can be powered up to reach further when you keep throwing in rupee's to summon a Great Fairy. I like how you can increase the number of arrows & bombs you can carry. The Silver Arrow's return too mainly to defeat Ganon. Other items you need is like from The Desert Temple The Power Glove that allows you to pick up heavy rocks. In the 4th dark world dungeon you get The Titan's Mitt that let's you pick up even heavier rocks & stones. I mentioned you must get The Moon Peral from The Tower Of Hera cause it allows you to keep your human form in The Dark World. Another must have item to even get to the 2nd temple is The Pegasus Boots that Sahasrahla. that let's you move faster & you have to use them to knock The Book Of Madora off a book shelf in Kakariko Village which that book is the only way you can enter The Desert Temple. The 3 Medallions you get are very handy. The items you get in The Dark World such as the hammer in the 1st Dark World dungeon The Hookshot in the 2nd Dark World Dungeon. The Fire Rod in The Forest Temple in The Dark World. The Titan's Mitt mentioned about already in the 4th Dark World dungeon. Then in the 5th Dark World dungeon you get The Blue Mail that reduces the amount of damage you take. The 6th Dark World dungeon contains The Cane Of Somaria that create these blocks that can weigh switches down it can also get create a block that can get you to the other side of the room like in Turtle Rock. Also in Turtle Rock you get The Mirror Shield. In Ganon's Tower you obtain The Red Mail which reduces the amount of damage you take even more. Basically you need all the items to complete the game such as The Ice Rod, Zora Flippers, The Magic Cape, Cane Byrna. There are a couple of side quests that stand out in my mind like the 1 where you get the flute there is this old man & his grandson is missing there is this boy that looks similar to Link & anytime you approach him he disappears it's cause he's dead. In The Dark World you find this animal or whatever it is standing on a tree stump you find out that is Flute Boy cause he went to The Dark World & was killed. With this flute you now have access to a bird that will fly you place to place & this lost old man in the caves leading to Death Mountain & he gives you the mirror that can take you back to The Light World. This game is 1 of the 1st times I believe that Nintendo allowed death in their games. So the game started a dark tone in Zelda games. I mentioned the glitches & how they made this game feels fresh I tried them out there kind of funny like you can face Aghnim while you have Zelda with you & Aghnim is sending Zelda to The Dark World it's like you got Zelda out of her cell so who is Ganon sending to The Dark World. Plus you know it's night time when you start the game & it's raining well if you do the glitch where you beat the game in like 5 minutes then in the ending it's night time & it's still raining. My favorite glitch is where you have the mirror & The Moon Peral ok & you can keep going back & forth from The Light World to The Dark World near the broken bridge & you can explore The Dark World before you even face Aghnim the 1st time. Just make sure you have the mirror, The Moon Peral & The Master Sword. Stuff you have to figure out like how to get The Big Key or the item in each dungeon is great. The bosses were all good The Ball & Chain Trooper who is in the castle. To The Armos Knights which a lot of fun. The boss of The Desert Temple Twinmola it's a good pattern type boss. The Tower Of Hera Moldorm is annoying cause if it knocks you off the ledge then you got to fight the boss all over again. The 1st Aghnim fight is good cause you have to knock it's attacks back at him. The Dark World dungeon bosses are well done some are harder than others such as Arrghus, Mothela, The Blind Thief & Trinexx. The 1st Dark World dungeon boss isn't too hard Helmasaur King you just use your hammer bust away at the metal on his face & fire arrows at the middle of it's head. In The 2nd Dark World Dungeon you battle Arrghus who is a big eyeball surrounded by several small eyes which you have to use The Hookshot to pull the eyes away & slash away with The Master Sword until you have to fight the giant eye. Mothula in The 3rd Dark World Dungeon while difficult all you need is The Fire Rod to beat it. The Blind Thief is hard cause it has 2 or 3 heads attacking you. In The 5th Dark World dungeon you face Kholdstare which is kind of a pain. You also have to have the bird to get to The 6th Dark World dungeon & the boss is Vitreous who is sort of like Arrghus but not as hard. To get into Turtle Rock you have to have The Quake Medallion & to get through it you have to have The Cane Of Somaria. This dungeon is a big pain cause you have to light torches to open some doors & if 1 torch goes out then the door will close. The boss Trinexx in it's 1st phase where you use The Fire & Ice Rod's isn't hard when you fight in it's 2nd phase then it's more of a challenge & I recommend that you get plenty of red or blue potion or some fairies on hand for The Dark World dungeon bosses. When you beat The 7 Dark World dungeon youu free a Maiden & finally Princess Zelda. Which takes you to Ganon's Tower where you fight the 3 Light World dungeon bosses again & have the 2nd & final encounter with Aghnim. Which the 2nd battle with Agahnim is a little bit harder. The final boss is Ganon & Ganon is the hardest of any Zelda game cause it takes 4 Silver Arrow's this time instead of 1 & when stomps the floor the ends start to break off & if you're knocked off the ledge you have to start the battle all over again. I think A Link To The Past Ganon is harder than Ganon in The NES original or Ocarina Of Time. But when you beat Ganon you are treated to a great ending. I know this has been a long read & I said my next reviews for The Zelda games are going to be really long so just a warning. This game is amazing bottom line while love Ocarina Of Time & enjoyed Majora's Mask & Twilight Princess this still remains my favorite Zelda game. If you never played Legend Of Zelda A Ling To The Past you should & play it any way you can cause you will miss out on 1 of the best games of the 90's","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-16-2013"}

Then I looked at reviews on Amazon. All of the one star reviews have nothing to do with the game and can be divided into categories of spam and anger that have little to do with the actual game.1.people who are angry they received a broken disc or no disc (not actual reviews, but feedback left in the place of a review)2.people angry that the game was not released on the Vita because they can't afford a PS3.3.people angry that a remastering was released and want Kingdom Hearts III instead because they already played these games.4. People angry they couldn't play the last game, and it was cinematic only.All things you would know if you actually read about something before buying.So yes, this collection is a remastering of games that were already released on the PS2. consists of the first Kingdom Hearts. If you played that, then you have played this essentially. It also has Kingdom Hearts Re Chain which is technically game three but takes place before the second one chronologically. Lastly, is a DS game, but it's a movie that fills you in on the story. Not a playable game.Two negatives:It may be a remastering, but the same bad camera controls plague this game, and since on the PS3 we expect better now, it's more of a pain. Still no map. Levels require you to walk around until you find where you need to go. In areas that look the same, that may take awhile. Add in bad camera controls and you may literally turn in circles for hours.Aside from that, the game looks beautiful, it's the same story, and there are trophies now.I suggest picking this up if you liked the previous games and don't mind re-playing them, or if you can put up with the two small flaws to arch up with this story before they release KH3.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2014"}

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

{"product_name":"B003Q53VZC","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"What's with the Nagging!?","reviewText":"The way the designers try to micromanage you through every level feels more oppressive than the Korean Military Occupation of the USA.Concept:  9/10A Call of Duty Style FPS with a horrifying story about the fall of the USA.Story:  7/10In the not so distant future, the US economy crumbles and a United Korea backed by China invade us.  With unemployment at a staggering high, gas prices out of control, and most Americans living in poverty, our nation was ripe for the picking.  Now the Unified Korean Army marches US slaves into death camps.  Pockets of resistance exist and do what they can to fight the oppression.The beginning of the game is great, but it rapidly loses momentum because the characters aren't directly related to the horrors of military occupation.  The resistance just operates behind the scenes and shoots at bad guys.  The story would have been much more meaningful if you had to rescue someone significant from the death camps or fought through them.  Throughout the game, the NPC's just micromanage you through the ruined US cities and you stop caring.  It's like, you want to fight, but the game won't let you.  It is too busy telling you where to stand and when to run.Gameplay:  7/10It's Call of Duty without the ability to throw grenades back at the bad guys and there are no flashbangs.  There is one level where you fly a helicopter and blow stuff up.Levels:  3/10You fight as a resistance force against the Korean Military around US streets and famous landmarks.The levels try so hard to micromanage you that you really can't enjoy them.  You are always with NPC's that constantly swear and say, \"Stand here.  Go here.  Shoot this guy.  Ok, wait here.  Ok, don't shoot this guy yet... Ok, now shoot the guy.  No, run here.  Stand here...  Hurry!\"  The constant nagging from your allies becomes really annoying really fast!!!  If the game just let you play, then it could have been fun!Another problem is that there aren't enough levels.  You can finish the game in under 4 hours!!!Graphics:  7/10They aren't horrible, but they do seem a bit dated.  Especially when you can't help but compare them to the Call of Duty series.  There are a few glitches where textures and normal maps are slow to load, making objects look like blobs.  It's unfortunate.Sound:  7/10The sound effects are OK.  They punctuate the action and the music is pretty exciting at times.  But the NPC dialogue will get on your nerves.Replay Value:  4/10You can play the short linear campaign over on 4 different difficulty levels or try to finish them without dying for achievement points, but it's not worth it.  Homefront does feature a Multiplayer Mode that is a blend between Battlefield and Call of Duty.  But this is available on Xbox Live as a Free Demo.Maturity:  Older TeensThere is lots of blood and military violence and the images of an occupied USA are chilling.  There's also a great deal of cursing.Overall:  5There's no reason to play this game because you can't really play it.  You just get escorted through levels and micromanaged so much that it isn't very fun.  This game is only good for a semi-entertaining afternoon or some fun multiplayer action that you can get for FREE on Xbox Live.I can't see why anyone would buy it for more than $20.Rent it if you just want to blow through the campaign between lunch and dinner.  It's an OK way to entertain yourself on a rainy afternoon.Avoid it if you like open world / sandbox games.Avoid it if you are a Call of Duty Snob.Avoid it if you are a graphics Snob.If you enjoyed this game, you probably live with your mom.  \"Clean your room.

{"product_name":"B001QXNBJM","reviewerName":"C.T.","summary":"Takes some getting used to but a good bit of fun.","reviewText":"When I first started playing BC2 I'll be honest, I didn't like it at all.  The controls feel sloppy and foreign (compared to the MW2 controls), the graphics aren't that great (compared to MW2 graphics), the movement/presentation of the game isn't very smooth (compared to MW2 movement) and after getting to the point where I was ready to get rid of the game I made a startling discovery...this game isn't MW2...Nor is it supposed to be.  The two games are VERY different and you cannot approach them the same way.Lets start off with what BC2 is.  BC2 is a TEAM based game, it's tough to be a star player in the game.  In MW2 I have a 2.12 kill ratio or so, in BC2 it's around 1.3 I believe.  You MUST rely on your team to win games, and winning can be very tough.  On the downside I can have a great game by myself on MW2, it can be frusterating playing with non-team focused people when playing with people I don't know.  But when it does work correctly it is a blast.The grahpics are not as sharp as MW2, but then again the maps are 10 times the size.  Instead of going for high poly counts and great looking textures, DICE instead opted for scale.  The draw distance is fantastic, there is SO much going on, and the destructible environments are a really cool touch.  Instead of being able to hide inside of a building for cover you've got to watch out, a tank shell will blow the fall out of a building with ease, so you've got to watch out.The gameplay mechanics aren't as smooth as I'd like.  Running and moving feels robotic, gun recoil feels off.  It's not bad, just a little choppy.One place where the game blows MW2 out of the water is with the audio.  The sounds of battle have never been better.  Gunshots and explosions sound deep and realistic adding to the chaos of the battlefield.The single player campaign is pretty good, but not great.  The story is weak but the action is solid.  The dialog adds a good bit to the story with each of the squadmates having very different personalities and backgrounds.Then again you're not going to buy this game for a 5 hour single player experience, you're going to buy it for the multiplayer.  I'm happy to say that despite a few issues the multiplayer experience is good.  While I don't like the player progression as much as I did in MW2 it still works pretty well.Players choose one of four classes and then customize their weapon/skill loadouts within those classes.  Each class functions very differently but when working together each is equally imperitive to victory.  Snipers to engage long distance targets and call in mortar strikes, Engineers to repair and destroy vehicles, Medics to heal and revive teammates, and Assault to...well...assault.  I sort of feel like assault gets the short end of the stick here.  They get the benefit of a 40mm grenade launcher on their primary weapon and their primary weapons have the best balance of stopping power and accuracy of the lot, but they have no good way to deal with vehicles nor a useful skill such as fixing vehicles or healing others.  Maybe more skills are unlocked later on (I'm just over  halfway through all the unlocks for the class) but I sort of feel left out.  Then again there are times when I can outshoot a sniper with an assault rifle so I don't feel too handicapped.The maps as mentioned are enormous and there is a nice variety of maps mixed in.  From night-time arctic assaults to desert combat each feels different and plays well.  There are a few different game modes but most people will end up playing Rush or Conquest.  I prefer Rush with one team attacking and one defending.  The object is for the attacking team to blow up a series of M-Com stations (just consider it a \"target\" as there's nothing special about them) in pairs.  After each pair is destroyed the defenders have a few seconds to regroup and prepare to defend the next set.  Defenders have an infinite amount of lives but attackers have a small set amount.  When a pair of objectives is destroyed the attackers lives completely refills though.  I've played matches where an attacking team hasn't been able to destroy a single M-Com station and I've played matches where they have plowed through the level with ease, in the end it is pretty balanced and comes down to who is the better team.Conquest on the other hand is sort of a \"multi-king of the hill points\" gametype where there are a set amount of locations that each team tries to capture and hold.  As you hold a point the enemy's troop counter slowly drains, the object is to essentially outlast the enemy by holding more points.  I've only played Conquest once as honestly it's just not as much fun for me.There is also Team Deathmatch type but I've yet to try it, the game just doesn't seem like it'd play well in a TDM setup.Overall the multiplayer is solid.  There are a few issues though, mostly related to connectivity.  I have gotten error messages several times where it will not let me connect to EA servers.  This is frusterating...very frusterating as essentially you cannot play the game you paid to play online for hours at a time.  Hopefully this will be resolved soon but who knows.  Also, there seems to be some bugs with saving your data both in multiplayer and single player.  I played for several hours and unlocked a few items and was disconnected from the server.  I reconnected later only to find that everything I'd unlocked was gone...bummer.Overall I do enjoy the game quite a bit.  Is it perfect?  No.  Could it be better?  Certainly.  Is it a good bit of fun and am I glad I purchased it?  Yes.Will it replace MW2 for me?  Absolutely not, nor should it.  They are very different games, I play both regularly.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000F3AADE","description":"Dead Rising follows the harrowing tale of Frank West, a freelance photojournalist after the scoop of a lifetime. In a small suburban town that's overrun by zombies, he escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be safe. Now it's a standoff, with zombies unable to get Frank, but him unable to get out & escape. Fortunately, he's got an entire mall at his disposal. Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"A. Sandoc \"sussarakhen\"","summary":"Zombies + Mall + mayhem & carnage = bloody fun time","reviewText":"Capcom's Dead Rising stands as one of the most fun titles to come out for the Xbox 360 since its initial release in late 2005. From the makers of the Resident Evil series for past console systems, Capcom has taken a new approach in adding to their growing library of zombie titles. Dead Rising is a semi-freeroaming action-horror game which takes the classic premise of George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead --- survivors trapped in the mall teeming with flesh-eating zombies --- and makes a fun and exciting game.The game takes place Willamette, Colorado, population 53,594 where nothing exciting happens in town outside of visiting the local mega-mall which seems to dominate the entire town. Dead Rising uses a time-based mission system and the intro cutscene in the beginning of the game hints at this. You play as freelance photojournalist Frank West, who never fails to mention that he's covered riots, wars, and all sorts of dangerous events, who gets a tip from an unknown source that something big is happening in little old Willamette. The intro both introduces Frank West, flying over the town to bypass the military blockade and cordon of the town, and the controls for the photography mechanics of the gameplay. It's in this hands-on tutorial part of the intro that we see a bird's eye view of the crisis that has befallen Willamette. From there you're dropped onto the roof of the Willamette Mall where you meet one of the few survivors of the town. The rest of the game moves on from there at a very frantic pace.It's the game itself that shines for Dead Rising. Despite a save system that could've been done much better (more on that later), Dead Rising's gameplay mechanics has quite abit in common with Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto games. From the get-go the player as Frank can just go down into the mall and begin killing zombies left and right, and everyway from Monday through Sunday. All manner of items stocked in the mall walkways and stores can be picked up and used either as a weapon, a change in clothing attire, and/or food. This is where Dead Rising will get most of its mention for being fun. When Capcom programmers decided to allow the player to use anything that could be picked up as a weapon they meant it. It's been reported in many sites and gaming publications that there's over 250 useable items to be picked up as a weapon. These items range from the gore-inducing lawnmower (an homage to Peter Jackson's Dead Alive zombie film), chainsaws, and excavators (a garden tool that has one of the bloodiest and funniest killing animation) to the ridiculously funny use for CDs, shower-heads, novelty masks, teddy bears and skateboards. There's also the more traditional weapons such as a pistol, shotgun, submachine gun, machine-gun, swords and axes. Being a game developed by Capcom, Dead Rising has more than a few wink-wink acknowledgement to other Capcom games such as Mega Man and Resident Evil.One could spend all their time just killing zombies, but the strict time-based missions in the game might make zombie-killing take a backseat to actually solving the mystery of whats caused the zombie outbreak in the town. There's two types of missions Frank could try solving. There's the mandatory Case missions which deal directly with him trying to solve the mystery with-in the 72-hour time limit. Each case mission must be solved in a linear order to open up the next case. The second set of missions are named Scoops and act more as sub-missions that can be taken on and accomplished or ignored. They really don't affect the availability of further case missions. What they do give Frank are prestige points that can go a long way to levelling him up to gain more skills and abilities. Most scoop missions usually entail finding scattered survivors within the mall and leading them back to the safety of the security office near the roof. Some survivors could be armed with extra weapons Frank carries and defend themselves when attacked, and some survivors are so incapacitated that Frank must carry them to safety. While carrying a survivor Frank will be unable to use a weapon so this type of mission usually takes several tries before the player figures out the best path to safety. Like most game AI, the survivors need abit of constant attention from the player to make sure they're actually following you and not stopping every second to fight the closest zombie. It's not a gamebreaker but the survivor AI could've used abit more tweaking to make them follow much better.As mentioned above Frank can level up to a level cap of 50 by acquiring prestige points (called PP in the game). Prestige points can be acquired through many different ways within the game. Taking pictures of different nature and quality will give Frank prestige points as high as several tens of thousand. Shots with poses that follow a certain genre gives more points than those that are just generic poses. Such genres that shots can be taken of are shots of burtality, horror, outtakes, drama and erotica. Erotica shots are pretty much just photographs taken of survivors and zombies (abit creepy) in sexually-suggestive poses. Brutality shots are usually pictures where extreme violence and fighting poses are framed and photographed. Horror is pretty much self-explanatory. Drama shots usually involve pictures with survivors and main npc characters in dramatic poses. Outtakes usually entail photographs taken of survivors and zombies involved in any sort of funny situations. Usually them slipping and falling down or wandering around aimlessly with novelty masks over their heads.Other ways to gain prestige points will be to finish case missions and scoop missions. The PP reward for finishing part or all of each mission usually range from several thousand to as high as 50,000 PP. The high amount of PP reward for taking on and accomplishing these two types of missions go a long way to levelling up Frank. The most fun way of getting PP, though not as much and takes a long time, will be to kill zombies. For every 50 zombies killed Frank gets 500 PP and everytime Frank reaches 1000 zombies killed he gains 20,000 PP. It's a much slower path to gaining PP but it's surely the most fun of the three ways.The main storyline in Dead Rising was actually a very good one. Like most games outside of the role-playing game genre, storylines were usually the weakest of all the games had to offer. In Dead Rising, Capcom was able to create an intriguing storyline that didn't rip-off the Dawn of the Dead story that the game was usually compared to. There's conspiracies, betrayals and just outright weirdness to help tie together the mystery of why Willamette, Colorado has suddenly gone zombiefied and why the U.S. military and government were quick to quarantine the whole area. There's not much that could be said as scary about Dead Rising. The game itself leans more towards comedic horror than outright horror. There were some cutscenes and plot developments that were downright creepy and scary, but most of the time you'll just laugh in glee at all the carnage you're causing within the mall. The characters of Frank West and those npcs he has to deal with in the context of the case missions were pretty well drawn both in animation and personality. As the game progressed and certain characters were put in danger it was hard not to feel saddened by such tragic events. It helps that the voice-acting in Dead Rising was pretty high quality. The spoken dialogue during the cutscenes were pretty well done and one could sense that Capcom wanted to really capture the cinematic tone they were going for with Dead Rising.Now to the one glaring negative in Dead Rising. The save system in this game could be called unforgiving and that's saying it lightly. The game only allows for one save per memory unit. This means that you can only save the game once if you only have the 360 HDD as your memory unit. This means that once you save over a previous save then thats it. If you're current save doesn't give you the chance to finish your current case mission then you pretty much have to start the game over. This would sound terrible if not for one saving grace. Dead Rising allows the player to start the game over with all skills, abilities, levels and PP acquired to be transferred over to the new game. This lessens the impact of having to start the game over. It also helps in power-levelling Frank to a level high enough that you can breeze through the case missions. Starting the game over and over with stats and skills included also gives the player a chance to try different methods of solving a case until finding the one thats easiest to do. I know of players who have done nothing but just kill zombies and try on a few case and scoop missions to gain PP to level up then start the game over then repeat the cycle again. This makes the game much easier in the long run, but also takes time.The graphics in Dead Rising is top-notch and really makes use of the 360's graphical power to put as many zombies on the screen as possible. There's barely any slowdown in frame-rate as the action on the screen gets heavy and crowded. The animation is not on the same level as Bethesda's Oblivion and Tecmo's Dead or Alive 4, but what lacks in near, photorealistic graphics it more than makes up for the high level of figures on-screen. The look of the mall itself was also well done. Each store and utilitarian room has their own unique look with most items rendered with enough detail to be recognized as either weapon, sustenance, etc...Dead Rising looks great when played on a HDTV-capable TV or computer monitor. The game itself utilizes Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and each sound has a distinct quality to them that you can tell the difference between an acoustic guitar smashing noisily a zombies head into pulp to one where you use an electric guitar instead. The sound effects of zombie-killing makes great use of all the squishy, gooey, and splatter noise effects horror movies have been well-known for.Overall, Capcom has created a great game with their action-horror/comedy Dead Rising. With a choice to either play the game in the free-roaming style of Grand Theft Auto to a more time-based, linear mission-style of an action game this game more than makes up for unforgiving save system its developers decided to give it. With summer time being the dead zone of new game releases, it's been a breath of fresh air to have a game like Dead Rising to play and take up hours of time before the start of the holiday season. Outside of the save system which keeps this game from reaching excellent status, Dead Rising is a great and fun game that should remain fun to pick up long after the player has finished its main mission.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-15-2006"}

Now, it is what it is: a great showcase for a launch shooter. The graphics are gorgeous and near high-end PC quality. The Anti-Aliasing Sony is using in their games is very good now that they have more horsepower to play with. The story is passable and the shooting is pretty stellar. There is some exploration and some fun to be had with tactics in the single player. The OWL does make the campaign fun and he will be your very helpful sidekick in hard modes when you are constantly using the tech device to shield, sic, etc. After the campaign though we get into the heart of this game; the multiplayer is both good and bad to be frank.The shooting itself is fantastic but there are major problems with performance leading one to believe this dev team was rushed and also that they are just not very good at optimizing their games. Hell, out of most people I know I give GG a damn good break.... but their game simply doesn't run well in 12v12. 25-55 FPS isn't cutting it for me. And the way they perform their magic by tricks with display resolution we never get to see the tight 1080p we get in single player as it truly is in native form and YES it is very annoying during movement in matches. I thought for weeks that they were using dynamic resolution. Most people thought it was 1080p native... turns out it's some complex and ingenious trick.... it's just that the trick is still very noticeable to keen eyes used to true 1080p.Going past that the Field of View is AGAIN too damn small which is yet another of the same problems this series has always had. I do love me some Killzone but it's 2014 and I still haven't played a multiplayer component of this game in true 1080p and surely not even close to 60FPS average with anything past a 60-70 FOV.At any rate 7v7 and up to about 9v9 actually runs decent with 9v9 starting to chug when the bots are out. In no way does this game engine support more than 18 players at a time. Leave it to the mighty gods at GG to not give a s*** vabout this and keep pushing the boundaries....To end this I did like the campaign and I think this is a worthy purchase for 30 bucks just to get a good taste of next-gen. Besides that I am not sure yet. GG has been mum on Coop and tbh I'm not really that into this game anymore. The terrible performance is off-putting for anyone looking to actually play a smooth multiplayer game. 7v7 is worth it I just wish they had better official options for servers and a 60FPS 9v9 component in this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2013"}

I bought a PS3 for myself recently and said to myself, &#34;I'll never have to purchase xbox live again.&#34;  3 months later, I'm back on xbox live, and actually appreciate it more than I did before after dealing with ps3 online.Playstation Network isn't horrible - it's just not as good.  If you casually go online for gaming - then maybe you prefer not having to pay for a subscription.  But playing online is what I care about.  On ps3, there is less communication with others.  And when you hear communication - it's usually little kids screaming and yelling on there. (This still happens on live, but not as often).  There is also less cheating experienced on xbox live.The subscription on xbox live weeds out potential hackers and little kids.  Long story short, xbox holds more of a consequence for those that tend to be jerks online.  I'm not saying xbox live is perfect - but it's far superior in my opinon compared to what I experienced with PS3.On another note - I played the same games on xbox and ps3 to compare (black ops, borderlands, etc.)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2013"}

Of course consoles don't see their full capabilities until 5-10 years down it's life cycle. When the PS3 launched everyone wanted to see something that would be worth a $600 purchase, but I don't think Resistance was it.You play as an infected soldier named Nathan Hale who is fighting alongside the British to rid of the Chimera infestation and save humanity. The game has a WWII setting that feels familiar yet not enough to be labeled as \"Oh, one of those again\".The main problem with Resistance: The difficulty. Oh my god is this game hard, so hard in fact that I couldn't even finish the game. There are about 30 levels, but the game is just so damned impossible to beat even on the easy setting. The game uses the ancient art of health packs and the game mechanics just feel dated and stiff.The only neat thing about the game are the weapons. You have regular fire modes, but interesting alternate fire modes such as the Bullseye's tag mode. You can tag an enemy and shoot around corners and the bullets will home in on the target. The sniper rifle lets you slow down time, one weapon even shoots up temporary shields. This, however, is not enough to save this frustratingly hard and linear game from getting sent right back to the store.The story may seem interesting, but it's slow and doesn't pick up much. The graphics, compared to games now, are ugly and dated and don't seem fully HD. Every weapon, no matter how powerful, all feel like they do the same amount of damage. Each Chimera creature takes forever to kill almost two whole clips some times, even on the weak ones! The game throws way to many enemies at you at once, and your health goes to zero in about five seconds. There's not lean button, so this means the game is poorly balanced and not much play testing went on.If you think the multiplayer saves the game it doesn't. You can have up to 30 players on one map, but no one is playing this online anymore, and the firefights are boring and a huge mess thanks to the dated stiff game play. I love the creature designs and the way levels are setup, but this game just feel out of its time frame. One last thing that makes the game almost unplayable is the lack of ammo. This isn't a survivor horror is it? Then give me more ammo it's a war!

Link can aim anywhere on the screen.Defender: In defender rounds, players remain stationary but can look and aim in all directions by aiming off screen. Hordes of enemies assault Link, and he must fight them off. These battles have a great deal of variety, from fighting off skeletons in a desert to defending a wagon from boar-riding Bokoblins.Ranger: In ranger rounds, players can move throughout the level using the control stick and aim anywhere they want by aiming the Wii Zapper wherever they want to look. In these missions, Link storms enemy encampments, fights his way through a forest and seeks out his foes while exploring the environments.The Wii Remote and Nunchuk are sold separately","reviewerName":"XDanteX","summary":"Perfect Accessory for Wii Point & Shoot Games","reviewText":"This accessory and game are both great and go perfectly together.

{"product_name":"B00CF7KVGE","description":"","reviewerName":"1Dub79","summary":"Great deal!","reviewText":"Since I got this game, I have seen more negative reviews than ever before on a Madden title, either current gen or past gen. Well, I cannot understand it because this game is the best Madden to come out in quite some time.CONNECTED FRANCHISE: This mode allows the player to be a coach, owner, or a player. The new owner mode can allow the player to build a new stadium, set prices, concessions, etc.GAMEPLAY/INFINITY ENGINE 2: Last year, Madden 13 introduced the Infinity Engine, which brought an overdue physics based engine to the franchise. Overall, it passed, but many times, players tumbled over each other after plays. The animations looked very goofy and bizarre. Now, the Infinity 2 Engine is a more polished version. There is VERY little to no players tumbling over one another. Animations are more polished and fluid than ever before.I've had to urge to be a successful All-Madden player, but I tend to get away because I feel cheated. The gameplay is increasingly fair on the All-Madden level, unlike the previous titles. For example, I play on All-Madden and though the players of the human player are somewhat \"dumbed down\", they won't feel cheated. For example, on previous versions of Madden, one false move on a pass-rush, the OT could easily pancake or take your pass-rusher down. Not anymore. The pass-rusher and OT realistically engage and jostle each other to the end. This provokes the human player to try to try various counter moves to get to the QB. If the pass-rusher has a higher rating, getting to the QB is easier, which can be a great accomplishment.No matter what Madden I've played, stopping the run can be a daunting task on All-Madden. However, it is a little easier on this game, especially it your team has a really good defense i.e. the 49ers. If the player's defense is not that good and they go against a RB, who has a high rating to go along with high BTK ability, big problem. I will say that when the ball is snapped, getting control of the nearest defender is a must. Not only that, pray that the defender is a good tackler.Passing against the A.I. is easier on the All-Madden level is easier. Defenders do not unfairly jump routes, profusely. However, if a defender is elite, it is increasingly possible. The key to successful passing on All-Madden is to take what the defense gives you. Keep in mind, if your QB has good accuracy, as well, as a good arm, look out! I play with the Redskins and I can throw some balls in some VERY tight spaces. Still, players must be caution. If a bad throw is made, the ball will likely be picked off. Of course, \"it's in the game\".GRAPHICS/VISUALS: Once again, the developers have done it again. The 1080i resolution of the game is second to none. In fact, I've noticed some cutscenes, which had very fast 120hz animations. Wow! Colors are more vivid and players look more and more life-like. Who needs a PS4, right now?! LolNFL SUNDAY TICKET OFFER: For those, who do not have Sunday Ticket or even DirecTV, don't worry! The Anniversary Edition comes with a special promo code, which allows the user to get access to the infamous Sunday Ticket for all 17 weeks of football action, including Red Zone. For those, who already have Sunday Ticket, a promo code will be included for a $10 reduction for the first of service and one year of NFL Sunday Ticket Max at no charge. Keep in mind, this Sunday Ticket offer can only be watched from the user's computer, tablet, or mobile device. It cannot be watched from the PS3.RUN FREE/PRECISION MODIFIER: Finally! Madden has produced a game, which allows ball-carriers to make just about every life-like move, juke, spin, stutter-step, and cut. Over 30 various moves can be made, now. If a player has a 90 rating or above, he'll be able to do special combos, which the average ball-carrier cannot do.The read option has been introduced to the game. This is very good for fans of teams, which have fast QBs, such as RGIII, Colin Kaepernick, Russell Wilson, and Mike Vick. Keep defenders honest and on edge with these play fakes.Ball-hawk has been introduced, which allows defenders to play the ball better than ever before. Just tap the circle button to control the nearest defender, and hold the triangle button. More than likely a pick will be achieved, if timed correctly.THE VERDICT:  For those, who are not quite ready to make the leap to Madden 25 on next-gen consoles, this version of Madden should satisfy players of Madden 25 on the current-gen. Much improved graphics and gameplay makes this all possible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2013"}

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"AMM \"adrian_m\"","summary":"Not the most technically impressive XBOX game, but great FUN","reviewText":"I LOVE this game!!I hate the Playstation so I have never played any of the earlier Oddworld titles.  Taking a chance, I got this for Christmas based on early XBOX game reviews and I have not regretted it yet!  While on the surface Oddworld: Munch's Oddysee looks like any other PS2 game out there, don't let that stop you from buying and enjoying this game.  What's it like?  Picture a game like Super Mario 64 or Sonic Adventure but with a much deeper plot, brain-busting puzzles and tons of technique and variety.Yes, this game will require a great deal of thought and planning to complete.  Don't wimp out and buy the [price] strategy guide just yet (wait until you beat the game on your own and then replay it with the strategy book to get to all the items/areas you may have missed!) part of this game's appeal is figuring out the puzzles yourself.  There's a great deal of satisfaction that comes with overcoming a particularly tricky area of the game!Your job as Abe and Munch is basically to rescue your friends and to pass through levels.  When I mentioned variety, there are levels where you must switch between the two heroes, possess enemies, use a crane to drop explosives on unsuspecting rivals, and resurrecting fallen comrades.  The powerups are actually useful and the story is both funny and interesting....I actually found myself laughing along with the nicely done between-level CGI movies!  Control is crisp and I found it to be really fun when you get Munch in his wheelchair!  Good stuff indeed!  Oh, and you get to save at any point in the game-this is the way it SHOULD be!Replayability is high because you are graded on your Qarma, in other words, the more friends you rescue, the higher your score.  This is difficult in that you must also utilize your friends to engage the enemies and some will be killed in the process.  The trick is to use your friends to fight only when absolutely necessary and only when you have sufficient numbers to do so.All in all, I love this game!

Hale is kidnapped by a black ops group in London and forced to Iceland for research testing. The full scope of what happens in Iceland is a mystery, but the game reveals that as Hale wrestles with the insidious Chimera war machine, he must also battle the virus raging inside his body that threatens to transform him into the very creature he fights against.The Return of the ChimeraThe Chimera are the main enemies of the Resistance franchise. For those new to the story, it is believed that the Chimera are of extraterrestrial origin. Yet, it is known that their army expands by infecting humans with a virus that transforms humans into Chimera while inside a cocoon. These creatures are much stronger than humans, and they usually have multiple yellow eyes. They have remarkable healing abilities and thrive in very cold temperatures, which has led them to alter the Earth's climate to a much lower temperature that better suits their habitat requirements.Resistance 2 introduces several new Chimeran enemies with a host of new powers. A few new characters include the Chameleon, a creature that can cloak itself completely and kill a player in one, destructive blow, and the Grim, which are a terrifying species that attack in hordes.The Battle Moves to the United StatesAfter the brief opening scenes in London and then Iceland, game play jumps ahead two years and across the globe to San Francisco. Giant, mile-long motherships slowly cruise through the skies, demolishing the city with fiery beams. The city is burned and mangled, and it appears that there will be little to no survivors. As the battle continues across the United States, you're sure to encounter many new, deranged, and much more powerful enemies.In Chicago, you'll be joined by a squad of soldiers, all carrying different weapons. To survive and move through the level, you'll need to work together, moving from cover to cover, setting up your squad in a smart and defensive manner. These are just a few examples of the challenging levels you'll encounter as you battle your way across the country to save humankind. And if you're hoping for new weapons, Resistance 2 won't leave you disappointed. The US-based campaign is loaded with tons of new weapons to enhance the overall game play and first-person shooter experience.Online game play Goes BIGPowered by Insomniac Games' third-generation PlayStation 3 technology, Resistance 2 delivers several console gaming breakthroughs.

It's a game where the faults of the game are easily identifiable (to me anyway), and I can clearly see some areas that needed a lot more polish or tweaking yet I keep coming back to it, enjoying the ride yet not caring for the bumps. Insomniac, the developer behind the stellar Ratchet and Clank series, in a weird way makes a solid FPS but without the core elements that most FPS games need but they do succeed on quite a number of fronts too so Resistance 2 is a game that annoys as much as it thrills.Story: Taking place immediately after the events of the first game, Lieutenant Nathan Hale is picked up and introduced to soldiers called \"Sentinels\", other soldiers who have been infected with the Chimeran virus and given special abilities which have to be kept in chick with medical inhibitors. They make it back to America where the Chimeran race has practically overrun everything and made it their home and it's up to Nathan Hale to try to bring them down, that is if he doesn't turn into one of them first.Graphics: I mention sometimes in reviews of games where the graphics can be put into 2 categories: the look of the game and the performance of the game. The former is Resistance 2's selling point, particularly in terms of scale. Seeing massive things on screen, tilting your character's head up as you see just how massive something is and you're like \"wow\". The game looks quite good when it deals with the Chimera events such as ships and setpieces, cutscenes and the like. Performance which I categorize as glitches, slowdown, framerate and such are non-existant practically; however the graphics in the game are murky at best. Textures don't really have a lot of clarity and the lighting in dark areas can be atrocious but it's a good looking game when it deals with the bigness of stuff, just not with the little things...literally.Sound/Music: Music-wise the game continues that kind of eerie quality during slow moments with militaristic fanfare and energetic music and it nicely sets the stage though with bullets, grenades and whatever else is flying your way, you're probably not paying attention to them all that much. Voice acting is generally alright but stoic Nathan Hale isn't much of a charismatic or deep hero and squad member commands can be lost in the shuffle of all the chaos. But the epic scale of many of the setpieces is helped by the music and the general loudness of it all.Gameplay: Pretty similar to the first game with spiky grenades, weapons with alternate special abilities (bullseye weapons comes with a \"tag\" where bullets will zero in on a specific enemy, great for strafing while magnum have exploding bullets that can be detonated after they're dead which can make great mini-bombs) but instead of a weapon wheel, the game only gives you 2 gun slots so sometimes you'll debate: should I bring an augur for its fire-through-wall ability or will the enemies be far requiring the sniper rifle FarEye? It's a small gripe but I find the bullseye/carbine combo a good fit. The guns and their added abilities are quite a lot of fun to use and like Ratchet and Clank, I sometimes find myself just changing guns for the hell of it as opposed to Halo or Call of Duty where I generally avoid \"crap\" guns.My one chief complaint about Resistance 2's single-player campaign is that there's way too many trial-and-error moments: moments where you will die and in some, die repeatedly until you figure out the correct strategy. Sometimes winning a certain part was not because of excellent aim or outwitting opponents but was the only time where enemy aim was weaker or I had to hide/shoot. In one part I had to fight no less than 3 missile-launching Titans in a park filled with parked cars that kill you if they explode. Yeah, trying to outrun 3 flaming balls of death while trying to not be near an exploding car is not fun. The chief offender of the game's cheap deaths are chameleons: cloaked enemies that have a one-hit kill that you MUST shoot when you hear the rumbling otherwise you're toast. Problem is he shows up so close to you that you really have to be aiming directly at him when he appears or you're dead and like the other enemies in the game at times, he ignores your delicious squad members and prefers to gun for you. Biased, much?While the recently announced MAG's 256 person multiplayer killed it, Resistance 2 has multiplayer of up to 60 people and as expected, it's a blast. Most of the time I was in team deathmatch where it was almost every man for himself and really no strategizing or breaking off into squads so the playing field is quite hectic but having dynamic objectives where you can have new things to accomplish as opposed to \"kill until your team reaches high score\". Also added is a co-op mode where the campaign is independent of the main campaign and players are broken up into different unit types such as heavy hitters or the healers. Both offer a lot of replayability and you'll probably end up doing this a lot more than the single player.Having played Resistance 2 quite a few times and not having bought it yet (strapped for cash sadly), it's a testament to the team at Insomniac that I actually want to buy this as opposed to other games where I'm like \"Yeah it's fun but I wouldn't buy it\". It's got its issues definately but this is quite a fun shooter regardless.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2008"}

{"product_name":"B005DVAB0A","description":"","reviewerName":"Drewz","summary":"Not horrible, but not worth $60","reviewText":"Had this pre-ordered and popped it in first thing when I got home.After experiencing what Ninja Gaiden has built itself into since it was first released on the original XBOX, it pains me to say that this Ninja Gaiden is very disappointing. Each installment (including the Sigmas) just got more and more incredible, adding new weapons, missions, playable characters, etc. This game takes all that away. While there are trials (similar to missions), and while there is supposed to be some extra weapons added via DLC at a later date, this game just feels like it has more than abandoned the momentum of the series.I won't spoil the story, but let me just say I found it to be just as much (if not more) of a throwaway tale as NG2. Combat is much easier on Normal Mode than ever before (you can pretty much just mash square to dispatch most enemies), but a Hard mode is available right from the start for NG fans looking to maximize their challenge on the first play through. There aren't any collectables or upgrades in this game and levels are very linear. Not to mention you can no longer heal, but have the ever-so-popular regenerating health now...Gameplay is what suffers most from this new take on Ninja Gaiden. You will basically find yourself moving from area to area in a very linear fashion, often being forced to stop and slaughter the same 2-3 dozen enemies you just did only moments before. There are no side paths or any collectables of any kind. Each level typically has 2-3 new enemies in it, but most of the time you'll might find yourself slaughtering repeats as well. Even with new enemies being introduced, it really does feel like you are fighting way too many of the same battles over and over. Another thing that hurts is since you cannot heal manually in this game, you pretty much to get it all right in one try. This will surely frustrate on some of the higher difficulties. Luckily, the game does offer a pretty forgiving checkpoint system should you perish, often restoring you at the last major thing that happened in battle. For instance, if a boss has two forms and you die after having already defeated the first one, the game will simply put you at the beginning of the fight with the second form.Overall though, I didn't give the game a one star rating because it works. It doesn't freeze and isn't plagued with glitches. It's just an empty game. The kind that you only play through once and then forget you even own it. The combat can get pretty gruesome at times, with some of Ryu's \"Steel on Bone\" attacks actually making you cringe. I found the enemy commentary while you are chopping up their comrades to be very stupid and unrealistic. However, once wounded, some enemies will beg to be spared instead of blindly attacking you until they're literally in pieces. I found this to be a nice touch as it isn't very believable when every single enemy is so eager to throw his/her life away. Despite others complaining about the camera, I didn't have any trouble with it, so don't believe it when people say it's bad. I found the camera to behave better than it did in NG2.This is not a review for the multiplayer as I just didn't have anything left in me to try it. Although, if I do try it at a later date, I will update my review. Here's hoping NG4 (if we get one) does much better.Plus, I miss the ninja babes =,(","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2012"}

I started it in normal mode and have been playing it for weeks off and on.  I still have not finished it even though I am on my original play through.I like strategy based games and this is the perfect game.Basically you create a squad of soldiers with four different class types.  I use two defense based soldiers equipped with shotguns to find and engage the enemy.  The second line is a lone heavy gun solder equipped with heavy armor.  Where as the first two soldiers can locate and retreat to cover, this guy seldom retreats. Once he is in position, he stands and delivers.  On the flanks adjacent to the heavy are support class type soldiers who can throw some grenades or heal the injured.  In the rear is the lone sniper who gets about 75% of my enemy kills.Great game if you like to micro manage a squad of soldiers.  The game has research and development plus resource allocation for improving your soldiers plus a side game of shooting down ufo's.  The side game is mostly just equipping your fighter aircraft with different gear and then putting them in combat where you watch the results.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2012"}

After that, though, indifference gave way to fury.These are not in any particular order -- except the first, which brought my game to a halt:1.  First of all, I hope you think gambling in a video game is fun.  I don't.  I played this game for about five days until I got to this point where you have to play something called \"Liar's Dice\" to continue.  Quite apart from the fact that I find gambling idiotic and gambling in a video game silly in particular, I couldn't figure out this mini-game and couldn't win at all, which one has to do to advance the plot.  Hence I could not advance the plot and the game came to an end.  There was no way to continue.  I tried everything.  I tried shooting the guy who deals the dice.  No luck:  he simply respawns.  I tried buying the classy suit that allows you to cheat.  Doesn't help.  There was simply no way to move this game forward and therefore we were unable to finish it.  I found it absolutely beyond belief that Rockstar Games, a multimillion-dollar publisher of mainstream video games, would have authorized the idiotic decision to have one of their showcase titles completely held up while the player learns and wins this absurd mini-game.  After three straight days of playing the idiotic \"Liar's Dice,\" we (neither I nor any member of my family) was able to win a single round.  Thus we couldn't continue with the game and finish all the missions.  After that, the game went back in the closet.  Uh . . . who is making these decisions at Rockstar games?2.  I've hated video games before, but at least I understood what was going on.  This, though, would have to be the first video game that I spent confused the entire time.  You're riding along, minding your own business, and suddenly a blue dot appears on your mini-map and somebody asks for help:  \"They stole my horse,\" etc.  The problem is, no sooner do you dismount than suddenly 5 red dots appear around you and shoot you to death.  Wait, what?  What happened?  Who's shooting me?  Why wasn't I given a second to ready myself?  Alternatively, 6 red dots appear out of nowhere and begin shooting at you for no discernible reason.  These sorts of challenges (I think the game calls them \"unattached criminals\") were extremely poorly done.  There's another one that is fairly typical of the way the game works:  you're walking through town.  Somebody approaches and says, \"Hey, my horse was stolen!\"  You whistle for your horse, mount it, ride towards the indicated dot for about a second before it says, \"You let the thief get away,\" or \"You failed to catch the thief.\"  Although you weren't really allowed to chase him down to begin with.  With most of these challenges, there's simply no way to win.  Additionally, it's not clear why challenges reappear.  Did you not do it right the first time?  For example, I can't count how many times I had to clear the bandits out of \"Pike's Basin.\"  Was I failing it in some way?  It said \"complete\" (or at least I thought so), but as soon as I cut through the basin again, lo! the bandits had all repopulated and the farmer needed help again.  This was puzzling:  is this simply an eternal challenge that you can always do when you need cash or was I leaving something undone?3.  The visual style of this game recalls the Sergio Leone films, and I was hoping it would be a gritty exploration of the seamier side of the Western myth.  But a lot of this game has you shooting rabbits and picking flowers!  This is absurd!  I'm playing this game to play a tough cowboy who gets to shoot bandits and so forth.  If I wanted to roam through the desert looking for flowers, I wouldn't need a video game for that!  In addition, picking flowers is a sissy activity that my manly cowboy wouldn't be seen doing!  Also, skinning armadillos and horses?  Am I the only one who finds this degrading?  If the game was going for realism, then why did it give me a magical map?  And a magical horse?4.  Traveling to distant places was a frustrating hassle.  Sure, there's a fast-travel system, but why was it so complicated?  Why do I have to leave town to fast-travel?  I can understand not being able to fast-travel in the middle of a mission, but why can't I fast travel from my hotel room, or anywhere else for that matter?  Sheesh!  I got the feeling that, in the early drafts of the video game, you WERE able to fast-travel anywhere from anywhere, as is logical, but at some point some supervisor pointed out that if players were able to do this, they'd finish the game too quickly.  Hence the fast-travel system was deliberately made more complicated so as to drag out the game.  \"You need a better spot for your campsite.\"  Why?  All the bandits are dead, plus this town loves me!  Why can't I save here and now?  Who cares if it's close to the water?  And why do I have to be subjected to that intolerable animation of me kicking out the campfire?!  I've seen it a zillion times!  Skip it!  It's not even the loading screen!  It's just some stupid animation that you have no choice but to put up with.5.  There are no difficulty levels in this game, at least in the PS3 version.  Some of the missions are really hard (or confusing) and you're not in the mood.  Tough luck! Everything must be completed on full difficulty.  Someone told me this game was constructed so that if you fail a mission, it gets easier and easier until you pass it.  I don't know how that rumor got started, but I can confirm it's not true.6.  You cannot skip missions if you find them distasteful.  WARNING:  Do not play this in front of your family.7.  On the other hand, there's no way to replay missions if you liked them -- without replaying the entire game.8.  There is a problem with my cowboy's vision.  The enemies can see him from a million miles away, but there's no way for you to see them.  If they're hidden against, say, dark bushes, there's no way to zoom in and really see what it is you're looking at until you see the puff of smoke that indicates they've shot at you.  Meanwhile, they have no problems seeing you clearly from long distances with complete accuracy.9.  Your enemies have line of sight to you when you're behind cover and their bullets can often hit you through what are supposed to be solid obstructions, such as adobe walls.  Meanwhile, your bullets cannot pierce solid obstructions and hit them while they're taking cover.10.  This is one of those cursed video games that thinks it's cool not to give you a health meters but instead start to splatter the screen with blood when you start to get damaged.  Why are video game manufacturers doing this these days?  It's such an inferior system.  The upshot is that you don't know how much health you have!11.  The story setup is fairly good:  the federal government has strong-armed you into bringing back a famous bandit.  Fine.  But then several missions have me getting involved with characters that would be out-of-character for me to get involved with, much less help.  Seth, the guy who digs up coffins?  I wouldn't have gotten involved with him.  The doctor that sold elixirs?  I wouldn't have gotten involved with him.  The gamemakers made much of the fact that they are supposedly giving you a full world to explore, but the reality is that they railroad your characters majors decisions at nearly every point, and in a way that palpably went against the grain of my character's motivations.  Why would I be getting involved with a nickelodeon producer?12.  The non-nature graphics of this game are not good.  In particular, I'm thinking of the animation of people's faces.  Really, this is the best gaming technology can do by this point?  I might have been impressed in the late 90's, but by this point . . .13.  There's no way to skip many of the cutscenes!  Interminably idiotic dialogue!14.  If you die unexpectedly (e.g., a fall, a wild animal, an unexpected encounter), you are not resurrected anywhere near the action, but at the point of your last save!  Why!?  Why do I have to ride clear across country again?  Are the game makers trying to punish me for something?  This wasn't fun.  Game is supposed to be fun, not infuriating.15.  You can't swim!  I found this ridiculous.  I thought my cowboy was supposed to be a hero!  Are you telling me I can be killed by a 2-foot-deep puddle?16.  Game is not clear when it's saving or which values it is saving.  If you loot bodies, the money you net is not saved if you then die.  But if you meet someone, that is saved.  Clarity and consistency on this would have helped.17.  You can't zoom in on anything to get a good look at it.18.  Load times are pure murder.19.  Why does the game orient you in the completely opposite direction after you've looted a body?  Are you trying to get me killed?  This can be very disorienting in the middle of a fight.20.  Speaking of which, am I supposed to loot bodies or not?  It seems vaguely dishonorable, but the real problem is that if you don't, the bodies sometimes magically disappear after the combat is finished.  Hence am I to assume you're supposed to loot them DURING combat?  If so, then why do the NPC's either run along or claim you've abandoned them when you take a minute to loot your fallen enemies?  All the while I played the game I couldn't tell if I was supposed to be looting bodies or not.21.  One needs to access the map so frequently that it should have been only one click away, not two.22.  Game is very confusing about why some items in the general store, the gunsmith, etc. are not available.  Is it because the attendant missions are not yet unlocked?  Because of my low heroic ranking?  Because they don't sell that in this part of New Austin?  Because the shopkeeper is temporarily out of stock.  This kept me confused the entire time I was playing the game.23.  Your hero can't climb most things.  I found this preposterous.  It really takes you out of the game, as this is not you fighting the hard world of the Wild West but you butting heads against the clunky command interface of the game.  I can't climb on top of a wooden crate, yet I'm a legend in the land?!24.  The prices for ammo were preposterous:  twenty-five samoleons for 5 repeater bullets?!  And this is at \"hero\" prices!25.  There sure were a lot of uninvited adventures dumped on your character.  I don't think games should get you in an adventure whose failure entails a penalty -- without first seeking your consent.  For example, suddenly you've got to drop everything you're doing and rescue the sheriff held captive somewhere in Tumbleweed.  If you don't, the adventure will disappear and you'll lose the benefit of completing it.  Shouldn't I get to at least consent to this by stepping on a golden X or something?26.  I must have the stupidest horse in the cosmos.  When I whistle, he comes running, but nowhere near me.  Is he playing mind games with me?  Then, when I start shooting, the horse actually steps between me and the targets!  Does he desire his own destruction?  There should have been some way of shooing the horse off.27.  You can't load your weapon at will.  Basically only in the middle of a fight.28.  The auto aim system really blows.  You end up doing most of the work anyhow.29.  The game bizarrely equips you with your hunting dagger just after releasing you from a cutscene right before facing a dozen distant enemies.  It sure wasn't me who equipped my hunting dagger!30.  In the very last mission of the main storyline, the game deals with the player in bad faith, implying that something in possible when it's scripted and unavoidable.31.  Taming a wild horse was so poorly programmed.  It took me nearly till the end of the game to realize that you're not supposed to be L'ing and R'ing based on which direction Marston is leaning -- as one would think -- but rather based on which way the head's horse is facing.  Am I the only one this stupid?32.  They should have included an RPG launcher as one of your weapons. In the spirit of the Old West.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2011"}

The gameplay is fun and feels realistic.  Even when you're not involved in shootouts, you have a blast just going out into the wilderness and exploring the landscape or hunting animals (there are about 25 different animals to hunt in the game).  I also enjoyed the quiet \"in-between\" moments in this game, such as being out in the empty desert at night on my horse and watching the majestic moon.  This game really makes you think about how the way of life was back then.  Those guys were tough.One piece of advice on the ending, without giving away any spoilers.  Once you complete the final mission, there is a dramatic ending that will make you think the game is over.  However, there is a remaining side mission that I would consider the true ending.  I had to google \"red dead redemption secret ending\" in order to find out about this final side mission.  This side mission is great and you will want to complete it (I bet a lot of players missed this because it's a side mission, and not a regular mission).  Hint- the end credits roll after this final side mission, so if you haven't seen the credits, you haven't truly completed the game.And you'll want to stick around for the credits because of the song that plays- it is called \"Deadman's Gun\".  It is beautiful and haunting, and was stuck in my head for days after I completed the game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-07-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000O5DS32","description":"Prepare to experience an evolution in the first person shooter. Originally one of the most popular titles for the Nintendo 64, theTurokfranchise has returned with a roar; this time springing on to the Next Generation gaming platform. Armed with a rich, all-new story line, as well as features and gameplay that will remind players why they fell for the genre in the first place, players will come away knowing why it is a good thing for humans that dinosaurs went extinct.An FPS evolvedYou don't want to cross Turok.View larger.There's more than one way to skin a raptor.View larger.Duel wielding against the Wolf Pack.View larger.Solidier Bugs are as bad as dinos.View larger.The StoryYou are Joseph Turok, once a member of Wolf Pack &#151; the most savage, merciless black ops squad of its time. Now, you have been attached by special order to Whiskey Company, an elite commando team, for what should have been a simple mission: Capture and detain Roland Kane from his fortress on a worthless, backwater planet. Kane is an escaped war criminal, the once-legendary leader of Wolf Pack...and your former mentor. Unbeknownst to you and your team, Kane is in command of a secret paramilitary force funded by the Mendel-Gruman (M-G) Corporation. As Whiskey Company's ship approaches the planet, it is blasted out of the sky by Kane's troops. Suddenly, your simple mission isn't quite so simple. Even worse, it quickly becomes apparent that Mendel-Gruman scientists have been terraforming and genetically engineering the once-barren planet for accelerated evolution.The Trouble with DinosaursThe trouble is that they like meat and that&#146;s just what you are to them. So your number one rule is don&#146;t get eaten. Far from cuddly, the genetically altered prehistoric beasts that Mendel-Gruman has unleashed on the landscape of the world you are dropped into come in all shapes, sizes. Although game developer, Propaganda Games, drew from Earth&#146;s own fossil record, they also let their creative juices flow as they created the deadly fauna of the game. Just a few of the beasties players will have to deal with are:Velociraptors&#150; Velociraptors are some of the most vicious and deadly predators on the planet. Beware, they can charge their prey, knocking them backwards and then mauling them with their deadly claws and teeth.Mini-Raptors&#150; Despite their diminutive size, mini-raptors move quickly and often hunt in packs, making them a deadly enemy.Dilophosaurus&#150; This large dinosaur is a mean carnivore with a huge appetite. It has a large crest on its head and can use its powerful tail to knock down enemies.Lurkers&#150; Like a cross between a dinosaur and a powerful jungle cat, Lurkers prowl the jungle, climbing and positioning themselves on trees and rocks, always ready to pounce on its next prey.Soldier Bugs&#150; These eight legged creatures look like the common scorpion, but they are much bigger and deadlier. They can be encountered in caves and other dark, enclosed areas on the planet. They are often seen in swarms, and due to their large size can easily overcome prey.T-Rex&#150; The Mother of all dinosaurs, the T-Rex is the smartest and largest of all creature enemies on this terraformed planet. Turok and Whisky company will have many run-ins with the T-Rex throughout the campaign.In addition to these, other creatures also roam the jungles and caves of the planet, some carnivorous and others plant eaters, but all are dangerous. Underestimate them at your own risk.Strategy and Multiplayer MayhemAlthough the real attention grabber inTurokare the dinosaurs, the most challenging combat in the game is essentially human on human. In these clashes the dinos serve as very dangerous obstacles. Even so, it&#146;s best not to go dino crazy, so the best players should not only come to coexist with the &#145;terrible lizards&#146; of this planet, but find a use for them. Through a combination of tactics players will learn how to use the single-minded feeding instinct of the dinosaurs against their human enemies, both real and AI. But be cautious. Your human opponents know the rules of engagement as well as you do and may very well use your own tactics against you.Regarding game modes, in addition to a single player mode utilizing engaging cinematic flashbacks and in-game interactions with non-playable characters to reveal the path that has brought Turok to the jungles of this alien world, players will also enjoy several raging online multiplayer modes. Including everything from four-player co-op play to 16 player matches in deathmatch and capture the flag modes, these online frag-fests are best enjoyed by spreading the action across the game&#146;s seven in-game maps. Filled with a variety of terrain ranging from high exposed routes, to low lying paths and even lava covered volcano slopes, these maps and possible additional downloadable content, should add extensive hours of gameplay.Weapons &#150; Quiet and Not So Quiet KillsTrue to its RPG rootsTurokcomes loaded with a large arsenal of weapons, but the real fun of this selection is its variety. Easily accessible from your controller&#146;s D-Pad, available weapons are both low tech and modern, and range from the basic, but quite deadly survival knife and compound bow, all the way up to standard FPS favorites like chain guns, shotguns, duel-wield pistols and a rocket launcher. Learning to use all these at the proper time is also crucial. Beyond the addiction of taking down an enemy with nothing but a cold piece of steel, silence on the battlefield can be priceless, especially when there are raptors about that will come running at the slightest sound. But on the other hand a rocket launcher does come in handy in a pinch.In the end whether it&#146;s taking on the game&#146;s larger than life fauna or its unabashed old-school shooter roots,Turokis a sure bet to deliver for gamers yearning to get back to the good old days.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Being nothing like the excellent Nintendo 64 game made me disappointed","reviewText":"The Good: Cool weapons, decent graphics, knife kills are fun, dinos!The Bad: Soldiers are boring, boring level design, generic multiplayer, B grade sci-fi setting and storyI had super high hopes for this game after being a fan of the N64 games, and I was quickly let down. Instead of being deep and rich in game play and story like a next-gen game should be we just get a generic B grade sci-fi type setting and story. The gun play varies from knifing dinos and soldiers to mounting turrets and killing a few huge bosses. The weapons are pretty cool like the plasma rifle, and mini-gun which you can set down and use it like an auto-turret.The graphics are pretty decent but rely too much on the U3 engine to make it look pretty. The story is pretty simple: You and your squad crash on a dino planet and have to get off...yeah pretty boring. While the animations for the knife kills look cool, and you can attach grenades to dinos and blow them up it gets old really fast. You'll either be running through jungles, or you'll be running through bases. It never changes from that switch off and not to mention the unbalanced checkpoints, and uneven fire fights. I didn't even bother with multiplayer since it just consists of mediocre match ups.Rent this for the weekend and you'll have some fun, but don't expect anything to advance the series or breathe new life.

The Metroid demo is awesome, and compete at nearly the same level of visual quality as it's Gamecube counterpart. Mario 64 DS is also awesome. I'm amazed by the output of this system.

As a band, the six members often play their special parts at the same time, though each player can jam however and whenever he or she wants. Play all at once. Take turns in the spotlight. Pair up in creative ways throughout the song. You can bring the band to life by yourself, playing one part at a time-or with up to four players. See game mode below:Solo Play: When you play by yourself, you can add one part at a time to arrange the whole song exactly how you want. The Tutes are on hand to back up your band in any parts you need filled.Multiplayer: When in a band with friends, up to four people can be band members.Wii Friends: Using WiiConnect24, you can send your jam videos to Wii Friends who own Wii Music. They can then watch your performance, modify it to their liking and send their jam videos back to you.Tutes: Your Own Private Back-up BandWhen not playing with friends, you can invite jam masters known as Tutes to play with you. They'll join a session playing an instrument that each thinks is strong for a specific song. You can simply enjoy the musical camaraderie, or pick up instrument tips by watching them jam. If you choose to watch, the Tutes will show you lots of techniques for many of these instruments, then ask you to follow their examples. They'll start with the simplest techniques, then as you master each one, show you even more nuanced ones.Key Game Features:Easy to Play Improv Jams- All members of your band jam by simply playing their instruments to the beat of a song or by improvising to their heart's content.

Art, sound, level design, etc is all top notch, and the game sports some of the most impressive visuals to be found on the gamecube.  Beyond aesthetics though, the game falls apart.It's simply not fun to play.  It has a somewhat awkward control scheme that even after you adjust to, is simply subpar to games that were being made in the N64 era.  Nentendo tries to say that this is not a \"First Person Shooter\", but a \"First Person Adventure\" game.  Well, you do occasionally have to shoot things in the first person perspective, and it's handled quite poorly, leading me to believe Nintendo's statement is really just a euphimism for \"Bad First Person Shooter\".As already mentioned, the control scheme is poor.  You cannot strafe and move at the same time (unless you're locked onto someething that moves your view while you're strafing), so enemies (the vast majority of which are extremely agile) can very easily get behind you.  Aiming (which you also cannot do while moving) is so incredibly slow that it forces you to rely on the game's lock-on targetting system.  Unfortunately, too many enemies (especially bosses) have moves that negate your lockon targetting making re-aquring them a painstaking effort.  In addition to general slow aiming, your upward/downward viewing angle maxes out at about 30 degrees above/below the horizon, so when enemies get above you, it's very difficult to deal with them (as many flying enemies or bosses will often do).  It makes the game challenging, but not in a fun way.  It's challenging kind of like running a 20 mile marathon after having someone break both your knees with a sledgehammer.And then there's backtracking.  There is way way too much backtracking in this game.  It's one thing to spend an hour in a game exploring new environments without making progress, it's another thing to constantly be forced to backtrack an hour through previously explored territory to retrieve a single item, and then spend an hour getting back, only to get another item, and use it to backtrack an hour someplace else, etc.Making the backtracking even worse is the frequent forced encounters where doors will lock preventing you from leaving and you have to fight a particular enemy (Dark Pirte Trooper) until you either kill it or it leaves.  Either method takes upwards of 5-6 minutes, because like many other annoying enemies in the game, it spends most of its time being completely invincible.Metroid Prime 1 was a basically good game with some large flaws.  This game took it upon itself to be a copy of the first game, and increase the size of all those flaws without adding anything good.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2007"}

The game has a dark and scary atmosphere and was very engaging. So why did I wait so long to review it?Final Fantasy XThat's right, Shadow Hearts was literally released on the heels of the greatest franchise in gaming, poor SH never stood a chance against it, And I was one of the many who took SH out of the PS2 saying I would play it later. I never did get around to it.Fast forward to '09, I now have a 60GB PS3, And I have no games to play,no money to buy any games,And I'm waiting for Amazon to ship me one(seriously). So with that said, I was looking for a game to play, I couldn't find anything, so I said to myself ''lets see where I left off in SH'' Turns out I was 9 hours into the game and stuck at Master Xifa's temple, Took me and hour to get out, but after that it didn't take me long to re-introduce myself to it. And after that I let the good times roll, I thought I was almost done with it but, I was far from it, Story was amazing,lots of characters to choose from that are also very likable, The battle system sometimes get flamed, but I don't mind it, good way to keep you on your toes.

{"product_name":"B002B1TDV8","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"So much potential - a low 4/5 rating","reviewText":"Scribblenauts is a very innovative game for the DS which has you solve puzzles by summoning almost any object you can name. Really, over 20,000 objects apparently populate your instant-creation list.This is a 2D sidescroller game, and your quest in each level is to get to the star. There are, of course obstacles. Let's say the star is on a high ledge that you can't jump to. You simply write \"ladder\" and POOF a ladder appears. You climb up the ladder. Done!If there's a pile of dirt you type \"shovel\" to create a shovel and dig. If there's a fish to catch, you type \"fishing pole\".There's no one way to solve any puzzle. I had a star that fell onto a spike and got damaged. I typed \"igloo\" to put an igloo over the spike. The star slid safely off the igloo and was fine! Your creativity is really challenged. Especially because you earn points for re-solving levels in different ways.It's not a big surprise, but in a game with this kind of innovative undertaking there are all sorts of annoying problems. Take ladders. Ladders for some reason do not work sturdily. They wobble and fall. Placing objects on the screen is often an exercise in frustration. I had an angry dog to get past. I made a leash and put it on the dog. So far so good. Then I tried *all* sorts of objects to connect the other end of the leash too. The dog would just drag them along. They wouldn't stick in the ground. If I tried to hammer a spike in the ground, I \"attacked\" the spike instead.I could make tranquilizer, but not use it on the dog. Often in these levels you get frustrated and just make a bear and take care of the dog (or other creature) in a hostile way - but I don't like to do that.The camera controls are really frustrating as well. You can scroll to look around the level, but it instantly snaps back to your main character. I would like the camera to simply go where I want it to go.There is a level editor in here, which is a fun idea, and there are a ton of different situations to try, so there is no dearth of things to figure out. The problem is you have to feel excited to try them all. Once you start getting frustrated by the game, it's almost a chore to pick it up and struggle with the next one.An awesome concept. I really give them the highest marks for making such an open-ended game. I love the ability to have your main character be a bride and other characters, too. But the basic problems with the objects you make, and the camera through which you view your world, knock off a point for me. I give this a very low 4/5, and really hope they make a sequel that handles the objects much better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2009"}
{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Christopher M. Shatto","summary":"Still an MMO, but a better one - updated","reviewText":"Edit: I've knocked one star off my original review for fun and two for overall. Why? Bots. Out of control bots. A month into the game most of what I said below is still true, but bots are overunning Guild Wars 2 and Anet either can't or won't resolve the problem. If huge groups of rampaging, obvious bots don't bother you, go nuts, but if you're not willing to deal with groups of bots running through every zone with you killing everything before you can get there, think hard about joining, at least for now.I'll be honest up front: After ArenaNet's virtual abandonment of the original Guild Wars after only two and a half years of serious development, I had serious reservations about Guild Wars 2 and I avoided dipping my toes in the pond for a month to make sure it wasn't a huge disappointment.On the surface Guild Wars 2 is another MMO. You have a skill bar that you slot skills in, you fight enemies, you \"quest\" and craft and PvP... but it's all somehow just slightly different in Guild Wars 2.\"Questing\" in Guild Wars 2 is mostly replaced by exploration and dynamic events. Instead of going to Person X, completing Task Y and gaining Reward Z over and over again across the entire world with slightly different text each time you mostly gain experience by exploring, interacting with the world (for example, by gathering materials and crafting items) and working with other local players to overcome dynamic challenges. Although mechanically it's not substantially different than completely traditional RPG quests, it's much more fun because there are generally more players and you feel like you're a part of dynamic, changing world instead of an errand boy running the same stupid chores over and over. This system also eliminates problems like spawn-camping where a large group of players are all after the same limited objective and have to stand around waiting for enemies or objects to respawn to complete their quests. And unlike in Rift the dynamic events that occur usually seem to draw players to participate. High level players in low level zones are automatically downleveled to 1 level higher than the max level for the zone. For example, a level capped 80 player in a level 15 area will automatically be downgraded to level 16 which prevents them from steamrolling everything in the area and gives them the opportunity to earn rewards for completing lower level content. This gives players a reason to participate in events no matter what part of the world they're in.Another nice change from the mold is the skillbar. Instead of stacking bars upon bars like World of Warcraft, Everquest and other traditional MMOs you  only get 8 slots like in the original Guild Wars. Unlike the original Guild Wars, however, the system actually works. You don't get overwhelmed by the dual-class system and its 100+ skills that you have to constantly sift through. Instead, you have a more traditional progression system that sees you unlocking skill trees and buying skills with earned points, but they all are customized to be useful to your specific class.The skillbar also introduces a different concept that sounds weird in theory but is actually very effective when you're playing: the first half of the skills in the bar are dependent on what weapon you're wielding. This means that when I wield a staff, I have one set of skills and when I switch to dual daggers, I have another. The swapping mechanic is easy and surprisingly intuitive and can be extremely effective.Combat is different as well, introducing the concept of combo fields and combo finishers. When the latter passes through the former, a special effect is achieved. For example, a warrior's whirling combo finishers used inside of a \"dark\" field created by a necromancer skill may send poisonous bolts flying out in all directions at nearby enemies. This adds a certain cooperative dynamic to group play that traditional heal/tank/damage games lack. The presence of active dodging is another important combat difference instead of the traditional MMO system whereby dodges/misses are simply dice rolls. Another nice feature is the lack of the hard heal/tank/damage trope. Everybody is fairly versatile at everything so they can conceivably swap roles as needed mid-combat as things change (plus, anybody can revive any other downed player if they can get to them and get free of enemy assaults, so no more having to worry about your healers being the only ones able to rez comrades).Other parts of the game are much more traditional. Crafting, for example, is mostly a matter of finding or harvesting materials (or breaking down existing items with salvage kits for materials) and combining them at the appropriate crafting station. Leveling is achieved through experience gains and you earn skill points to buy skills. Trait lines that you can advance as you level are unlocked by paying a class trainer and your traits can be reset by the same trainer for a price. Fast travel from outpost to outpost, a feature of the original Guild Wars, is replaced by waypoints. You have to spend in-game currency to use the waypoints, but unlike in games like WoW the jump is instant so you don't have to sit and wait for a wind rider or the zeppelin to finish its route and you can jump straight to any waypoint you've found without having to first make your way to another one.The one major downside I would point at is the real-money system. There's no monthly subscription in Guild Wars 2, but there is a real-money store where you buy \"gems\" that are then used in game to purchase items. Most items are just vanity, but some are boosters and you can also buy in-game gold from other players. What happens to this system in the long run is up in the air. It's nice that gem to gold conversion is strictly a function of the player market (so we're told, anyway). That means that you can't just buy unlimited gold directly from ArenaNet and flood the market, driving prices through the roof and making things unaffordable for people who don't use the real money system, but it still encourages overfarming which could have the same affect.All in all, it's a good game. While still maintaining some of the traditional MMO tropes it's enough of a departure from the standard to feel fresh for now and it will be interesting to see where it goes in the future.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2012"}

E Jackson","summary":"enjoyable, but not quite a classic","reviewText":"I remember back in 1999 when I received Dino Crisis as a Christmas present. This was my first exposure to a survival horror game. Believe it or not, I actually didn't bother with the Resident Evil series until six years later, in the summer of 2005, which is when I played Resident Evil 2 for the very first time.Now, let's go back to 1999 for a moment. The world of 3D gaming was in full swing at that point in time. 1999 was a year when people were anxiously awaiting what the Playstation 2 would give us, while at the same time, we were appreciating what the original Playstation was offering. The original Playstation, as you may already know, is where the survival horror genre *really* became popular. Resident Evil, Silent Hill, and, the now underrated and unfortunately forgotten, Dino Crisis series.Over time, people haven't treated the Dino Crisis series with *nearly* as much respect as the Resident Evil and Silent Hill series. It probably has something to do with Dino Crisis 3 being a really bad game with horrible camera angles, which meant, after that failed experiment hit the market, people weren't interested in any more Dino Crisis games. But, you know, even before Dino Crisis 3 was released, people didn't respect the Dino Crisis series as much as the other survival horror games. I really have no idea why. Dinosaurs can be *just* as cool as zombies. Believe me. Perhaps it has something to do with the animation? Even though killing dinosaurs is fun and addicting, Capcom made killing zombies slightly more interesting, thanks mainly to better animation from pointing and shooting your guns at a zombies head. It just looks and feels better in Resident Evil.  This in NO WAY should be reason to avoid Dino Crisis. This also doesn't mean Dino Crisis is flawed in the shooting department. Both Resident Evil and Dino Crisis offer tons of enjoyment. TONS of enjoyment. They are just separate beasts.The original Dino Crisis is supposed to be about making the right decisions when it comes to either keeping your ammo and health in one place, or making the decision to bring the ammo and health with you. It's supposed to be about guessing whether or not the ammo or health will eventually be necessary as you progress through the game. However, on easy mode, none of this makes a difference. The game is *so* easy on easy mode, that you can literally get attacked by dinosaurs about five or six times before you even need one of those Med Pack M's (used to bring your health back to 100%). Seeing as how there aren't many dinosaurs in the game overall, you will only need to use one of these health packs maybe two or three times throughout the entire game. Dino Crisis is *that* easy!  This means you will only have to bring one or two Med Packs with you, and leave the rest behind.To be fair, you can't just mindlessly shoot every dinosaur you arrive to, because you aren't given a whole lot of ammo. Certainly not as much ammo is given to you compared to how many health packs are available throughout the journey. Despite that, running out of bullets probably won't ever be a problem.  Just make certain you avoid some of the weaker dinosaurs in the early parts of the game. That way you will have enough bullets for the bigger and deadlier dinosaurs in the later parts of the game (which obviously require more bullets to kill).You are given the ability to mix things together, to create dangerous darts. These darts are used to kill dinosaurs *very* quickly, sometimes in a single shot. The problem here is that, on easy mode, the game is so simple that mixing darts together isn't even important. You don't have to worry about dart-mixing on easy mode *at all*. You can simply shoot or avoid all the dinosaurs you come across on easy mode and not have to worry about dart-mixing EVER. That kind of ruins the whole \"survival horror\" aspect of the game.  You should have been required to use at least one or two of these darts.People criticize Dino Crisis 2 for being just a mindless shooting game where you have to kill as many dinosaurs as possible to progress to the next area and collect bigger guns, but the honest truth is, the original is a MUCH easier game overall because you can simply run past all the dinosaurs that stand in your way. You can't do that in the second game. You have to stand up to them and shoot. So Dino Crisis 2 is a harder game, in my opinion. Oh sure, you are given an option to up the difficulty (in both Dino Crisis games) but the problem here is that the difficulty goes up SIGNIFICANTLY, making the game nearly impossible.Another problem I have with the game is the amount of cutscenes. You CANNOT skip over them, so you are forced to watch almost every single one of them. Most of them are kind of boring because most of the cutscenes feature the main characters just talking to each other. Sometimes you will see a cool-looking dinosaur attacking something, though. But Capcom *really* should have given you an option to skip over the cutscenes like they did in the sequel, because most of them are flat-out boring. These conversations are supposed to create a spooky mood, but it doesn't work in my opinion.I also have a problem with the INCREDIBLE amount of puzzles you come across. I am not kidding, there's over 25 puzzles in this game. Some of them are just a matter of typing in the correct series of numbers, or the correct words to access the next area. Some of the puzzles are more along the lines of finding the right way to complete them, such as the puzzle where you're pushing these Up, Down, Left and Right buttons to figure out how to sucessfully lift up and put down boxes using a giant crane. These are extremely hard puzzles to figure out by yourself unless you have a walkthrough.  Once you figure them out, the sequence is exactly the same the next time you play the game, though.  They're not random like in Resident Evil 3.The game is also *very* heavy on searching for the correct key cards to gain access to the next part of the game, which can be annoying. Simply put, the game is dominated with puzzles and key cards, which are always required to access the next area.  A bit much, to say the least.Despite the above problems, Dino Crisis is STILL a pretty fun game because the dinosaurs are animated beautifully and the graphics as a whole are really good for 1999 as well. The actual gameplay has some problems mentioned above, but there's also plenty of action to be found. Also, the game is pretty scary and intense, and the dinosaurs are simply wonderful looking and it's interesting the way they can attack you because they attack differently each time. Sometimes they will bite at your arm, other times they will pick you up from off the ground, and more.Oh, and the music and sound effects are amazing.  Perhaps the best music and sound effects in a survival horror game ever. Instead of featuring melodic themes, you are treated to sound effects and musical notes that seem to play randomly, almost making it sound like improvised music, like something from a King Crimson record.  This means, if you listen to the music carefully, you can hear a bunch of unusual and creepy sound effects in the background.  You hear something different each time.  It's awesome, and works great.  It's not a typical soundtrack in any shape or form, even by survival horror standards.  It's so good.Overall, even though Dino Crisis has almost zero replay value, and too much time is spent running around inside a facility doing one puzzle after another (and collecting one key card after another) the game is worth the experience.  It's not a classic, just a nice game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-20-2007"}

Dinos?","reviewText":"Having played a rather large number of survival horror titles in my time, I uncovered this title at the local flea market for 3 bucks. Having missed it back on the ps1 days (I was too busy with Silent Hill and Resident Evil I guess...) and being a die hard fan of Survival Horror, I picked it up. First and for most, many people have claimed this to be Rresident Evil with dinosaurs. Don't get me wrong, the similarities are hard to miss, but this really is something unique. Enimies are fast... the slow moving zombie has been replaced with the screeching, agile, adreniline fueled velociraptor... Which makes this game pretty difficult. No, think about it. RE controlls... only with zombies that move faster than you. Get the picture? While this does ramp the difficulty significantly, it isn't too over bearing (You just have to learn that blasting dinos isn't a good idea and running away is). Despite the more frentic combat, the game still moves at a sluggish pace that survival horror players have either come to love or hate. This is due in large part to a vast number of puzzles (which make little sense, as usual... colored key cards, statues, crate moving, etc.)and back tracking, in true RE fashion. However, this game offers some really chilling atmosphere, and despite the slow moving speed, it really does feel faster and more frentic than it's compitition, just because dinos are everywhere, you are always running and usually have an extremely low ammount of ammo at all times. Because nearly every area has key items, you have to explore. Because these same areas feature dinos, you have to use ammo to kill them. Because dinos are so fast and hard to kill you are always taking damage. You use healing items to cure wounds, so there for, unlike Resident Evil, it is pretty damn hard to hoard ammo and healers... all this results from fast moving enemies, and because you almost always just barely escape every situation by the seat of your pants, this gives dino crisis an exciting edge that most other horror games still haven't perfected. Add to this, \"choose your own adventure\" style twists in the plot where you call the shots as to which direction the story goes, the ability to combine items to create more powerful weapons, new types of ammo, and more potent healing items, and some pretty nifty graphics (they really aren't that bad, considering this game is almost 5 years old)and you have a winning title. As for the not-so-juicy parts, well... there are only about 4 types of enemies. And if you ever saw Jurassic Park or opened up a childrens Dinosaur book, you already know what they look like and how they will act. I'm not complaining, because each dino still scares the crap out of you when it pops out of a vent shaft or chases you down a corridor at high speed... but they lack that what-the-hell-is-it? factor of the mutants seen in RE and Silent Hill... Before you ever encounter them, you already know exactly what the enemies will look like, and how they will try and kill you. It just isn't as disturbing as the freekish encounters experienced in most other games of the genre. More so, the weapon selection is a little limited (3 weapons: Pistol, Shotgun, Grenade Gun), which offer a nice balance of speed, ammo availability and power... but it still leaves something to be desired, as pistol ammo is far too week to be useful (7 to 10 hits for a kill on a fast moving enemy... yeah right) and shotgun ammo is far to scarce to be wasted on anything but important circumstances (obviously grenades are saved exclusively for bosses if you actually want to beat the game). A good middle ground weapon would have been nice, just to lower frustration and make combat more stream-lined. In short, if you never liked Survival Horror, this isn't going to turn you into a fan. But if you like the corridor romping, the solving of mundane puzzles that pop out of no where and a few heart pounding marrathon runs while being chased by savage lizards, this is a game you should check out. Dated by today's standerds, but still decient enough to replay to see the 4 different endings. I give it a solid 85 out of 100.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00GV4V8XC","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Paslay","summary":"Exceeded my expectations, even after completing the demo.","reviewText":"Like many of you portable RPGers out there, I had been looking forward to this title for a long time. I've been a bit... put off... by Square-Enix's recent titles, but I can't refuse a free demo. The demo, if you haven't played it, wasn't taken directly from the game. The main mechanics and characters are the same, but the world and quests in the demo were created specifically for the demo to give players an idea of the gameplay. The demo was fantastic and definitely reaffirmed my decision to pre-order the game. However, after playing about 8 hours into the full version, I can tell you that the demo was a mere shadow of what to expect.Bravely Default is a sequel to 4 Heroes of Light in that Final Fantasy II is a sequel to Final Fantasy. The overall design and themes are very similar but the characters and world are different. Genre-wise, it walks a thin line between classic RPG and Dungeon Crawler - a formula that works extremely well.The story is, essentially, 4 young people from different walks of life coming together through adverse circumstances to restore order to the four elemental crystals (hmmm, this sounds familiar) and save their planet. I realize that I just summarized the plot of several Final Fantasy titles, but - as always - they've made it unique and added enough character and story to make it its own. 99% of the dialogue is voice acted and it is done well. I will admit, I am not a voice acting aficionado, so people may disagree with me on this point.Gameplay is very interesting. Square-Enix got a bit experimental with the mechanics which I find very exciting. While the SNES era of Squaresoft will always hold a special place in my heart, I loved how innovative they were during the Playstation days. I felt that they really pushed the envelope and attempted new things, something I don't feel they have done much of over the past few years... at least until now.Bravely Default (yes, I think it's a stupid name too) gets its name from the battle system. Combat is turn based in the traditional sense, but you can select the Brave command up to 3 times to take up to four turns at once. The downside of this is that every time you select Brave, your taking away your next turn. This means you may have to wait through several enemy turns while your turn gauge catches back up. So, if you don't defeat your enemy, you may be forced to watch - helplessly - as your team gets slaughtered for up to four turns in a row. Fortunately, the Brave/Default command is per party member, so while you may max out your Brave on your Monk so he can hit four times in a row, you can let your White Mage take their turns one at a time so they can dole out the cures and eliminate status effects after each attack.The Default option is essentially Defend, only it allows you to save your turns as well(up to 3). So, using the White Mage as an example again, I max out Brave on all my offensive party members. The boss is still standing and their turn gauges are all at -4 meaning they have to wait through four turns before they can act again. I opt to let my White Mage take their turns one at a time, taking each turn as it comes, healing my party. The boss makes his next attack and misses, there's no need to heal anyone. Instead of attacking with my White Mage for paltry damage, I'll select Default. My White Mage will Defend and my turn meter will increase by 1 (meaning I have an extra turn saved up). Let's say this happens twice more, now my White Mage has 3 turns (the maximum) saved up on top of their standard turn. Then the boss unleashes a massive attack that blinds my Monk, kills my black mage and deals heavy damage to everyone else. No worries, my White Mage has four turns saved up! I hit Brave three times to use up my saved turns on top of my current turn and cast Raise on my Black Mage, Blindna on the Monk and Cura twice. These actions all happen in succession and now my party is now fully restored. Because I had turns saved up from Defaulting, I'll be able to take my next turn as usual because Brave didn't put me into a deficit.It probably sounds complicated, but it really isn't. It's a unique twist on turn based combat that adds an element of calculated risk to the equation. It's a great spin on turn based combat that allows you a little extra control over the flow of the battle. Keep in mind though, the enemies can also use Brave and Default, so you may get a boss that will attack four times in a row, but remember they'll have to wait four turns to act again as well. There are also job abilities that can add brave points to your teammates or subtract them from your enemy which adds an additional element of strategy, allowing you to act sooner or keeping the enemy from acting longer.Another new mechanic is called Sleep Points. You have a gauge that fills whenever the game is put in sleep mode. For every eight hours you get one SP or Sleep Point, these points can be used to get an extra turn in the middle of battle regardless of your brave or default status where you act immediately. You can also buy sleep points with real world money if you feel that they're necessary. I'm never a fan of micro-transactions, but the game is perfectly playable to its fullest extent without buying additional Sleep Points, so this doesn't bother me.There are 24 jobs (classes) in Bravely Default and you can switch your character's job on the fly, as long as you are not in battle. Jobs are obtained by defeating key bosses that represent the job. So, for instance, everyone starts out as a Freelancer. Shortly into the story you will fight a Monk and a White Mage. When you defeat them, you obtain an item called an \"asterisk\".  This item unlocks that job for all your party members. You party members will level up with experience points as per usual, but your job will level up independently of your party member's level with job points collected from each battle. Each job level grants you additional abilities and attributes for that job. For instance each level of a Mage job will give you access to more powerful spells.Attributes are passive abilities. These are gained by leveling up jobs. Once you unlock attributes, you can set them to the party member even if they change jobs. For instance, the Valkyrie attribute - Piercing - can be set to a Ninja to make them more effective against armored enemies. Each attribute has a numeric value and each party member has a maximum value their slotted attributes can equal. For instance, if your party member's attributes can't equal more than 5, you can't slot in 3 attributes that have a value of 2. Using the right Job and Attribute combination can make for a REALLY powerful party. It's a nice element of customization and strategy that rewards experimentation that's really rewarding.Lastly, you can use one set of existing job abilities in addition to your job specific abilities. An example would be, if you mastered the Black Mage job on one of your party members and you want to have them start the White Mage job. You can select Black Magic as their extra ability set and still have access to the spells they learned. It's essentially a sub-job. This can also make for powerful combinations and support opportunities.Traveling takes place just as a standard RPG, you enter towns and dungeons via the world map and either run on foot or use vehicles (depending on where you are in the story) to navigate around the globe. Random battles take place both inside and outside dungeons. The encounter rate didn't seem too extreme either way.Part of the game centers around rebuilding a town. You collect townsfolk via Streetpass tags. Each time you get a tag, even if it's the same person, an additional townsperson will be added.  Building shops, upgrading shops and clearing paths take real world time for your townspeople. When you want to complete these tasks you can select how many of your townspeople you would like to work on it. Increasing the townspeople assigned to a task greatly increases the speed in which it is completed. You can put everyone on one project and get it done quickly, or spread the townsfolk around more strategically and get several tasks done simultaneously. Rebuilding shops gives you access to purchase their goods when you're at a save point. Upgrading shops increases the quality of the goods offered. Clearing road blocks gives you access to previously inaccessible shops. As you upgrade shops, rebuild and repopulate your town you will receive care packages from your townsfolk including potions and items. Upgrading shops also grants you different abilities based on the weapons you're using. Once you have assigned your townsfolk work, you can return to the gameplay and they will let you know when they have finished.Every once in awhile a Nemesis may arrive in your town, usually piggybacked on a Streetpass tag. These are powerful enemies you may choose to fight for exp. and items. Only 7 can be present at a time (check their level first so you don't find that you're in over your head) the oldest ones will age off as new ones arrive unless you choose to \"protect\" one, saving it for later. You can choose to send select Nemesis with your Streetpass tags to other players.Speaking of Streetpass, you can also send your party's information via Streetpass to your registered friends. While in battle, they can call on your to jump in and execute an attack. You can also pass along special moves to your friends and each of their party members can slot a single special move received from you.Graphically, this is the prettiest game I've seen on the 3DS. The hand-painted backgrounds are beautifully done. Details like waterfalls and moving objects are plentiful. I've wandered around the city in day and night just examining the details. The 3D was expertly handled and you can tell they put some real thought into it instead of just making the moving stuff come forward and sticking everything else in the back. The demo looked good, but the finished product looks amazing!Sound is beautifully done. The 3D sound is executed well and the gorgeous music pairs perfectly with the breathtaking scenery. This game is aesthetically brilliant.The Collector's Edition (as long as it wasn't smashed by Amazon) is well worth the fifty bucks. You get the game, obviously. It also comes with a very nice/large - softcover - artbook. The artbook has paintings and detailed sketches, character designs, etc. It's one of the best CE artbooks I've seen in a long time. The soundtrack is great, 10 tracks total. The AR cards come packaged like a deck of cards and allow you to see interactive cut scenes. The art on the cards is pretty cool as well. The packaging is just about twice the size of the SMT: IV packaging. If I had to do it over again, I would definitely still buy the CE, which is more than I can say for several other titles released over the past few years.Overall, Bravely Default is one of the most refreshing RPG experiences I've played in years. The amount of customization and strategy included in this title make gameplay a blast! It is extremely robust! There is so much put into this game, it's a bit overwhelming at first. However, the learning curve and tutorials are done very well and you'll be on your way in no time. Graphically it is gorgeous. The story is well done and very much an active experience, things are constantly happening to advance the story and provide insight to the world around you. Traditional RPG and Dungeoncrawler elements are fused seamlessly and perfectly. It really reminds me of the kind of innovative game Squaresoft put out on the PSOne and I love every second of it! This is a must buy for any 3DS owner!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2014"}

I barely knew about Call of Duty, played a tiny bit of Battlefield 1942, but thats it. I initially played this on the PC, but i want to give the PS3 version credit too.As an experienced gamer, i still don't understand the story of Unreal Tournament or the whole concept, all i know is that it was made by midway, and it is wicked fun. Don't ask what the story is, i just don't know..What really mattered to me was the multiplayer. The multiplayer mode in this game was golden, especially with the simple game modes like TDM and CTF. What made me like this game so much was the variety. This was no military, super realistic war shooter, this was a \"unreal\" (intended pun to the Unreal engine, as well as given point) game. It had really cool weapons that all had distinct fire powers, vehicles that were a blast to drive, and really unique elements. Whether if the game was against bots(which i still support), or real people, the gameplay feels balanced and fluid. One of my favorite things to do in this game was get in the banshee (i think that's what it was called), and just run over everyone that i could. It is so satisfying to hear the announcer yell \"HEADSHOT!\", or any other phrase, it was fun to gain kills and have the announcer just keep saying phrases- i would have to say the announcer in UT3 is the best of announcers in fps's, like Halo.Overall, the game is really satisfying, and has the perfect amount of modes, maps, and extra things to do to stay a fun game. They even released a collection of modded maps to the store, all for free, which is such a pleasure to have.The only thing that can be annoying is that this game is not polished, it is quite glitchy, and sometimes can freeze with the DLC maps. It is a pleasure to play this game, as many of the games that cane from midway were exclusive to pc or xbox. I would say more, but i kind of feel like playing it again now. UT III IS old enough and cheap enough to get for anyone. I wish there were more games like this, that were unrealistic, still supported bots and split-screen, and just plain fun to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2013"}

There is alot of joy to be found in short bursts of play here, taking 1 or 2 races at a time, then tinkering with your ride.  The controls are dead on easy to learn and a little too easy to master eventually.  The sound effects are a bit less polished than the rest of the game with voiceovers that are either too \"gnarly\" or just plain corny. Also the big airs you can launch your ATVs into in this game are best experienced with your own soundtrack, as this game actually features again WOLFMOTHERS WOMAN, but offers a few other decent tracks and beats MOTORSTORM PACIFIC RIMS soundtrack by a mile.

{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"Jack Treese \"Jack\"","summary":"Definitely the best New Super Mario Bros. yet!","reviewText":"I got a Wii U for Christmas, and had no problems picking this up immediately.  As expected, this Mario title is exceptionally fun, probably the best Mario title since Super Mario World!Not much to talk about in the way of story--Bowser holds Peach captive, Mario gets tossed far away and has to go rescue her.  Along the way are some of the most clever platforming levels in the history of the genre.  There are also Star Coins, 1-Ups and power-ups aplenty, along with enemies to compliment the action of course.  The game plays like every other Mario title, which is never something to complain about.In this case, the only true exception is that the new GamePad adds a fifth player to the co-op mix, or makes for a great single-player experience (even in conjunction with a Wii remote) as well.  The GamePad adds a very clever twist to the gameplay, allowing whoever is using the GamePad to add platforms for the Wiimote wielders.  This mode can also be used for one player trying to get the last of those Star Coins.  While on paper this sounds shoehorned, it feels very secondhand once you start playing.Another caveat of the GamePad gameplay can be utilized with only one player using the new controller--rather than being tied to the TV you can pop on your headphones and continue playing as someone else watches a movie, for example.  Playing like this, the game is just as smooth and vibrant as playing on a TV, with absolutely zero lag between the two.  Another feature that becomes useful involves hitting the Home button and utilizing the GamePad's browser to look for hints online, and then resuming gameplay without ever quitting out of the game itself.One thing that should be noted (though shouldn't be necessary if you research it) is that the game is NOT compatible with the Wii U Pro Controller.  I've noticed that the game has received criticisms for this, largely from people that refused to do some simple research before buying the game.  In my opinion, even if the Pro Controller were compatible there would be very little point for it.  The game plays just as fine on either the GamePad or a Wii remote.  Yes it would have been a nice option, but it's not really necessary.So if you want a fun game to introduce yourself to the Wii U and you can get over the fact that one controller isn't compatible with it, New Super Mario Bros. U is definitely the best platforming experience of 2012, and one of the best of the entire Mario franchise.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006LEM9","description":"For even the mildest fans, anything related to this beloved book deserves top-notch treatment. Vivendi's officially authorizedThe Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ringfalls disappointingly short of that goal. The game is intriguing enough (credit the source material) to play through entirely--once. For the cost of the game, you are guaranteed a reasonably pleasurable 10 hours of gameplay. After that, it will likely sit on your shelf.There are good things in this game: the RPG mechanics are fine (at various points in the story you play as Frodo, Aragorn, and Gandalf), the visuals are beautiful in parts, and certain aspects of game design are fantastic (Gandalf's magic-casting stands out). Little touches make it appealing to true fans, like when Aragorn receives the repaired Sword of Elendil, and it glows during fighting. It would be a great game for even non-LOTRfans to play, since a good deal of backstory is provided in lengthy cinematics throughout the game.Fellowship's greatest asset, of course, is the story itself, as well as the bevy of villainous creatures that provide great boss-fight material. I'm sure many other gameswishedthey had a Balrog to offer.But the story deviates strangely from the book in order to satisfy the format of an RPG game. The final boss-fight (which we won't spoil here) is completely unrelated to anything devised by J.R.R. Tolkien, and it seems hollow, strange, and unsatisfying. The puzzles sprinkled throughout the game are random and often frustrating, as is your first encounter with the Ringwraiths (inevitably, you die many times--too steep a difficulty curve right out of the gate). This game is still strongly recommended, but with many caveats. Proceed with caution and you're likely to enjoy yourself. Expect a masterpiece and you'll be wishing you saved your money for a different PS2 title.--Jennifer BuckendorffPros:Great story and great characters (of course)Missions that require problem-solving as well as combatGorgeous mapsGetting to play as GandalfCons:Painfully long cutaway scenesCheesy endingOften-tedious fights","reviewerName":"Matt Mabry","summary":"A great start to what would lead up to 2 great games.","reviewText":"The Lord of the Rings: Te Fellowship of the Ring is the game that spawned all of the hype about the Loard fo the Rings games that got progressively better, The Two towers was great but the Return of the King topped it all off.But the Fellowship of the Ring is a lot of fun too, it's just like the 2 sequels, but a little bit worse, of course it was a great start, and in fact, this game is a lot of fun, considering how loathly it seems compared to it's spawn.In this game you can play as gandalf, and who wouldn't want to do that?

I'm a moderate gamer; the new controls are generally more complicated than I'm willing to commit to. He is a hard core gamer. Some games are easier to watch than others, and some are easier to play. This review is not for the hard core gamer. This review if for the girlfriend (or boyfriend, who am I to judge?) that sits on the couch and watches.I'm not going to discuss the storyline or the premise of the game, as several other reviewers have done that in great detail. I will say that the animation is beautiful and the cut scenes, of which there are many, play like a movie. Now, for the important thing....GUYS...LISTEN UP....if you have been trying to convince your girlfriend that video games can fun, despite the fact that the controller has way too many buttons and things have gotten complicated beyond belief, this may just be the game that does it. I sit on the couch and watch Mike play games all of the time, and previous to this, the extent of my involvement was collecting and shooting stars as the second player inSuper Mario Galaxy. Imagine the wave of panic that spread across my body when he told me this game was multi-player. When he handed me that brand newXbox 360 Wireless Pink Controllerit was out of my hands, as there was no way I could say no.3-D gaming freaks me out. I would end up wandering around the board, lost and confused. Even watching the game, I can never remember where I came from and where I need to go. Luckily, that is a problem the primary player has to deal with. I was player two, happy to sit and watch, until battle time. The early battles were very easy, target an opponent, press a button. And while it did get a little more complicated as the game went on, it was a natural progression that I was easily able to follow. I feel like without this game as a starting point, the next game we tried out together,Tales of Vesperia, would have been a bit overwhelming if it were not for the fact that this game slowly let me enter the waters of RPG gaming....and a controller that was more than a joystick and a huge red button.

The only good song in the entire game is in the CREDITS!  What the?--The costumes in LBP2 are largely gimmicky and over-the-top (aka not as good) compared to LBP1.--Online multiplayer is nearly unplayable on many levels due to horrific lag and even freezes up COMPLETELY at times, forcing me to do a hard restart of my PS3. Completely unacceptable.--The \"simple\" act of finding community levels is a mess--the screen is WAY too cluttered and I can't stand the way the level descriptions start scrolling, it's very difficult to read and gets very frustrating very quickly. It's way easier finding levels in LBP1, even though LBP1 isn't all that great when it comes to this either.--Often times I'll sit there thinking a level is loading because the little \"loading\" sign is spinning, but in fact all it's doing is loading the creator's stupid planet. Why do I need to see their planet? Why do I care? It's a clusterf__ck. So I sit there for a good minute before I realize the stupid level isn't even loading. They should have made the loading screens way more clear.--The \"arcade\" games do not feel like LBP. They might be cute, but they're not LBP. Lets not stray too far from the original formula, Mm. I bought this game to play as Sackboy, not to relive my Atari days.--After you complete a level there's no longer that five or so seconds to \"bask\" in the win and screw around with your friends like in LBP1.

A flying city?!? How the hell?!? Quantum Mechanics or in layman terms Space Magic of course, I understand all about it, unfortunately I lack the space in this review for an in-depth introductory and if I explained it I would give away the story. Sarcasm and humor folks, this game thankfully has some of that too, it still knows it's a game.So you're picking up this girl with a Yakuza Space Magic pinkie finger, Elizabeth, and she'll be you're follower/NPC-slave throughout most of the game. I don't know how you guys feel about followers, but I love 'em. Freya and Vampiric Drain babe Serana in Skyrim or my 3 talkative Sorcer-Gods in Dark Arisen, anything to break my debilitating loneliness. Elizabeth seems to be catered perfectly to the needs of the modern day gentleman, she throws money at you, opens doors and Rifts with her Space Magic Finger and is an asset instead of a liability in combat, she doesn't block your pathing and is as immortal as a mathematical formulae. She's also 19 so it's completely cool to sexually fantasize about her. Her face mimicry is splendid and you'll care for her gradually, unlike Ellie in Garbage Of The Year LoU, who's being shoved down your throat.Together with Elizabeth you're gonna run through Cloud City, it looks like a mixture of Kingdoms of Amalur and Batman: Arkham City. I think both probably do it a little better, but let's not compare Booker with Batman. That would be like a Klitscko-Foreman fight, an unfair match-up. Anyway, this game looks fine graphically, original and colourful. Along the way you're gonna have to murder some locals from all races and convictions, those damn Irish Paddies! This we do with guns and Vigors. Vigors? I refer to the earlier Space Magic. The guns are ok, a bit unintutive but cool, unfortunately you can only carry 2 at a time like Uncharted and while you're never short of a gun, the best ones don't drop very often. My advice is hold on to that RPG-launcher and that Wild West Hand Cannon once you got 'em. You can buy ammo and upgrades at kiosks like BS2.Combat can also feel a bit hectic, you've already got the graphic overkill from the Vigors and sometimes you have to fight and jump across the Skyways simultaneously which takes getting used to. I was also quite annoyed with the 'Broken Shield' pop-up that just kinda fills up the entire screen. And getting ammo mid-combat can be cumbersome unless you're a gun switcher. But overall, gameplay feels solid and exhilarating.This game has a lot going for it, pretty set-pieces, fun gameplay, a guest-appearance from MechaBirdZilla and the 'IMMA BLOW YOUR MIND\" quantum mechanic story which will do just that, the ending is triumphant and meant to give everyone love and hope, but you can kinda argue on replay value, not me though, I've just finished nr2 play. There's also still 3 DLC's on the way, the first teaser is an all-you-can-shoot challenge thingy, quite fun to pass time withSo great game, you don't make this if you don't care, this gives people love and hope, and it's an inspiration to the industry.

{"product_name":"B002I08RR8","description":"","reviewerName":"Tristan A. Hayes","summary":"A Great Conclusion to the \"Assassin's Creed 2 Trilogy\"","reviewText":"Before I begin, I would just start by saying you really should only play this game if you have played the previous game, Assassin's Creed Brotherhood.  Revelations begins with a video overview of what happened at the end of the second game, which, I consider a huge revelation and spoiler for the series thus far. The game, as the final entry in the Assassin's Creed 2 series, is the culminating event and brings the story together fully, and one would miss out on a large and important portion of it without playing the former.Revelations begins differently than the previous by instead of having players start in the real modern world, they spend the time in the Animus. It is shown that after the events of the previous game, that in order to keep Desmond from experiencing total mental collapse that he had to be put in the Animus. Subject 16, who, if players solved the puzzles in the second game, serves as the only other real life contact Desmond has in the majority of this game. He states that we must relive parts of both Ezio's and Altair's (from Assassin's Creed 1) life in order to separate the three from Desmond, which would allow Desmond to come back to normal. It sounded like a lot at first but during the game, it proves to be quite interesting as we do get to spend a majority of the time as Ezio, who is seemingly in his 40's or 50's, and as Altair through several points of his life after the experiences in Assassin's Creed 1.The gameplay is much of the same that players have expected from Assassin's Creed. In quick review, there is still the same free running horizontal and vertical gameplay of being able to climb almost everything, free run to jump wherever, swing from walls, pull ups, etc. Melee combat has been enhanced with the new aspect of a slow motion effect when doing various counter kills in combat, which feels more refined than in previous games. This was the most impressive part as I continually stayed in combat just to see it. The metagame of capturing various zones in the city remains as well as renovating it. There is no trophy for it this time, but it is still interesting.The only part of gameplay that does not feel refined is the Den Defense. In this game, players have to defend the zones they capturing by playing a minigame in which you have to station various units such as barricades, archers, shooters, on rooftops as they defend their Assassin's den for the zone. It's quite aggravating as you have to rely on some morale meter that builds up over time so more units can be stationed, as well as anticipating where enemy units will come from, as well as needing to pay attention to any units that fell, not to mention at times the enemy will bring up some mobile unit that can smash through any barricade quite quickly. The game also feels as if it takes ten minutes each time. I found that rather than go through with that, just lose the den on purpose then recapture it by killing the enemy commander(s), an effortless task usually which takes five minutes tops.My favorite aspect of gameplay was the use of the Assassin's. Similar to the previous game, Ezio can recruit Assassin's that can be ranked up. With more assassin's most missions became quite easy as they could be called in to defeat enemy units, or just to keep me from being detected.And closing out on the gameplay, platforming in various locations as Ezio in various monuments was fun. There is something fun about the euphoria of jumping from platform to platform, climbing, and running through at times gorgeous landscapes to reach some treasure uninhibited by enemy units. The game features many of these which was always something to look forward to over the duration of nine sequences (chapters).Presentation wise, the game looks like a step up from the previous. Cutscenes have character models that look quite real at times, blocky fingers of Assassin's Creed 2 seem to be gone, and the landscapes and Constantinople look gorgeous. Blood doesnt look flat this time as well. For sound, the language of Constantinople was great and I always get a blast when the people of different languages interact. Similar to the last the player has choice of dialogue to play beyond English. I played in English and call characters sounded great. Altair sounded different than I remember, but still decent.  Music is quite amazing and its great they give the soundtrack with the game.Overall, the game is interesting. The lack of much gameplay in the modern world was missed, however with the circumstances of the games story it is to be understood. The best moment of the series happened in this game as well, which will be a spoiler if I said it but it was just as impressive as a set piece in Uncharted 3.  The game felt short overall, as there just wasnt as much to collect. They ditched the 100 collectibles idea and just focused on collecting animus fragments (for some gameplay as Desmond and unlockables), there were no monuments with hidden truths in them like the previous games, and the metagame of rebuilding the city felt kind of old as it was in the previous two games. I think the game could have used a bit more content, but that is most likely what Assassin's Creed 3 will do. However the games story concludes great and left me browsing the internet for speculation and theories on the future.The game is definitely a must play for Assassin's Creed fans and the Assassin's Creed 2 trilogy is a must play for everyone. This game also has a multiplayer mode that fills silly at first but overly addicting. The reason I say silly is that people are supposed to be assassins yet other human characters will run and jump while not being sneaky. It takes a while to get used to but quite addicting. Its a nice multiplayer mode in this age of the first person shooter. The game also includes a 3D mode for polarized lenses as well as Assassin's Creed on disc.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2011"}

That was a Christmas gift. My normal rule is &#34;I buy once.&#34; Made an exception here because I felt partially responsible, like if I had questioned him more during the return flight he would have kept up with it. So, I broke down and spent yet another $200+ to retrofit him for his February birthday. The look on his face and teary-eyed hug I got assuaged the ache in my wallet - almost. Anyway, he loves it and is far more careful now. The huge screen and graphics are clear and amazing. Suggest, among other accessories, getting a grip for it to add in comfort while also serving as a protective shield for inevitable drops.  Connects to my home internet flawlessly via my Apple Airport router, another fantastic buy. Still can't believe I spent over $500 for a 10 yr old's hand-held game,...long way from the days of Major Matt Mason.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2014"}

This is more of a list of reasons to play the game then a review. And why you shouldn't avoid it just because of what others said.*This is not a sequel game in any way, but it does connect in a weird way*Like previous reviewers stated, Aya doesn't seem anything like she does in Parasite Eve and Parasite Eve 2. There is a perfectly good explanation for this which is shown at the end of the game, in a huge unexpected twist. It also describes how the \"overdive\" ability was born. The overdive ability is something that can let you take over someone elses body, but with a special machine will let you travel back in time to someones body to change the future. The story can be really confusing at times, but starts making sense later in the game if you can comprehend the time traveling that \"overdive\" brings.All in all, it's a really good game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2011"}

Travis emerges victorious and finds himself in the presence of Silvia Christel, a mysterious French woman who claims to be an agent with the UAA. Silvia gives Travis official rank of 11 in the organization. Now, it's up to you to become #1. No More Heroes takes place in the city of Santa Destroy, and you are free to explore the town to your liking, taking on missions large and small to collect money and purchase new weapons as you work up towards the 10 main killing contracts.

The boss fights are easily the best part of the game with memorable characters that run the gamut of samurai schoolgirl to a Darth Vader wannabe. In between bosses, however, there is a sandbox mode where you can workout at the gym, buy new clothes, buy beam katanas, rent videos to learn new wrestling moves, and find various oddjobs to pay the fee  required to battle the assassins. With regards to the sandbox mode I would say it isn't well-designed but it works with only one or two minor problems, it isn't meant to be very interesting because its purpose seems to be in order to serve as an illustration of the hum-drum world juxtaposed against Travis's fantastical adventure. The combat is deeply satisfying without being particularly deep thanks in part to its fast-paced nature and way over the top(but not gruesome and horrifying) deaths and bloodletting. The graphics aren't the best the Wii has too offer but it has style: it uses color, sound effects, and visual effects in a consistent and highly enjoyable manner.If none of the above has convinced you to buy this game yet I would like to say that its one of the extremely few games I've beaten more than once  just for the sake of reliving the experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000035Y6N","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"a great big adventure... too big in fact","reviewText":"If Chrono Trigger is widely considered the best turn based RPG ever, I guess there's no argument to say otherwise.  Certainly no argument from me given the limited amount of experience I have with these type of games, but keep in mind I hate turn based RPGs.  I avoided them like the plague during my Super NES obsession 20 years ago.  I think the combat stinks because you have to take hits to actually *deliver* hits during combat (hence the \"turn based\" part of the genre) and the storyline is usually overlong, elaborate and exceptionally grand and elegant in a phony/uninteresting kind of way.  The presentation is the same unbearably pretentious way.  If this were a movie I'd get completely lost or uninterested in a matter of minutes and would shut it off, but for the sake of a video game with a reputation as being the best ever and a can't miss title, I decided to keep going.Chrono Trigger's storyline is enticing and lures me in during the first half but then other characters get thrown into the story such as Schala, Melchior, Janus and Prophet and it turns extremely confusing in a hurry.  The game should have continued the pace it had in the first half with the robot (really incredible that I actually feel sympathy for a robot in a video game of all places, but the game manages to make me feel bad for him), and even though I hate that a frog is part of the characters since it just seems totally silly to take an amphibian seriously, he's at least sometimes memorable.  Ayla's indiscernible english is a chore to read for the player (added worse by her frequent appearances throughout the quest, ugh).  Marle is confusing in the beginning which probably should have been taken as an indication that this game was going to be difficult to follow from a storyline perspective.  I guess she's a princess?  And she's several other people too?  Who really knows.Magus is supposed to be the bad guy but then a character named Lavos comes out of nowhere and I get lost.  Right when Glenn and Cyrus appear that's when the confusion escalates and loses me to the point that I was never able to recover.  The truth is, a video game storyline needs to be kept short and simple for me to understand.  Chrono Trigger is the exact opposite of that.  It's cool if you guys like it though.  I won't knock the game and give it a low rating just because I have trouble understanding sophisticated storylines in video games.  This is a fault of mine- not the game.  But perhaps the worst aspect is all the time travelling.  NOW I'm totally lost.  I can't keep track of all the past, present and future events that take place.  Knowing exactly what to do with a mess of timeline portals has to result in me using a FAQ to figure out.Do they still create turn based RPGs these days?  I can't bother to keep up with video games like I did when I was a kid.  I like the magic spells with the lightning, fireballs, icecube attacks, etc.  These are fun to watch and were really impressive back in the mid 90's.  Anyway a 3-star rating is fair.  This has to be the best turn based RPG I've ever played given it's only the second one I've ever played (Super Mario RPG being the other).  Take that for what it's worth.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-06-2013"}

Select from dozens of fighting styles, including (for example) martial-arts styles (Legendary Strike, Leaping Tiger), magic styles (Tempest, Dire Flame), transformation styles, and weapon styles (Twin Axes, Staff, and improvised weapons like chairs). Each style has its own tactical role and attacks that range from punches and kicks to weapon strikes, mystical powers, and even transformations into supernatural monsters! You can focus on a narrow channel of styles and become dominant in these forms or broaden your area of study to include a wide variety of styles adaptable to many combat situations. Combat is fast-paced martial-arts action, and it is exciting and tactical as you rapidly switch fighting styles to meet diverse challenges.","reviewerName":"Michael Corona \"Nemesis Legion\"","summary":"Welcome to the world of Jade","reviewText":"Jade Empire - Circa 2005GOOD:- Good/Tight controls- Nicely balanced gameplay (some might think it's to easy just go to the difficulty setting and crank up the difficulty)- Lots of different and interesting fighting styles to earn and choose from- An original story with some twists and turns for you to discover (by talking to people).

This worked well, although it required some rubbing to get all of the little specs and oils off of the screens.  Some patience is required here, and I don't think a child would have this.the first step is to use the affixed tape to hold the screen protector in place after you line it up.  This is pretty easy.  The second step is to pull the protective \"slide sheet\" off the back while the tape holds it in place.  This is a handy way of making sure that you don't get a fingerprint on the edge.  And the third step is to pull off the top coat of the screen protector.In between steps 2 and 3 you can run into several problems, which I did.  On the second sheet install (the touch screen) I had an air bubble, but they give you a little cardboard piece to work it out.  This was not a major problem.  Also, I didn't line up the screen protector correctly, and picked up the whole thing and moved it a millimeter to the left.  I was able to hold the screen protector by the tape pieces that would be removed later, which were very handy for this.  It was much more difficult to see the air bubble on the second install because the protective top coat was dark blue, and there was so much printing.  but I reapplied the blue top coat and worked out the air bubble as I saw where it was.Overall the install went much smoother than most screen protector products.I didn't like the included instruction pamphlet at all.  It had the instructions in 5 different languages for each step, which added a lot of visual clutter.  The internet link to the video instructions was not working at all, and when I went to Hori's website they didn't even have a 3DS section, and I couldn't find the product by product number in the product search function.  Being a japanese company, the entire website was in japanese and I didn't see an option to have it presented in english.  For a world class company, it is disappointing to include broken links in the instructions.  And the URL was very long, they should had used a QR code.  Oh Well.  This is a minor gripe but I feel that the included instruction pamphlet was so cluttered and poorly organized that you might as well throw it out.  Its great that clear instructions are printed on the product itself.  If not, I would have given the product 3 stars because the pamphlet is so poorly done. All the right information is there, but, they chose a bad layout.So, 4 stars.  Its the best screen protect product I've ever seen.

This sequel, as many reviewers have pointed out, is rather disappointing.PROS: A unique environment (Africa) that hasn't been done to death.  A tons of unlockable guns, and a good assortment of fun weapons like flamethrowers, grenade launchers and mortars.  Decent, though overrated AI.  Save-anywhere is nice, as are your buddies which help you out.CONS: An essentially soulless environment, tedious and repetitive gameplay.  It's amazing how devoid of any personality the world is.  It's a largely repetitive, empty world, which you will be tediously crisscrossing ad nauseam in order to get to your next mission.The missions are almost always assassination missions (drive to point X, kill Y) or FedEx missions (drive to point X, deliver Y).  The problem is that the environment is not really open-ended.  High mountains mean that the only way to get around for most of the game is by car, and this means that you HAVE to drive by the same stupid guard posts every time.  Unlike Far Cry or Oblivion, you are pretty much stuck on the roads that the developers want you to use.  The graphics are nice but nothing compared to Crysis or even Oblivion!  I run the game on Ultra-High with DirectX 10 and am not overwhelmed.The AI is also not nearly as amazing as advertised.  The bad guys take a seemingly endless amount of shots to die, which really cuts into the realism.  They can spot you at night, in the brush, from 100 yards away, and are amazing drivers and shooters.Oh, and the biggest strike of all against it: this game ships with SecuROM DRM anti-piracy software, which insidiously installs itself like spyware and limits the number of times you can install the game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005ML10","description":"One of the most anticipated titles in PlayStation2 history absolutely  lives up to the hype.Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Libertyis the  follow-up to one of the most captivating and intelligent adventures on the original  PlayStation. Solid Snake, everyone's favorite mullet-sporting supersoldier, is  back, along with many other familiar faces and voices. While its predecessor was  lauded for telling a complex story, this sequel has even more fascinating twists  and turns. Also, likeMetal Gear Solid,MGS2takes console-game storytelling to an entirely new level with  stunning in-game movies, great graphics, and game mechanics that let you find  your own solutions to challenges. The game's twisting and at times bizarre plot  will undoubtedly keep some gamers perplexed.Konami has replaced the moronic enemies from the firstMGSwith more  cerebral and capable foes; this causes an even greater emphasis on stealth than  the original. The controls have been refined and Snake's repertoire of moves has  grown, significantly deepening the gameplay. This is, technically and  stylistically, one of the best-looking PS2 games on the market. The sound is  also topnotch, with a fabulous score and outstanding voice acting. What makes  this game such a standout, however, is how all of these sight, sound, and story  elements combine to immerse the player into an entertainment form somewhere  between movie and game. It will be years beforeMetal Gear Solid 2: Sons of  Libertyis surpassed. This is interactive entertainment at its finest.--Raymond M.

MGS 2 retains all of the same action of the other Metal Gear games and adds stunning graphics, improved enemy AI, and an even more interactive environment. This is probably the best looking game on Playstation 2 to date, and the involved but easy to learn gameplay make even multiple play throughs enjoyable. In fact, fooling around is whole new game in itself. Try setting C4 in a guard's path and trigger it as he walks by, or try shooting out the lights or hiding in a box to screw with his head. It's freedom like this that makes MGS 2 so great. So the gameplay and graphics live up the hype, but what about the story? Unfortunately, this is where MGS 2 falls short. In the beginning it starts out great, but torward the end things just get...very weird (you'll see what I mean). It's seems as if the creators went a little overboard on trying to make the storyline dramatic and complex. This is the only factor which keep it from deserving a perfect 5 stars in my opinion. Even so, Metal Gear Solid 2 is a superb game, and is well worth buying if you have a Playstation 2.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2001"}

When I opened the box there was a warning stating that the game was realistically violent and it is intended for mature gamers; that's an understatement.  This game is freaking violent and bloody.  Limbs can be blown off, heads can be cut off, and internal organs can fly out of the body, and all this followed by a lot of blood.  Putting that aside Double Helix is an average first person shooter.  The story is very simple and there aren't any twists or turns making the story quite boring, but it moves the game along, so I'm not complaining.  The graphics are average and could be better considering it came out farley recently.  The game box clames it is a covert action game but after playing it for an hour or so, I realized it was pretty much a shoot'um up with very little strategy.  You have a good armament to choose from but all the weapons are pretty basic, none of them are special.  You can chose from an M4, a shotgun, a socom pistol, frag grenades, and the one and only OICW.  Were have we seen that weapon before, oh yeha in Ghost Recon.  Most of the game you are by your self but in a couple of levels you have some soldiers fighting beside you.  Some of the controls are annoying and hard to use so you may want to reconfigure them.  Double Helix is a good game, but should not be played by people under 14 years old.  And since it is so cheap it is definitely worth it.  Just remember to play on an empty stomach.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2003"}

It was a good game, and one I would recommend to any FPS fan. Its many features were well done. While I would give it high scores in most areas I can't help but think one thing; it's too short.Most of the levels, while detailed, were small for the space they tried to project. A good example is the missions in South America. These were much hyped, but still fell to the pitfalls of the Quake3 engine. Q3 isn't known for rendering large outdoor environments, and this shows when you are limited to moving in small valleys and between steep hills, stuck to one path. While it might look pretty, and it does, there is nothing more to see. So to add length, each environment is usually a string of several levels together. With the player limited to a linear route the missions (and the game) can go by fast.I did like the AI. I think SOF2 has some of the best AI on the PC market today. While the AI in Ghost Recon and Return to Castle Wolfenstien were good, I think SOF2 might even have surpassed them. The AI is aggressive, but not stupid. They will generally do a good job of hunting you down, moving between cover, leaning around corners, using grenades to flush you out, create a smoke screen or blind you, and using dropped weapons. However this is a mixed bag. Even on some of the easier difficulty levels the AI is almost TOO good. Such as often detecting me when they should not (like while I might be moving silently under cover) or too accurate with hand grenades, making it impossible to find protection.I liked multi-player but it was nothing new to me. The random mission generator was a nice touch, but again suffers from being more of the same.Overall I liked it and would recommend it, I just will not be playing it again anytime soon.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2002"}

There are 3 components on every stage:1. Kill guys until your score gets high-enough...2. A station will then pop-up, this triggers the mini-game, where you usually throw or smash guys3. Kill more till your score activates the next trigger, which will be the boss-battleNote: Every stage has a time limit of 30 Minutes.All games have a repetitive nature, so I tend to overlook that criticism. However, this game deserves it. Because when you're killing people you're not really doing anything but trying to get it over with to activate the next trigger. This is not a platformer game, where you jump, walk, and progress through the stage. The stages are setup as small areas and guys keep respawning once you kill them. No way to level or improve your character. It just seems pointless and boring.It has a very comic book feel to it as the designers intended. If you hit someone it says \"Blam\" or whatever. Also set in black and white, with only the blood and some lettering and on-screen prompts set with yellow highlights.Everything I read from critic & user reviews was true:1.

Thankfully it only happened once, but apparently similar things have happened to others after release of the Heavy Rain patch. I was on the \"Butterfly\" mission where Ethan crawls through the tunnel in the dark. Suddenly the screen went black and the audio was screeching. It sounded terrible and I couldn't get it to stop until I turned the PS3 off.That aside, Heavy Rain was a very intense game with a good story. There are not enough of these types of story rich games. The beginning is somewhat boring and slow, and it feels more like an interactive movie than an actual game. You have choices but they feel very limited, and often times your options on-screen are hard to see and you end up choosing the wrong one (at least I did). The words were also vague and sometimes ended up doing things entirely different from what I imagined.But Heavy Rain was half of the reason I finally bought a PS3. I was a big fan of Indigo Prophecy on PS2 and really wanted to play the team's latest game. Needless to say, my expectations were almost all fulfilled. The story was very exciting towards the end. I had absolutely no idea who the killer really was until it was revealed. The game gives you hints and plants things in your mind, but you're never really sure until it's confirmed. Overall it was excellent and has some replay value if you want to go back and experience different endings based on your choices. The game was fairly short though. I finished it in about a day and a half, and I didn't even play it the entire day. Bottom line, I'm eagerly waiting this team's next game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2010"}

It is a movie that yes does give you some interaction, but there is no thinking required though, no analyzing, no strategy involved in the least. While yes there are different things that can happen each time you play it but doesn't rest on choices you made or how you played, rather it all depends on whether you hit the proper button quick enough when it flashes on screen. That is hardly entertaining its just stupid. Don't get me wrong it takes a little skill and for someone like me who play the PS3 rarely it is frustrating when you don't know which button is which on the controller at first. However, after a couple of hours you learn the buttons but even then it doesn't become that entertaining watching and waiting for an \"X\" or an \"O\" or whatever button to pop up on the screen so that you can push the button at the right moment. While the concept of the story is a good one I am not sure why anyone would think this style of gaming interaction is good or fun in the least.

For this story, Rick and Jennifer - instead of entering by accident the West Manor like in the first game - are instead invited to the manor as Doctor West, an eminent teacher at the Arkham University, invites Jennifer to do an interview with him for the school paper. As Rick follows her, both for a following date and as a bodyguard, we see their date turn from a simple academic business to a diabolical nightmare composed of twelve levels, whose designs were haunting and corresponded to the tension I found in the original games.Of the storyline, I liked how the game's makers interspersed several flashbacks in the storyline. To me, this strategy allows us to dive straight into the characters' nightmare, and forces us to venture through the game if we want to understand how Rick got to wear the Terror Mask. Not only that, finding the complete photos of Jennifer in the game, along with doing the levels on various difficulty levels, allows us to find out how the Manor was built, but also how Rick and Jennifer's relationship went over the years.Of the voice actors, I loved Josh Keaton, Richard Doyle, and Shanelle Gray's excellent performances. But I loved and adored the twisted interactions between the Mask and Rick. And for that I am glad that the game makers cast Jim Cummings (DarkWing Duck) as the Mask. Good work from the writer Gordon Rennie, and to Howard Drossin, whose soundtrack was the perfect companion to this gory horror game.As for the gameplay, it is set in a 3D environment, but it also offers level sections presented in side-scrolling camera angles. This was fun to do as it reminded me of the original games, which you can play if you want to see the complete storyline from the trilogy. Personally, I think it is agood thing they put the original games in this remake for I heard that there won't be any sequels to this 2010 remake since Splatterhouse didn't do enough sales to allow a sequel. This is sad for the game ends on a cliffhanger just like in the Evil Dead movies that Sam Raimi did.Maybe what didn't help to the game's reception were the long loading times between levels, the difficulty to manipulate the camera, and the very sensible or unresponsive controls if you wanted to do certain moves. Not only that, maybe newcomers and some players didn't respond well to the game's goriness. Personally, I don't mind if a game is violent, as long as the game or movie offers an well-written story and is not an excuse for gratuitous acts of violence or sexuality and to display weak and stupid characters, which I found in the movie series Crank. But for those of you that have never heard of Splatterhouse, be aware that the game is no Disneyland. It is a gory game made for a very mature audience with a strong stomach.In the end, this game is a wonderful tribute to a classic whose images I remember seeing in my Batman comic books made in the eighties, and which intrigued me as I saw a haunted mansion turning into a Lovecraft monstrosity.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2012"}

Code Veronica X is probably my second favorite in the series, followingResident Evil 2. This game is a port from the Dreamcast version namedResident Evil- Code Veronica. The PS2 version I am reviewing is not very different. I have not played the Dreamcast version though, so I will not comment on the differences. If you are looking to get into Resident Evil, this is an awkward place to start. While you are given a background on the characters, they are still characters that are established in other games. I would suggest Resident Evil 1 or Resident Evil 2 before purchasing this one. After that, you need to add this to your collection.Graphics- 7/10Remember that this is a Dreamcast Port. Do not expect these graphics to be pushing the Playstation 2's processing power. The graphics are much enhanced from the previous titles in this series. All characters are shaped out nicely. Every character can be distinguished from one another with ease. All T-Virus infected monsters look good. I am saddened by the absence of the Licker, but the Hunter more than made up for it.The camera angles return in this game. Those of you who hate fixed camera angles are going to want to avoid this game. However, the camera now moves with you through an angle, which could prevent you from feeling ill or running into the undead. Due to the fixed camera angles, you never miss special items and always get a great graphical background. The backgrounds are better than they have ever been.The graphics are not the best, but at the same time, there is nothing wrong with them. Who buys games for graphics anyway? Well, if you do, you will not have any trouble enjoying Code Veronica X.Story- 10/10After the events of Resident Evil 2 take place, Claire Redfield and Leon Kennedy join an Anti-Umbrella corporation. Umbrella has been created Bio-Weapons, in which animals or humans injected with the T-Virus. Some become Zombies and others become something else entirely. Raccoon City had the virus unleashed on it as you may have seen in the first game. Claire Redfield escaped and is now in search of her brother, Chris Redfield. Chris went to the Umbrella HQ in Europe. Claire goes there to search for him.However, after an awesome cutscene, Claire is kidnapped and transferred to a island near Europe. It is known as Rockfort Island. Claire is only in her cell for a bit before chaos erupts. The island is attacked by an unknown source, and has leaked the T-Virus subjects. Claire is set free and told she will probably die anyway. Well, little does that idiot know, Claire has some experience in these matters.Soon you will meet the reckless, independent Steve. He will go down as one of the most annoying characters in the series. I however thought he really adds to the experience. He has plenty of personal issues, and takes it out on anything and everything.You will also meet many other disturbing characters like a cross dressing psycho, a T-Virus infected man from a previous game, and a supposedly dead girl. I promise all these characters flesh out the story insanely. Each one is unique and gives you a different feel. This is probably my favorite line-up of any game in the Resident Evil series.Sound- 8/10The music in this game is almost perfect. It always matches the mood. If you are exploring an area there will be soft, mysterious music. While in a firefight, you will hear intense music. The only problem with the music is that while it always matches the mood, it is never an outstanding score by any means.The sound effects are not perfect. Gun sounds sound decent, but not realistic. Voice acting in fantastic. Alexander Ashford brings an extremely disturbing element to this game. All the other character flesh out the game as well.Gameplay- 9/10If you like the other Resident Evil games, minus Resident Evil 4 and first person shooter games, you will love this. If you hated those games, you will hate this one. I am one of those people who love this style of gameplay. This game has more guns, a better knife, and an extra Battle Game once you finish the game. You will find yourself battling zombies and other monsters, and collecting items to enhance your progress in the game.This game is designed along the same pattern as all other Resident Evil games. There is a contamination and you need to escape the chaos. You will battle your way through herds of zombies trying to collect abnormal looking keys and objects to lead you to your safe departure from this island. Along the way, you will have to deal with all the psychotic characters on the island.You will play as both Claire Redfield and Chris Redfield. Yeah, I spoiled a bit of the game, but you probably already knew you would play as him anyway. Both scenarios are good length. You will also get to play as Steve at one point. That does not last long though.Code Veronica X features an enormous amount of weapons to play with. Sub-Machine Guns, Assault Rifles, and many other cool weapons will be at your disposal at one point or another. One key weapon that will be at your disposal is the Knife. You had it in the other games, but now it is much more powerful. To save ammunition you will find yourself cutting out the kneecaps of zombies. The knife becoming more powerful creates an interesting way of evading enemies instead of risking running past them.The Battle Game has also been added for this game. After you have defeated the game, you will unlock this fun add on. You will go through a series of sets in an attempt to make record time. These are short, but are entertaining. You can play as Chris and Claire at first, but can also earn other characters to use.Difficulty- 8/10 (Note- This is how much I like the Difficulty)The game is easy...if you know what you are doing. Those who do not will find themselves searching high and low to complete whatever puzzle they are trying to piece together. I suggest buying astrategy guideto maximize unlockables and complete the game without frustration. The bosses in this game can be hard, with or without a guide to help you out. The Tyrant you face can cause you to lose your mind if you lack the right firepower.Overall- 9/10Anyone who loves the Resident Evil series already owns this. If you are looking to get into the series, I suggest starting at an earlier game. If you hate this series go jump off a bridge because you hate great games. This game should keep all you adventure/horror types occupied for a week or more.This is part of the original style game that us Resident Evil fans love. Resident Evil 4 changed everything in a good way, but these games are still awesome in their own way. Pick this one up with an open mind that it is a completely different game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2008"}

Red Army troops are pouring across the borders of Mexico and Canada shortly after a nuclear missile is unleashed on Washington D.C. Chaos sets in when breaking news informs Americans that their President has been killed and the Russians have invaded the country.Players take on the role of a blue-collar worker who evolves into a charismatic and fearless freedom fighter obsessed with finding and freeing his brother, who has been taken hostage along with other New Yorkers by the Soviets. You must recruit and lead an army of urban guerillas to take on the Soviet threat in the streets of New York City.Freedom: The Battle for Liberty Islandprovides two layers of gameplay: A strategic turn-based mode that centers on base operations in an underground sewer system and an action mode that unfolds in the streets where fierce battles are won or lost and resources are captured.","reviewerName":"Sixto Limiac","summary":"This is the direct reflection of excellent gameplay","reviewText":"Whoa, where in bloody chickens did this game come from?  Underneath my gamer radar,  I did not consider Freedom Fighters warranting much attention, but once it stocked on the shelves, gamers began to ramble about it.  \"Wow, this game's friggin' amazing!\"  They hollered.  Like a wave of contagious infection, others followed, \"amazing, amazing, amazing!\"  The curious George within overran me and I decided to rent it, and what did I discover?  THIS GAME IS FRIGGIN' AMAZING!  I know why Freedom Fighters is on the tip of many gamers' tongues.  Squad-base action hasn't triumphed or felt this refreshing since tackling Ghost Recon.  But then again, even Ghost Recon did not invoke as much overwhelming guns-a-blazing, Rambo wallop.  Nor did Tom Clancy's romp take you in the streets and alleys of war-torn New York to gun down the blasted Reds!Communist Reds?  Aren't they gone?  Truthfully who knows (I watch too much X-Files), but in the fictional game of Freedom Fighters, the setting is based on an altered history.  Mother Russia is the triumphant of WWII, nuking Washington D.C., and subsequently invading Manhattan!  Jeez Louise, that's one helluva story, bub.  To make matters worse, Americans have to rely on some plumber to throw back the Communists invaders.  A plumber?  Not some Hu-Ra Marine or Ranger?  Nope, our heroic leading role, Chris Stone, must recruit soldiers to ultimately drive the threat back.  Hu-Ra, plumber Chris!Know this.  Everything Freedom Fighters happens to be is the direct reflection of excellent gameplay.  The concept, the system, and overall execution falls nearly flawless.  On the whole scale, FF rips up the genre into something that has been lacking entirely on today`s market.  EA has done good, real good.  The game is mission-based where few objectives must be carried out and the main one  is bringing down the Soviet Flag and hoisting the red, white, and blue.  Other goals include demolishing bridges with C4 and rescuing battered POWs.  Although the heart of the gameplay is focused on the firefighting.  It is a mix of first person and third person gunplay.  With automatic aiming in the third person and manual targeting with the first person, FF works perfectly.  Moving Chris is easy and somewhat cheap since you can see everything by rotating the camera in any direction you desire.  That may steal the suspense of not knowing where your enemies lie.  Relatively simple to handle, the combatants under your control work easier than you can imagine.  Directed by three buttons which hold a position, advance, and regroup, your recruits are very, very responsive. You can take up as many as twelve and gain them by accomplishing missions or sacrifices your health packs on wounded combatants.  Thusly, you gain charismatic points to earn additional soldiers.  With a formidable squad in your command and Chris himself, firefights can get huge.  Sometimes I just watch my fighters advance through enemy fire and run the Soviets down.  As long as you have health packs, you're soldiers can be revived endlessly.  Other great gameplay moments are helicopters chasing your party, trying to gun them to shreds, snipers taking accurate shots as you move through the streets, and the enemy outnumbering you as you retreat for cover.  And did I mention there's one surprising moment of a tank thundering into your position?  Great stuff, man.Sadly, with the good must come the bad.  FF is an all too brief game.  If you consider yourself the fanatic, all-day player, you may  conquer the game in one sitting.  Yes, it is that addictive, but don't be surprise to find yourself playing and playing, and suddenly reach the abrupt ending.  It happened to me the third day.  The second and last drawback I had was the automatic reloading.  I don't like it, it feels as I'm being spoon-fed. I mean imagine if Halo were like that?  It wouldn't be as deep, and I believe the intensity of  FF could have been so much more without it.  I want to be the dictator of all my actions and be forced to retreat, run for cover, and reload properly!Graphically, Freedom Fighters is sharp and distinctively stands on its own.  The layout of the environment has captured a remarkable setting of what New York were to look if a battleground.  Set in the cool urban terrain, the added touches of the soviet's barricades and defensive lines augment the powerful setting.  The incredible atmosphere grips the dark and harsh event of war in the city.  Seeing the somber soldiers in their palpable gloom, holding their firearms reached a degree of melancholy.  Enemy structures as turrets, barb wire, and small towers were stirring to see as flashy firefights break out and my soldiers cleared out enemy positions.  It's always pleasant to watch the reds go into your blast of a frag or shot gun, and see them hurled across the screen.  The faces on each character are tremendously in depth, with superior frame rate to back it up.  Chris intends to change outfits in accordance with his mood, and his mug is awesome when he wore a hood and covered his face during the lone sniper mission.  It was amazing to watch him with an AK-47 strapped to his back, climbing up the ladder as lighting struck.On the music FF is like a gun, it goes off with a blast.  Collected in a well developed variety of music, it's a treat to listen to many different themes.  The Russian opera is often played and never ceases to amaze me.  There are different types of music played at the right time such as heated firefighting.  The soft, congratulating music played after a mission is also one of the best pieces the game delivers.  It is a feeling of heroism springing into the air.  Voiceovers are done excellently.  Chris is gruff and speaks only when necessary, so when he actually does, you can expect something completely impressing.  Sound effects themselves are booming with great sound design.  The cool Russian accents are rife with authority and seem truly authentic.Take my word, Freedom Fighters is well worth the purchase.  It's a mouthful of joy and goes to hit its stride in the genre.  The polish of the game is obviously done where it counts, stellar high action.  One remarkable game, you can't be steered wrong with it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-07-2003"}

Basking in the glow of fictional Miami-lookalike Vice City, players are thrust headlong into the violent, seedy criminal underworld and held under until they stop kicking. Like it or not, this is a game that appeals to your very darkest side.As new-on-the-scene gangster wannabe Tommy Vercetti, its the players job to carve out a name for themselves amidst the razzle and glamor of the 80's. Said name is accomplished, on the whole, by doing very bad things, such as stealing cars, knocking off banks, waxing rival gang members and generally giving 'the man' a hard time. Drag people from their 80's sports cars, hit them with a baseball bat and get on with life...its that simple. You're given the freedom to explore a hugely detailed living breathing Florida city, complete with neon soaked beach fronts, highly dodgy cuban poor-quarter, sky-rise downtown and most anything else you could think of. Missions are granted through your increasing network of criminal contacts, and there's literally hundreds of different jobs and capers to explore.In fact, the 'simple' mechanics of the game conceal immense playability and structure, and you can play for hours doing not really very much at all...just cruising round, pushing the envelope of being a bad-guy and exploring the city. The graphics are a notch up from GTA: III, and likewise the sound is a marked improvement, with a very healthy selection of radio stations to choose from. Let it be said that if you generally shun 80's music you might feel a little swamped here, but hey, its all part of the atmosphere.Its also worth noting, for anyone who has been living in a cave and hasn't heard the press hype, that this game is not one for the kiddies. Its not just that its very violent or profane...its that it basks, revels and rejoices in acts of wanton destruction, and sports a very sick (and very funny) sense of humor and irony. There's a good deal of drug abuse, lots of sexual innuendo and a veritable orgy of killing...indeed, many sub-missions involve seeing how many people you can flame-thrower or machete in a time limit. So heed the warnings, and don't take it too seriously eh?The few downsides to the game include a fairly sluggish combat system (compared to other contemporary shooting/fighting games), a drop in the framerate when you get lots of cars on the screen and...well, thats really about all I can think of.For those of sterner stuff, GTA: Vice City represents a new generation of video game, one that takes risks, appeals to an older, wiser gamer and most of all, delivers value for money in spades. There's at least a hundred hours of play, but really the possibilities are limitless.I'm off to slip into my sport jacket, grab my street bike and katana from the garage, crank up Billy Jean on the radio and do some serious gaming.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0000696CZ","reviewerName":"Nick","summary":"An Absolutely Outstanding Achievement","reviewText":"I am a sixteen year old gamer from New Hampshire.  I have been playing videogames my entire life.  I've enjoyed all of the Grand Theft Auto games, although I never purchased any of the first three.  I got Vice City in late November and have not had another game in my Playstation 2 since.As far as I'm concerned, the beauty of this game is that it is quite likely the least linear game of all time.  There are an abundance of missions that ease you through a surprisingly deep story where your character, Tommy Vercetti slowly gains a reputation in Vice City as a force to be reckoned with, but the missions are always there for you to tackle, and any average player can avoid them and still enjoy the rest of the game for hours and hours on end.This game may not be Grand Theft Auto 4, but it is still leaps and bounds ahead of Grand Theft Auto 3.  Vice City is absolutely enormous.  It consists of two huge islands, and a number of smaller islands in between.  The entire city is opened up after a few missions, so the player has access to any part of it from the very beginning of the game, unlike it's predecssor which had the player gradually unlocking every borough of the city as they went along.  There are many more weapons, including everything from Grand Theft Auto 3, plus new additions like golf clubs, chainsaws, miniguns, hammers and many more.  You will also find many more vehicles, including the motorcycles that were mysteriously absent from Grand Theft Auto 3, golf carts, helicopters, airplanes, and a ton of boats.  And although the game looks almost exactly the same as the third in the series graphically, there have still been some graphical upgrades made, namely reflections, (take a look at the ocean at sunset from a helicopter to see what I mean.)And if the player really doesn't feel like completing the game's main missions, (which can get quite tricky later on), there are a countless number of things to do on the side, as any Grand Theft Auto 3 veteran already knows.  These include driving taxis for fares, acting as a paramedic in an ambulance, dealing drugs in an ice cream truck, or racing cars and motorbikes.  If those get boring, the player will likely find himself exploring the twisting streets and back alleys of the city just to see what other kind of trouble they can get into.  Firefights are a good way to get yourself into trouble, but the aiming system still suffers slightly from the same problems it did in Grand Theft Auto 3, so when your wanted level gets high, and the cops and the FBI are tailing you with cars and helicopters, surviving is very unlikely, although you can always put up a fight.The Insane Stunt bonuses from GTA3 make a welcome return as well.  There are jumps and hills scattered all over the city, and  you will be rewarded with cash for getting enough air off them in a bike or car.  Flatland tricks can also be performed as well, including wheelies and stoppies on the motorcycles, and two-wheeled bonuses in cars.The main missions are still the meat of the game though, and thankfully, they are absolutely incredible.  They will never have you doing the same thing twice, and each one is unbelievably enjoyable.  They range from planting and dropping bombs with remote controlled airplanes and helicopters, to gaining access to a mall under police investigation dressed up as a cop to plant a bomb in one of the stores.  You'll have to use every vehicle in the game on these missions as well.And last but not least, the sound.  Thanks to the setting, (the game takes place in the '80's for those of you who didn't know already), we are treated to over eigty of the best songs from that decade.  There are seven radio stations, which are each devoted to their own genre of music.  Rock, new wave, pop, rap...  There is also a talk show station, and a public radio station.  And devoted GTA3 veterans will recognize a number of the radio's personalities from the predecessor.  Lazlow hosts VROCK, Vice City's hair band rock station.All in all, this is one of the best games ever made, hands down.  The gameplay is spot-on, the sound is excellent, and it never, EVER gets boring.

{"product_name":"B004WLRQMI","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"The most refined and expansive \"classical\" 3D Zelda experience to date","reviewText":"With the benefit of retrospection, it's easy to assume that this game may very well be the last of a pure type of Zelda breed.Skyward Swordhas come and gone, and has seemingly ushered in a new era of design ideas for future Zelda releases. That said, for those who believe thatOcarina of Timeis among the greatest games of all time, this is a game for you. For just as Ocarina of Time introduced an amazing template for a \"classical\" 3D Zelda experience, Twilight Princess took that template design and sharpened it to an unimaginable gleam. This is an incredible game, even today still, and now that it is a \"Nintendo Select,\" there's no better time to get into it.The story in Twilight Princess really hearkens back to a classic Nintendo theme of duality. Much like the dual-timelines of Ocarina of Time, or the Light/Dark World ofA Link to the Past, there are two dimensions at play here. Link is a young man living in the peaceful, forested Ordon providence near Hyrule, in a small village. Here he lives a peaceful life with his fellow villagers, making a living on the famous Ordon Goat Ranch. Meanwhile, the light soaked kingdom of Hyrule has been invaded by beings from another dimension called the Twilight realm, their king a creepy villain named Zant. Zant's plan is to combine his world of Shadow with Hyrule, creating a dark, twisted reality for him to control. One day, Link's life is interrupted by this chaos, and once again, a young man clad in green will take up the call of destiny and stave back the sinister darkness that has fallen over Hyrule. He will also meet a shadow imp named Midna, who seems to be untrustworthy at first, but will come to be an awesome companion throughout the quest.It is immediately discernable while playing this game that this is a darker Zelda game than has ever come before it, with perhapsMajora's Maskbeing the exception. Indeed, this is a gritty story, full of dark moments and even some more violent parts for a Zelda game (but still admittedly tame by industry standards these days). As with any Zelda title, you can count on the characters being likable, compelling, and charming. The writing of all characters, minor and major, is very well done, as is their design. Midna is worth mention alone. My all-time favorite companion character in a Zelda game (We even named our puppy after her :D), not only is she helpful, but her back-story is deep and her character is so well conceived and executed, she's an absolute delight to have along on the journey. She's a real stand-out in the entire franchise and that's saying a lot! What helps make the experience so compelling is also the cinematic nature of the game. Though not quite as dynamically cinematic as newer Zelda offerings, Twilight Princess still boasts some really interesting cutscenes and story events. Yes, Twilight Princess is a great game in regards to its story and presentation.The art/sound design in this game is also very well done. After their grand cel shading adventure inThe Wind Waker, Nintendo took Twilight Princess to the extreme polar opposite, opting for a more \"realistic\" graphic novel-like approach for the visuals. Granted, this is a Gamecube game, albeit a gorgeous one, ported over to Wii, so don't expect HD console graphics, but even having just beat this game for the fourth time last week, the graphics in this game are still beautiful. Link looks awesome, and to see many familiar elements of the series realized in this unique, realistic fashion is awesome. The visual splendor of the Twilight Realm alone is worthy of mention. This bloom lit world is filled with really beautiful particle effects and coloring, and is a real joy to behold. Imagine the way a sunset bathes the world in a warm, piercing light that makes everything look radiant, and that's what the Twilight Realm looks like here. Very cool. The music is very well done too, as you probably already expected. Koji Kondo once again delivered. The music here ranges from haunting, creepy, atmospheric, lovely, moving, majestic, powerful, and everything in between. The only thing I wish they had done different with the music was to have some of it fully orchestrated, as the gorgeous compositions would have really benefited by it, but that is a minor gripe that only serves to further compliment the brilliance of the music itself. It really is a beautiful soundtrack.The gameplay is where this game takes Ocarina's template, and expands upon it to new heights. Seriously, imagineOcarina of Time, and then grow its scope and size several times. You'll be going on an epic quest across a ginormous Hyrule, exploring its massive field, its various regions, its several provinces, villages, and towns, as well as discovering its clever temples and dungeons. There's a big emphasis here on horseback riding and combat. Some story events require it. The world here is really big, it would take forever to try and run across it all on foot. This huge space is utilized very well, hiding a ton of collectibles and secrets that true fans of the exploratory aspect of the Zelda series will love. The traditional Zelda gameplay is true perfection of the adventure game genre. The controls are fantastic, the puzzles and combat are incredibly satisfying, and, as you'd expect, the temples and their special items are a real highlight. It all comes together in a way that really pays homage to Ocarina of Time, every step of the way, even while expanding the scope to previously unseen levels. Other aspects of the traditional play has been expanded on as well. Link has many new moves that really makes him feel like a true warrior swordsman. Despite the fact swings are pre-rendered and merely activate with a waggle of the wii-mote, fighting in the game feels quite satisfying.Like I said earlier, there is a dual nature to the adventure here, and that expands beyond the story and into the gameplay aspects as well. You see, when Link encounters the Twilight Realm in Hyrule, because of his blessing by the goddesses as a true hero, he transforms into a fierce wolf instead of a mere wandering, lost spiritual flame like everyone else. This changes the nature of the gameplay quite a bit. Now you will use his sharpened senses to track scents, his teeth instead of his sword, his paws to dig in almost any spot, etc. It's enough of a change from Link's traditional gameplay to really make it stand out. This, combined with the shadow realm's genuinely warm and beautiful aesthetics and equally unique musical queues and sound design help make this game's own mark on the franchise. Later on in the adventure, you have the option to switch between normal Link and his wolf form at will, and the game design takes full advantage of this, adding yet another interesting dimension to traversing the temples.The Legend of Zelda is a spectacular series in video games, perhaps the greatest there is. Even with the benefit of over 25 years of retrospection, Twilight Princess is a very unique game that stands out. If considered in context of Zelda's history as a whole, it is perhaps the most comprehensive, encyclopedic \"classical\" experience you could expect from the series, while also feeling like one of the most unique at the same time. Those may seem like mutually exclusive statements, but somehow Twilight Princess pulls them both off quite effortlessly. Skyward Sword has finally released, and greatly reinvigorated the series with massively ground-breaking changes. If it heralds a new age for the Zelda series like many believe, then Twilight Princess is the ultimate \"classical\" Zelda experience and a true relic of a fantastic era, and may well be for quite a while. If so, it is an excellent title that will no doubt continue to satisfy any gamer's desire for even more years to come. Now that it is a Nintendo Select title, there's no better time like the present. Buy it, adventure through the massive kingdom of Hyrule, and once again take up the mantle of chosen Hero and save the world of light.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-23-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","summary":"My Favorite Console","reviewText":"I own a Wii, and I have a number of friends who are Xbox 360 fanatics. But, for me, you simply obtain the best overall experience with Sony's PS3. There are a number of things that the other two major players in the console arena have going for them that the PS3 does not, but these pros don't manage to change my opinion that this is the best system presently on the market.The Wii is worth owning for all of the games exclusive to Nintendo's library; whether disc-based or downloadable. And the 360 is worth owning because all of its games provide the achievement (or trophy) service to its user base. The 360 also has a unique platform for interactive gaming in the form of Kinect. But, if no games were console exclusive and Sony would update their entire gaming library to support trophies, the PS3 simply couldn't be topped in the department of excellence.One of my favorite things about this console are the controllers. Whether it be their standard Dualshock controllers of their Move controllers, you're looking at controllers which come more naturally to any user than can be found on the Wii or the 360. And, although I mentioned Kinect earlier, I still don't particularly enjoy using the Kinect; thanks to lots of inaccuracies and recognition failures. It's neat, but doesn't feel fully realized. The 360's standard controllers have always felt entirely too bulky in hand for my liking. And, although I do think Sony's Move controllers are improved-upon knockoffs of the Wii controllers, Sony still manages to do a much better job with interactive controlling than the competition. Their Move controllers are also cordless; a big step up over what the Wii can claim.When it comes to graphics, again there is no comparison to the PS3. 360 games look great. But the 360 simply isn't running output equivalent to the PS3. And the Wii doesn't hold a candle to either of these systems with regard to graphics. The PS3 also outstrips its competitors by providing a Blu-Ray player, free online play (unlike the 360), and the ease of connecting with friends (unlike the Wii). The interface of the PS3 is perfectly easy to use, and provides easy connectivity to popular sites like Facebook and Youtube. Although I do wish that the quality of the Youtube app was on par with a standard PC.One recommendation I would make to any newcomer would be to go ahead and pay for a year's worth of Playstation Plus. This will provide you with access to all sorts of free games, regularly updated, which you'll get to keep. The reason I recommend this is because, due to the ever-changing list of free games, the service quickly pays for itself. It also provides you with early and exclusive access to new releases and free 60 minute full game trials. Another thing worth mentioning is that you'll want to purchase a system with high memory, because it's amazing how quickly you'll hit the space limitations. Eventually I ended up buying my own internal hard drive and installing it in my console by myself. The hardware installation was a breeze (another reason to love this system).Games are definitely worth mentioning here. While the 360 has a handful of exclusives worth playing and the Wii has an immense downloadable library of classic games worth revisiting, the PS3 still takes the cake here. Much like the Wii, Sony has also been building a library of games from its previous consoles, in addition to tons of non-disc based exclusives and PSP minis (playable on the PS3); all easily downloadable from the Playstation Store. The 360 tends to get add-on content for disc-based games a month ahead of the PS3, but it (in my experience) always makes its way to the PS3 eventaully; sometimes much improved upon or added to by the time it gets there. The disc-based exclusives for the PS3, at least for me, are far more desirable than what you'll find on the 360. The Wii is no shrimp in the land of exclusives, and the 360 really does have a few winners in this category too. But both are dwarfed by what the PS3 has to offer. You're going to want PS3's exclusive games. Nowhere else will you find God Of War, Killzone, Socom, Uncharted, Ratchet & Clank, Metal Gear Solid, Sly Cooper, inFamous, Little Big Planet, Resistance, and on and on and on...There are certainly a few lessons Sony stands to learn from what has helped their competition stay afloat. But, having owned a PS3 for three years now, I do think that they are working on making everything about the services they provide better than the rest. Sony also seems less interested in jumping on the latest bandwagons before they are thoroughly proven. At the end of the day, I love that I can play games which look and feel great; giving me a better experience than I've had with the other two big guns in the room. I also love that I can connect online with my friends easily and without having to pay any money to anyone. I should probably throw in the fact that I own two PS3's at this point and have never had one break on me; nor have any of my friends.This system is one of the best investments you can make. The price may still be a bit higher than the competition, but so is the level of service you're going to get with Sony. The Blu-Ray function alone could explain the comparative cost difference. And, regardless of the small amount of negative hype surrounding this system, you simply cannot go wrong with a PS3. I have no personal vendetta against the 360 or the Wii. I'm not one of 'those' reviewers. I've used all three of these systems extensively. And the PS3...is the best you can do. What more can I say? Buy now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2012"}
{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"G. Denick","summary":"Impressions from a fan of the \"Uncharted\" series (campaign review)","reviewText":"I've never spent much time playing the \"Tomb Raider\" series, but this reboot did all the right things, and it drew me right in. This modern take on the famous franchise takes inspiration from many great sources- my first impression, oddly enough, was of \"Resident Evil 4\" (a classic so significant, it's still influencing the gaming landscape). The early goings of \"Tomb Raider\" have a distinctly \"survival horror\" vibe that is masterfully conveyed, interspersed with just the right amounts of Quick Time Events, cinematic showpieces, character development, story telling, and gameplay tutorials. Additionally, it reminded me of the fantastic island of the TV show, \"Lost\" (complete with freaky natives and bunkers!).The most striking comparison, of course, is that of the \"Uncharted\" series. \"Tomb Raider\" obviously existed long before \"Uncharted\", but it's equally obvious that it drew inspiration from the mechanics of climbing, combat, and cinematic storytelling of one of this generation's most successful series. And I'm not complaining at all- I wish there were more games like \"Uncharted\"! For the most part, \"Tomb Raider\" does a fantastic job implementing these elements, resulting in a game that is a blast to play and easy to pick up. Everything is very responsive, the settings are visually vibrant and interesting, and the island is begging for more thorough searching. The inclusion of TONS of unlockables is a genius notion, including documents (which help to further unfurl the mystery of the island), artifacts, and salvage (for weapon and gear upgrades), and it means crazy amounts of replay value... plus the online multiplayer aspect, if that strikes your fancy.The only thing holding \"Tomb Raider\" back from five stars is that when pitted up against the unrivaled production values of \"Uncharted\", it falls a shade short. The characters are noticeably lacking compared to the likes of Nathan, Sully, and Elena, and the presentation just seems a bit \"off\". There's such an emphasis placed on (literal and figurative) darkness and grittiness, I oftentimes had difficulty seeing what was going on around my character, and it actually had something of a demoralizing effect (particlarly when compared to the bright, tropical locales of \"Uncharted\"). That's not to say that \"Tomb Raider\" is a bad game- it's not. In reality, it's a very good game- it's just not among my top favorites.Final note (MINOR spoilers follow): The producers of this game must be huge fans of the movie \"The Descent\", for there are many nods to the horror film, including Lara's affinity for the climbing axe, the \"bone scramble\" toward daylight in the opening moments, and the slow emergence from the red pool of ichor in \"the pit\". Additionally, Lara's psychological transformation closely mirrors that of \"The Descent\"'s protagonist. It was an excellent source to draw inspiration from, and the developers of \"Tomb Raider\" did a fine job of subtly paying homage to it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Tomb Raider deserves every accolade it receives!","reviewText":"Wow... I almost didn't buy this gem of a game. I usually primarily stick to games that have monsters. You know, games like God of War, Castlevania, Darksiders, etc. I kept reading Amazon reviews, followed by youtube clips, and I decided this game had the potential to be special (regardless of not having monsters). I pulled the trigger on it, and as they say - \"The rest is history'.Combat - I'd say 90% of Tomb Raider is a third-person shooter. I make a concerted effort to avoid shooters, but this one is a little different. One of the weapons are not typical of what you'd find in a third-person shooter (more on weaponry later). I found the shooting mechanics to be slick, and responsive. One of the main reasons I avoid shooters is because I'm usually not very good at them, but I think I fared pretty well in this game. Although the combat is mostly third-person, you will have several opportunities to use melee attacks. Please don't expect hand to hand combat to be on par with some of the popular action games on the market, but if executed correctly, it can be very satisfying. I usually used melee attacks out of pure necessity (when an enemy rushed me) and more often than not I was the last one standing, unless I was unfairly shot, lol. The overall combat system worked well for me.Weaponry - Many of the games I've played had a massive number of weapons; many of them going unused. Not in Tomb Raider... You'll only have 5 weapons throughout your entire journey, and I guarantee you'll use all of them (all upgradable). I'll start with my least favorite one. You'll get the shotgun early in the game. I mainly used it to blow open doors, and I rarely used it on enemies. Lara's climbing axe is the melee weapon of choice, and she swings it like it's no tomorrow!  Her machine gun is used for 'crowd control' and works well when being confronted with a sticky situation. The pistol with a silencer attached is very useful in taking out enemies one by one, with headshots. My personal favorite is the bow and arrow, with fire attached at the tip of the arrow. There's somethings very special about hiding behind a crate, and shooting a flaming arrow at an enemy :-) I don't know of any other shooters that offer up fire-tipped bow and arrow play, do you?Enemies - As I briefly touched on in the opening paragraph, Tomb Raider mainly consists of humans. You'll run into they occasional wolf while in the woods, but it's nothing your climbing axe can't handle. Although mostly human, there actually was a nice variety. Enemies had everything from machetes and guns, to grenades and turrets! In regards to difficulty, I thought many of the enemies put up a tough challenge. There was really only one boss battle in the game. There's so much I want to say about this boss (mostly good) but that's difficult to do without giving spoilers. Let's just say he's completely 'different' than the enemies you'll faced throughout the entire game.Miscellaneous - In order to get the most out of the game, you'll have to take advantage of the many opportunities to explore. There's a TON of things to look for, and it never gets tedious. If you're the type of gamer that enjoys puzzles, you'll find several puzzles inside the various secret tombs. I've read many reviews that described the puzzles as easy, but I disagree. And, if you hate puzzles, not to worry because the tombs are optional. Tomb Raider doesn't keep track of time played, but if you explore and try to complete each area, you're easily looking at a 20 hour game. There's also multiplayer, but I didn't play it, therefore I can't judge it (my guess is that it sucks like all the other mp elements thrown into single player games) but I digress...The only negative aspect I can think of is some of the long cut-scenes. But besides that, I've got nothing. Definitely one of the most intense games I've ever played, from start to finish. Being that I've never played any of the previous Tomb Raider games, I can't compare it to those. If you like action games, I honestly believe you'll at least give this 4 stars. Dragon's Crown, you're up next!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2013"}

Although intrigued by the genre, never played anything else in the series until getting my hands on the latest PS3 version last Black Friday.  The first couple hours of play almost threw me off - what in the world am I doing shooting arrows into deers, rabbits and wolfs?  Coupled with seeing some negative reviews, I almost gave it up.  Thank God, I did not.  The game drew me into an almost non-stop binge playing for a few days (well, I have to work during the day and feed), and when I finally emerged as a survivor I had to look back with a smile.  True, it resembles Uncharted (I played all three), but who cares.  Yes, it is a bit gory, but is it rated M?  Have to admit that the puzzles are not that difficult, but they strike a good balance between fun and thinking.

Although this explains some of the gameplay mechanics (like why parts of the city are off limits early in the game), it ultimately mucks up the story too much and comes across much more hokey than the A story - which is good, albeit a bit convoluted.The gameplay is fun at first, but it gets repetitive quickly.  When you enter a city to assassinate a target, you must gather intel.  You can max out your intel and complete all the side missions, or you can complete the bare minimum (although this will make killing your target somewhat harder).  There are 6 basic things to do in every city - climb a high tower to \"synchronize\" (read unlock objectives) on your map; save citizens - which means fighting a bunch of people at the same time; pick pocket; rough up an witness; protect an informer; and a final type which essentially is a race.The open fighting is nothing new, but it hangs together pretty well and it doesn't feel like you're mindlessly mashing buttons.  For an assassin game, it's really the quiet assassin kills that are the most fun.  It's simple enough, but if you're spotted, you'll be attacked by guards.I think the game developers intended you to run at that point.  Running from roof top to roof top and through crowded streets is fun - at first.  Like all the other gameplay aspects, it gets frustrating at a point.  When you have to run for five minutes to get away from the guards and then truck it all the way back to your objective - it gets a little tedious.  By the end, I would simple fight any guards who messed with me, because it was quicker than running away.The graphics are pretty good.  Some of the cities look a little washed out on blue or red.  This creates a good atmosphere, but takes a little away from the realism.  The background citizens look really good - they move very realisticly in the crowded streets.  They react pretty much like you would expect in any given situation.  The climbing animation is great too.  You can climb pretty much anything that looks like it can be climbed and every step you take was painstakingly animated.The main problem with this game (outside of repetition ) is that once you beat it - there's little incentive to go back and play it again.  (There are \"flags\" to collect in the various levels, but this makes playing the game feel like work; and as far as I can tell it doesn't add to the story).  This is a great game to rent over a long weekend and take back to the store on Monday.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0053BG26C","description":"","reviewerName":"L. Gildart","summary":"Excellent for older and/or mobility impaired adults","reviewText":"I have SLE with mobility issues (inflammatory arthritis) and chronic fatigue, which puts me in a catch 22 situation of needing to exercise to keep from losing ground with both my mobility and my stamina, while having to fight an uphill battle just to get to the point that I CAN exercise.  Going to a gym with any kind of regularity is out of the question.  I used to be really active before I got sick, and I much prefer doing \"something\" to jogging on a trampoline or working through a list of exercises from my physical therapist.  So I thought I would give this a try.I love love love it.  Unlike the Wii Fit game, your mii doesn't shame you over a one star performance (okay, I think that's funny, but your mother or your grandmother might not).  Also, Just Dance makes it extremely easy to start from right where you are, mobility-wise.  You can start sitting down, if you need to.The game is also very flexible in terms of how you structure your sessions.  You can use the Just Dance feature to browse through songs and move to what you like to hear or to learn the moves (which actually seems to be helping with my cognitive function) to the dance routines you like the best.  If you're just looking to get in, get some cardio, and get out, you can go into the Just Sweat section and do that.  You can even set weekly goals for yourself.My favorite part about the game is that it is so low key and hassle free.  You turn it on, and get right to whatever you want to do.  When you are finished, it's fast and easy to shut the thing down.  The songs are eclectic (some content might not be appropriate for young children), and replay value is high.  I like it so much that I got Just Dance 4 for Wii U.The only thing I don't like about it is that it doesn't always record your movement correctly or save your progress.  It's no mean feat for me to hit my daily goal, so when I go back the next day after meeting my daily objective and the last dance I did didn't get its points saved, it's a bit of a disappointment.  Not a super big deal, though.  I'm not exactly getting graded or paid by the point : )","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2013"}

Basically, every 2 or 3 star review on this site says it all.  Storyline?  So bad it makes you cringe.  Play control?  Absolutely God-awful.  Music?  Cheesy as heck.  Flow of the game?  Unorganized and jerky.The voice acting on the game is akin to nails on a chalkboard.  Sonic sounds at times like a clueless stoner and at other times like a used car salesman.  The Genie takes the cake as the most annoying character in the game.  Just hearing her voice gives me chills.  After the first 3 or 4 cutscenes, I started skipping them.  The game's tutorial is mandatory, which I LOATHE because it's honestly NOT that necessary and makes for a slow and tedious start to the game.I know the Wii remote is central to the Wii system, but this game would be much easier with a regular controller.  Flinging the remote forward to perform an attack is absurd.  Due to the Wii sensor bar's limited capabilities (come on, don't say you haven't noticed with other games), the attack works 75% of the time.  Sonic jumps when you release the 2 button, not when you press it.  This makes for some frustrating timing issues in a game where you're constantly moving forward, and it's unnecessarily so.  The game's levels do not flow (especially during the tutorial) so you get to do a short level, then it loads, then you get 2 or 3 pop-ups saying you got a new ability, then it loads, then you get back to the menu and do it all again.  Sonic starts off moving so slowly it's agonizing, and when you accidentally hit a wall, you start at a glacial pace again.  The music sounds like a bad episode of Pokemon.  I could go on and on!It's sad, really, because the game COULD be good if it weren't for the HORRIBLE play control and flow.  Please, I beg you, rent the game before you buy.

Now available in black and complete with a charging cable and rechargeable battery pack, the Xbox 360 Play and Charge Kit is all you need to juice up your Xbox 360 Wireless Controller&#x2014;even in the midst of battle.","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Never need batteries again!","reviewText":"First, I'd like to say I play my xbox in a very different way than most people. I use a tv capture card and play the xbox right on my computer by connecting an hdmi line to the capture card.With that in mind, I'm in very close proximity with the xbox. Unlike the PS3 and perhaps older gamecube and ps2, the xbox 360 controller requires batteries and is always wireless connected.  I think given my close proximity I don't require such wireless connection. So in come this. My goal is to basically have a wired connection to my xbox unit and don't have needs for swapping out batters. Sort of like the ps3 where you simply plug the controller into a usb charger, connect it to the ps3 and you got a constantly charged connection.Basically this allows me to keep my controller plugged into the usb port and I am able to always have battery power. Now, I have noticed some of the negative things said here to be true. Let me first explain what I experienced. First the charging cable doesn't stick onto the controller very well. It means that it's very easy to drop the line connecting to the usb cord because the line gets severed. Now, comes the issue I notice that most people complain about: the battery doesn't hold charge. Well to be honest in my personal experience, it appears to be random. Sometimes if the line disconnects, it indicates full battery power and doesn't pause the game asking me to reconnect the controller. Other times, when the line disconnects, it acts as if the battery is totally dead even though I may have been playing for a few hours. It seems very random and I can't quite figure out what the deal is or the reason behind it. What I do know is that it doesn't appear to hold charge that long.This is a minor annoyance to me since I am very close to the xbox unit right on the computer. However, I think if you're a player who likes sitting at a distant and require the wireless connection, this might be a factor you'd want to consider. Given my circumstances, I give it a four star purely because I can finally play unlimited without fear of having to buy new battery supplies.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2013"}

Opposing characters are regulary relieved of appendages in a slow motion view that shows how much damage is being done.

This is where the somtimes wonky controls raise the annoyance level and bring the game to a screeching halt until the player figures out how to get past that part of the game, (my favorites: the gun turrets when you lose our powers, chasing gambit and some of the flash back levels, grr)once thats accomplished its back to the bashing and the fun.Overall I do recommend this game, just beaware that it does have some rough patches","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-18-2009"}

This game is quite a bit like any of the Far Cry games, in the sense that you can choose between a straightforward action packed gun battle, which you will lose for sure if you play on Delta difficulty, or a stealthier slow approach to enemy fights. The game's story is pretty decent for most military FPS games and sets you up for an amazing series and it's crazy fun too.The Story:- You are a member of the U.S. Special Ops and your squad of Nanosuit soldiers are sent to rescue a group of archaeologists being held captive by the North Korean Army. Quickly things do not go as planned for your mission, as your squadron deploys into enemy territory, all of your parachutes/nanosuits malfunction and your squad is dispersed all over the island. You meet up with one of your people and you two go looking for another one of your people. As you get close, you discover that there is a North Korean Patrol in that area, but then they get attacked by something. You rush into the place only to fight them dismember and so is your squad member.The Pros:- The game has the right balance for a game that seems open-world. By the time you finish a mission, you will sort of be tired of the landscape, and the next mission takes you to a new landscape to explore.- The choice of being stealthy or being in an all out gun battle is fun, if you get bored of one style you can switch (granted your not playing Delta difficulty, you die in one shot pretty much).- The graphics still look decent (that was before I played Titanfall though)- The nanosuit itself is a unique weapon and amazing weapon.- The story is very good, like I said before, for a military FPS.The Cons:- Walking takes forever, running is alright, but annoying because it's based on your suit's battery life which is better spent on other uses.- You can't really tell the difference in using the different machine guns and assault rifles. They have the same modes, semi or automatic.- Not enough secondary missions, I'm one of the people who likes alot besides just the main story. Just seems like they gave up towards the end.- Ending is predictable.- Delta difficulty is ridiculously hard (not really a con, I don't mind a challenge normally, but when it takes an hour just to make it to the next checkpoint, its crazy ridiculous)Other:- I got all 1000G in one playthrough on Delta difficulty. I don't recommend playing any other way than stealthy on this level of difficulty, as the enemies notice you in a millisecond and it takes one shot pretty much to kill you.- Any achievements requiring kills carry over even if you start a new game, even if you die they count.- You can only get this game off the Xbox Live Marketplace (for Xbox 360)Buy this game if:- You've played any of the Crysis games already and want to see how it started.- You have enjoyed any of the Far Cry series.- If you're up for a challenge play on Delta difficulty","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2014"}

Never Looked SO Good","reviewText":"I am a fan of just about every game that involves racing.  From track racing games like Gran Turismo to more open racing games like Need for Speed and Burnout.  I was excited at the thought of being able to play an open world recreation of Los Angeles.  From everything I heard the graphics and environments would be based off of GTA IV.  After giving this game a try I must actually say it exceeds my expectations.There is a fine line in racing games.  Having races that are not too complicated to traverse and then having competition that won't blow over you.  Games like Burnout can generally be easy if you learn the dynamics of that game.  With Midnight Club it can be a bit more challenging.  Although I say that in a good way.  The overall challenge in this game is excellent and keeps opponents close all the time.  Learning how to drive is simple and the controls are tight.  With Midnight Club you will find yourself getting frustrated a little at the close loses, that just makes winning all the better.  Most of the races are based on checkpoints and you may have a single competitor or several.  Everything in this game is dynamic.  Meaning weather can change abruptly just as it may in L.A. and time of day is always changing.  That creates added challenges to the game.  The game will give you the opportunity to choose the difficulty of many races.  I find it good to start off slow and learn your car while challenging lesser opponents.Now let me talk about the graphics which are simply amazing.  I found myself crossing many familiar landmarks which were neat to see.  The game seems to have improved graphics over GTA.  And for PS3 owners there is no install which makes getting into the game that much quicker.  The game moves very smooth with no hiccups.  I was quite impressed at the realistic environments they did create.  Don't expect L.A. point for point.  You will get a shrunk down version of the big city.Customization is one of the biggest selling points of the Midnight Club series.  This version won't let you down.  You have the opportunity to skillfully upgrade your ride.  From non discrete to an obvious racer.  As you further progress in the game you will get more upgrades unlocked.  Also you can customize your cars paint job.  Once you think you have a great looking ride you can show it off online.  This is really a nice bonus since it lets others rate your ride.The extra goodies Midnight Club Los Angeles has are police chases.  Thankfully your car has a radar which can keep you out of too many pursuits.  If you pull over in a pursuit you can once again take off leaving the police to chase.  Although you better be good or they will get you.  The PS3 version also has added trophy support which is a nice addition for those who like extra challenges.Overall Midnight Club Los Angeles is a top notch game.  From the races to the customization.  It's all here.  I would not advise this game for everyone.  If you like a challenge and consider yourself a race pro then give it a try.  Just try not to enjoy the scenery too much.  This game is the perfect package.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-22-2008"}

No eject or power buttons (which drives me freaking nuts).Bottom line: Buy it for Pete's sake! There's even a mail in rebate from time to time that makes the thing free (if you buy an xbox between certain dates).Oh, yeah... you might just want to use the plug in part and program your TV's universal remote, using RCA's codes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2002"}

Includes a DVD remote control and an infrared receiver that plugs into an Xbox controller port.Note: this item is required for DVD movie playback on Xbox.","reviewerName":"Gadgester \"No Time, No Money\"","summary":"Turn Xbox into a first-rate DVD player","reviewText":"When I bought my Xbox I did not know it is actually an excellent DVD player capable of progressive scan.  When I had a Playstation 2 I thought the DVD playback there was a sore joke; Sony had cut too many corners in playback quality and playing DVDs with the PS2 controller was an exercise in patience.  I received the Xbox DVD controller as a gift...The remote itself is light-weight and very easy to use.  I wish there were an eject button, but even my mom, who never touched any remote controls, can use this one without any problems.  (She really likes the green buttons.)  After two weeks I gave my DVD playback kit to my college-age cousin and bought another one for myself.  Excellent product.  Well worth the money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-24-2002"}
{"product_name":"B000EPP6UA","description":"In Resident Evil 4 you'll know a new type of horror, as the classic survival-horror action returns with all-new characters, controls and storylines. We last saw Leon S. Kennedy in Resident Evil 2 - a rookie cop in Raccoon City, fighting to stay alive. That was six years ago. Since then, government forces have managed to control the zombie threat and Leon has become a Federal agent. When the President's daughter is kidnapped, Leon tracks her to a remote, hidden fortress in Europe - where he'll relive the horror he faced six years before.   Players will face never-before-seen enemies that make Nemesis seem like a kitten. You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","reviewerName":"Movieskinny \"WayneG\"","summary":"Rez4 is great game play","reviewText":"I've played this game on Platstation2 and it is excellent, but does not have the super visuals of the PC version. You do not need a game guide to play this game! It is fairly linear and easy to move from area to area.It has an amazing amount of boss battles that are demanding, but not impossible. Sometimes the hoards of zombies from the various villages or castles can be very challenging. If you've played the other incarnations of these games, the zombies or foes came in very small bunches, and usually in cramped or clostrophic hallways. The environments in Rez4 are far more open with waves of killer creations coming at you from behind, sides, and frontal assault.If you liked Half Life or Far Cry games, you WILL like this game. You definitely need to think at every turn. THE NEGATIVES, which actually aren't! I played this on PS2 semi-concurrently while doing it on PC. I finished the PS2 version first. My Logitech Rumble Pad 2 would not allow for thumbstick usage at all, no problem. Made it more challenging! The zoom on the rifle scope would not work at all. You had to do the jerky direction buttons to move the scope or any weapon aiming, no problem, just made it a little tougher. I don't know if the Logitech game pad software is bad or Rez4 software is bad, but it worked enough. Direction buttons are more responsive at times than the sloppy joystick. OK, I do remember when I first loaded the PC version and dialed it up, and thought I could super snipe my way through this game with a mouse and keyboard, but I got over it quick!!This game has replayability factor written all over it. You even get to buy an unlimited rocket launcher from the mysterious weapon vendor. You need to get over being spoiled by the easy mouse and keyboard system. Get a Logitech Rumble Pad with this game and you'll love the challenge of playing the ultimate Resident Evil game ever made. It just dawned on me, the control scheme worked out to be exactly like a PS1 controler with no joystick at all.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"zeb alford","summary":"Goldeneye is &quot;smashing&quot;","reviewText":"Goldeneye lookes like just another shootem up game, but it is more than that.

{"product_name":"B000034DMG","reviewerName":"Disintegration","summary":"Masterpiece in horror gaming...","reviewText":"Without a doubt, RE2 is the greatest horror/ action game ever made. The first one was good, but took place mainly in a mansion. RE2 spans out across a city, including areas like a sewer, police station, and even a laboratory. Graphically this game is beautiful for its time and holds its own today. The cut scenes were amazing when it came out, and still look fantastic. The voiceovers are also fantastic, and are very memorable. Many of the cut scenes are done with the games normal graphics, and this looks great as well. I actually didnt play it till the N64 version game out, but it was still amazing. I remember seeing the trailer when it came out for ps1 and I was thinking how amazing the graphics and realism was. Even the little things make such big differences, such as empty shells being released from a gun after shooting it. The game B mode is revolutionary, allowing you to have up to 4 endings. And the Tyrant is the scariest video game character i have ever seen. You never know when he is going to bust down a wall and jump at you, and his theme music is amazingly scary as well. The first time you shoot him down, after you leave the room you see a cutscene of the Tyrant getting up, and his theme music starts to play, that is arguably the scariest moment I have experienced with a video game. Many consider Silent Hill to be the scariest game, but I disagree, I think RE2 is. RE2 envolks emotions you thought couldnt have happened. Having two characters is the best thing about this game, though, each having different puzzles and weapons, and meeting new characters. Overall, this is the greatest horror action game I have ever played, and you should definitely play it as well.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2005"}

Anyone vaguely familiar with Mario's past will instantly recognize the cast of characters and items. You intrinsically know that mushrooms are good, that flowers spout fire, and that pipes lead to warp areas. The levels are colorful and smartly designed. The story is delivered with a good dose of humor, taking occasional potshots at Mario's past. The familiarity of the world is one of the game's greatest assets, and Nintendo does a great job keeping its tradition alive.This also means that there is very little in the way of surprise here, as the game still relies on just too many tired clich?. If you're surprised by a plot twist in this game, you're probably eating mushrooms again and should have your head examined.Still, Paper Mario is a fun game and stands head and shoulders above most of the dreck the N64 offers these days. Though it gets a bit cute at times, most gamers should find hours of satisfaction in Mario's homecoming. Let's just hope he doesn't let it get to his head...the last thing we need is Mario eating too many mushrooms and singing about LSD, like Captain Kirk...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2004"}

Let me tell you, I was happy with my choice. I loved everything about it. I played for about 10 hours every day (I'm not kidding about that), and finished it before my rental period was over. I'm glad I managed that feat, because otherwise I would have wept when it was time to return it.The worlds you'll travel to are so cool. I found myself exploring a giant toybox, a colorful garden, and a gorgeous desert palace, among many other environments. Since I didn't use a strategy guide, I was constantly wondering what would come next.As I travelled the extensive world, I met many party members who would help me out, both in battle and in puzzles and exploration. Each partner has their own distinctive combat abilities, puzzle solving skill, and personality. For example, Watt, a sweet, good-natured sun ball that joins you in the Shy Guy Toy Box, can use electric shocks to attack in battle, and you can also use her to light up dark rooms. Parakarry, a distracted mail deliveryman, used dive-bomb attacks and could fly me across short gaps. The list goes on and on.The combat system is a mix of action and RPG elements. You select commands from a menu to attack, but if you time your button presses carefully, you can do a lot of extra damage. Press A just as you rebound from your jump to do a double-jump; Rapidly flick the control stick to build power for a dive bomb; each attack has its own button combination, so you won't get bored.Outside of combat, you can level up your HP and FP (FP are like MP), collect badges that make you more powerful, find Super Blocks to grant your partners new moves, and, most importantly, solve the perfectly-done puzzles. Each puzzle makes perfect sense; if you look carefully, you'll always find a way to solve it with a combination of you and your partners' abilities.Finally, there are some little extras that can really make a difference. The graphics are bright and colorful, and look great even today; they make even minor characters memorable. There are a few sidequests, such as delivering letters and collecting Star Fragments to earn new badges. And after every world you complete, you'll get to play a short interlude where you control Princess Peach. It's these bells and whistles that really make the game unique and fun.Buy this game immediately. It may be on a last-gen system, but the masterful gameplay and pure fun are timeless.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-02-2005"}
