{"product_name":"B000R2XJJK","reviewerName":"quickster","summary":"Pretty fun","reviewText":"I played this through chapter 2 and lost interest. There is alot to it and it kept my interest until I realized that some of the quests are outright boring. I really wanted to like this game, but the dialog is boring. The dialog option you get to choose do not flow well with the conversation. The game is very buggy as well. Save a lot because it will crash. There was a part when I just kept going up to this gate and I got some dialog and then the game camera was stuck, I couldn't do anything...I gave up after that. It seems that developers need to fix a few things still as I am playing the newest version. The fun part is the fighting and building your character. The stat tree is kinda cool. Making potions from herbs is cool. I wish they would have made more of a way to blacksmith. You only get to switch between 1 piece of armor. The game is just kinda boring. I bet it was pretty darn cool back in 2007 though.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"Best Pirate-Ninja Game Ever!","reviewText":"Have you ever wanted to be a Pirate with Ninja Skills?  Look no further!  Assassin's Creed Black Flag is the best Pirate game of all time!Story: 10/10You are Edward Kenway, a privateer who looks for easy riches as he steals the identity of a Royal Messenger and gets drawn into the war between Assassins and Templars and the world of piracy on the high seas.  Throughout the adventure, you meet famed pirates like Blackbeard, Black Bart, Charles Vane, and others as you assemble your crew and sail into the pages of history.  The story is well told through in game cinematics featuring great dialogue, memorable characters, and interesting plot twists.Gameplay: 10/10The Single Player Gameplay of Assassin's Creed Black Flag is broken up into 6 major parts: Simple Stealth, Assassinating, Ship Battles, Diving, Harpooning, and Fleet Management.The Stealth is incredibly easy, but the variety of options available to you prevents the game from being boring.  Many of the missions require you to follow enemies, hide out in one place and eavesdrop, sneak up on a victim and kill them, infiltrate a warehouse and steal the goods, or follow other characters to a secret lair.  You can hide in bushes, hide in trees, on rooftops, behind objects, blend into crowds by standing near others.  The only way to get caught is if you stand out in the open for a long period of time or attack someone in the open.  While you are hiding, you're free to knock out or kill enemies in your path and loot them for cash and supplies.Assassinating an enemy is also easy.  Hide near them and kill them with a sword, a hidden blade, or even a blow dart.  If you're caught by enemies, the combat is straightforward.  Press A to knock an enemy off balance and break their guard, Press or Hold B to parry, Press X to attack with a weapon combo, and press Y to use a special weapon: Pirate gun, blow dart, smoke bomb, etc.  If you're having trouble, button prompts appear onscreen to tell you what to do.  If you know how to play, the combat is also very easy.The Ship Battles in the game are amazingly good and it builds on the Ship Combat introduced in Assassin's Creed III.  Your ship has armor, side cannons, exploding barrels that can be dropped from behind, chain shot fired from the front, mortars, and a special ram dash.  All of these things can be upgraded multiple times.  Hunting down a ship is easy.  Look through your telescope and you'll see how powerful the enemy ship is and what it is carrying.  When you see one that you want, you attack it.For most of your ship's weapons, the Left Trigger Aims and the Right Trigger Fires.  The weapon that you fire determines where you are looking.  If an enemy ship is in front of you and you are looking that way, you fire your chain guns from the front.  If they're on the sides, you fire your broadside cannons.  If they are behind you and you are looking back at them, you drop explosive barrels into the sea.  Once you damage an enemy ship, you can press Y to fire swivel guns for additional damage.  They auto aim, so you just have to press and hold the Y button.  When enemies fire, you hold X and your crew braces themselves to take less damage.  At times, you may have to fight 5 enemy ships at a time.  If you know what you're doing, the battles are really fun!  The weather also affects the battle.  More wind leads to larger waves and they'll affect your aim.  If the waves are high enough, they even block your cannonballs.  When you deplete the health bar of an enemy ship, they are capsized and from there you have two options.Attack it or ram it again to sink it.  You get half the loot and some additional crew members you fish out of the ocean.  Or, you can board it.  Hold the X button and your crew throws grappling hooks to bring the ships closer together.  While this is happening, you can man a swivel gun and take 5 shots to weaken the enemy forces.  The larger the enemy ship, the more difficult it is to capture.  You may have to kill 5, 10, 15, or 20 enemies.  You may have to climb the main mast and cut down their flag.  You may have to detonate some powder kegs, kill the Captain, kill a few officers, or climb a mast and kill their musket scouts.  When you board, the combat is just like it is on land.  Use combos, guns, smoke bombs, etc.  to kill the enemies.  Once you complete the objectives, the enemy surrenders.When you take control of their ship, you have 3 options: You can salvage what you can from it and sink it to instantly repair your ship.  You can spare their miserable lives and reset your \"Wanted Level.\"  Attacking ships raises your wanted level over time, the higher it gets, the game spawns more powerful  hunter ships to come after you, so it's a good move if you don't want to be bothered.  OR you can add the ship to your fleet and perform simple mini-games to collect more cash over time.At certain points on the map, you see a shipwreck.  You can use a diving bell and explore the ruins.  Return to the diving bells for air when you start to run out of breath as you explore.  If you're lucky, you find special plans that allow you to unlock the highest upgrades for your ship.  However, guarding the treasure are sharks, eels, jellyfish, rays, and urchins.  If you are in the open for an extended amount of time, a shark will attack.  You can hide from the sharks in the ruins or in beds of seaweed.  But you can't hide for too long because you will run out of air.  If you die, you keep what you found and can return to your ship at any time.  Because this isn't overly punishing, it's kind of fun.Harpooning is easy and fun.  You can upgrade some of your gear by obtaining 2 great white shark skins, 2 killer whale skins, etc.  To kill them, you head to a shark or whale icon on the map.  You begin in a small boat with a certain number of harpoons and you see your prey.  As it swims near the surface, you hit the creature with a harpoon which is connected to your boat by a rope.  When the barbed harpoon hits your target, it pulls the small whaling boat through the water.  While the creature is pulling the boat, you can hit it with more non-roped harpoons to deliver extra damage.  After a certain amount of time, the rope breaks and the creature charges your boat.  If you hit it with a harpoon as it charges, it will turn away.  If not, your boat takes damage and if it takes too much, it sinks.  You aim your harpoons with the analog stick and hold one button down to ready your throw.  As you ready your throw, your aim becomes more accurate and damaging.  When the creature takes enough damage, it dies and it's hauled up to your ship.The game also has a Fleet Management Minigame, using the ships that you capture.  You see trade routes, difficulties, and a percentage of surviving the mission.  You can send ships on the routes for cash, or use your heavily armed ships to attack enemy ships on the routes, making them safer for your weaker ships.  The battles are simple tactical battles.  You pick 1-3 of your ships to fight the enemy. Your first pick gets a speed boost, your second does more damage, and your last gets an armor boost.  Once the battle begins, all of the ships auto attack based on their speed.  The AI on both sides pick their targets and once the battle starts, the only thing you can do to control it is to drop a barrel bomb on a random enemy ship.  Your bombs are damaging, but limited.  If you pick tougher ships than your enemy, you should win easily.  The trade route missions are passive and take minutes to long hours to finish.  When the mission timer expires, you are awarded a bunch of cash.Upgrades: 8/10The Upgrade Systems are similar to FarCry 3.  Hunt 2 specific animals and you get your upgrade.  You can improve the damage and carrying capacity for your special weapons.  If you don't want to hunt, you can buy the skins at a high price from a trader.  For example, you may need to jaguar skins to upgrade your health max.  So, you go to the jungle and kill, then skin 2 cats.  Go to your upgrade menu and select the upgrade to improve your max health bar.  It's that simple.  Also, there are different ways to upgrade your health bar and you don't have to do them in order.  Each Health Upgrade or Ammo Upgrade can be accomplished independently of others.  So, you can complete Health Upgrade 3 before you do 1 and 2 if you have the necessary components.You can also upgrade your outfits, your swords, and pistols.  It's really easy to get the \"best gun\" and \"best swords\" about a third of the way into the game.  But you'll be spending most of your pilfered loot on ship upgrades.  In order to upgrade your ship, you'll need cash and supplies like wood, metal, and cloth.  You get these supplies by raiding other ships, which is Great Fun!  The beauty of the upgrade systems in AC Black Flag is that every action you perform usually rewards you in some way.  All of the missions give you cash, piracy gives you cash and supplies, hunting gives you cash and animal parts, and exploring the city will get you cash and more pirate songs for your crew.  If you don't feel like hunting or whaling, it's ok, you can take your cash and buy the skins that you need for upgrades.  This allows you to focus on the parts of the game that you enjoy the most.  Also, some of your accomplishments in Single Player unlock cosmetic items in Multi-Player, so you're constantly being rewarded for playing.The World: 10/10It's incredibly easy to get anywhere you want in Assassin's Creed Black Flag.  If you capture any fort or have been to a location, you may fast travel there.  If you are on shore and want to insta-travel back to your ship, just find a rowboat along the shore and press B.  You can also fast travel to any synchronized tower on land, too.  The islands are also fairly small and the naval objectives are easy to get to, so you never have to travel for a long time.  When you are sailing at top speed, the camera pulls back and your crew sings famous pirate songs called shanties.  You collect these in towns as pages blowing on the wind.  If you catch one, your crew learns the song and sings it when you sail.Graphics: 10/10The world is beautifully rendered and who doesn't want to look at the Caribbean Islands all day?  The characters look great and animate fluidly.  The serene beaches, stormy seas, and lush jungles also add a great deal to the atmosphere of the game.Sound: 10/10The dialogue is well acted, the background music adds to the intensity of the game, and the battle effects really make the combat feel alive.Multiplayer: 10/10Assassin's Creed Multiplayer is back and they've added a Game Lab, where you can play designer and create your own multiplayer games with their own parameters and release it to the public!  There are also a ton of unlockables, perks, upgradeable abilities, and the game modes have all been polished!  The basic gist of the game is to blend into crowds and assassinate other characters, while you avoid being assassinated yourself!  The quality of your kills is more important than the number of your kills.Replay Value: 10/10You can blow through the campaign in about 20 hours, or 50 if you want to fully upgrade everything and have fun with all of the side missions and activities.  If you like Multiplayer, there's another 100 hours of fun there, too!Maturity:  MThere's swearing, piracy, drinking, wenches, adult themes, and pirate violence.  This isn't for kids, but it doesn't have anything horrifying or gory that will scar you for life either.Overall:  10/10Although it's very easy, Assassin's Creed Black Flag is a Great Game.  It's fun to play through the adventure and you feel great doing it!  The story, characters, gameplay, upgrade system, and mini-games are all really easy to learn and reward you instead of punishing you.  With an arsenal of assassin's tools at your disposal, it's up to you how you complete the objectives.  The game is also full of small perks that make you happy.  Did you know that your crew cheers when you take the wheel?  There's nothing quite like a crew of maniacs cheering and singing for their captain as you plunder the high seas.  The collectibles also tie back into your upgrades, too.  So, no matter what you do, it feels like you are progressing through the game!  If you ever wanted to be a pirate, you'll love this game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2014"}

Starting with Smackdown 1 for PS, and up to now with Smackdown Just Bring it, THQ is always making improvements. Ofcourse there is no perfect wrestling game. There are some flaws, but unlike some people, you HAVE to look past them.The GOOD: The Entrances are great. The characters look as close to the wrestlers as they are going to in a video game. The finishing moves are all there, even up to the &quot;Last Ride&quot;. There are also TONS of different matches to play. TLC, Ladder, I Quit, Tags, Intergender, Hell in a Cell, and on and on. There's also &quot;Slobber Knocker&quot; mode, which is my favorite. You pick a superstar and attempt to KO, or Pin as many wrestlers as possible in the 10 minute time frame. Finishers almost always result in an immediate victory which keeps it moving along.Also, as was a flaw in previous Smackdown games, the finisher (when earned correctly) ALWAYS leads to a pin, rather than the computer kicking out of 2 straight stunners. The story mode? You have more control over where the story goes, by picking what to say/do in certain situations (whether or not to challenge someone etc)  So what could be bad about this game??Negatives: The announcing is truly rediculous. However, no big deal. Ignore it. It's the only thing wrong with this game. Some people are WAY too critical of video games. They are meant to be fun, not to be perfect.

Taegel","summary":"Flawed, but Some Good B-Movie Fun","reviewText":"From reviews I've read, it sounds like the XBOX 360 version of this game is more fun: better graphics & more zombies and NO FREAKING PARROTS.  Argh.  The parrots get pretty annoying.  But I digress.DEADRISING is one of those games that's pretty fun to play, but the gameplay gets a little bit repetitive.  The missions and the scenery don't change very much throughout the game, and fairly quickly you've explored all there is to explore.The game vainly tries to compensate for its lack of an interesting story by having cutscenes that drag on for too long.  Not only that, but these scenes include laughably overwrought acting and silly, on the nose dialogue.  I know it's just a video game, but come on!The fact is, (and without giving too much away) at the point where you think the game is (finally) about to explore some new territory and provide more diverse challenges, it's all of a sudden over.  And the ending is not at a particularly dramatic or satisfying point either.  It's almost as if the game developers ran out of time or money and decided to just quit.  I will support this by saying (again, without giving too much away) that the whole setup -- the diabolical scheme that we're supposed to thwart never gets confronted or thwarted.  (like if you were watching a movie, and the villain said, \"Muah ha!  I've planted a nuclear bomb in the Capitol Building, and you'll never get there in time!\"  So the hero rushes to the Capitol Building, but halfway there the movie ends abruptly).  Like our hypothetical movie, the scenario of certain impending doom gets dismissed rather lamely with a few title cards at the end.  I suppose it could be a setup for Dead Rising 2, but mostly it feels abrupt and forced.All that being said, it's still a pretty cool game, and there's lots of fun to be had.  The controls are intuitive, and the diverse weaponry (chainsaws, toy light sabers, lawn movers) fun to use to slay thousands of zombies.*NOTE: If you haven't played RESIDENT EVIL 4, get that first/instead.  Resident Evil 4 is an awesome game.  It uses the same engine, has a more compelling story that feels less repetitive, betters graphics and a far richer world.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2009"}

Let's begin with the story; wait, what story?  There is some nonsensical plot with poorly done cutscenes that are excruciatingly painful to watch making the best move in this game the \"R2\" and \"select\" buttons because you don't want to sit through all that drivel.  But story-telling is overrated these days, so let's just concentrate on getting the target audience what they want--gratuitous sexual poses and moves.  Got plenty of leg spreading, bending over, clothes dropping, dancing moves that would make a showgirl jealous.  Oh, and since making a hacknslash game just about hacking and slashing just doesn't cut it these days, why not throw in some absurd motorcycle racing that defy physics and a Space Harrieresk section (as described by another reviewer) with inverted controls--real swell.  And if you choose to play this on the PS3, the load times are quite noticeable, perhaps to give your soon-to-be arthritic hands a break.  Yes, I did download the patch and can't imagine what it was like before it.But not all is lost, the core gameplay is very good.  It has definitely the most advanced fighting system in the genre.  Just be ready to button mash because there is plenty of it.  Even with skill, you will still need to button mash through all the kill moves and QTEs laced throughout the game.  And the difficulty may be too high for some.  If you've never passed any of the Ninja Gaiden games, then you'll definitely be in for a challenge.  But don't worry, you'll have plenty of time to cool off while the game reloads after your death.In conclusion, if you want a good hacknslash that defies convention in a pubescent sort of way, then look no further than this latest installment of The Never Ending Story, because the story refuses to end, just as a 12-year-old would have it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00005ATSN","description":"One of the most highly esteemed digital adventures is back on your Game Boy Color console in two new games:Oracle of AgesandOracle of Seasons. Both are independent games, but when they're linked between two Game Boy Color consoles via the separately sold Game Link cable, players can share items, uncover story elements, and unlock hidden areas in each game.Using the Harp of Ages, Link must travel through time and space to save Nayru, the eponymous prophet inOracle of Ages, who's been kidnapped by the evil sorceress Veran. By learning new melodies to play on the harp, players will travel to the past and affect changes in the present to solve the game's varied puzzles.InOracle of Seasons, players help Link embark on a quest to recover the Essences of Nature. To do so, he must first find the Rod of Seasons, a magical item that lets Link transform the landscape into the season of his choice, helping him overcome obstacles and solve puzzles. Ricky the kangaroo, Moosh the winged bear, and Dimitri the dodongo accompany Link on this adventure.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Probably my favorite of the 2","reviewText":"It's strange reviewing Oracle of Ages since, fundamentally, it's the same as Seasons. Same gameplay style, graphical quality and a theme to the puzzles but in the end these games are like one large story cut in half. But at times I tend to be biased towards the series since it's probably my favorite game series period not just in gameplay-wise but since I've never played a Zelda that I didn't either love or at least like(don't even think about suggesting those CD-I ones) and Ages is in the love group....sounded cheesy to say but how else can I word it? Ages is excellent.Story: Each game requires you save a princess and this time it turns out to be Nayru, Oracle of Ages. The one behind this is Veran and she intends to write history so Link, with the help of a mystical harp, has to stop Veran and if you play a linked game, beat the true masters behind it all. It's not exactly the deepest story but I didn't even care since I got wrapped up in it anyway.Graphics: This is Game Boy Color but regardless there vibrant and colorful with certain locations looking great and really pushing what the GBC can pull off at the time. It's a minor nitpick but whereas the various seasons in its sister game where colorful and rich regardless if it was fall or spring, the different times here just look kinda...plain looking. But it helps differentiate the past and the present.Sound/Music: Music is of course excellent and even if it came out of tiny speakers, they're still hummable and well-composed music. And of course you should know by now there's no voice acting to speak of since this is the GBC and a Zelda game no less.Gameplay: In a way it's similar to Link to the Past where altering something in the past affects progression in the present. Go in the past and change something and next thing you know the present has a brand new thing you can use. While I love the season dynamic better, the time aspect is quite fun and even genius at times. One thing though: Ages is the more difficult and the reliance is more on the series' trademark puzzles rather than outright fighting so better do brain massages Mr Burns style if you're going to pass these brain busters.The unique feature of these 2 games is in its password feature: beat one and you get a password. Load the other and input the password and NPC's from here will recognize you there and even make you do quests to get awesome items. Not to mention there's an additional ending to get if you beat both games using a password. One gripe is that you at times feel like you have to go back and forth and can't really switch games on the fly.Odd to say but one reason I gravitated to Ages when I was younger was because Nayru was the hotter Oracle than Din was and I had to save this one. Strange no? But regardless overall this is probably my favorite even though the seasons changing is better than the time one. But still if you can track these down, definately pick them up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2006"}

FEAR definitely falls into the psychological thriller category.First, the situation. A compound is taken over by a military group in full body gear, led by an apparent vampire. Normal attempts to retake the area have failed, so you are sent in alone. It's just you against groups of these quite intelligent enemies. They'll work together, move around to flank you, take cover.Graphics are very smooth - you can watch as an enemy walks towards you, crouches down to get beneath an overhang, and stands as he continues to seek you out.  Peering around corners feels very natural, as does lurking in the shadows. There are dust motes in the air, shadows on the floors, holes shot out of walls.In addition to the \"natural\" events, there are also seamlessly built in unnatural ones. Was that a person who moved just out of the corner of your eye, or a ghost? Did you really glimpse something in the shadows or was it a vision? It ramps up the tension until you're jumping at the smallest of sounds, worried that it portends something nasty.The sound interweaves nicely with this. There are moments which are dead quiet, where every tiny footfall noise stands out. There are other moments when the bullets are flying and music is thrumming, that you know you have to shoot quick or be dead.Sometimes \"bullet time\" is awkward in a game, but it really worked in well in FEAR. It really gives the sense that you are caught up in the adrenaline and that your sense of time slows down. Anybody who's been in a real life adrenaline rush knows that feeling!There are some periods in the game which are just extended gun battles. I imagine that without these, some people would find the game \"boring\" - not enough shooting. Other people will find these long battles lose the tight-wrapped tension the rest of the game offers. I happen to be in the second camp, but I understand why game makers have to make these trade-offs.I especially like this being on the XBox 360 - with the combination of a large, widescreen TV and high end graphics. Play this late at night when the rest of the world is asleep, when you can pick out every small creak or strange noise. You can really get emotionally involved in the situation, which is the mark of any good drama.Be sure you understand this game is rated mature (there is a lot of nasty violence and swearing) and that it is meant to be very scary.

{"product_name":"B000067DPM","description":"Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republictakes place just a few years after the Mandolorian Wars, thousands of years before the events in the Star Wars movies we know and love. Two Jedi, master Revan and his apprentice Malak, led the Republic's forces to victory and pursued the Mandalorians into deep space only to return as Dark Jedi at the head of a huge fleet of Sith warships. Only the Force powers of the Jedi Bastila prevented the Sith from overwhelming the Republic's weakened forces. At the start of the game Malak has usurped control of the Sith by betraying Revan and has attacked the ship carrying Bastila and yourself. In true Star Wars style, the game begins with a bang.The storyline could have been a standard coming-of-age yarn but is instead a genuinely interesting adventure told with humor, compassion, and respect for the source material. Your character has a mystical bond with Bastila, and the two of you share some kind of connection to the Sith villains Darth Malak and Darth Revan. The game's planet-hopping adventures are driven by your exploration of these connections and how they relate to your larger goal of discovering the source of the Sith's sudden fleet. During your adventure you can explore side quests minor (such as racing swoops or gambling) and major (such as uncovering the fascinating back stories of your companions). Star Wars fans will get a kick out of the rich lore introduced in the game, particularly the Tatooine storyline that reveals the origin and history of the Sand People.Gameplay is an abbreviated form of Wizards of the Coast's d20 Star Wars RPG game system--anyone who has played Dungeons & Dragons will be familiar with the abilities, stats, feats, and bonuses in this game. The player creates a character as a member of one of three starting classes (soldier, smuggler, scout) and then later chooses a Jedi class (guardian, consular, sentinel). Joining the player's character are other Jedi, warriors, thieves, droids, a wookiee, and even a Mandolorian. Unlike the faceless non-player characters of other games, each member of the supporting cast has an intriguing history and even agenda. Up to two of these other characters can join your character at any time. Depending on who you chose to take with you, new dialogue and even intra-party arguments come into the game (put the Mandalorian veteran with the Republic patriot and you'll see sparks fly). Combat is real-time turn-based, meaning the turns are seamless but the player has the option of pausing the action at any time to issue orders or direct any character to use a certain Force power, ability, feat, or item.Graphics range from adequate to exceptional. Building and character models are not impressive--about what you get inGTA 3. Lightsaber graphics and environmental effects (like waving grass, clouds, and weather) bring the world to life. Battles are just brilliant, with characters pumping out blaster fire at Jedi who dash, dodge, and even deflect the bolts back toward their assailants. Complete with sounds straight out of the movies, the thrilling combat is pure Star Wars.All in all,Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republicis a masterpiece of Star Wars gaming. The pacing, balance of action and dialogue, clever puzzles and quests, and loving attention to detail have set the bar very high for role-playing games in general and Star Wars games in particular. Consider this a must-have game.--Mike FehlauerPros:Captivating storylineClever dialogueStar Wars feelTrue story and dialogue support for either Light Side or Dark Side playBrilliant combat graphicsFascinating characters (the loyal--and homicidal--droid HK-47 is truly unique)Cons:Occasional bugs in dialogue, movie playbackCannot transfer equipped gear between characters while on your ship","reviewerName":"mom to 3 boys","summary":"No idea what RPG means","reviewText":"I could careless about 1st person view, graphic, sounds, etc... I was just looking for another Star Wars game to add to my collection --Battlefront I & II, Lego star wars, episode III  and after reading the great reviews about knight of republic I bought it and it is nothing like I thought it would be...When you encounter an enemy, it is not like other games where you hit A or the X button a bunch of time until they die. In this game when you see an enemy the screen will freeze and you have to pick the attack you want to perform and the order you want to perform it. And after you make your selection you can actually put the controller down--really don't touch it-- and your person will kill the enemy all on its own while you watch, which sounds easy until you get higher up in the game. If you don't pick the right action your dead in seconds. If you are use to knowing that you failed at killing the enemy just because you didn't hit my A button enough times. Then with this game you won't be disappointed if you failed it's because you didn't use the right weapon or you didn't load the right armor or you should have picked different actions...... there are endless reasons.There are so Many menu, so Many option, so Many things you have to change, adjust, upgrade which I know other people just love. But I don't spend hours on ended playing video games, so it's a little tough on me finding the time to fininsh it, because with this game you need at least 4 hours just figuring out the menus.One good thing about this game you really do have to use your Mind, if your looking for a game where you just walk forward and kill something this is Not it. If your looking for a game that requires you to read, make choices and will consume hours out of your day because it will take forever figuring out what to do next, then this is the game you want!!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-20-2006"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Ryan Pritchard \"thor_oakenfelder\"","summary":"it has its ups and downs","reviewText":"I started playing this game after I had already completed reach and played hours of online with Reach, so maybe my opinion is swayed by that. Anyway, to this game. It's dark. like super dark, some areas are black with shades of black. That may be overstating it a little, but I think if you go in thinking you won't see anything, then you might feel like it's visible enough. I was not a fan of the new VISR mode. Even when used in blackout situations, it doesn't really illuminate as much as highlight. I got tired of playing wireframe graphics in the 80's so I could really have done with a better night vision. Especially since 70% of the game is played in dark areas.The mood of the story is tense. I had to think a lot more than run and gun what with the lack of motion tracker and the limited ammo available. It does really change the way you play when you are given such limited options for weapons. Trying to figure out what's going on in the game and in the story worked well enough, after all, you shouldn't always have it handed to you on a platter.The characters were interesting enough, if a little too comical for what had been a very staid and serious series. But these characters were background jokers in Halo 3, so it makes sense that they are in this game as well. It's strange to have such vocal main characters after playing the other games in this series.The music is eerie. Not in a bad way, just in a way that sets it apart interestingly from the soundtracks of the other games.The open environment was cool. I only wish I could have seen more of it. Given more ammo and brighter environments, I could have spent hours just wandering around the maps killing covies. As it was, I just wanted to get to the story flashbacks that occured in the day, so I could see where I was going.I haven't done much with the multiplayer, since Reach is what all of my friends are playing, but I can see where it would be great if you didn't have reach.For me $20 was a good price to pay, but I would have been upset to get it at full price.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2010"}
{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"Shaun L. Stoffer","summary":"Halo ODST: Not what I was hoping for","reviewText":"The campaign consisted of around eight levels that were all together around ten hours of acutal gameplay depending on what difficulty level you choose to play, for me, I always start out with normal for my first playthrough then work my way up to legendary. I played co-op whenever I had one of my friends over, who's a Halo fanatic, and we cleared the first five levels on heroic in about 2.5-3 hours.You play from the perspectives of a group of soldiers and switch between them at the start of each mission. One mission in particular I found suprisingly boring and annoying, in it you must scavenge around different parts of a ruined city to find beacons that explain what happened there. This mission has eight parts and you must complete one at a time after you finish the actual missions. It felt like I was playing Prince of Persia or Tomb Raider, minus all the jumping and climbing, in the sense that the majority of the level was looking mindless roaming. Because of this, I didn't get to experience fighting a group of enemies every step of the way which is what I craved from the Halo series.Being able to dual wield was eliminated from the campaign for some odd reason, but you gained the ability to switch to basically a form of night vision at the touch of a button. With it, you can see and distinguish enemies, allies, and objectives fairly easier at night. Far from a fair trade, but better than nothing.Another thing I found frustrating was that if you finish half the game in co-op, you cannot continue the other half solo. Instead, you have to start over from mission one. Pointless.The music, graphics, even the story is all much darker than all the other previous Halo games. That's not to say that the sinister appeal was negative, but just not what you would expect from Halo.Getting all the map packs for Halo 3 on the second disk was nice to a certain extent. However, you don't actually get the downloads to save to your hard drive, the multiplayer is all on the second disc and you cannot store any of the map packs - which made me less than estatic. So if you were thinking about playing through the campaign once or twice, saving the map packs to your drive, and trading ODST in for $30 and just using your Halo 3 disc for the multiplayer - it ain't happening, sorry. This was, by far, my biggest issue with ODST.Therefore, if you paid $60 for ODST, you got ripped off. I paid $30 and would say that is a fair price but not worth a cent more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-08-2010"}

Many reviews peg the game time at 80 hours but don't worry:  A great portion of this is made up of those cinematic events!I've only completed the first 2 portions of the game but I am well impressed enough to provide ratings for this game:Graphics:  9/10The cinema events in this game will simply blow you away.  Keep in mind if you've seen the XBox 360 or PS3, you can't compare the graphics of the 2 systems (duh!).  But compare this game to other PS2 releases and I assure you the graphics hold up just fine to any other PS2 game, and in many cases far exceed them.  In battles, the special effects are impressive, from Shion's Ray attack to KOS-MOS R-Blade.  Tecmo defintely had a winner with the graphics from this game.Sound:  9/10The music often fits the mood of the situation perfectly.  I was definitely on the edge of my seat in the level where you are trying to evade the Gnomis without getting touched!  Now, my ONE gripe with this so far is the music doesn't change for bosses as it does with other RPG's.  This is slightly annoying but a minor complaint.Sound effects are right in place and very good.Presentation:  9/10So far, the game directs you well in where to go, but allows a lot of freedom on how to get there.  There are several paths, for example, you can take on the ship level to get around.Add in the email system, the ether system and the ability to extract skills from different items you can equip and you've got a very deep experience here.Lasting Appeal/Overall:  9.5/10If you are tired of ordinary RPG's and want something different, Xenosaga Episode 1 is definitely for you.  It can be had for around 10-15 bucks in most used game stores and is well worth the investment.  You'll definitely spend a lot of time exploring the game dynamics, which are very much in-depth both in battles and in strategy.This game does have some language (hence the \"T\" for teen) so if you happen to have a kiddie (8-12 or so) I'd be careful about this one.But if you've got a teenager (or you're a kid at heart) who loves RPG's and strategy, this is the game for you!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2008"}

Kallister","summary":"Stupendous!","reviewText":"Star Wars: Galaxies is one of the best MMORPG games I've played to date.  And I've played quite a few.  If you've ever wanted to immerse yourself within the boundaries of the Star Wars universe, wield blasters, fight alongside alien races, track down villans, or wanted to set up a shop and become a wealthy merchant, this game is right up your alley.Each character will be different from another.  Instead of just taking a single class profession, you will get to choose different professions within professions.  For example, a Brawler can be good with unarmed combat, or may choose to wield a weapon, such as a sword, or a polearm, or even an axe.  Artisans can delve into learning different creation traits, like specializing as a Weaponsmith or an Armorer.  Once you have gained enough experience, you can take your character from a basic class into an advanced class, which will let you develop even more different abilities than were available to you before.The gameplay itself is nice.  The screen and controls are very user-friendly and easy to understand.  The combat sequences are simple enough to understand, and instead of there being combat \"rounds\" like in traditional RPG's, your weapons will have specific recycle rates that allow you to attack after they finish.  For example, most times blaster pistols will allow you to attack every 4 seconds, while knives and daggers are somewhere around 3.7 seconds.The maps are absolutely gargantuan.  They're scaled to be a whopping 15 x 15 kilometers in size, and characters generally travel at a maximum rate of 5 meters per second.  If you were to go from the top of a map to the very bottom, it will take your character at least 50 minutes of real time to walk.  This leaves you with plenty of opportunities to explore, and to take on missions for experience and cash.Also, you're not limited to a single planet.  By using transport stations, you can go to other planets, such as Tatooine, Dantooine, Endor, Naboo, and many others not seen before in the movies.  Plus, future expansions promise more areas to explore, as well as combat in space!  Imagine yourself piloting an X-Wing or a TIE fighter.Of course, no game is without flaw.  The missions are far too difficult to do when you first start out, so making money becomes tedious as you do simple delivery missions within the city.  Most times, you should only take destroy missions with a group, and sometimes that can still be challenging.  Running around the map can get a bit too boring as well, since you'll have to spend 10 or more minutes in just transit time to reach a certain destination.  Fortunately, future updates promise to include personal speeders and animal mounts to correct that problem.  And lastly, the hostile \"mobs\" (mobile characters) get too ichy with their trigger fingers.  You have to be extremely careful to avoid them when travelling, or they'll kill you in a matter of seconds.Overall, though, Star Wars: Galaxies, is one of the best MMORPG's, if not games, out there.

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer \"kahohito\"","summary":"A pale shadow of the first game","reviewText":"I'll admit up front that I'm biased by my love of the first game.  That story was cinematic, that gameplay was fast and fun, and those graphics were incredible.  I pre-ordered the second game right away and just finished it.Where the first game was about the fall of a utopia and the corruption of the leaders involved in its creation (power corrupts, etc.), this game is about the attempted resurrection of that utopia by any means necessary, in this case the abduction of children, basically putting forth the moral that the ends do not justify the means.  A great idea, but the straightforward storytelling this time around really hampers everything.  The first 2/3 of the game contains no storytelling surprises; the characters involved this time around are only moderately interesting; and the father/mother rivalry, while novel at first, is repeated so often with no further developments in the story arc that it became a yawn halfway through.The new gameplay aspects sounded interesting before I bought the game, especially the idea of playing the entire game as a Big Daddy - something the first game only allowed me to do for the final boss battle.  Unfortunately, the developers chose to \"balance\" the game by rewriting what it meant to be a \"Big Daddy.\"  This Big Daddy apparently wears spandex for armor because at the beginning of the game he dies after a couple good whacks from a wrench-wielding splicer, and he burns through Adam about as fast as a Hummer burning gasoline on the Autobohn.  A better balancing act would have been to ratchet up the splicers' individual lethality or to have the splicers hunt in packs like wolves.  One Big Daddy against a pack of coordinated splicers would have been a pretty sweet fight.  Instead the developers gave us \"Not-So-Big Daddy\" against the same bad guys copied-and-pasted from the first game.  At that rate I could have just replayed the first game (again).The graphics are about as good as they were in the first game, but everything this time has a real been-here/seen-that feel to it.  I enjoyed exploring new areas that weren't in the first game, such as the prisons and the nurseries (and I especially enjoyed the idea that a \"utopia\" would need prisons and rehabilitation - er, brainwashing - facilities), but there wasn't enough truly new stuff in the environments to instill in me that same sense of awe that I had playing the first game.  And wandering around the ocean floor outside of Rapture was fun the first time I did it but bloody boring after that since there is almost nothing to do outside the buildings.  Even the one shark I saw just ignored me and swam by.I never played the multi-player so I cannot comment on that.  I played the first Bioshock for the story, and I always planned to play the second one for that same reason.  Unfortunately, this game failed to deliver.  The story is mediocre, the new gameplay elements are only kind of fun, there was no game-changing twist like the first game had, and by the last four hours of playing this game the whole thing simply became for me an end-run to the final cutscene so I could say I finished it and then play something else.  It's fun, but it's certainly not worth full price - unfortunately.  Rent it or wait for the price to come down significantly.  In the meantime, play the first Bioshock again.  It's a far better, far more rewarding experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000035Y4T","description":"The game that rocked the world and changed arcade-style fighting forever returns in all its splendor. Choose from eight unique characters (some familiar faces have returned from the original, but a few new combatants make for spiced-up action), as you try to pummel your computer-controlled opponents to death. Each character has special moves that only he or she can pull off, making the game full of plenty of surprises...and blood. As with the original, whichever character wins the battle gets the opportunity to complete a Fatality, which is every bit as violent as it sounds. There's a reason that this game was so overwhelmingly popular, and the cold-blooded, hand-to-hand combat is as fun today as it was when it first came out.","reviewerName":"theboombody","summary":"A Great Conversion","reviewText":"Very little differs between the arcade version of MK2 and the Super NES version.  You really can't ask for something better out of a game converted from a cabinet to a 16 bit system.MK2 is probably the strongest game out of the whole MK series.  It has plenty of fatalities, friendships, etc, but not so many that there's an endless list of button presses to memorize.  It has great graphics and great characters, my favorites being Baraka and Kung Lao.  It's just as fun to watch as it is to play.  Like all MK games though, it's challenging as all heck.  Don't waste too much of your life on this game, but play it on the easiest difficulty and be sure to look up fatalities online.  Try to buy it cheap somewhere.

The game is still very good, but my main issue is that a lot of it seems to be copy/pasted from the previous game. Without getting into details I can say that some missions are the same just named different and the setting is changed. While some might say it's supposed to Albion but 500 years later it feels lazy on Lionhead's part to not give something that feels more fresh. However, if you never played the original game you'll be pleased with it.Also a major complain by many are bugs, I have not encountered any major ones just minor disturbances. Even so they still take a little bit away from the experience.It's not all bad though, as it has vastly improved from the previous entry. The best improvement is the combat system. It's much more fluid, fun, and amazingly simple. This time around I actually used a combination of all my abilities instead of just sticking to melee. A new and welcomed addition is the dog which asides from some bugs behaves very well and is really helpful. Also nice is too see that the decisions you make have a greater impact this time around.Overall, I recommend this game to anyone. The main thing to have in mind is to play the game without expectations and trust me you'll be greatly surprised.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-09-2008"}

Controlling a motley crew of renegade characters, you must hunt down the TimeSplitters across a variety of environments, such as the gangster-filled 1920s, the lush jungles of Aztec temples, Soviet military installations of the cold war, and futuristic robot factories in space.The game delivers an involved single-player and a cooperative story mode, with a complex narrative, multiple objective-based episodes, and animated cutscenes. The game engine has been extensively upgraded to accommodate bigger environments and special graphic effects. The Mapmaker has been enhanced, opening up even more potential for the advanced gamer looking for customizable game scenarios.","reviewerName":"ribcage","summary":"hard","reviewText":"When I was going to get Timesplitters, I was thinking I was going to be getting it and just shooting stuff like crazy having a good time. However, what really becomes addictive about this game is attempting to unlock all of the characters(there are 130, I think.) You start out with 20 or so by default, and from there you earn more in one of three ways:Beating levels in Story Mode. I haven't played too much of the story mode, and only really on easy(I played some of the first level on Normal, and it was going good until I got to the boss, which is a helicopter gunship, and I got torn apart). It's a time travelling game so you go from 1990 Siberia to 1920s Chicago to alien planets, Tokyo in the future, the old west, etc, etc. There's AMAZING variety in the levels. Each has its own special characters and, in something of an ode to classic gaming, each level has a boss.Next, you can unlock characters in Challenge mode. You get series of events based on one action. For instance, the first series is glass breaking. The first event has you breaking out all the glass in the area with the grenade launcher on your soviet machine gun. The next one puts you in the same place with a brick. The final one has you using a normal grenade launcher in Notre Dame Cathedral. You have to complete the challenges within certain time limits to pass with Bronze, Silver, Gold, or Platinum. The medal you get determines what things you unlock. Platinum doesn't unlock anything Gold doesn't, it just gives you bragging rights if your friends are playing and can't achieve it.Finally comes the best mode. Arcade League. Arcade is the regular multiplayer mode you play with friends, Arcade League is preset challenges within the mode. If you've played the challenges in Perfect Dark, it's pretty much like that only more of them, and it's set up like the challenges--there's several series, and each series has 3 events. Also, Arcade League is split into Amatuer(Easy), Honorary(Medium), and Elite(Hard). You have to go in order. You can breeze through Amatuer League, and probably only have to go back for better medals on the flame tag/virus levels and the assault level.Assault. Oh man, this is quite easily one of the hardest modes I've ever encountered. It's only on 3 maps, and this is what happens. You spawn as part of an assualt team and you have to accomplish certain actions, such as gaining ground, shooting barrels and computers, and taking out autoguns. Within a nerve-rattling time limit.There are some parts of the game that will have you screaming and cursing, but 85% of it, though hard, is great to just play over and over until you get it down. What makes the really difficult parts more frustrating to me is that I know with just a little extra effort I can make it, but I never seem to be able to reach that magic point.My only complaint about this game is that there aren't really enough guns. I hardly notice that amidst all the insanity. This game moves INCREDIBLY fast.Oh, and it has a mapmaker. It's pretty restrcited, but you can still pull off some awesome maps.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2005"}

Contoured perfectly to fit a player's hand,The Wii Nunchuk (left) connects directly to the Wii remote.View larger.the Nunchuk controller builds on the simplicity of the Wii Remote controller. The Nunchuk contains the same three-axis motion sensor found in the Wii Remote, but also includes an analog stick, and two buttons to help assist in character movement.Many games will allow you to control your character's movement with the Nunchuk in your left hand, while your right hand is free to execute the action movements with the Wii Remote. For example, the Nunchuk is particularly useful for games like Wii Boxing. You can use the Nunchuk to punch with your weaker hand, while you use the Wii remote to punch and jab with your predominant hand.Take the fun to the next level with two-handed control of your games.View larger.In first-person shooters, the Nunchuk controller carries the burden of movement, freeing you to aim and fire using a more natural motion with the Wii Remote. In a football game, you can make your quarterback elusive with the Nunchuk controller while you search for an open receiver to throw to using the Wii Remote. Serious gamers may even want to use two Nunchuk controllers to gain a fierce competitive edge.Because the Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers are only relatively dependent on each other, players are free to hold them in whichever hand is most comfortable. Perfectly suitable for either right or left-hand use, the Wii Nunchuk controller grants accessibility not often seen in previous game controllers.Also, the Nunchuk controller doesn't need its own power--it plugs into the Wii Remote controller when it's in use. So there's no need to worry about charging or replacing expensive batteries.Adding a Nunchuk to your Wii system will definitely help you open the doors to the next level of gaming, and seriously step up performance. Just be careful not to knock out your significant other, or bruise the dog, severely, while using one, or two Nunchuk controllers.","reviewerName":"Njrg","summary":"This is Nintendo Quality?","reviewText":"Very light and very cheap feeling compared to the white nunchuck.

Brady","summary":"Really fun, with a few flaws","reviewText":"The overwhelmingly negative reviews of this game are just ridiculous, overly dramatic and petty. At its core this game is a ton of fun, with some minor flaws.At its core this a great arcade racer. If you're expecting Gran Turismo, go buy Gran Turismo. I do not buy a ton of racing games, so for me its a great purchase. NF:MW is rooted in fast and furious street racing, with traffic, cops, and brutal crashes. The racing is fast paced, hectic, and challenging. The graphics are beautiful, and the open world concept is flawlessly executed. The mix of cars you can drive and the styles of racing is diverse, and adds a ton of value to the game. The multiplayer is frantic and fast paced, and the single player campaign is really deep with cars and challenges.Some minor gripes with the game are numerous, but I really don't feel they take away from the enjoyment of the game. The most talked about is the lack of body customization. A full kit and paint customizer would have done a lot to the game, and I was disappointed to see it was left out. The drag style race was also left out, which on a pure speed rush could have added some variety. I also think the crashes, while cool looking, should do more to hurt your cars drive-ability. I hate that I can flip a Porsche 19 times in the air, destroy its body, and  then speed off like nothing happened. I also wish each car had a few more races and challenges. I feel like you get your car fully loaded, and then you have to move on to the next car. Some really challenging races utilizing the full gamut of upgrades would have been welcome. My biggest complaint is the upgrade system though. It drives me crazy that you can't upgrade your car by pausing the game, and the upgrade menu takes up the entire screen. The whole point of the system used is to make it fast, but mid-race it just makes you crash and burn. I just end up picking a configuration depending on the race and sticking to it. Lastly, where is the manual transmissions?!Overall the game is a blast and a great buy. I haven't taken it out of my system since its release. Its by no means perfect, but 2 stars doesn't give it credit for how fun it is. I'll continue to play it and enjoy it, and hope a NFS Underground remake is in the works.PROS:Beautiful graphicsFast and frantic racingHuge variety of cars and race typesOpen world is fun - especially picking a fight with the copsFun, fast paced, and approachable - great for people looking for an awesome arcade racerCONS:Damage is purely cosmeticCar customization is way too shallowAs soon as you upgrade your cars to max stats, you don't have any races left with that carUpgrade system is really slick, unless you're racing when you need it most...No manual transmissions","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2012"}

As Jen, players learn to unleash and control four different demon-fighting forms, each possessing unique skills and attributes, as they are immersed in a fantasy world joined inextricably with our own. This is not a world of goblins and barbarians, or any other such fantasy fare. Within the dark realms ofPrimal&#146;s alternate universe, gamers find themselves involved in an intricate and realistic story--enhanced by several subplots and twists--that makes them question the fine line between fantasy and reality.Primalis a story-driven game of exploration, combat, and puzzles, presented through the experiences of Jen and Lewis, a present-day human couple drawn into discord by eternal forces. While gameplay revolves around the events of the story, there are many personal revelations and surprises for the characters along the way. Essential to the game&#146;s core is the unusual and evolving relationship betweenPrimal&#146;s two main playable characters, Jen and her companion Scree, a gargoyle. Players can switch between Jen and Scree at any time and will be required to assess and utilize each character&#146;s strengths to succeed in various areas of the game.Primalis set within a huge environment featuring four expansive realms surrounding a central hub.

VanPortfliet \"Matthew san\"","summary":"An A for effort...but just barely above average","reviewText":"I was torn between giving this game 3 or 4 stars, but in the end I decided it earned a 4...if just barely.This is a beautiful game, with some of the coolest graphics I've seen on the PS2, and I do mean cool. It's not just that they're well done (though they are), but the designers of this game created some really cool worlds to get lost in. I was very impressed by them. I've always been a sucker for the whole \"4 elemental realms\" thing, which so many games and stories have used, and this game pulls it off perhaps better than any other I have played.The sound is also done very well, though just as a matter of personal preference, I don't really care for modern rock music when I'm playing a game that takes place in a fantasy realm, even if the main character is supposed to be from the present time. That's mainly just the combat music though...most of it is orchestrated and very well done. Voice acting is pretty good, especially Scree.The story isn't the most original thing I've ever heard, but it is very good...definitely enough to keep your interest.So far this game is going for a perfect score of 5, but unfortunately the designers really dropped the ball when it came to the gameplay, in my opinion. Most actions are pretty simple, and I have no complaints about. The ability to change between Jen and Scree is nice and adds a nice element of variety in figuring out how to use their seperate abilities to solve puzzles. The puzzles themselves ranged from simple to only slightly confusing, but were generally really well done and entertaining. So still, all is well.But then there is the fighting...I loathed the combat system in this game, to the point that it almost ruined the game for me. I felt a feeling of dread whenever I saw enemies just because I hated the thought of having to endure combat. You'd think it would be fun controlling a chick with various demon forms/abilities, but unfortunately no. The combos were hard to pull off or even figure out, combat controls themselves were incredibly slow and un-responsive, and just all around...well, not fun. I think I would have enjoyed the game more with no fighting and just the puzzle solving. I mean, I love to fight, but the controls have to be there or it just isn't fun.On a final note, I really missed jumping. I mean, I guess it's kind of realistic not being able to take big jumps, but that's just one of the things that make games fun. I mean it is a game, and not real life. It seems like she should have AT LEAST been able to jump while in demon form, I mean c'mon.So that's my opinion. The controls (particularly combat) were really lacking, but the game did have some really interesting and fun puzzle solving, an interesting story, beautiful graphics, and absolutely awesome worlds to explore. Worth a runthrough. Lastly, there is pretty much no replay value. If you're interested, buy it cheap.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2005"}

This is a game that is tons of fun, challenging and has enough small pieces that you can buy the game and actually get your moneys worth out of it with hours of gameplay beyond the \"beating of the boss\". While it doesn't veer away from the DKC tradition of being the simplest of plots (baddies steal bananas, Kong's fight to get bananas back) it takes pieces of previous DKC and ups the ante by introducing the Wii control system to the familiar controls and making them new again. Also noticeable to me, though I'm not taking advantage of this, is the 3D aspect of the game. I'm sure those with 3D television will have some great \"ooh\" and \"ah\" moments playing this game as enemies fly toward the screen and DK move to the front and back of the main part of the action.

{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Hendo","summary":"Great Console, But Missing a Few Very Important Features","reviewText":"Seeing that the majority of reviews here are thanking Amazon for making the PS4 available for sale right before launch, and not actually reviewing the PS4, I decided that a review of the system should be posted up for those that are looking for real reviews.I was one of the lucky ones who got a PS4 a few days earlier because of the Taco Bell promo, so I've had a few days prior to launch to mess around with it. I was able to get a copy of COD Ghosts, so please take that into account when I discuss the PS4 graphical capabilities. Also, I could not play online yet so I won't be talking about online gaming in this review.The PS4 is Sony's 4th generation console, and they've been successful in every generation since their first. I think you're going to see history repeat itself with the PS4 launch...... off to a slow start, but by the end of the generation it will be on top. With a fairly weak lineup, there was honestly not much I was excited about, besides the fact that it's Sony's new console in 7 years. Hooking up the device is a breeze, you just plug the power cable (no power brick required!) into the PS4 and into the wall, and the HDMI (included) from the PS4 to your TV or receiver, and you're set to go. First thing I did was pop in COD Ghosts, installed it onto the HDD, and started playing the campaign mode. I have this game for the 360, and comparing the graphics to the PS4, it was only marginally better. The game looks very pretty, don't get me wrong, but it just isn't that big of a jump in graphical power from last generation to this generation (nothing like how when the Sega Dreamcast first came out and blew everything out of the water). Now for the game play itself...... there was some lag during some of the more intense parts of the game. The 360 version definitely handles COD better than the PS4, which makes sense because the PS4 is a brand new system, but then again, it is using an x86 architecture which is theoretically \"easier to program\" for, but I guess they had some trouble porting COD Ghosts.Now let's talk about media capabilities, or lack thereof. Blu-Ray movies play fine, just as you would expect from Sony, however...you cannot play 3D movies! Sony will probably enable this feature later, but for now you can't do it. The PS4 is a 4K capable device, but only for movies and photos, not video games. One of my biggest gripes about the PS4 is that it can't play audio CDs and mp3s, or stream media from your computer....WTF Sony? The PS3 was a great media center, and I hoped the PS4 would be too, but these lack of basic music features is going to make me knock one star off of my rating. I've heard rumors that Sony will enable this feature later, but we will have to wait and see. I wouldn't be surprised if they pulled a 180 like Microsoft did earlier this year.Pros:-sleek product ID (smaller than the ps3 slim!)-quiet design-500 GB Hard Drive-Ability to upgrade your HDD to a larger HDD (or SSD)-controller is a Dualshock 3 on steroids (it's better in everyday)-built in power supply (no brick!!!)-USB 3.0 ports-iPhone and Android appCons-No Audio CD playback-No MP3 playback-No DLNA support-No media streaming from a computer (no mp3s, no movies...)Overall I give the PS4 4 out of 5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-14-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0000AI1KK","description":"Sequel to the terrifying Fatal Frame, Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly serves up another chapter of horror that will keep you up at night.","reviewerName":"Matthew Warner","summary":"Deadly Good","reviewText":"Mio and Mayu are twin sisters visiting an old childhood hideaway in Japan. Soon to be lost underwater with the building of a dam, they've come to take a last walk around the quiet forest trail where they played as children. It's also the location of the accident that left Mayu with both a physical and emotional scar; chasing her sister, Mayu tumbled off the path and severely injured her leg, giving her a permanent limp, and a phobia of being abandoned by her twin.As Mio sits reflecting on her past, and wondering about that day, Mayu wanders off, following an oddly colored butterfly into the forest. When Mio realizes her sister is no longer with her, she runs to catch up, passing an odd stone marker as she heads deeper into the forest.Without warning, the afternoon sky suddenly turns to night and an odd light shows in the distance. Finally catching up to her sister, Mio looks down the path towards a small, seemingly abandoned village...So starts Fatal Frame II: Crimson Butterfly. The most recent entry into the Survival Horror genre, this game is designed from the ground up to scare the player silly, like any good ghost story, and it largely succeeds. To clarify something right up front, however, this game is just that: A GHOST story. This instantly sets it apart from both the Resident Evil and Silent Hill series of games, to which Fatal Frame is most commonly compared.As a veteran of both Silent Hill and Resident Evil, in addition to Fatal Frame, I'm pleasantly surprised that not only do the three series each have a different approach on how to scare the player, but all three work very well in their own way. Fatal Frame is sort of the middle child of the three; it's not as shock-horror as Resident Evil, but isn't nearly as disturbing (imagery wise) as Silent Hill. I mean, which is more disturbing?: The ghost of a broken-necked woman grinning at you, or a bizarre cross between a lamprey, a skinned corpse, and a twitching pile of psychosis grinding the face off a dead security guard?Basically, this translates directly into how scary the game actually is. If you're fairly new to the genre (or easily scared) then Fatal Frame will probably do it for you. If you're like me and have been to Silent Hill and back, it's more of a coin toss; is it the events leading up to an enemy attack, or the attack itself that scares you more? While the atmosphere in Fatal Frame is exceedingly well done and very cohesive, it lacks the threat level present in Silent Hill, or even Resident Evil. Video game vets will pretty quickly adjust to the game's combat engine of picture-taking (which, in practice, isn't nearly as stupid as it sounds and makes more sense as a means of fighting ghosts than, say, shooting them). While the ghosts in the game are certainly creepy, most of them don't attack the player, and the game lets you know which do and which don't right off the bat. This doesn't make it any less creepy when a dead 7-year old girl pops out of a wall next to you and laughs, but the fact that she can't actually do any damage to the player negates some of the fear factor, at least for me. Were this Silent Hill or Resident Evil, you can bet that dead kid would be trying to take your head off before you knew what hit you, and it's that fact alone that adds to much of the tension to a game (again, at least for me). The build-up to an enemy is that much more effective when you know that the payoff could be fatal.Still, this was a stylistic choice for the game, and while it's potentially not as frightening in the long run, it does make for an excellent storytelling device, which brings me to the game's strongest point: The story is top-notch, which is unusual for the clich&eacute;-ridden Survival Horror dealie. In Fatal Frame, there's no hunting for the Spade Key to unlock a door in a Police Station. You won't find any crests to open hidden doors, and you won't be killing demons with a handgun. For once, the puzzles present actually make a good amount of sense and blend seamlessly into the story, which is such an amazing feat in it's own right that it can sell the game right there. Survival Horror done coherently!On top of that, you won't be fending off the same five enemies over and over. The ghosts in the game have their own stories attached, and they overlap as the game unfolds. If the promise of scares isn't enough to propel you forward, the compelling narrative is. What starts out as seemingly random ghost encounters quickly forms into several narratives the player can uncover, and they're all interesting enough to be rewarding.Tie all this together with absolutely breathtaking graphics, a superb translation and voice cast, and a particularly well done soundtrack and you have a package that's good enough to have you playing through it several times over and still want more. It's a new take on Survival Horror, and while it's different, it's still excellent all around.This game shouldn't be missed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2004"}

I've already played the Xbox 360 Naruto games Rise of a ninja and Broken Bonds(Both Excellent games) and was expecting this game to be a more open world system like the previous two, and while the animation and effects are good all you mostly do throughout the game is fight in rounds,do races, or tree climbing races until the end.  I mean yes that's what most of us want to do with this kind of game but as one reviewer has said just hitting one button and doing all these combos was just a tad to easy, with the 360 naruto games you at least had to hit multiple buttons to do combos and special moves an the like.  The one other thing I slightly dislikes was the village exploration with the 360 version not only can you go almost anywhere but the villagers have voices to listen to and if you want talk to as well,  while this one had printed script you had to read when you talked to a villager(Which I found a little strange since the PS3 games are suppose to hold more data for their games). The side missions you get from the villagers and the other ninja rookie team members like Ino, Kiba, and the others that open the D through A rank missions are pretty good though and sometimes fun.  The only other true annoyance of the village exploration is that unlike the Xbox version you cant climb most buildings unless the have a ladder icon on the side of the building than you can do the wall walking on them unlike Naruto Broken bonds where you could climb any building almost as long as the wall was a flat surface and you made it to the top before your chakra gave out.The missions seem to run through the variety of fighting, tree climbing, and races as well as the hide and seek segments with Konohamuru.  Though the animation with the village regardless of no voice audio or not was probably the best looking of the Naruto game series out there.  The other option you have other than the main story mode segment is just straight up fight rounds with the characters you have opened up through the main story and play the fight rounds in fighting areas like the training grounds to the forest of death if you want.  All in all the game is pretty good for most Naruto fans and the animation as well as effects are probably the best out there so until the release the second game with the Shippuden arc all Naruto fans have a good time with this entertaining game for your enjoyment...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2009"}

Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Kristopher G.

And unlike the Oracle games, one cannot come and go as he/she pleases; to travel from the Light World to the Dark World, the player must go back to the point from which he/she warped.  In terms of sound, the music and effects are outstanding, if you don't mind hearing the same 3 tracks through the majority of the game.To its credit, the other items available throughout LTTP makes the journey a lot easier, such as an ocarina that signals a bird to fly you to different areas in Light World, along with 3 hidden medallions that attack multiple enemies.  In the graphics department, LTTP looks exactly as it does in the Super NES version, and those Dorkly parody videos.  My one complaint is that the dungeon maps are so small compared to the SNES version.I can't really complain about the other game in the cartridge, though.  Actually, I can't say anything about Four Swords as it requires 2-4 people with their own GBA's and their own copies of Zelda to play it.  So by itself, LTTP racks up 4 stars in my book; as a bundle, you'd have to travel to the four corners of the globe to get the most out of it.This game is rated E for Everyone.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0002A2S26","reviewerName":"G. Marshall \"Geoffrey Marshall\"","summary":"A typical sequel.","reviewText":"So I just got Halo 2 today and spent the last three hours playing it. I haven't beaten it yet, but I think I've gotten enough to write a review on it. This review deals only with the single-player campaign; I don't have anyone to do multi-player with but I know that the original rocked and this one would rock even more in multiplayer.My verdict? It's an improvement on the original, but that's all it is. Which is not a bad thing, considering how good the original was in the first place. It's not an improvement in the sense that GTA San Andreas is an improvement over both of the previous GTAs (much larger scope and range of activities) but it's more of a tweaking of what was good in Halo, fixing what was bad, adding a few more twists, and releasing it. To me, it still looks and plays like the original Halo, just with a continued storyline and a few new skills.One thing that is most appreciated by me is the improved Marine AI, and the fact that I don't have to drive the warthog all the time. You can choose to navigate, or to man the guns and let the A.I. take you where you should go. The maps are a bit confusing, and there will be times where you won't be sure where you have to go. Just wander around a bit and you'll find out where to go, there are no time-limits to worry about.I am still trying to get used to the weapons. The battle rifle is a fair replacement for the old assault rifle, since you have the submachine gun as a fully automatic weapon. Shotguns seem to shoot a bit slower and they feel...\"softer\" is the word that comes to my mind. Some say the needlers have been improved, i'm trying to see where that's the case. They don't seem to home in as well as they did in the first game, though they do seem more powerful. The new range of covenant weapons available are pretty impressive too, you finally get the Fuel Rod Gun and the Energy Sword :D sweeet...All in all, it is a very good game but only because Halo was a very good game. If you liked the first one, you will like this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"C.

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Disappointing","reviewText":"A couple years back, Midway updated their light gun shooter Area 51 for the last-gen consoles in the form of an action, scare, and conspiracy theory-filled FPS that was surprisingly good.  Blacksite: Area 51 is more or less a follow up to the aforementioned game, in which you play a soldier and find yourself searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, only to uncover an alien conspiracy.  The first thing you'll notice about Blacksite: Area 51 is that the game is boasting some spectacular graphics.  The characters, aliens, areas, and environments are beautifully rendered; making the game a joy to look at, but that's about it.  The use of squad tactics doesn't work very well, and you'll mostly find yourself engaged in battles with your squad not doing much to lend a hand.  It should also be noted that there are a fair amount of glitches and bugs that occur now and then, ranging from graphical glitches to bugs in the gameplay elements.  The single-player campaign is decent enough, albeit much of the shock value and scares that were featured in the last Area 51 game are absent.  The multiplayer mode is uninspired and boring to say the least as well, which is even more disappointing.  For all its flaws though, Blacksite does offer some solid moments of intense action, and the political commentary does conjure a smirk.  All in all though, Blacksite: Area 51 is a disappointing FPS that could have been so much better than what we get here.  It is worth a rental at least for FPS addicts or fans of Midway's Area 51 license, but other than that, Blacksite can be avoided.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2008"}

The only problem with the game is the immense amount of commitment required. This isn't the kind of game you can beat quickly. It requires massive amounts of leveling up which equals hours upon hours upon hours.

If you just want to shoot zombies, then you'd probably have more fun playing Resident Evil 5 or Left 4 Dead 2.Concept:  10/10Alan Wake is a famous writer who is struggling with writer's block.  He goes on a short vacation to the Pacific Northwest with his wife to relax and get some fresh air.  Upon his arrival to the quaint little town of Bright Falls, something goes awry and he is sucked into an insane world of darkness.  He quickly realizes that he is living in one of his stories.  A thriller.  But this thriller has been corrupted and is becoming a horror story.Story:  9/10The main draw to Alan Wake is the Stephen King style writing.  This is a very deep and complex story and if you aren't paying attention, you may not understand the ending.  There are plenty of discussions about it on youtube.  The dialogue is very well written and there's some pretty good acting.  I'm not going to spoil anything here, but the more you focus on the details, the more you will get out of the game.Gameplay:  7/10There are two types of gameplay:  Exploration and Combat.This is not an open world game like Skyrim or Red Dead Redemption.  These are levels put together to create very wide areas where you are encouraged to explore and find collectibles.  You can find pages of Alan's Manuscript, Thermoses of Coffee, weapons, ammo, and items.  Most of these just unlock achievements or help Alan in combat.The Combat is very simple and somewhat repetitive.  After dark, the People of Bright Falls become criminally insane lunatics smothered in shadow.  Armed with crude weapons, they try to kill Alan.  To make matters worse, only light can harm them.  Lucky for Alan, he's armed with flashlights (beam), flash bangs (grenade) , flares (timed area of effect), and small arsenal of common guns.  When you see an enemy, you must first get light on them to remove the darkness.  Once the darkness is banished, they're vulnerable to gunfire.  Enemies will charge, throw weapons, and try to hack you to bits and you can dodge or sprint for a short time to escape.  Light in the game represents a safe haven for Alan Wake.There are times when the darkness corrupts objects or flocks of ravens, too.  They become possessed and fly at Alan.  He must dodge, escape, or use light to neutralize the darkness in the objects.  That's pretty much it.  But most people will be playing this game for the story and atmosphere.Graphics:  9/10The graphics are very good.  The Seattle-esque town of Bright Falls looks pretty amazing in the day.  There are snow capped mountains, dense forests, and all of the things you'd expect to see in a small town.  The characters could look better, but they aren't bad.  The art direction did take a Stephen King (realistic and familiar) approach.  What is more scary to you?  A gigantic demon or your maniacally grinning uncle trying to cut your face off with a kitchen knife while he quotes the Bible?  The enemies in the game are not wicked demons sporting curved horns and fanged maws.  They're people who could be your friendly neighbors... except now they're possessed.Sound:  8/10The sound is very good and contributes to the atmosphere.  It does a great job at setting the mood and providing audio cues for gameplay.  The voice acting is pretty good overall.Maturity:  TeenThis is a horror game and is very much like a Stephen King movie.  It's not overly gory and there isn't any nudity.  It is more like an interactive horror novel.Replay Value:  5/10There are 3 difficulty modes and some DLC.  You may also want to play some areas over again to explore and get achievements.  But there is no multiplayer or branching story arcs.Overall:  8.5/10To some people, this game will be a masterpiece.  A perfect blend of psychological horror and action that hasn't been seen since Silent Hill 2.  To others, it may seem like a mediocre action game with a confusing story.  If you're willing to search for clues in the story and pay attention to details, then you will enjoy this game.  If you just want to blow through an action game, then you probably won't like Alan Wake.Buy it if you love complex horror stories.Buy it if you like horror novels.Rent it if you have 7-9 hours to finish the campaign.Avoid it if you just want to shoot bad guys.Avoid it if you like simple stories.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX7BQ","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Fantastic Production Values and Storytelling Make Up For the Shortcomings in Gameplay","reviewText":"The Good:+Amazing production values+A fairly good story+An amazing soundtrackThe Bad:-Some very clunky controls-There are many moments where what you do as a player makes absolutely no difference.  Even sitting idly by and watching events results in the game simply pressing forward without the player suffering any consequences---NOTE: The Following Review is LengthyQuantic Dream is best known for producing the very well done Heavy Rain.  The storytelling and real sense of choice in the game made Heavy Rain stand out.  There was no such thing as a game over.  Even if characters perished or you didn't do something a certain way, the course of the game could change a lot.  Beyond Two Souls is the follow up and while I'd love to tell you it's as awesome as Heavy Rain, that's really only half true.  Everything about Beyond Two Souls production values really shines and stands out.  Gameplay wise, it doesn't quite hit as high, however.  There's nothing really &#34;Bad&#34; about Beyond Two Souls, but it's not the best follow up to Heavy Rain.Beyond Two Souls focuses on Jodie.  Ever since she was a girl she's always had a ghost like entity by her side named Aiden.  For the longest time it's hard to decipher just what Beyond Two Souls is about.  The story jumps between Jodie as a child, a teenager and an adult.  But it won't do so in any particular order.  The game jumps from one timeline to another quite often in a very non-linear fashion.  There are times when the story comes off as kind of a mess.  What'll keep you going, however, is how intriguing it all is and the desire to see it all come together.  And it very much does.  The only real strange part about the story being told in this non-linear fashion, is that there's hardly a reason to think it should be.  But even if it were told in order you might still be scratching your head for quite a ways into the game.  Mostly because we're introduced to new characters and plot elements that the story is content to turn its attention away from for extended periods of time before returning to them.  One moment we're with Jodie as a misunderstood teenager.  The next we're with Jodie as a scared child... and then an adult before going back to a part of her past.  Each one introducing something new.  Whether plot related or character related.As I said, it's hard to really say what the story is about.  It's really just about Jodie and Aiden.  Their relationship together and their bond. Everything from a production standpoint about Beyond Two Souls is really up there.  The acting from Ellen Page and Willem Defoe is really good.  Even most of the supporting cast is pretty good.  What might strike you as odd is the writing where there are some pretty poor lines every now and then.  And though the performances by most of the cast is good, there are still moments that stick out as rather bland.  Usually from lesser characters.On the upside, though, the game does look absolutely gorgeous.  The character models are amazing.  Beyond Two Souls is simply one of the best looking games on the PS3 right now.  From time to time the game might freeze up for a second or two or even slow down as a result, but the game is still really easy on the eyes.  But by far the best part has to be the games amazing soundtrack.  One of the best ever composed for a video game.  Simply put, Beyond Two Souls is an assault on the senses.  It's just a good looking, sounding and well crafted game.  Though the story can be confusing it's still good and filled to the brim with a lot of interesting moments and emotional highs.  There aren't many games like it on the market.  It's just a shame the gameplay doesn't stand out quite as much.The gameplay in Beyond Two Souls is most similar to Heavy Rain.  The key difference is that you'll control both Jodie and Aiden throughout the game.  When you control Jodie this is when it's most sensitive to Heavy Rain.  You'll wander through certain locales and perform task.  The game will usually prompt you to do something by pressing certain buttons.  Sometimes it's just a quick tap.  Other times you'll have to hold it.  Sometimes you'll have to hold more than one button at a time.  As you can imagine, sometimes the game will have you do some pretty mundane tasks.  For instance, when getting into conversations you're given choices such as whether to lie or tell the truth or stay silent, but these choices hardly really matter in the long run.  They certainly never really change the outcome of events or the characters reactions.There are also combat scenarios in the game as well.  Jodie will at one point train to fight.  You won't be doing a lot of it in Beyond Two Souls, but the mechanics are quite different from any other game.  When Jodie is performing an action in combat you will use the right analog stick to match some of them.  So if Jodie is punching off to the right, you must move the analog stick right.  If Jodie is kicking downward you must manipulate the analog stick downward.  The only problem with this mechanic is that it's sometimes hard to tell just what Jodie is doing.  It might look like she's punching to the right but it's really just a setup for her to hit someone downward, which means that instead of pressing right on the analog stick... you have to press down.  This actually happens A LOT more often than you'd think.  It doesn't matter, however, as the game is not particularly quick to punish you.Playing as Aiden is a different story.  When playing as Jodie, a quick tap of the triangle button will switch you to Aiden.  As Aiden you can phase through walls and manipulate objects.  You can possess some of your enemies and you can also heal Jodie's wounds or protect her from harm.  Aiden doesn't get quite the same combat experience as Jodie, but it's nice to be able to change from Jodie to Aiden.  Unfortunately you can't do this at all times.  The story pretty much dictates when you can and can't switch to Aiden.  It's not something that can just be done on the fly.There are a few minor complaints about the basic structure of Beyond Two Souls gameplay.  For one, the controls are a little clunky.  Even something so basic as walking can feel clunky.  Particularly when the camera angle changes.  It's easy to make Jodie walk into a wall or become disoriented.  Aiden doesn't control much better as it takes a moment to get a handle on his controls.Some of these problems can be softened if you simply download the Beyond Touch app for your smartphone or tablet.  Doing so allows you to sync your tablet or smart phone to the game and control it that way.  Though many a gamer will probably wonder why this is even an option when the controller itself works fine.  In particular, the app is especially helpful when controlling Aiden.  Along with this there is also a multiplayer feature in the game.  One player controls Jodie while the other controls Aiden.The only real downside to the gameplay in and of itself, is that Beyond Two Souls tries to do what Heavy Rain does in many regards in a story that doesn't quite allow for it.  Heavy Rain was big on making your choices matter.  Doing certain things and performing certain actions (or failing to perform them) resulted in some pretty serious consequences for the player.  The story never ended, but characters could die or events could really play out differently.  Beyond Two Souls tries this, but because of how the story is told it couldn't possibly hope for the same results.  In Beyond Two Souls your choices feel rather mundane in the long run.  They often don't mean anything.  When given choices the outcome rarely (if ever) changes based on one of them.  And if it does change, it never really impacts the overall story.This is compounded by how the story is told.  Obviously if you play through a moment with Jodie as an adult and it flashes back to her being a teenager you know that the end result of whatever it is you're doing isn't going to change.  The choices you make and the moments when you can make them are never impactful enough that they'll alter the story (despite David Cage often saying they would).  It's good at making you feel like your choices are important, but they never really make a difference in how moments of the story itself play out.  For instance, in one moment at a birthday party you're given the option to get even with the kids that bullied you there or just leave.  No matter which choice you make it doesn't impact the story.  It doesn't add to Jodie's character... or even help develop her.  It's great that the preceding scenes before it show that Jodie is different and an outcast... but giving us the choice between revenge or not never really plays a role in the game itself.  What you do here doesn't help develop or impact Jodie as an adult and it obviously can't impact Jodie as a child.  The game is full of moments like this.  Choices that are seemingly big but don't really impact the big picture as a whole.  This might be less bothersome if David Cage hadn't spent so much time telling us that they would.The greater sin is when this happens in gameplay.  David Cage, the games writer and director, has been quite fond of saying he's no fan of game over screens.  That the story must go on no matter what.  And in a game like Heavy Rain this is fine.  You're jumping between different characters in what is a pretty linear story.  But Beyond Two Souls isn't like that.  Since there's no such thing as a game over and the story must go on no matter what, the player feels few consequences for anything they do.  Because of how the story jumps around in the timeline there's not really much room for the game to really let you die.  Obviously if you played through a segment as an adult, you wouldn't be able to die as a teenager.  This doesn't stop you from getting in mortal danger where you'll have to make button presses to save yourself or have Aiden save you.  The problem is that because of the structure your success or failure simply doesn't matter.  In one moment I had to out run pursuers on a train.  One of the things that happens in this scene is that you can make Jodie jump over an obstacle in the way or not.  But it doesn't matter whether you jump over it or trip.  She still keeps going either way.  Tripping over it or jumping doesn't actually matter.  You must then fight them off.  Even if you miss every button press nothing really happens.  You'll get captured and have to escape your captive and jump off the train.  If you manage to fight them off?  You still jump from the train.  How you get to point B is different, sure, but the fact that it has absolutely no impact ON Point B itself is kind of strange.  Other times refusing to do a button input simply makes the game stop and all you do is watch Jodie struggle until you do what the game is actually asking you to do.  No consequences for inaction.  No incentive to hurry up (even in so called crucial moments).  You're given choices, but in a game that's so heavily ABOUT choices it's kind of strange that the impact of them isn't there.There are other moments that are a lot worse, however.  In some instances even missing every button press and just watching the scene changed absolutely nothing.  Some of them played out the same way.  In others the game just sits there waiting for your input.  But at no point in time did I ever feel as though making a mistake would ever result in consequences for me as a player.  What's the point of putting button inputs there if nothing changes?  It sort of makes the idea of Beyond Two Souls having difficulty settings laughable.  Needless to say, any player might as well jump right into the highest difficulty setting immediately.  More than that, it sometimes comes across like the game is putting this out there so that you can feel like you're playing a game without actually playing.  Certainly some scenes can feel a little different, but the story will always press on regardless.  And because of how its told there isn't really much room to put consequences on the player.  If you come to a moment where it seems like Jodie should die from your inaction or doing nothing?  The game simply makes you switch to Aiden to heal her.This is actually rather sad because Beyond Two Souls has some really intense moments.  Moments that, had the player felt more like a participant, might have come across as a lot more breath taking.  And believe me when I say... Beyond Two Souls has some really incredible moments.  Some that really hit emotional highs.  But it's hard to feel the impact when you realize that had you done nothing in them the end result wouldn't have changed.  Basically what I'm saying is... even in gameplay, Beyond Two Souls has a hard time making it feel like your choices matter.  I want to know that me NOT making a kick connect might result in some heavy consequences.  Again, in Heavy Rain this wasn't a problem because it felt like the choices you made mattered.  But the story and approach to that particular game allowed for that flexibility in the story telling.  Beyond Two Souls has no such flexibility.  It's not as though the game really has room to let Jodie die if there's still a moment on the timeline we're working up to.The story of Beyond Two Souls will have you engulfed and perplexed.  It's a good story.  One with a lot of emotional moments and a lot of effective moments.  In terms of reaching for emotional heights, Beyond Two Souls succeeds where few games really have before.  On the other hand, from a gameplay perspective Beyond Two Souls is no where near as exciting.  The player's actions making little difference in the outcome of events or the refusal to make players own up to their mistakes in gameplay is a little jarring at times.  It doesn't keep you from playing the game, but it does give off this idea that the player is merely a passive participant rather than an active one.It is definitely a game worth playing.  Even multiple times.  However, if you are a gamer that values the illusion of choice (or at least the feeling that the choices and mistakes you make in gameplay matter) then you have to get used to the fact that Beyond Two Souls will provide you with a lot of choices, but few that will make a difference or result in consequences for the player.  Beyond Two Souls is a good game, but had it had a couple of tweaks to its gameplay it would've been a great one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-24-2013"}

There is no exciting techno music with dynamic menus, there are no flashy cars zooming by in between menus.  Instead there is a calmness, a certain finess to everything.  You know right away that it will be a different experience than NFS or Burnout or Dirt, and it is.  On with the review then:First thing first, there is a huge, I mean huge like at least half an hour, installation period when you choose to do so.  I did because I thought it would save time in the game, yet the game still takes time to load in between races anyway.  I guess with so many detail on tracks and cars it's necessary.  After a while you get used to it and work on strategies during that period.Licenses are still there and I found them to be passable easier than previous GT games.  I got all bronze but got them licenses, anyway.  Besides you can always go back and try again for better times but I must say gold is not hard, it's impossible and unforgiving.As usual you start with smaller cars (Miata, anyone?) and work your way up.  Leveling system is nothing new to the gaming world, so people who complain about it must have been in a cave for the last few years.  It works fine, the better you do in the races the faster you climb the ladder.  I got all my licenses, except S, and gone up to level 14 in about 10 hours.I'm an average gamer, played many driving games but I have never given a second thought about the AI of other cars.  Actually you have more pressing matters than AI, the track.  I usually focus on the track and how I drive more than how other drivers behave.  Infact, for those nay-sayers, I have a video showing how competative other drivers react when they see an opportune moment.What else, oh yes, the 1000+ car thing.  Where else can you find your first car, get it beefed up and race it against Ferraris and get your butt kicked, here of course.  Most of the cars recycled from GT4, and some has more versions than necessary but this game works like a monument to car racing rather than games with numerous flashy super cars that you race for a few hours and drop it after a week.  This game does not need a story, the racing is a story itself, and I loved racing cars from 70's and 80's.  I'm 36 and it felt good to drive the cars that I've drooled over when I was in my teens.Graphics, how can I put this, while I was driving bumper to bumper I was amazed with the detail of the taillight of the Murcialago infront of me, that ended after it lit up red and I burried my bumper into it.  It's that good.  Tracks also look great but nothing particularly special about them since I concentrate more on the track than scenery.  I can't really comment on sound because I don't know how every car sounds, but I can say that when you modify the engine you feel the difference in sound but it's a given in modern games I guess.I didn't see or feel any damage on cars yet.  It was lacking from GT series from the beginning but it didn't keep the fans from playing and loving the game.  Afterall we are not playing the game to trash the cars.  I can understand the developers though.  Seeing how serious the game is done, and the attention to detail, they probably didn't want to throw in some generic damage effect, falling bumpers, paint scrathes, just to please a few people.  I'm sure they wish to do it well and unique to every car with both mechanic and cosmetic damage but the aim of the game here is to push people to drive better, not to punish them for driving badly.Overall it was well worth the wait, thank god.  It may not fulfill everyones expectations but it's certainly not a disappointing game as some claim.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2010"}

This game is certainly imaginative.  The bright colors, the goofy stick figures...  This game is straight out of the \"Puff the Magic Dragon\" era.The graphics are AMAZING.

Why the heck would I want to dance in a platforming game?  Throughout the game you collect stickers, which you use to decorate your character or the levels you play in or create...  Why??  How is this \"fun??\"The controls are iffy - sometimes you'll run and jump and go flying across the screen.  Othertimes you run and jump and it's like you just jumped into invisible tar...  This makes the levels extremely frustrating and challenging when they clearly shouldn't be.  There were also levels that required two players to get the extra rewards.  That drives me crazy.  I'm 30 years old - I don't have siblings or kids or anyone to join up to play video games with, which means I can't enjoy this stuff.It seemed to me like online was where all the fun was, so I jumped online to access some levels.  I found that the frustrating controls still caused the same problems, I found that when you're playing online, all that you end up doing is competing for the little reward bubbles, and in general, you just get in each other's way.  I did a few online coop levels, did a few online solo levels, and returned the game the next day.You might love this game - and if so, more power to you.

First off, kick ass Dante who I so praise in my above review is seemingly gone.  His character says all of five sentences during the entire course of the game, and bases all his decisions on the flip of a coin.  Didn't Two-Face from Batman do that?  Anyway there's a second disc with another playable character, the oddly shapen Lucia.  Lucis has her own story, her own moves, and her own weapons.  The problem here is, we really don't care because we don't understand her story.  In the original DMC, we understood what Dante was searching for, the purpose of his quest, and we enjoyed everything he encountered along the way.  In DMC2, we don't understand why Dante is even on this mission, or why he is interacting with Lucia.  Did the creators suddenly forget about Trish from the original?  I think it would have made more sense to place her in Lucia's role.  All in all, it is unfair to compare DMC2 to it's predecessor, but that is what nearly every reviewer will do.

The graphics have improved over the years, but fundamental flaws remain unaddressed. WWE SmackDown! vs. Raw 2006's graphics are fairly solid, with faces, costume elements, and venues looking better than ever. The thin audio elements still fall far short, though, with simple meat-packing slaps and insipid, contradictory commentary urging you to mute the whole affair. The high point doesn't lie in any element of presentation, but rather in the wealth of gameplay options available to you: everything from steel cage, parking lot, and \"buried alive\" matches to girl-on-girl pillow fights and royal rumbles are represented. The plentiful bells and whistles go on and on, right through to online title matches, unlockables, and the new General Manager mode. The contestant roster includes more than 70 past and current superstars, and you can even create a brawler, complete with his own entrance sequence. The trouble comes when you actually get down to the business of playing any one of these options in particular. Your success hinges on little more than knowing precisely when to hit one of the two reversal buttons, and then pounding your enemy to putty with some brutal attack of your own. The plethora of match types simply blur together as you find yourself constantly just staring at the screen, waiting for another fleeting moment of conditional control. Hardcore wrestling fans will find the deepest reservoir of variety ever available, and may even forgive the feeble fighting system long enough to enjoy some theatrics. If you've been frustrated by the clunky and almost traditionally unresponsive controls of wrestling's past, however, you'll just have to wait and hope that next year's edition at least takes a shot at improving them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-06-2005"}

A must have.","reviewText":"This is a fantastic turn based role playing game from a long lineage and history of the Dragon Quest franchise. For starters, all of the classic enemies and their cartoon-esque art style are here fleshed out in 3D. The turn based battles feel great as ever, but there is some depth to said combat. When you level up you get your standard stats increase, but now you get extra points to pool into combat traits such as swords, spears, clubs, unarmed combat, courage and so on. Each character has different trait abilities. These stats will give you abilities to use in battle that are different than spells. Abilities like Heart breaker, penny pincher, monster masher, blow kiss and a lot of others.There is a very competent tactics system where you can assign certain party members to take certain actions during combat. You can still control them if you want to, but if you don't, you can have them show no mercy, fight wisely, focus on healing, don't use magic, get psyched up or follow your orders. The choice is yours, but it does save on brain cells not having to think about who will do what or if you've got a very young player that isn't playing for the combat.The menu system feels a little cumbersome and it takes a longer time than it should to do things. The menu is broken down into items, where each party member has their inventory to equip things and a bag that holds your excess. In battle, you can only use items that character holds and cannot use anything from the bag, which makes sense. The magic menu where you can use a character's spells. Attributes to see character stats, traits, abilities, bio and so on. Finally there is the miscellaneous section, where you can easily heal everyone with the push of a button (that will automatically use magic and items to replenish health), tactics, line-up, equipment, settings, help, battle records and an interesting new alchemy pot, where you can take useless items and make them more useful.The game follows the player from a third person perspective and you have very good control over the camera. The game has you walking around towns which are safe from enemies and the wilderness which is not safe. Random monster battles will happen. You will not see a monster on the map (just in rare occasions), but rather you will just be taken to a fight screen with the foes. All of the monsters have good animations and a sense of charm and personality. The 3D and animations really bring everything to life nicely. Better yet, the enemies have a lot of combat diversity that adds a lot and makes you think. Diversity far from just spells and attacks, but some enemies flip when hit to reveal a stronger version. Some enemies start the battle sleeping allowing the player to run away or take advantage. There are plenty of status ailments like sleep, poison, paralysis, curse, mute and so on (Pretty standard stuff).Now let's talk about the story. Normally, I don't care much for story, but this game has a surprisingly good and rich story with plenty of characters to get attatched to. Your character is the silent protagonist. Yangus is the brute comedy figure, Jessica is the bold young lady you meet 2 missions in, Angelo is the charming ladies man that works for the templar that you will find a few hours into the game. It is all held together by the cursed king. Some short frog like humanoid creature and his horse of a daughter Madea. Hence the name Journey of the Cursed King. You are all following a strange jester villain that literally has affected everything in the story. Quest after quest is tied to this jester. It is nice storytelling.Each quest... or I should say chapter in the story is around 2+ hours between battles, travel, your exploring and cut scenes. Speaking of cut scenes, they are voice acted for the most part. Some voice acting is quality, but it feels like they recycled some voice actors doing triple duty. You end up reading a lot quicker than their voice acting, but you can skip to the next bit of dialog (box). The townspeople are not voice acted, but rather dialog boxes at the bottom of your screen as is the traditional RPG format.If you come back from a long downtime of not playing, the game reminds you that you can ask your party what to do to get back on track. This works excellently like a hint system or a friendly reminder.All and all, his is a fantastic game for anyone who likes turn based role playing games. You really can develop your characters to how you play. Its deep, but you can still play it on a shallow level. There is exploration, but you won't get lost with clearly defined paths. A lot of dungeons and outdoor areas you can just go straight to find your goal, but you can look off the path to find treasures and other quirky things.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

E Jackson","summary":"don't hide under that mask, Link","reviewText":"Let me ask you a question.  When playing A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time, do you think Kakariko Village is the most important part of the game?  Do you think meeting everyone in town, getting to know their personalities, and figuring out their dilemmas is the most exciting part of the quest?  Then Majora's Mask is for you.  Me?  I think meeting people in Zelda games should only be one of *several* fun things a player can do.  There's also exploring rich and colorful overworlds, fighting enemies and bosses with specific weapons and strategies, collecting exciting items that take advantage of the heroic Zelda theme, and exploring dangerous and challenging dungeons filled with traps and aggressive enemies around every corner.  When you add up all these crucial features that I've grown to associate with the Zelda series, it officially makes a Zelda adventure feel like a complete package.  So what happens when you take away most of these trademark features of Zelda?  You're left with an incomplete, unsatisfying boring game.  Proof that storytelling and character development can only provide entertainment for so long.  This is why Majora's Mask isn't very good.Majora's Mask does tell a remarkable story and has pretty decent characters.  There's no Ganon as the bad guy but I don't really mind.  He's been used too many times anyway.  Many of the characters from Ocarina of Time even return for another appearance, such as the music box guy, the horse owner and the Goron's.  Their specific theme songs from Ocarina of Time can be heard as well.  The story is that Link takes a walk into the woods after the events of Ocarina of Time, and a mischievous imp named Skull Kid supporting two naive fairies turns evil upon wearing a mask.  This imp is especially a big jerk- not only does he want Link to die, he wants him to suffer as well. Why?  Because he's wearing the Majora's Mask, a mask with mysterious powers.  This Skull Kid guy is now completely out of control and Link is apparently the only one who can stop him.  Sound appealing to you?  It is.  Too bad the gameplay is so one-dimensional with all the errand running concerning the townspeople.  Oh but there's another aspect to the story- the moon above is angry and if Link isn't able to finish the quest in under 72 hours and stop Skull Kid's madness, the moon will crash into the planet and everyone will die.  An enticing and noticeably darker theme for a Zelda game.  The moon totally reminds me of the angry sun from Super Mario Bros. 3.  Just *look* at his face, haha.Instead of Kakariko Village you have Clock Town.  No it's not a town dominated by clocks; it's a perfectly normal looking town with buildings and ordinary people running around, many of which aren't the least bit concerned that the world is coming to an end which is quite a peculiar reaction if I do say so.  Throughout this town you perform tedious tasks such as finding children in a hide and seek game, and a needlessly generic rupee collecting mission that involves floating around on pink Deku flowers and landing safely on generic platforms.  Clock Town itself is divided into four basic areas.  North, South, West and East.  You'll be *constantly* running back and forth between these four areas over and over again figuring out the mediocre tasks relating to the townspeople.  The theme song that you hear in Clock Town is cute enough to make you puke!  Reminds me of the Muppet Babies, seriously.Unfortunately the repulsive baby-like and overdone ocarina-playing segments are back one again where you have to play songs by way of pressing a sequence of buttons.  This is comparable to a 3-year old kid pressing buttons on a toy and believing he's making great music.  I HATE this aspect of the 3D Zelda series so much.  You'll be playing the Song of Time hundreds of times since the idea is that you have to go back to a previous time whenever the moon above gets a little too close for comfort and you're in danger of running out of time.  The good news is that going back to a previous time means you can re-collect rupees and other things (where you can repeatedly deposit rupees by way of a banker in West Clock Town, allowing you to run around collecting a bunch of rupees and simply return to this same spot over and over as a way to keep them stored).  The bad news?  Going back in time is often inconvenient since you JUST spent several minutes trying to advance the plot (and probably desperately hoping the game offers something more than going around talking to people) so this whole \"going back in time\" portion of the gameplay gets pretty annoying after a while.  A Link to the Past allows Link to transport to a dark \"mirror\" world and Ocarina of Time uses time travel- these concepts are both a lot better than repeatedly going over the same areas and rooms and opening the same chests that only serve as a pitiful attempt to drag out the length of Majora's Mask.Eventually you leave Clock Town (thank GOD) and venture out to a smaller, barren and plain-looking overworld with empty fields, scarce and badly animated enemies, and just a totally uninteresting and failed attempt at exploration.  The game has an enormous amount of heart container pieces.  WAY too many in fact.  You get to wear a variety of masks, some of them necessary to make progress, other masks for entertainment value.  Either way, putting on a variety of masks so you can complete tasks and errands hardly satisfies that urge to finish the game, and due to the plethora of problems I've already mentioned, this isn't enough to make me feel like I'm taking on a legitimate Zelda adventure.  I guess that's the point since technically Majora's Mask is a subplot anyway.Soon you arrive to a swamp where a dumb but admittedly funny story pertaining to a tied up monkey accused of kidnapping a princess takes place.  The story is the *only* good portion of this swamp/Deku Palace I'm afraid.  From here you have a boring stealth mission avoiding being caught, boring lily pad jumps, platform gliding by way of a Deku Flower item which is really childish, and overall tacky combat so the storyline can take center stage.  My God is it ever torturous killing enemies with bubbles (yes that's right, BUBBLES!) in this one underground portion.  You have to eliminate 30 enemies and collect the prize they leave behind- gold skulltula tokens for the Mask of Truth (or a Giant Wallet later on).Of course the second biggest problem with the game (besides focusing on story and characters and nothing else) is that the dungeons are limited to only four, and half of them aren't what I'd call particularly long or memorable either.  The Woodfall Temple is surprisingly short and uninspiring.  It's all about torch-lighting puzzles, collecting stray fairies which is a mandatory mini quest I guess you can say probably used as a means to make the dungeons feel longer then they really are, running across narrow wooden platforms, floating around on your pink Deku flower (and by the way, Link looks horrific wearing the Deku mask) and an uncreative sword-swinging boss fight at the end.  This place falls short of being interesting.  Snowhead Temple is one of the better dungeons.  You have to roll, punch or pound your way through the snow and ice wearing the Goron Mask which alters Link's moves completely.  You have to collect more stray fairies and shoot patches of ice with fire arrows.  The fast-paced boss fight is pretty fun at least, but the Wizzrobe mini battles are sort of annoying.  He teleports all over the room and you have, I'm afraid, *two* battles with him.Great Bay Temple focuses around lighting torches, pulling switches/platform jumps, swimming around (or having the current push Link) and figuring out which room you're supposed to go through all the while being underwater.  This is actually the best temple in the game.  It's challenging in a way that makes you think without being annoying which instantly makes it leagues better than Ocarina of Time's horrendous water dungeon which was nothing more than a snoozefest.  Graphically it looks really good too.  The mini boss is the same as the boss from the water dungeon in Link to the Past but in a 3D world of course.  The fish boss fight is pretty difficult but fast and fun too.  Excellent dungeon overall.  Now the Stone Tower Temple is a major disappointment in comparison.  It's all about statue and switch puzzles, walking statue enemies, underwater swimming with a commendable amount of enemies and threats (in the water at least, nowhere else) and having to reflect light to open doors.  The boss made of bats is original and awesome in appearance.  The main boss fight is the same exact thing as Lanmolas, the sand worms/snakes from the desert palace in Link to the Past.  This is pretty easy for a boss fight too.  Overall however, Stone Tower is incredibly bland and a chore to go through.The final showdown with the gigantic Majora's Mask is cool and ominous in appearance, but lousy in strategy and execution.  You basically spend your entire time dodging whips slapping around the room as well as fire attacks, and basically the object is to use arrows and swords to bring him down.  Whichever incarnation you're facing, a well-equipped Link assures this battle simply isn't challenging enough.  The ending is meaningless too.  I can't remember ever finishing a game and feeling like I just wasted my time.  The fairies are boring and don't really seem interested or grateful for anything you've done.  Neither does Skull Kid or anybody else.  This just goes to show how unmemorable Majora's Mask is overall. Interesting note- the Astral Observatory opens with a couple notes that totally sounds like the intro to Billy Joel's \"Captain Jack\" classic, a song some of you may know.  Some of the mini games are really fun I admit.  The target/bow and arrow games are fun, especially the one where you actually shoot enemies.  I really hate the fact Big Skulltula returns, perhaps the most overrated enemy in the entire Zelda series.I'm not sure if this should be named the worst Zelda game of all-time.  Zelda II: The Adventure of Link for the NES may in fact be worse due to an awkwardly implemented way of battling enemies in side-scroller fashion with bad play control and a REALLY bland overworld.  That game is probably worse than Majora's Mask but only by a tiny notch.  Other things that annoy me is the password-demanding kid in Clock Town, the lovey dovey man and woman in the mini game room, and *especially* the marching rooster collecting game that obviously seems designed for little babies as evident by the nursery rhyme music that plays while performing this horrendous game.  Watching Link march around to this music is just sad on so many levels.  The twin dancers in Clock Town perfecting their moves to Egyptian music resulting in Link performing some rather hilarious and bizarre moves of his own is a nice moment of comedy.  I'm not too crazy about the platform flowers that rise after you water them.  A nifty way to get around perhaps, but rather clumsy in design overall.  Pick up the other 3D Zelda's instead of Majora's Mask and you probably will be happy you did.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2013"}

The goal is to find all the items on the list before time runs out. The time limit is very generous, and there is an option to turn off the timer for newer players.If you're unable to find an item, a \"HINT\" option shows the general area to find an object, but using this subtracts points from your final score. Tapping the screen too many times can also subtract points.Each level completed unlocks a Journal page which documents your journey.At first, the items to find are described clearly:Pocket Watch2 MiceForkCaptain's WheelHowever, as the game progresses, the descriptions become more challenging:Broomstick PilotThreaded FastenerStoke the FlamesThree TinesNow in addition to the items on the list, each level has a Jade Mask and a Glyph hidden in it.Collecting enough Jade Masks unlocks a Mini-Game menu on the main screen:(2) Mini-Game Free Play.The games below are unlocked as you collect more the Jade Masks:Memory Match - You have to match tiles to clear the board. You can choose to match items that are identical, similar (i.e. football & baseball), related (i.e. screwdriver & screw), or random.Jigsaw Puzzle - Complete the puzzle before time runs out.Tile Swap - Swap tile positions to complete the picture before time runs out.Mah-Jongg Match - Tiles in a Mah-Jongg pattern must be cleared before time runs out. You can choose to match items that are identical, similar (gold anchor & brass anchor), related (i.e. screwdriver & screw), or random.Find the Difference - This shows two pictures on the top and bottom screens of the DS and you have to find the differences in the bottom picture before time runs out.If you collect enough Glyphs, you can unlock the 3rd style of gameplay:(3) Unlimited Seek & Solve.This mode allows you to visit each location and find every single hidden item. As you find items on the list, new clues take their place until all the items are found.Now if you fancy yourself an expert, there are also 10 awards to earn:(1) Ajaw's Jade Mask - awarded for finding all 17 Jade Masks.(2) Mayan Tablet - awarded for finding all 17 Glyphs.(3) Mayan Temple Drawing - awarded for completing \"Find the Forgotten Ruins\" mode.(4) Mayan Children's Doll - awarded for completing \"Unlimited Seek & Solve\".(5) Mayan Burial Urn - awarded for reaching the rank of Senior Adventurer at 5 million points.(6) Golden Mayan Masks - awarded when you reach 15,000 points in Memory Match.(7) Golden Jigsaw Puzzle Piece - awarded when you get 18,000 points in Jigsaw Puzzle(8) Golden Tile - awarded when you get 18,000 points in Tile Swap.(9) Golden Mah-Jongg Tile - awarded when you get 18,000 points in Mah-Jongg Match.(10)  Golden Mayan Glyphs - awarded when you get 12,000 points in Find the Differences.I must admit, this is a very addictive game. The levels reminded me of M.C. Escher woodcuts, and all the objects are hidden quite well. The gameplay is very easy to pick up - I didn't even need to read the directions.The main issue I had was the repetition. After unlocking the first few levels, I found myself revisiting the same pictures, but with a different list of items to find. This makes the game a little boring - which is not a good sign.My other issue is the low gameplay time. I played this game for 4 hours and I was able to unlock 14 of the 20 levels. This means that I will most likely complete the game, along with the extra awards, within 3 days. If this was an expensive game, I might take issue with that...but for the asking price, this is just right.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2008"}

It's Obsidian's first original IP and it has a lot of potential and creativity behind it. Unfortunately while the story-based elements of Alpha Protocol are impressive, the actual gameplay never comes close to matching it.In Alpha Protocol you play agent Michael Thorton. The story is told in a sort of flash-back, flash-forward format. The dialogue is filled with espionage-type details and really draws you in if you're a fan of spy fiction. You'll meet some a-typical characters along the way that seem like they're straight out of Metal Gear. It's an intriguing mix of real-life seriousness and goofyness and for the most part works in keeping you engaged in the story. The voice-acting is also pretty good for the most part especially when you consider the plot-branching involved in this game (which is the best part of the gameplay).After choosing your professional background and stats you wake up on an operating table and are forced to fight your way through a tutorial level. After some training levels you're taken to different places around the world and given a selection of missions and handlers which you can choose to complete at your leisure. In fact that's the best thing about this game: the choices you make. Every choice you make in the game has branching consequences which decides how the game itself plays out. Even your professional background decides some of your dialgoue choices. Not even the Mass Effect games have this kind of branching effect and you really feel like you're effecting the game world.While the dialogue and story branching are very impressive, the actual gameplay ranges from passable to just plain lousy. There's nothing broken in the gameplay exactly, but Michael's responsivness always feels sluggish. There's the slightest of pauses before everything you do, climbing anything is slow, stealth just looks awkward, and covering only seems to work half the time. Also, while there are a lot of customization for weapons and gadgets  they're not implamented very well. Your gun only does as much damage as the training you put into it (no matter how accurate your shots are) and the enemy A.I. is so bad I found the stealth and gadgets next to worthless (though I loved the silent take-downs). The only mechanic that felt satisfying was the hand-to-hand combat, which is a lot of fun but for some reason you can't block (and again is only useful if you've put enough points into the skill).It's really frustrating when you see a game like this with so much potential but lacking in the simple gameplay mechanics. Again, Alpha Protocol is far from unplayable but most players won't have fun playing it. If you're a fan of spy fiction and RPG customization I'd recommend at least a rental or wait for this to drop to $20 (which is what I did) as I'm still going back and playing through it for the different story branchings. Everyone else should probably save their money for a more polished RPG experience.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2011"}

Johnson","summary":"No issues here!","reviewText":"I received this Microphone in the mail and was eager to try it out on my 360 and laptop.  Visually there is nothing special about the microphone; its looks almost identical to the Microphone that was included with Rock Band without the wire of course. However, even though its basic looking it does not look (or feel) cheap.  It appears to be sturdy enough to take the occasional drop without it falling apart.  From past experiences, I have never had any issues with Logitech products and I suspect this one will be no different.  I have tested this with both Rock Band and GH:World tour and no problems with either game.  In addition, I have no issues with the microphone cutting out due to interference or being out of range. Range is excellent and I'm able to go to my son's room and still have the mic function just fine.Other than the steep price, I can't find anything wrong with this microphone.  It works flawlessly with my XBOX games (no games to test it on with my PS3) and on my laptop when I use it with my Rosetta Stone software.  The best thing about this is that it requires no drivers, all you have to do is plug in the USB transponder to your device and turn the Microphone on and your good to go; the batteries are even included!The reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the steep price, but if having a wireless mic is THAT important to you, then the price should not be an issue.  In either case you should not be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2009"}

The WaveBird Wireless Controller replaces standard controllers. Up to four controllers can be used at one time. With the WaveBird Wireless Controller, you can play up to 100 hours on just two AA batteries.","reviewerName":"Marshall David WahlstromHelgren","summary":"The Nintendo Wavebird the Nintendo Controller to have.","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of Nintendo and I love their products, I would even say I'm a Nintendo enthusiast because I love a lot of what Nintendo comes out with, and thats video games and other related accessories. Sure granted all of there items are made in China and Japan. But they are awesome and usually stand the test of time. The Nintendo Wavebird is one of the best wireless controllers on the market and is starting to become rare since the Gamecube was discontinued in 2007. So why the wavebird you ask? Well, for one this controller lets you play games from the comfort of your couch, chair bed etc, in any part of the room with ease. For a while I just used the basic wired Original Gamecube Controller and on some level I feel bad that I gave that up since the controller came with the system and it matched the system plus it was from Nintendo. I am a little mad Nintendo never thought of making colored Wireless controllers for example purple wireless controllers in the first place because I think they could've sold the GameCube for more money and made way better sales in comparison to what they made initially to there competitors aka Sony or Microsoft, it would've put them way ahead of Sony or Microsoft. I was never truly happy with my PS2 or my Xbox they're cool systems, and the controllers are great but I don't like the fact that A.) I had to mess with cords and B.) I had to use a wireless Logitech controller for PS2 and they never came out with any wireless solutions, sure there's generics but I love first party but thats Sony and Microsofts loss.The controller, is really cool it uses Radio Frequency or RF to pick up a signal I have a phone that has wifi and 3G. Never had any interference, though I find it interesting that if you were using more then one controller and had two or more controllers on the same channel it would mess things up, but then again it makes sense. But when I am using more then one controller I always make sure the controllers are on different channels, only thing I don't like is the fact this controller only came in two colors Grey or Platinum. Which is a bit annoying to me, but what can I say? If I paint them then it takes away from the value of the controller.  These controllers are so much more convenient then corded controllers. Granted they lack a rumble feature.I got these controllers because you can play wirelessly and up to 100 hours of gameplay and it's better then messing with cords especially if your in an area where there's a lot of traffic and controller cords get tripped on.  Though when I use the Corded version I didn't have to worry about batteries, and the corded versions last longer because of not needing batteries. If only Nintendo had made these controllers with a rechargeable battery pack like they have with the Wii U. But nobody was really thinking of that over at Nintendo back in the day. Overall I highly recommend this controller its worth the money. I paid $25.00 each for each controller which I bought one at a time and thats a $100.00 investment I made and it was well worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2013"}

The game play was mostly the same as the first game, and yeah it was unfinished and buggy, but beneath the technical problems that sadly have plagued Obsidian (the developer of this sequel) there is really quite an interesting (and definitely darker) story dealing with such high brow concepts as existentialism, quite different fare from the \"standard kill the bad guy\" scenarios that dominate the genre.Through the efforts of modders who have created several patches that have succeeded in restoring most of the missing content that was planned but never finished for the game, as well as patches and fixes, now we finally have the finest KOTOR The Sith Lords. The gameplay is still as good as ever (check out the internet on how to get it running on modern PCs) and it is nice to see that several of the ideas first implemented here (like influencing your companions) have become commonplace in modern RPgs like Dargon Age.In case you enjoyed the original KOTOR and have a fond spot in your memories for different RPGs like Planescape Torrment you owe ii to yourself to give this game a try, believe me you will not be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2012"}

In my opinion, it bests the Final Fantasy series's last dozen installments in terms of sheer originality.  The combat is enjoyable, if a little too simple (Ninja Gaiden this ain't), and the storyline is also very engaging.  This is also one of the few games that succeeds at constantly divvying up the quest between action, puzzle, and exploration elements of gameplay.  You could play this seriously as an adult or with younger kids.It's a shame that a lot of people ignored it when it first came out, but now that the price dropped, maybe you will pick it up like I did.

I'm serious in the cutseenes in after the big plot twist, he's not in any of em, and he's in my party)-bounus chain is cool(Once you get it, Just don't die, get criticly hit or escape)-addictive battle system(and it's 2 players for co-op mayhem!)-Good thing most save points have healing spas beside them(In dungens)-Anti Aura is nice.(Especially regeneration!  it heals)-Synthising weapons is awsome, if you have the time, items, and money-Specifying plans are cool to upgrade the stuff you created-The battle coloseum is pretty fun(But on ranking mode, the top 2 are ultra freakin' hard!)-Chaning names is cool(But it doesn't change what the voice actors say)-Alternative costumes, sweet!-A nice 60 hour epic-9 multiple endings, replay value up-A pretty good game that should definitly suit RPG fansCons:-Slow diolage make's the story pace slow and tired(The first 3 hours I only got into 4 fights, man ain't that exciting?

That pisses me off!!)-Alt costumes only work in battle(C'mon, Tales of Symphoina had all alt cosumes on characters during cutseenes, and most of the costumes look better than originals)-The game stalls TOO much! Even at points it freezes on me(This is hard to believe{even me} but San Andreas never did this to me)-Creating items takes a while nad costs cash-When you run out of MP you DIE [...]  This is the first game I ever really had to give a dang about MP.

I'm still in school, but sometimes I don't care(I'm a game addict)-If you want everything, you NEED the guide, which was a pain coughing up $15 for a lot of page turning, but it was ultra helpful.A lot of cons, but the Pros outweigh them, and this game wins over my fun factor.  Right when I got in my first fight(After like an hour of wandering around and listening to slow diologe) I fell in love with this game.  And I like a lot of the characters.  The plot may be slow, but the battle system saves the game from being a total tedius bore.  If you love games like Tales of Symphonia, Final Fantasy X, and Xenosaga, you have to add this to your collection.  The reason it took a while to finish was cuz Sony sent me a demo disc the earased all the data from my memory card.  That was screwed up!!

Nathan Drake, treasure hunter/Terminator hybrid attempts to follow the path of his namesake Sir Francis Drake to find Ubar, the fabled &#34;Atlantis of the Sands&#34; finding a long buried plot and a sinister conspiracy behind its disappearance.Graphics and voice are superb as always. Naughty Dog almost has the crown on this, but I feel like they're barely edged out by Mass Effect and one or two other series, as dialogue can be lost in the wash of combat a little too easily.Gameplay is probably the best of the series, though U2 still has the best sequence by far with the train. Exploration and treasure hunting are still nice diversions without being impossible nit hunts, but some treasures have really odd reqs to reach.There's only one major nit that peels off star 5: The ocean of dispoable grunts. After 4 waves of enemies, you'd think there'd be some more exposition on why the opposition cares so much. In U2 they we're a mercenary unit under a tyrannical psycopath, but there's not a drive like that to fight through burning buildings and crashing planes when rational people would be running for exits or parachutes. Other nits are present. You can throw back greadnes (yay!) but they're on timers that sometimes allow the greande to still explode and kill you even when you're successful at throwing them back (boo!) Snipers have unlimited ammo, but when you loot their corpse they have, without fail, only a single spare clip remaining. Close combat has been revamped, but the AI apparently doesn't really care about friendly fire, as they'll pump you full of lead while trading punches with a guy. Again, how do you drive a group of guys to swiss cheese one of their own?MP is actually decent. There's leveling bonuses, but you won't feel like you're armed with a peashooter among RPG's when you are dumped repeatedly into levels with all level 45+'s to your 3.Overall, totally worth it. Great story, entertaining dialogue, great play sequences. Even with all the QTE's it still doesn't feel like press X to not die and more like you're in the cutscene, which is fantastically hard to do.

Rose \"Blu Aficionado\"","summary":"Gorgeous, but be Patient!","reviewText":"Reviews are opinions other people have about a certain items or products.  This one will be no different, however I urge you to try this game for yourself...even if its just a rent.  You may dislike somethings, but at least you wont miss an excellent game altogether!I must say the visuals are absolutely mind blowing!  The dust and particles blowing in the wind and around the shanty's is downrightamazing.  This brings me to my first category:Graphics/Visuals: (A+) If your a fan of COD4/5 photo realistic environments, RE5 is going to blow you away!  The details in everything from the small puddles of water to the wood grain on doors and planks honestly takes you right into the game!  The blood, and liquid properties of things are spot on, and really take gaming to a new level!  If your into stunning graphics or need something new to show off that HDTV, this game will sell it!Sounds/Surround:  (A+) This is one of my favorite new features of \"next gen\" games, the surround sound is so important and just adds that level of realism, especially in games like RE!  The crunching of sand under your feet, the banging of angry zombies on wooden doors, your partner opening up a fully automatic weapon behind you in the distance...all promise to keep you playing on the edge of your seat!  I was very impressed with the sound of this game, hearing hordes of zombies coming right at you (front speakers) and the loud shout of your comrade telling you to \"watch out\" (rear speakers) all of this combined with snarling zombies, and random 9mm rounds popping...incredible!Gameplay: (A) Okay I broke this down into two sections multiplayer co-op(MP), and single player campaign(SP)MP-Playing RE5 co-op with a buddy is something that has never been done before in a RE game, and believe me it is an excellent addition!  Having to help a real person playing along side you and vice versa is nerve racking, hearing your friend yelling into the mic \"hey I got 3 more coming on my right can you get em\" is just something you don't get when the AI player cries for help.  Its so nice, helping each other and actually talking about solutions, and what way to go next...however its a double edge sword. (read SP)SP-While playing with a buddy is awesome, SP has some perks also.  You'll be controlling Chris, while Sheva is computer controlled (for the most part) The real bonus to SP campaign is Sheva talks and gives you little \"hints\" as to whats next.  I found it kinda nice at certain points of the game where your just completely turned around with no clue where to go.  Personally for me though if you got the internet, and a buddy with RE5...go with the CO-OP, the end experience is hard to beat!Controls (B/C) This depends on what kinda games your used to.  If you find yourself playing strictly first person shooters (CoD, Halo) this game WILL take some getting used to.  Its a slower paced action than your used to seeing in FPS games, but if you have the patience to learn your gonna be in for a surprise.  You can not reload or shoot while moving, which many people have complained about.  While this is frustrating at times (namely when a mob of zombies is headed your way and your mp5 is dry) it adds to the urgency of the moment!  Make sure your gun is always reloaded and get some distance between you and the enemy (remember that spade shovel they got reaches a lot farther than your knife also) Watch your partners back and hope for the same from them and I promise you will have a great time with this game.All in all I give this game a 9.2/10 with the controls being the only thing you need to get used to, but not a deal breaker, or a reason to overlook this amazingly well told story.Enjoy!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B007R4X3AG","reviewerName":"Christopher Barrett \"Evil Corgi\"","summary":"Nostalgic fun, even for someone new to rhythm games ~","reviewText":"Two fans would enjoy this game: rhythm game fans and fans of the Final Fantasy games.  I count myself in the latter, having started my love of Final Fantasy with the original game on the day it was released in the US (back in '88 I think it was).  So the nostalgia factor is important to me.  I'll give a brief description of why I found this game so fun and so frustrating (in a good way).When you first start playing, you set up a profile, select a party made of chibi personalities from Final Fantasy games 1 - 13.  They decided to go with the chibi so that all the characters would have a similar appearance despite being from different games with wildly different art.  I am NOT a fan of the chibi style, but I guess it's better than some other alternatives I can think of...The first area that is unlocked is the standard music collections from each title.  You pick from FF 1 - 13 and then you have five stages for each, each with a different tune from the original game.  So yes, the tunes for the old NES games are the beepy, mono tunes.  Accept it, these were the songs we all fell in love with in the late 80s.You use the stylus to do the actions on the bottom screen: tap, hold, or swipe.  Occasionally a combination of hold then swipe.  The top screen gives you the queue.  The 3D is actually not really important for this game, and I typically keep it on a low, or the lowest setting to reduce eye strain.  Especially when you stare at the little round icons flying across the screen.The initial rhythms are not hard.  In fact I made A or S on every one my first time through without ever retrying.  There are five styles for each FF title.  2 are very easy little opening and ending tunes where you basically just tap when a note touches the crystal.  The others are tougher: a move background (FMS), the Battle, and a Field stage.You might think, holy crap this is easy... until you unlock the Chaos Shrine.  Then it gets crazy tough.  Each Chaos shrine has a Field and a Battle stage and it is MUCH faster.  You also unlock additional Challenge games for the Final Fantasy titles.  The regular difficulty is the stuff you already beat.  Then you have Expert, which is pretty tough.  Then if you make an A or S on Expert you get Ultimate.  Bend over and kiss your own arse goodbye.  You will probably have to practice the same song at least 6 times before getting an A or S.  Sometimes more.  Some are frustrating because you have to tap then swipe in a rapid succession in wildly different directions.  So basically tap - swipe up - tap - swipe down - tap - swipe upper left - tap - swipe down right - tap - tap - swipe down left - tap - tap - swipe upper left.  And all happening insanely quick.You level your characters.  This really only helps in the Chaos Shrine battle stages.  The stronger and higher level you are, the more misses you can make (hence damage you receive) and the more damage you dish out, hence battling more baddies and racking up more items.Speaking of items and such.  There are tons of things to collect.  Most are very useful.  Again, mainly in battle stages.  Items can be used to help you or to help you acquire new abilities.  Abilities can be equipped if you have enough CP and they also assist you in battle as well as field stages.  They don't tend to do much for you on the FMV stage since it's more of a 'just finish' it stage to get points.There are additional characters, songs, videos, and more to unlock.  I was super thrilled when several songs I felt were stupidly left out ended up being unlocked!  Such as Dancing Mad from FFVI Zanarkand from FFX, Crystal Core from FFIV, JENOVA from FFVII and more.  I won't give all of them away, nor the secret characters.  But they are all familiar faces, and there is at least one per FF title, with a couple of titles have 2 or 3 extra characters.  You can also purchase a few extra songs that can be played in Challenge mode.  I recommend sucking it up and giving the $1 per song to Squeenix (my loving name for Square Enix) for those few extra songs you might enjoy.  Just remember, they are original songs, so don't expect remixes.It's incredibly addictive.  I actually took time off from Etrian Odyssey IV and Fire Emblem Awakening to play this!  Addictive, challenging, nostalgic.  A great title for fans of Final Fantasy throughout the years.  I was so happy with the memories that I have started replaying the original games - in order.  Sadly kind of hit a wall with the travesty that is Final Fantasy II... sigh...  But yes.  The game is worth it.  Not really much of an RPG, but a few little RPG elements in a very good rhythm game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2013"}

There's not a lot of change, gameplay-wise, from those classic games, but we really wouldn't *want* that.  We want to see the gang have an adventure, to run, to jump, to pickpocket, to throw bombs and unleash the might of THE MURRAY upon cartoon henchmen.  In addition to all of the characters from the previous games, there are five ancestors of Sly's who you play on a mission here and there, which adds to even more variety.

{"product_name":"B007FTE2VW","description":"","summary":"Bugs and Design Flaws","reviewText":"EDIT (April 1) -- Well, the game has been out almost a month now, and while the servers are mostly stable now (rollbacks are still not uncommon, but connectivity is mostly stable), nevertheless the game is riddled with questionable design choices and outright bugs currently.  One might hope that the bugs will be addressed at some point in the not too distant future, but it appears unlikely that the design choices will be revisited.  These impact things like city size, traffic functionality, the interplay of demand between R, C and I, the trade system, and the overall problem that the simulation is, frankly, too easy and too streamlined to provide the kind to depth that SimCity's fanbase would have liked to have seen in the game.  I would be very careful before deciding to buy this game, as a result.=====It's been a long time since the last iteration of the series was released -- January 2003, in fact, just over ten years ago.  So, you can afford to wait a bit longer to buy the next iteration -- and you should.SimCity has been reimagined as a multiplayer online game.  The ostensible game-design reason this was done was to permit people to play in a region together with other people online, each controlling one city in a region, trading resources, specializing their city and cooperating with the other mayors in the region to achieve challenges and build regional great works like large airports.  While that may sound well enough, the side effects of this core design decision are many -- both technical and gameplay.First, the technical -- and this is why you should not buy this game right now, but wait to buy.  Because SC has been recast and redesigned as a multiplayer online game, it is played on servers, as is the case with an MMORPG.  The city you are playing exists on a region on one of EA's servers, and not locally on your machine.  You must be connected to EA's servers and logged into them in order to play, just as if you were playing an MMO.  And, if a server is down or offline or full, you can play on another server, but, just as would be the case in an MMO, your \"character\" (here, your city) is located on the other server which is full -- if you want to play on a different server, you need to create (claim) a new city.  This will all seem familiar to gamers who have played MMORPGs, but may seem surprising to players of the previous iterations in the franchise, because this kind of architecture has never been present in the franchise before, and is not common in city-builder simulator games in general.  And, as is the case with MMORPGs, this kind of design generally leads to a lot of problems when the game is first released due to the heavy volume of player interest.  That is, the servers are set up to accommodate a stabilized player load, and not the rush of new players when the game is released.  So, currently there are massive, massive server problems for this game, making it barely playable -- servers are offline, or being maintained, or simply full, there are queues, there are rampant disconnects from servers in which one's city fails to save to EA's cloud, meaning that significant progress -- perhaps 30 or more minutes of play -- is simply lost into the ether.  At this point, because of the server problems the game is experiencing and the large load of players (the game just released in Europe, meaning more players inundating the already full servers -- and, no, the servers aren't geographically limited in terms of who can login to them), it just isn't very playable.  Your best bet, even if you are intrigued by the new design, is to wait 10 days or so for the initial rush to die down and then check on internet sites to see if the servers are stable yet.Second, the impact of this design on gameplay is substantial and wide-ranging.For starters, the basic idea of the game is now to play in multiplayer regions where the cities depend on each other.  As a part of this design, the size of any one city in a region is rather small and limited -- very limited when compared to SimCity 4, for example.  You aren't supposed to be building the one great city, but a specialized city that works together with other cities -- trading resources and services with each other based on comparative advantages.  In this way SC adds a regional cooperation simulator into the game, but it's more of a cooperative online game than a simulator, as you are really playing trade-offs with other players.  The main impact of this is that it limits what you can do with your own city, because you are kept to a small enough space, and with only certain resources and not others, so as to force you to specialize.  Now, you can play this in private mode, where you control all of the cities in the region, but this is still a very different kind of gameplay than previous versions of SimCity featured.Another set of impacts from this is that, unless you are playing in something called \"sandbox mode\", you lose a lot of control over what you can do in your cities.  The reason, again, is that this is designed as a multiplayer game, and like many multiplayer games it therefore polices what you can do, as a player, when you are playing.  Even if you are playing in \"private\" mode, you are still restricted, because in theory your gameplay could result in leaderboard rankings, achievements, challenge rankings and so on.  If you are playing in sandbox mode, these aspects fall away -- that is, your play is not \"counted\" towards any of these -- and you get more flexibility to control what is happening in your game.  But, keep in mind that even though this sounds like \"single player mode\", it is still taking place on EA's servers and streaming to your computer, and therefore you need a continuous connection to the internet to play in sandbox mode as well.The game has some interesting features as well, like upgrading public buildings, more variety in road design, and, of course, much better graphics.  But prospective buyers should (1) wait at least until the server rush dies down and the servers are stabilized so that you can actually play the game for more than 20 minutes at a time and (2) consider carefully whether you want the kind of design that the game is -- a design that is focused on the regional level of play to a much greater degree than earlier games, and which is fundamentally designed to be played on a regional level with other players rather than as a single player game.----Note that this is an initial review -- I will edit this review as time passes and I can experience the game without the current server issues and become a bit more attuned to the new design.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive.

Fallout New Vegas captures the original vision of Fallout and that original sense of dark humor, spot on. While there are several annoying and embarrassingly bad bugs, I was fortunate enough to not run into anything that was game-breaking.Graphics: I sincerely hope that the current Gamebryo engine has seen its last release with Fallout NV. For a triple A title such as this, the engine looks horrendous. There are some nice motion blur and lighting effects here and there, but generally the graphics are outdated. Two fundamental components - textures and models - are my biggest concern, as they look washed out and clunky, respectively. I felt the same way when Fallout 3 had come out (at that time, comparing the game's engine to TES IV: Oblivion as they use the same engine) - but now the graphical shortcomings are exacerbated. Truthfully, some aspects of Fallout NV look worse than Fallout 3. There are graphical glitches aplenty but nothing (so far) to detract from the overall gaming experience.Sound: Fallout remains as atmospheric as ever. I love the fact that the soundtrack captures the spirit of the original west-coast setting - and I love Obsidian for graciously including many of the best tracks from the original games! Music aside, the voice acting is simply fantastic. Perhaps not on par with Dragon Age (which had some of the best voice-work I've ever heard in an RPG), but Fallout NV is head-and-shoulders above Fallout 3. Gone are the same voice actors that were recycled from Oblivion and gone are the wooden deliveries.Environmental/ambient audio is also very well done. Giant and obsolete radio towers gently moan when you pass underneath them, the sounds of distant gunshots can be heard occassionally, dust devils whip sand around....there is certainly a lot of variety here.Gameplay: The quest and general `RPG' structure is solid. While the main plot is relatively straightforward, you are better off ignoring it altogether and focusing on the myriads of additional quests available in the game. Most of the side-quests are quite involving and thoroughly entertaining. As far as quest decisions go, let me just say that the consequences carry a lot of weight and there are several potential outcomes in most cases. Fallout NV's world is not black or white - there are (several) shades of gray to consider. At key points, I found myself struggling to lock in on a particular dialogue response  - and I mean that as a compliment. The combat is fun as ever - at least whenever you're in VATs. Out of VATs it can still feel a little lame. This is a much more challenging game than F3. I was getting my butt handed to me early on. Also, if you haven't leveled up high enough and you spot a Deathclaw - you better run the other way. Trust me. There are several companions that you can find along the way, including a dutiful eyebot that `sounds off' with bravado every time you engage in combat. I love the little guy. Unfortunately as great as the gameplay mechanics are, there are also several bugs that mire the surface. For one, companions don't seem to respond to the parameters you set. I specifically instruct my human squad-mate not to engage unless I do, and s/he runs up guns blazing every single time. There are several other bugs but my understanding is that a comprehensive patch is coming out or has just come out recently.In closing I have to say that Fallout New Vegas is a fantastic game. Early on I was very worried about how it would turn out given Obsidian's misfire with Alpha Protocol, but I'll happily admit that my fears were unfounded. Yes there are some major bugs, but the overall package is tremendously entertaining and can easily eat up 70+ hours of your life. I wouldn't mind Obsidian taking over development of all future Fallout games. The amount of business the resurrected franchise is earning Zenimedia, further sequels are a no-brainer. I hope they spend more time ironing out the cracks...in the meantime, Bethesda can get busy with an Elder Scrolls V.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2010"}

First off, I should say this is my first serious Tomb Raider game, having not gotten into any of the previous generation's TR titles (I'm a Halo/God of War/Uncharted kind of guy), but having seen Tomb Raider announced at E3 I was instantly drawn in by the epic trailer.  So, how's the game?  Brilliant, epic, sometimes frustrating.  Is it perfect?  No.  The graphics are gorgeous, the combat is quite fun and the character/story is fun.  However, I had issues with the time it took for Lara to reload guns in particular (and died more times than I should've - maybe it was me, but it happened way too frequently for my liking) and near the ending I got tired of how many times you have to do the same thing over and over in three &#34;parts&#34; to take down the last bad guy.  Still, that's not enough to take away from the overall awesomeness of Tomb Raider.

Huang is a spoiled rich kid who expects everything to run smoothly, but his trip does not go exactly as planned. Only minutes after arriving at the Liberty City airport at the far end of town, he is robbed and left to die. Only through quickly thinking is he able to survive and make his way back to his neighborhood, but the damage to he and his family has been done. Now his destiny is to search for honor, riches and revenge in the most dangerous and morally bankrupt city in the world.GameplayThe largest DS game to date,Chinatown Warsis set in theGrand Theft Auto IV-imagined version of Liberty City, and contains most of its boroughs and neighborhoods. In exploring and exploiting this vast area, players use the game's rotatable camera to take in a 3D, 360-degree view of their environment, providing an elevated and somewhat skewed third-person perspective, that switches to first-person with the appropriate player action. Assuming the role of Huang Lee your goal is to rise up in the ranks of the underworld to challenge the Triad of Chinatown gangs that have usurped your family's position and recover the stolen heirloom and your lost honor. In trueGTAfashion this entails gameplay that embraces the seedy underbelly that Liberty City is famous for. Throughout the game's 70+ missions -- all of which can be replayed even after completion -- and its myriad of side quests, players earn cash by completing jobs ranging from petty street crime, all the way up to drug dealing and assassination. As in otherGTAreleases, rising competence at crime raises the amount of attention received by police, but unlike previous games here players can not simply outrun alerted authorities. With each additional star added to your 'wanted rating' players must disable or destroy more of the pursuing police units to keep them off your tail. In addition to mission play, the game also contains many opportunities, such as the safe cracking and car hot-wiring mini-games and the various items and weapons hidden throughout the game that demand skill with the DS' touchscreen and stylus for success. By whatever means, once players have attained a certain level of cash and street cred they will also be able to recruit members for their own gang who pledge their loyalty by allowing themselves to be tattooed with the mark of the player's choosing.Cars and ControlsCars and control schemes play a prominent role inChinatown Wars. All cars feature GPS functionality based on available roadways. Directions are shown on the lower of the DS' two screens as part of the in-game PDA interface, but players may take vehicles off roads wherever possible, with the GPS automatically resetting when back on the pavement. While driving players also have access to five in-game radio stations and use of their weapons. Your PDA provides efficient management tools for your growing crime empire, including quick weapons switching, a running total of available cash, in-game e-mail and Internet access and nearly instant game saves any time. The control scheme inChinatown Warsutilizes an easy to use and comfortable to play combination of steering via the D-pad, choice of action through the face buttons and/or stylus taps and manual and automatic weapon locks and unlocks via shoulder buttons.Key Game Features:The Largest DS Game Ever- Contemporary Liberty City is a massive world complete with pedestrians, weather and traffic patterns, five different radio stations and four different sprawling boroughs to explore.Endless Gameplay- Mature storyline with over 70+ story missions; plus dozens of side quests, collectibles, contextual mini-games and the all new mission replay feature.Street Economics- Addictive drug dealing side game with 6 different drug types, 80+ drug dealers and a supply / demand driven narcotics economy.Play with Friends- Nintendo Wi-Fi mode for head-to-head and co-op multiplayer mayhem.Bragging Rights- Chat, trade guns and commodities with your friends, and compete for glory via online tournaments and leaderboards on the Rockstar Games Social Club.PDA Interface- Use the touch screen as a PDA device to set GPS waypoints, change radio stations, communicate via e-mail with in-game characters and order weapons on the Internet.Online Bragging Rights and MultiplayerCare has been taken to ensure that players can share theirChinatown Warsexperiences with friends and fellow players in different ways.

This whole Richter/Dracula thing should have been removed.After that's over, the REAL game begins, but unfortunately that's not true.  It doesn't begin yet.  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle (which you unfortunately have no control over).  Once he's inside and the gate closes, you can now play as him, but wait a minute.  There's no music playing in the background.  A game can't really start if there's no music, because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting.Luckily, my worst fear didn't come true (that Konami forgot to put music in the game) and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in.  It's about time!  You had me worried there!But then more problems arise.  In the same little area where the music kicks in, you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you, and many times you never see these zombies coming until it's too late and you take a hit.  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable.Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria.  She's extremely attractive, and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons.  And that's a big problem.  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turn-on to the player that it's very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest.  After a Maria encounter, you can't stop thinking about her beautiful pale face, those big beautiful eyes, that smooth relaxing voice, and so then what happens after that is, when you are in the middle of a serious battle, you almost always die because you can't stop thinking about Maria's beautiful face.Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games.  I shouldn't have to say it, but I think it's obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a good-looking woman, because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere.  They shouldn't have made her look so pretty.  Because of this, only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure.  Had she been less attractive, guys would be able to better concentrate on the game.You're probably thinking by now \"Alright, talk about the actual GAME!\"  Okay, I will, but you won't like what I have to say.  It's just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic.  Basically, it all boils down to one thing.  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow, weak and almost useless.  Yes, I'm talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador.  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game.  But because they did, we have no choice but to put up with them, and I have no choice but to complain.  These two weapons really drag the game down.I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game.  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you, which if you ask me, lacks creativity.  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight, but no, they had to go with the old predictable mirror match.Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them, forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen.  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence, we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse, we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if we're not careful.  A little bit of blood is fine, but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful.  It's enough to terrorize you.  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you won't have to attack them, though in many places, avoiding enemies won't be easy.Finally, the biggest problem.  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down, so it's not really a new castle.  Now that's what I call clumsy.  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place, it feels like I'm watching a porno blood fest.  Not a pretty thought, is it?  So as you can see, many problems prevent this game from being a classic.  Don't even think about buying it.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2004"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet.

{"product_name":"B002MWSY3O","reviewerName":"andrew806","summary":"Kool","reviewText":"Not everyone is born with the ability to dance, so thankfully Just Dance doesn't require you to be the next Michael Jackson. All it asks is for you to drop any inhibitions and shake your groove thing to some classic pop hits. While the dance routines are well choreographed and a lot of fun, the game's control scheme is imprecise and so the gameplay ultimately becomes frustrating and unrewarding. Just Dance also omits many features that are common in the rhythm genre, such as a career mode, downloadable songs, and rewards for good performances. What you're left with is more of an interactive dance video than a game, and while that can be fun in short bursts, the appeal soon wears thin.The premise of Just Dance is incredibly simple. You pick a song to dance to, hold the Wii Remote in your right hand, and copy the moves of the virtual dancer onscreen. This simplicity makes the game accessible to newcomers, who won't have to worry about learning complex control schemes. Up to four players can get together for a dance-off, each competing for points, which are awarded based on movements tracked by the Wii Remote. Each move is scored as bad, OK, or great, and at the end of each song you're given an overall score and can see how it compares to your friends'. If you're bad, you don't have to worry about failing; you just carry on with a low score.This is fortunate, because the game isn't particularly good at recognising your dancing performance. Even if you make the instructed movements, you're often awarded with poor ratings, which is a minor problem in the standard Quick Play mode but a real issue in some of the other modes. For example, Strike a Pose mode requires you to freeze at random moments during a song, with the stillest pose earning more points. No matter how still you stand, though, it's nigh on impossible to get the game to recognise this. Last One Standing mode is even worse. You start out with seven lives, and you lose a life for each bad move or gain a life for every five great moves. Not only is this imbalanced, but the poor controls result in a frustrating experience where it's difficult to keep going for a worthwhile length of time.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2011"}

But let's get back on topic shall we? So, this is definitely the best DC fighting game to date. The only other exception would have to be Mortal Kombat VS DC Universe, which cannot compare to the awesomeness of Injustice.Injustice offers a lineup of DC heroes and DC villains to play as in Multipayer splitscreen or Online.The campaign however, is similar to Mortal Kombat 9, but that doesn't mean it isn't epic! It's a pretty cool story, and I highly recommend playing it. By similar, I refer to the chapter system and character swapping. No spoilers from me of course!There are also DLC characters that have been released throughout the time this game has been released, and most of them/if not all, do not disappoint, and are worth the extra dollars.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is interested in DC comics, or any fighting genre game (Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat, Tekken, etc.)Note: The game is only 2 player local. Just in case any of you would be wondering.I truly have a blast with this game when friends are around. Very fun and worth the money.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00007KQE9","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"WAY better than number 3","reviewText":"Honestly, you'd think that Dynasty Warriors was done after number 3. For those who are complaining that its \"the same thing\" I certainly hope you don't play Resident Evil or Mega Man X series because they're kinda the same too.Even to those who've played number 3 this is worth a try. There are now over 50 levels and several new characters to behold. Weapons are now more innovative and body guards do more than just get [killed], they actually...well, body guard.Also, you can now edit and create your own character and body guards. Of course this brings alot more to the gameplay. Also, the music is different, but in my eyes isn't that much better.The storyline and gameplay haven't changed at all, but the difficulty is really elevated.The next thing to note is the sudden increase in levels. Where as Dynasty warriors 3 had 22 levels, this one has over 50. Thats 18+ new levels. Also, for each force it has more of a story or \"Acts\" as they're called in the game. The missions are about more than just finding the main person and killing them this time. Some require you to find a specific item (such as one where you must find the Imperial Seal) and if the enemy finds it you must stop there escape.This is actually a lot better. Sure, its the same gameplay, but each new Dynasty Warriors game is most an expansion of the previous one anyway, they're just supposed to ADD more.  No one said you had to buy the next one over and over again. By now, you should expect it to be more of the same thing, thus we don't have much of a right to complain...Anyway, weapons are different as well. Now, you must gain experience by defeating and scoring combos on Generals. Not to mention that as a result, it teaches you to be more greedy with your KO's (and we really should be). You're body guards rise in level as well.Also, another new addition is more things to do in the challenge mode and Versus mode. There is a new challenge mode that sees how many you can knock off a bridge and a new time attack mode. The Versus Mode has been extended as well. Now, you can duel with your friend one on one whenever you want. Speaking of duels, generals still have the same boring intro, but this time you'll be asked to a dual. The downside is that if you don't duel the entire force morale goes down and so you feel as if you're forced. Dueling with one general is like your basic fighter (but you can't jump), you're given a set basic time limit to end the duel. Its complete one on one and it works well. You get about 45 seconds which is more than enough time.There are plenty of new additions but I'm currently still exploring the game for myself, I shall post another review later on.But for me to keep going. You still have the same items, but they too, level up. Some are better than others, as usual, but they're easier to organize. The series has a small RPG like role in which you equip only certain parts of your characters. Not as free as in DW3, but it works none the less and brings the difficulty up.But some of the bad. The same glitches from DW3 and DW2 are still there. The ones where the enemies disappear and \"pop up\" like they did in the previous installments. Also, in the beginning its VERY hard because some Generals can take you out in ONE combo.THE GOOD+Plenty of updates+New Levels and characters+Innovative weapons and items system+More difficulty+Good sound+Smoother graphics+Same easy controls+Eidt Generals and Bodyguards!THE BAD-It still has those glitches (Random enemies pop up out of nowhere or aren't where they indicate on the radar)-Same gameplay (I know I said not to complain but since some are gonna want to know)-The new \"General Duels\" are somewhat forced upon you-The one on one in VS.

That wasn't the only cool thing to happen that night.  I also was allowed to pick out a present.  Nothing too expensive, just a little something to keep me entertained.  We walked to a video store that was ready to go out of business.  They had some WWF wrestling videos (back then it was called WWF, not WWE like today), and I was about to buy a video because the prices were cheap and I was a big wrestling fan at the time.  But then I noticed a nearly-empty shelf to the left of the wrestling tapes where The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past was sitting.It wasn't in the best condition.  The cardboard box was in fine shape, but the instruction booklet was all screwed up.  Looked like a dog went crazy on it.  All the pages in the booklet were there, the print was certainly readable, I could turn the pages okay, but certain pages were crinkled.  In fact the front page of the instruction booklet was so crinkled it was as soft as toilet paper!  The price of the game was reasonable, and the game cartridge was in pretty good condition.  So I asked my dad's friends for the Zelda game and they bought it for me.But I made a mistake.  A few days later my cousin came to my house.  I was thinking about hiding it because I knew my cousin was a big Zelda fan and was extremely eager to play the one and only Zelda game on the Super NES.  I wanted to play through the game and THEN let him borrow it.  I thought about it for a few minutes but decided not to hide it.  If I had done that, I would've felt guilty about it after he walked out the door.  He's my cousin, and I love him, and we get along great.  So I just couldn't do it.So I prepared myself for what was to come... my cousin begging me &quot;please PLEASE let me borrow it!  PLEEEEEEEEEASE!!!&quot;  I gave in and let him borrow it.  He borrowed it for a couple weeks and beat the game before I hardly even had the chance to play it.  But I'm glad he enjoyed it, because his enthusiasm over the game got me more excited to play it, when he returned it.I've since lost the game and don't know for sure what happened to it.  I think I gave it away to a high school friend in 1998.  I figured \"I'm done with the game.  I don't need to play it anymore.  Time to move on to other things\".Stupid me and my big wrong mind!I plan on buying it again because lately I've been having severe urges to play it.  You know the urges are getting stronger when you begin dreaming about it!Even though I had a lot of fun playing The Legend of Zelda: Link to the Past in the mid-90's, and probably went through the quest at least 30 times, I don't think I appreciated the game as much as I should have.  I don't think I realized back in 1995 that I was playing a classic Nintendo game.  I didn't realize Zelda: Link to the Past has a perfect balance of RPG, action, and adventure, and not many games can successfully pull off such a daring idea.  I should have known that if anybody could do it, it'd be Nintendo.It's a very colorful game.  I think the colors help make the graphics look better.  I wouldn't say the graphics are bad, though.  I don't think Nintendo could have improved on the graphics because this IS an early 90's game after all, and Nintendo was in the beginning stages of finding out what the Super Nintendo could do.  Nintendo found out the Super NES could do much more and go much further than originally expected when Star Fox and Donkey Kong Country were created.I don't think Zelda: Link to the Past is a very challenging game, except in certain places, but it does have its fair share of tricky moments.  I guarantee you will beat it eventually though, and it's much easier than the original Legend of Zelda on the NES.  As for the music, everything sounds very clear and ahead of its time.  The music plays in all the appropriate places too.  The dark places have quiet, spooky music.  The music in the lighter, happier areas of the land give off an energetic and confident feeling, making it feel like Link is on top of the world and nothing can go wrong.  Expect to hear mellow themes which might bring you to tears.  I'll have a tissue box waiting for you in case it happens!  Supposedly the guy who created the music in this game is a master of coming up with incredibly fitting orchestral themes.  And I believe that to be true.You probably won't need any kind of strategy guide.  I didn't need one, except to look up information for a couple heart pieces I was having trouble finding (even though it's not necessary to find all the heart pieces).  I also needed help reaching the third castle in the Dark World (which IS necessary to completing the game).  But that's it.  And I didn't have the internet in the mid-90's, so I had to ask friends for help.Not many weapons and items are hidden in crazy locations (except the flute maybe, but it's not that difficult to find).  So you won't often be looking at your TV screen with a confused look on your face wondering where something is, because most of the time you just have to walk around talking to people and experimenting with your weapons and items and eventually you will find what you need to progress further into the quest.  So if you come across something unusual and don't know the purpose of it, try some of your items on it to see if anything happens.Excellent game in every way, and hopefully when I buy it again I'll be able to appreciate all the time and energy that went into making it.  You can count on wasting many hours playing through this exciting adventure.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2004"}

After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable.

{"product_name":"B001L8DKJ8","description":"InPrinny: Can I Really Be The Hero?players are treated to a single player spin-off from the popular role-playing (RPG) universe ofDisgaea. Here players step into the unlucky shoes of a penguin called a Prinny and 999 of his comrades as you slash your way through various Netherworld areas in side-scrolling service to the Demon Lord Etna. Although the mission that you are saddled with is ridiculously comic, the action you face is not, so you're given 1,000 lives to work with and you can use everything you find on the battlefield to help you survive and succeed.Caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }Classic side-scrolling action.View larger.Challenging difficulty levels.View larger.Multiple vehicles &amp; aircraft.View larger.The StoryPrinnies are the reincarnated souls of evil humans trapped in purgatory. Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"Brian Cheek","summary":"Charming Throwback.","reviewText":"I Just impulse bought this off PSN for $7.99. I know it's cheap right. I can see why the game has grown in popularity. It's a beautiful throw back to the old days. Kind of like old school Ninja Gaiden, with humor. For those of us who are NIS fans... This is an obvious choice. For those who are not. Remember when you had limited life, everything relied of precision platforming, bosses took real strategy, and all you had was a few simple attacks. In a gaming era littered by 5 hr first person shooter campaigns and 100+ hour open world variations it's nice to sit back with a pick up and play old timer like this. I recommend this game to the 80's and 90's gamers. As well as the new generation. There is a heritage of gaming to be found...

I just got it when the price dropped to $18.  I've played to Chapter 3 so I think I am well enough in it to give an opinion but I will update this later if I see that things have gotten better or worse in the game.  So here is a quick good vs bad.Good:-Simply fun to play.  You know how some games get slammed for graphics and stuff, yet you find this guilty pleasure in playing it... cause it's just simple mindless fun without all the complicated controls and long story cut scenes?  You know how when you come home from work and school and just wanna chill and play a game and kill stuff without worrying about the mechanics?  This is the perfect game for that.  Think Splatterhouse.  Horrible reviews, but a huge guilty pleasure for a lot of people.- Magic spells and moves.  Not as many varieties as I'd like but it is fun to use these.- Simple story.  Well, this is a con too as it's sorta boring but they don't seem to take it too seriously at all so you don't really feel like it's in your face.  It's just enough to move it along for what it is.- Variety in environments.  To me this keeps it from feeling repetitive.-Co op.  I have a friend who got this the same time i did so we can play together.  Awesome idea and very fun.- Plays seamlessly.  You don't sit and look at loading screens hardly at all.  They did a good job of loading during door opening animations that don't take long at all to happen.- AI seems to do well in battles so far.. but i heard it can get bad later in the game which I haven't experienced yet.Bad:- Cool environments but some horrible textures at times.  Some of the textures you can clearly see them tiling on the models (ie dungeon walls) and they are pixelated and have no normal maps or bump maps on them.  It looks really bad cause some of the other textures in the same environment look good.  Overall, it looks and feels unfinished in this area.  Pop in textures all over the place but that doesn't bother me as much.- AI character gets in the way ALL THE TIME.  This is minor but can get annoying since they went out of their way to make a few audio clips like \"Hey get out of my way\" etc but they didn't take the time to just make sure the AI doesn't just stay in FRONT of you and force you to push it a out of the way.  It seems small but after a while it can get really annoying.- Glitches.  I only ran into some minor ones like the character shaking weird but then on time I went past an invisible wall and it looked like maybe i found a secret area.. until i fell through the floor and was floating then died.  That really made the game seem like it was in BETA stage for me...- Online co op is basically usless.  Hard to find a match at all.  But that's not really the game's fault that not a lot of people bought this and play this.- Sound can be lacking some times.  There are areas where there is no environment sound at all, but you still hear a few birds and foot steps... but no atmosphere.  It just sounds odd.  But then other areas they add it.  Again, feels unfinished.- Worst title screen ever.  Who designed that?  It just makes the game look low budget right from the intro.  Looks like little to no effort was put into making it.  Come on guys, show some love for your own game and make the title screen look good.  I know this seems nit picky, but I want to feel excited to press start.  With this game, I feel like taking it out when I see that title screen.- Hit detection a little off. Not too bad but sometimes you have the enemy right in the middle of the cross hairs and you shoot but it doesn't hit them at all.  Not too often this happens but it does happen.  Not so bad that it ruins gameplay though.- Can't go backwards after opening doors.  Some times you may open a door just cause you are curious and it turns out it is the way to the next area.  You can avoid this by using your direction indicator with L3 that shows you where you need to go, but some times you will forget.  So if you open that door, you can't go back and pick up things you missed.  Again, this can add to replay value and it's not a huge problem, but it will frustrate you from time to time.Overall this game is fun.  Splatterhouse got HORRIBLE reviews and it was still a blast to play in my opinion.  This game seems more glitchy than Splatterhouse... and the latter has more exciting gameplay, but this is  still fun.  So why all the hate?  To me a game may be perfect in every way and still some how end up being boring to play.. I'm looking at you Mass Effect 1 and Dragon Age 1.  Sorry but those are great games that managed to put me to sleep when I tried to play them after a long day at work.  The long cut scenes and dialog was good but just not very fun when it comes to actually PLAYING a game.  This game doesn't have the awesome graphics, is glitchy and has almost no story... yet I can play for hours and feel like I had fun, relaxed and not bored.  Guess it comes down to taste and what you prefer at different times.  This is the game you want when you are looking for mindless kill monsters fun.  It's cheap enough now to warrant a purchase in my opinion.  If this game didn't have fun gameplay then I would say don't bother... it sucks.  That's sorta how i felt about Lair.. but that's another review lol.Anyway, that's my two cents.  Happy gaming.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2011"}

You really feel like you're in a high budget action movie full of 100% destructible environments and tons of stylish moves. You can run up railings, slide down them, back flip off walls, do Max Payne/Matrix dives, slow down time. You have a few cool abilities such as a sniper shot where you can precisely shoot an area on the enemy and enjoy the awesome animations. You have a Barrage power where you are invincible, can shoot 10 times faster, and have infinite ammo for a few seconds, and a spin attack which kills everyone in the room.The graphics and audio is top notch and looks great and there isn't any slow down even with hundreds of things flying around the room. There are a bunch of interesting unlockables in here as well. The story is somewhat interesting but is really confusing and feels incomplete. Tequila is trying to get his family back from two rivaling gangs known as the Russian I-9s and the Chinese Dragon Claws. It's short, confusing, and kind of boring really. While all this is good and all the game is extremely short where you can finish it in less than 10 hours, and the game gets really repetitive after about half way through.

I have never done that with a game. Not a bad thing, but I usually take my time and enjoy the stroll through. I got this on STEAM for almost FREE, so I thought I'd see what all the hype was about. Most played game in history? OR was that #1? I'm not sure but I thought I read this was the number one played video game ever.Since Steam had this game for sale for only a couple of bucks, it was a steal. I got my two bucks worth in one day! Game looks awesome on pc. Play is pretty straight forward on single player. No getting lost in some huge environment. Enemies can be exited with one shot many times. I really think I like to play it again, and that is the ultimate rating for me. Can I play it again? YES!!The only other reviewers I know, two kids 8 and 10(not mine), finished it faster than me. I guess they liked it too.The game hops around the world and gives you multi-environs to fight through, which really does give the game a nice feel. (This is not a spoiler, but an important alert)The only negative about the game, for me, there is a mini level, where you are WITH some terrorists running through an airport and mass annihilating(I personally did not shoot one) airport passengers and employees(NOT enemies). I really want to know what this had to do with a game that kids are playing?? At the end of the level, you are personally assassinated by the head terrorist, what?! I think the game gives you an option to delete this level of offensiveness, which I didn't do, but might try to delete on a play through again. The game doesn't make it clear what offensiveness you will encounter.It is a straight up shooter with very little other to offer. The great amount of different countries and environments was the overriding factor for me finishing this game. Each levels sends you to a different part of the world. Excellent feature. Take DOOM3, game play never varied from start to finish, which bored me to no end, and I ended it before the finish. There are no puzzles or anything perplexing either.

{"product_name":"B002I090AG","description":"","reviewerName":"H. Wang \"nycmode\"","summary":"My simple, layman's review for the 3DS","reviewText":"Quick background:- I should open a video game museum as I own almost all incarnations of home/handheld consoles from the Atari to now.- I was a huge fan of the DSi- I play my DS an average of an hour to three hours a day, depending on the day.Quick summary:- It's a no-brainer, great buy if you are a fan of Nintendo/DS games.- If you're on the fence about this, I would still say it's worth a buy, and here's the reason why below.- The 3D effects are very cool.  Now I would like to point out that it's not going to be all about \"in your face\" effects that you see in some cheesy 3D movies, but rather many of the games emphasize the more subtle side of 3D, sort of like what you saw if you watched Avatar in 3D, where the background effects have depth and add a bit of realism to the environment. (Games like Pilotwings are a great example of this).- Will you get a headache?  It depends on the amount of eye strain you can handle.  It will take a moment to get adjusted to the 3D effect, but for me I was okay within a few minutes.  But I do recommend taking breaks as the eye strain for this is a bit more than your standard handheld.- You need to obviously focus on the \"sweet spot\" which is looking directly at the top 3D screen at a specific angle and distance.  If you're the kind of player that moves the DS around in your hand, you might find instances where you'll get disoriented.- The battery life is okay.  It wasn't as horrible as I thought it would be, but if you crank up the 3D effect and also use WiFi a lot, obviously it will drain a lot faster.- I like the fact you charge the 3DS on a nice cradle, which makes it easy.- The 3D camera is a nice fun gimmick.  I agree with other reviewers that these are not meant to replace real cameras, but I have to admit, I really like how you can take 3D photos and view them.  I thought it made the image feel more real and sort of helped me capture that mental moment in my head even better.- I like how it is backwards compatible with old DS games.  Bear one thing in mind, the aspect ratio of the bottom screen is different in the 3DS from the old DS.  If you want you can hold the Start and Select buttons while selecting the game from the 3DS menu to have it display in the correct aspect ratio.  However, it does make the image seem tiny, so it may be worth just playing your old DS games on your old DS itself.- The cost is a bit high, but still seems reasonable given the nice upgrades and the fact you're paying a premium to play on a device that offers something that isn't available elsewhere at the moment.- The games right now are okay, but in my opinion there aren't any killer, must-own launch apps that are in the market right now.  Yes I had fun playing PilotWings, Street Fighter, Lego Star Wars, Bubble Bobble etc, but in the end there's nothing there that's blowing my mind.  However, there are good games just around the corner like Zelda, so I don't think the situation is that bleak.Conclusion:- All in all a must get for Nintendo fans- Worth getting just so you can experience the fun of subtle 3D gaming- Battery life not awesome, but not as terrible as I thought.  Easy charging on a cradle is a plus.- Backwards compatibility with DS is good.- The device is comfortable to hold, and feels more substantial than the DSi.- It's a great device for kids, and lots of options for parents to control content is a huge plus.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-18-2011"}

{"product_name":"B007XVTR5S","description":"","reviewerName":"Clayton J. Gibbs \"Horror Soundtrack Collector\"","summary":"Solid COD Game","reviewText":"Initially I was considering avoiding this title for a while, mainly because of the futuristic feel about it.  I'm glad I didn't pass it up.  After getting really bored with MW3, I converted to being a heavy Battlefield 3 player and didn't touch a single Call of Duty game for almost a year.  When I saw the launch trailer I thought, \"Oh great, now COD is going HALO\".  Not so much.So far I've played a little campaign and a little MP and haven't had a minute for Zombies.  The campaign is actually better than the first Black Ops and that isn't saying much.  But, I bought the game primarily for MP and had a hard time getting away from the campaign because it was highly engaging.  It's a good mix between the past in COD and the now future of 2025.  The variety was interesting enough for me to play well into five missions and the options of choosing your load-out is a sweet perk.  Graphically, the single campaign is beautiful, although the MP is not on the same par.MP-wise, the perks, weapons upgrades and maps are the same formula.  COD is an arcade, pick-up-and-play MP and Black Ops 2 dominates in this genre.  After getting sophisticated with tactics in Battlefield 3, this was a refreshing game experience.  I won't getting crazy into detail about all of the changes, but if you've been a fan of the others, you'd be sure to like this one.  There are a few bugs, which is to be expected, but they'll get worked out.Lastly, I want to add that Medal of Honor: Warfighter is a terrible game overall, so if you are shopping around for FPS games, skip that one even if it's in a $20 bargain bin and I'm dead serious.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

Contra 4 takes advantage of the dual screens of the Nintendo DS to deliver larger than life action, with massive enemies, detailed platform gaming and mind-blowing set pieces. Using a variety of upgradable weapons, take the fight to the alien army of the Black Viper and reclaim Earth for Mankind in single-player or 2 player co-op mode.","reviewerName":"Hongster","summary":"Old School Contra","reviewText":"For those who are not familiar with the Contra series, it is a platform shooter which began as an arcade series and made it's way unto the NES, SNES, Genesis, PS1, PS2, and now the DS.  This is the 4th version of Contra, but it is worthy to be called the \"true sequel\" to Treasure's Contra III: The Alien Wars.The game is very similar to many of the Contra games in the past, for instance the 1st stage is almost an exact replica of the 1st stage from Contra I, and there are many other stages that are heavily borrowed from other games as well (most notably Contra I, Super C, and Contra III).  This is not a bad thing at all mind you and for those who think that taking ideas from older games is a step back in development does not know about how the series took a major fall ever since Contra III.This game is not easy and that's how Contra games are supposed to be played.  There are 3 modes of game play: Easy, Normal and Hard.  On easy you get 5 continues and 10 lives, on Normal you get 3 continues and 5 lives and so on (the game is very difficult so if you never had any experience with any Contra games, be prepared to lose a lot of lives on the 1st stage).  The game includes 6 power ups which are: Machine Gun, Spread Gun, C Cannon/Blast, Homing Missiles, Fire and Laser.  You are allowed to have 2 different weapons (which can be switched with the 'L' button) and the weapons can be powered by twice (normal and hard mode), otherwise if you are playing on Easy, the weapon is powered to the max after getting it.The game play is very similar to Contra III, except for a few minor inclusions such as a grappling hook and with the DS you will utilize both screens for playing the game.  You will not use the bottom touch screen as all functions are done by the button pads.Conclusion: If you have been waiting for a true sequel for Contra III, then get this game as it will satisfy you with the tight controls and challenging game play.  For those who never tried out the series I advise you that this game is not easy at all (even on easy) so be prepared to be frustrated if you cannot pass the 1st stage.  Also, this game requires 2 DS carts to play multi player mode (trust me you do not want to play solo and this game was always meant to be played together)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-16-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"Smithy1185","summary":"Two GTA games in one great package","reviewText":"I have owned this game since the day it came out and I still play it on a regular basis.

Another great thing about the Xbox versions is that they have improved graphics and effects that the PS2 versions did not. The load times are also much improved as well. The only problem that I can find is that sometimes there is a bit of slowdown in certain parts and you can see that the games would look much better if designed from the ground up for the Xbox. Anyways this is a great collection worth getting if you have never played or owned these incredible games before. If you already own both on the PS2, it probably isn't worth buying again but the faster load times and improved graphics are a nice bonus.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2005"}

Seriously, what fan of BF1 wouldn't get excited over 4 player split screen. thats my favorite addition for sure as I have many Battlefront buddies. The fact you can now play as jedi and sith is a brilliant addition and it works great. I loved the Episode III game for its playable jedi and awesome lightsaber action. I gotta say though, BF2 does the whole jedi thing much better. Now I'm not raggin on ROTS, I gave it 5 stars. But really, the addition of lightsaber weilding characters is not just a cheap gimick. Its done very well. Space combat is another great addition to the BF universe. And although its recieved tons of hype, it doesnt need a whole lot of explaining. you fight in space battles now such as the ones from episode 3 and 5.

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new. Additional new features that players can expect to experience include new alien races, a more realistic damage system, a new heavy weapons system allowing for maximum damage, a regenerative health system, a dramatic increase in the number of character animations available to Shepard, and updates to the dialogue mechanic used when conversing with NPCs.Integration with the OriginalMass EffectMass Effect 2allows players of the originalMass Effectgame to import save games to continue the story of their own Commander Shepard.

It hadn't really ever existed in the form we think of for quite some time, with cowboys and Indians and gunslingers and the like. That era lasted only for a couple years and was largely gone by the late 1800's. By 1911 we had movies, telephones, electricity, cars and, despite what the intro to this game would have you believe, airplanes. It was the tail end of the Gilded Age, and only three years from the start of World war One.This is the West were \"Red Dead Redemption\" takes place. It centers around a man, John Marston, a long-since retired criminal who, against his will, is essentially forced into being a bounty hunter. He's sent out west and spends the game running after criminals so that he can see his family again. It's a simple, serviceable plot, and hardly original, but as with many things the genius is in the execution, and this game executes the story quite well, with several great side quests, a wonderful voice cast and a strong central theme.The gameplay is really great! If you've played \"Grand Theft Auto IV\", you know the controls. They've been refined a bit here and are very easy to use, even if it is a bit odd to be riding around on a horse instead of a car. I also like shooting system, which even though it's third-person, works quite well, taking you into an optional slo-mo shooting mode that enables you to shoot to wound and not kill. It also makes small game hunting much easier.There's also much to do in the game, from gambling to collecting flowers. You can buy locations, though you can't do much with them. You can collect different outfits. You can even go to see a movie (though the developers lost a real chance to do something impressive with that feature, like scrolling some pre-1911, public domain pictures, such as \"A Corner in Wheat\"). And of course as you'd expect, you can be a good guy or a bad guy, though being the latter is much less fun.What to say about the graphics? My goodness, but they're impressive. I live in Arizona and there's quite a lot of beauty here that's reproduced in the game. The detail is amazing, as is the variety, where the parts that are in Mexico look and feel very different from the parts in the USA.Really I don't have anything bad to say about the game. It does a great job of reproducing the look and feel of an era that was already on the way out by the time the game takes place. It's fun, enjoyable and gives great value for the money!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"B. Wright","summary":"Good idea wrapped in bad execution","reviewText":"Envision a world of Steampunky goodness covered in a layer darkness and foreboding with 'magic' fireballs and electric bolts in combination with pistols, machine guns, splicers, big daddys and genetic engineering.  Now, picture this is _not_ the world of Bioshock Infinite. This used to be Bioshock. Bioshock Infinite now takes us on a trip into the clouds and it's not a very good trip at that.We still see a bit of that Steampunk feel, but wrapped in a FPS that could have been released in the year 2000. In other words, the gameplay has not in any way improved. In most cases, it's gotten worse. The ballistic weapons are average with the sniper rifle really being the best. The vigors are worthless even maxed out. The best you can hope to do with a vigor is stun the enemy and then finish them off with your gun.The enemies are completely repetitive and nonsensical.  Which means, you're going to see the same enemies and mini-bosses over and over and over. Anyway, your player character is tasked with locating a 'girl' to pay off a debt. In the process, his hand gets tattooed with the letters 'AD' and labeled a 'false shepherd' by some loony prophet. This loony guy calls on the citizens of Columbia (cloud city) to 'attack' the 'false shepherd' (you). This is where the game turns into a shooter.  What would motivate a whole city to don weapons in an effort to kill this 'false shepherd'? It's not as if he couldn't cover up his hand with a glove. Duh.In the original Bioshock, there were Big Daddy characters, engineered little girls, splicers and other interesting and unique characters which made that story a bit bizarre and creepy, but at the same time unique.  In Infinite, the bizarre creepy part is gone. What's left is a cliche first person shooter that copies every other FPS on the planet in enemy tactics, types of enemies and levels. But, this copying is all done without any innovation at all. No real automatic targeting, no taking cover, no stealth, no fatality kills, nothing new added to this engine to make it in any way unique or new. Worse, once the 'big' battles start, you're trapped in the area until the fight is done. In other words, it's a glorified generic boss based FPS.The story is so weak as to be almost non-existent and the motivation for people to kill your player character is just ludicrous. In reality, Irrational most have been hoping we'd be so enamored by the gameplay that we would overlook the silly story. Well, I'm here to tell you, that thinking didn't work. Worse, the vigors (magic) are just as weak as the story. Weaker even. Spend all the money you like on upgrading your vigors. Unfortunately, they'll never be strong enough to kill even the weakest of adversaries, let alone bosses. Sure, you can use them to stun an enemy and then finish them off with a bullet. But, that's the extent of the stupid weak vigors in this game. I found that the sniper rifle is the best weapon as long as you can get a clear headshot. It can at least kill many things in one shot, unlike the silly weak vigors. With bigger characters, this gun also seems to do the most damage.Infinite also uses checkpoint saves spread out exceedingly far apart in the game. So, if you aren't careful and you quit out of the game (or your console crashes), expect to retrace your footsteps again to the point where the next save is. I'm not a big fan of check point autosaves for exactly this reason, especially when you could play for 30 minutes and never see an autosave happen.If you're a big fan of the Bioshock series, Infinite may be worth a single play through. That doesn't mean you'll like it. So, I'd suggest renting this one. Keep in mind that it does not, at all, feel like the original Bioshock in any way. Don't go into Infinite expecting the same look and feel of the original. On the other hand, if you're not a fan of this series, I'd suggest that you save your money and your time and skip this one altogether.Graphics: 2 out of 5Gameplay: 1 out of 5Story: 2.5 out of 5Overall: 2 out of 5","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-30-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0017ZIIK6","reviewerName":"DanD","summary":"Mortal Kombat has never looked so good...","reviewText":"I grew up with Mortal Kombat, so when I recently bought a PS3 after over a decade without owning a gaming system, I knew I had to pick this game up.  Suffice it to say, I was blown away by the graphics; I know things have changed since my Super NES days, but the graphics here are amazing period.  You can see the tears in the suits, feel the concussion of the blows.  I would've preferred a little more blood, but it looks pretty violent without it.You can play the old fashion ways, in a one-player arcade mode, or two-player combat with a friend.  However, there's also a story mode that you can play from either the Mortal Kombat or the DC side.  The story itself is, well, the stuff bad comics are made out of; it's interesting, but not really believable, even in the realm of video games/comics.  The Mortal Kombat guys vs. Superman?  Much as I love Raiden and Scorpion, the Man of Steel's got this one covered with his eyes closed.  Still, the scenes play out nicely, and most of the voice cast does a solid job.  And anyways, this is a fighting game, not a story-driven game; it's pretty interesting to see these groups of characters go up against each other.There are a few flaws here, as there are with all fighting games.  The controls are often slow to respond; and the computer has far more control over its fighter than you do over yours.  The computer can block where you can't, and can perform endless series of combos, and can even inflict damage on you when you're in Rage Mode (it's pretty difficult for you to hurt the computer when the computer is in Rage Mode).  Even the Rage feature is kind of contrived; it comes in handy when you're getting your butt kicked, but overall, it's unnecessary.  We play Mortal Kombat to beat the crap out of tough-looking S.O.B.s, and by God, we get that here.  MORTAL KOMBAT vs. DC UNIVERSE isn't a perfect game, God knows; and it's probably a bit dated compared to a lot of what's out there.  But I dare you to find a game series as stress-relieving as Mortal Kombat.  And this is, by far, the best-looking, hardest-hitting Mortal Kombat game yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2009"}

While I didn't find either to be a game stopping problem, I have to admit that it was aggravating at times.  More notably, the patch caused so many other bugs that I had to play the original install errors and all.The storyline is better than the previous game, and it does look a bit nicer.  Not up to par with what it requires to run it, but I would score it with Titan Quest in looks.Many reviewers complained about the camera in this game and while I admit I was moving and adjusting it constantly, I recall doing the same thing in the first game.  The only gripe I had about the camera was that it swivels the opposite direction of what one would expect.  An annoyance yes, but nothing to make me thrown down the keyboard in frustration and stomp away crying about it.In all honesty, I found this game to be more enjoyable than NWN 1.  If you recall, the original didn't get good until the Hordes of the Underdark expansion and even that paled in comparison to the incredible fan created modules such as the HEX Coda.The huge amount of bugs and subpar graphics operating under a staggering system requirement list give this a game a rating of 3 stars.  Perhaps Obsidian (as they did for Knights of the Old Republic 2) with release a working patch of bug fixes and optimizations soon.  If and when this happens, I fully expect this game to make it just as big as the first.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2007"}

I've seen enough of EQ2 to know that it is better than EQ, but not as good as WoW.WoW makes them all look lame.  Start with quests.  Unlike EverQUEST WoW's quests are the best way to level up.  Later in the game (40+) you will level up faster just by grinding, but at least util level 30 you hardly need to grind at all.  Plus, WoWs quests are usually interesting, and some of them are outstanding (I especially like The Missing Diplomat, an Alliance Quest starting in StormWind at Level 28, in the Cathedral - speak to the altar boy).The class selection is great.  I've spent most of my time as a Mage or Paladin, both good solo classes.  Priest is harder to solo up, but they are in great demand at high levels.  The balancing of the classes is imperfect, but most people will accept any class in a group if they don't have a specific need (tank/healer), a good sign of class balance.The professions are very well done.  You get to choose two skills (so people actually trade with each other), and at higher levels the crafting skills bransh off in two or three directions (e.g. blacksmith becomes either armorsmith or weaponsmith).  You can be a miner, herbalist, skinner, engineer, blacksmith or one of several others.  Resource gathering skills are often teamed with resource using skills (miner/blacksmith), but you should consider just taking two gathering skills.  You'll be much richer in the short and medium term, and as a higher level player it's easy to power level yourself through a crafting skill.There are also three \"free\" skills anyone can learn, fishing (it's more fun than the real thing), cooking (a good way to turn junky drops into decent cash from merchants) and first aid (a good way to chew up alot of money, but really helps to solo later on, makes anyone a healer between battles).The Death penalty in WoW is extremely player-friendly.  There is no experience loss!  You either return to your corpse, or else talk to a spirit at the graveyard of the zone you died in.  If you don't get your corpse, you suffer a ten minute (online time only) penalty period, during which your stats are reduced 75%.  So the death penalty is ten minutes afk time, at the most.Note - one recurring Quest theme is condemned men not being executed quickly enough.  Parents might not want their kids playing games where humanoids are frequent targets of the player, and where human body parts are often the necessary item to bring back in a quest (usually heads and hands).The PvP system is brand new as I write.  You get points for kills (being in a large raid group gets you plenty of points).  Players are ranked, and the top ranks get a Title (Sergeant Griswel) for the following week, and a good item that is useable for as long as you keep that rank, or a higher one.  It's great if you don't mind PvPing a week at a time, the rewards are zero for the casual PvPer, but it's still fun.The only ones who will not like WoW are the truly hard-core players who want to always be more powerful than everyone else.  WoW does not require a lifetime to hit the level cap: 60.  In fact, you can hit level 60 without ever going indoors to do dungeon fighting, though that's where they keep the best stuff.  Hard-core players who want to be better than the rest of us forever will want to play an MMORPG like EQ where the top levels are all but impossible to reach without either endless time or an expert group.Specific recommendations - Pally, and Mage are the easiest to level up (the pet classes: Warlock and Hunter, are also).  I recommend a human, the human area quests are quite good, and there are enough players where finding a group is easy even on established servers.  NEVER GRIND!  Always be doing quests.  The quests will bring you into the next levels as you need to go.  Try to group.  If you need to kill ten of something, four players will get ten kills each much faster than four solo players.  In newbie areas, feel free to group up and ignore all your groupmates, you just want fast credit for the quest kills.Always do quests, they are great fun, and you level up just fine running from quest to quest til at least level 20, arguably 30.  Only then do you need to do some grinding, but not much.Grab mining and herbalism as soon as you can, and sell everything you get (sell ore, not bars, ore sells for more).  You will be rich.  Pallys get a free horse at 40, others pay either 90 gold or 100 gold, which at level 40 is alot of money for most players (but it won't be for you).Items with a grey name must be sold to a merchant, they have no use.  Items with a white name have a use, either in professions or quests or both.  Sell these at the auction house in Ironforge, especially linen cloth, wool etc.  Weapons sell for far more to merchants than armor items do.  rade Linen cloth for bags early on, and upgrade bags frequently.  Use the bank, there's tons of room there.Go into dungeons early and often.  Playing the game is a skill, and experience really helps.  The deadmines and stockades are both fun and have lots of good drops.  Find a good guuld, but do not expect high levels to do your quests for you, find a group.  In any group - one puller.  If two people are bringing in enemies the group will wipe.  Finally, be polite, never loot a Bind on Pickup item that you cannot use unless nobody else in the group can use it.  Don't even roll on it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2005"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"Snakes Last Stand...","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots is one of the (if not THE) greatest achievement in gaming history. It creates a new standard for not only stealth & action games but for all genres period. This is the last game where Solid Snake will play the main protagonist in the MGS series, and this proves to be his most heroris mission yet. The MGS series has always been knowned for its presentation, and this ones no different...the presentation beats the hell out of movies these days and no game I know has the kind of presentation that MGS4 does. The gamplay has changed and probably for the better, the new over the shoulder shooting style fits the game very well and its the best thing that could have happened to the gameplay in my opinion. The graphics and sound are the best I have ever witnessed, even Mass Effect or Halo 3 can't beat this. The game may not sell millions of copies like Halo 3 or GTA IV but it beats those games in gamplay and presentation bar none.Things have changed, Solid Snake is aging super fast and has less than a year to live in the world. But B4 he dies he has one final mission to do and that is to stop Liquid Ocelot (his brother) from controlling the world. Snake cannot do it alone so characters new and old show up to his aid to help defeat Liquid once and for all. The Game is truly breathtaking and allows certain freedom that previous Metal Gear games didn't allow u to do. For example you can either choose to kill or not kill whoever you want and it effects the game completetly. The game is taking place in wartime between the PMC's and militia and if u so happen to help militia or the PMC's they will help you in favor. The game is so diverse in so many aspects that it is truly overwhelming, over 70 weapons and items at ur disposel, new gadgets like the Metal Gear Mk.II adds a new take on the game and allows players to strategize be4 they do anything else. The new weapon system is similar to Resident Evils system of weapons where you can purchase and sell items to a gun launderer named Drebin in real time whether ur in a boss battle or just walking around scouting the area, the new system really comes in handy. The Game is truly a masterpeice and will impact the gaming world without a doubt.PROS:PRESENTATION - The Metal Gear series has always been known for its gripping storyline and breathtaking cutscenes and this one is no different. From the minute you start playing you alrady feel like you are part of the game, thats how powerful it is. (10/10GAMEPLAY - the game provides diverse gamplay for both practical and veteran players. The new over-the-shoulder aiming system to the new weapons system to the new gadgets like the Metal Gear Mk.II OctoCamo and even an \"IPOD\" the game is really fun to play and mess around with. (9.5/10)GRAPHICS - the game is BEAUTIFUL in every aspect. To the character models faces to the shadow and particle effects. This is the best looking game I have ever seen, it has one of the most realistic water effects in any game, the dirt and snow effects are surreal. Every little technical detail is amazing, this game beats the rest out of the park in graphics, I haven't yet seen a prettier game. (10/10)SOUND - This is where the game really shines, the voice acting is the best in the business. Long-time fans will never get enough of David Hayters voice (Solid Snakes voice) he improvises since Snake is now Old Snake emphasis on the \"Old\" part. The voice-acting is so natural that you would actually believe these characters were real-life people. The music by again \"Harry Gregson-Williams\" with Nobuko Toda is breathtaking, the orchaestra  is masterful full of strings and piano and horns and really creates the atmosphere of the game. (10/10)MULTIPLAYER - I haven't played the full versio yet because Im still playin the campaign but I was involved in the beta couple mothes back and it is pretty damn good. If you play the campaign than the multiplayer should be second nature because the gamplay mechanics is the same, even the drebin point system is involved in the multiplayer. If you played the old MGO (Metal Gear Online) that came with MGS3: Subsistence, it is nothing like that infortunately. Personally the old MGO was a lot more fun and faster with pretty simple mechanics but the new one is a little awkward. It is slower and a bit more complicated but technically its the same...kinda. Its fun thats all you need to know. (9/10)CONS-The hardcore fans (like me) will appreciate the lengthy cutscenes and the unveiling of the Metal Gear saga and story...but for newcomers I suggest you play the previous MGS games because you WILL get confused. The cutscenes are great and exciting but sometimes I wish I was more involved.- The game is 60% cutscenes and 40% percent gamplay, its not as bad as u would think but since this is the conclusion to possibly the greatest video game series of all time, you would expect this kind of thing. Its better than MGS2's lengthy cutscenes because those were boring as f***.- The new weapons system is great and convinient but it makes the game a bit easy, but it is fun.- THE TRULY SAD PART ABOUT THIS GAME IS THE FACT THAT THIS IS POSSIBLY THE LAST METAL GEAR GAME AND IT REALLY BRINGS A TEAR TO MY EYES.There really is no bad part to this game, but for newcomers they might find some flaws that they won't fully understand. The game is truly a masterpiece and for hardcore fans this is just as good as sex, this game summarizes the whole Metal Gear series and concludes it. Almost every question that has been asked in the MGS series is resolved and answered and it truly does conclude the series in a satisfying way where everybody has there somewhat happy ending. To Solid Snake you deserve a good saluteFAREWELL SNAKE ITS BEEN FUN!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2008"}

Since it came with a copy of the original American Mcgee's Alice, I decided to start with that in May. However, it took me until November of that year to beat that game (it was good, just long), and then I didn't start the main game until the middle of August.All I'll say about the first game is that it's definitely worth either watching or playing. It's not necessary for the enjoyment of Alice: Madness Returns, but it'll definitely help with the story. And since EA dropped the online pass requirements for their games, the first game is free even if you pick up a used copy.As for the main game, it's rather enjoyable. It consists of 6 chapters which are actually quite long, where you'll be slashing and jumping around various areas. Each chapter has its own vibe, and even within the chapters the vibe can change a couple times.The controls are fairly tight, although I probably had at least a dozen or more deaths that I felt were because of the controls. But, to some extent I'm sure a number of those were simply because I tried to rush things, or didn't fully think out my path. The battle system, having played on hard, is at times unforgiving, but ultimately satisfying when you squeak by or really get into the groove and plow through the enemies.The story is top-notch. Playing as Alice, who is slightly insane, the story keeps you guessing on whether she's really insane or is in fact the only sane one in the game. I found that I guessed where the ending was going, but nonetheless thought it to be great when I got there.Honestly, I can't think of any reason to take any points away from this game. It's long, but at no point does the game contain filler to pad the length; rather the length only allows the story to go to more places and tell much more.For these reasons, I give Alice: Madness Returns 5 of 5 stars.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2013"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Supremely disappointing","reviewText":"Lair was supposed to be one of those PS3 exclusive games that made buying the expensive system seem like less of an expensive paperweight.  Sadly though, the hyped and lauded Lair ends up being supremely disappointing thanks to some overly shoddy controls and shallow gameplay.  The first thing you'll notice when you fire up Lair are the amazing graphics and the almost cinematic camera view style as you pilot your dragon around, taking on everything in sight.  However, what kills Lair is what could have made it all the more fun and enjoyable.  The SixAxis controler, which was utilized so well in the similarly styled WarHawk, ruins the game.  Making any kind of quick or tight turns is impossible to pull off, and considering there are plenty of narrow flying moments, this is inexcusable.  Not to mention that the control scheme is also quite buggy and glitchy as well.  This is particularly worth noting when it comes to targeting enemies, and the change-up's during the unnecessary, overly dramatic, slow-motion technique that comes out of nowhere in battle is just annoying.  The gameplay itself is disappointing as flying around and obliterating everything in sight gets old pretty quickly, and there's little to no replay value once (if) you finish the game.  It's sad because the potential here was quite high, but alas, Lair is a sure-fire disappointment.  All in all, Lair is one of the most disappointing, and frustrating, games out for the PS3 right now, and while it may be worth a look for some; in the end, the game is better off being left on the shelf.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-02-2007"}

GT4 is a worthy addition to the series.  The graphics are eye-popping considering the PS2 hardware's abilities.  Also, the number of cars is truly staggering, as is the number of tracks.  (Red Rock Valley is still conspicuously absent -- this track can only be found on GT2.)  The only thing I can fault is that the controls are so simulation-oriented, the physics are so true-to-life, it's almost ruined this game for me.  For example, when turning and braking at the same time, most cars in this game will just plow straight ahead when there should be some turning effect going on.  The only way to remedy this situation is to either back off the brakes or back off the turning angle.  Also, when your car gets out of shape on a fast straightaway, there is almost no way to stop the fishtailing.  You will eventually crash hard into the guard rail and have to accerate again from a stop.  I have tried the \"active steering\" option in the control menu and nothing seems to help these problems.

{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

While it can't play DVDs, the mini-cds are a brilliant concept, for they reduce load times and are much more durable then PS2 discs. The design of Gamecube is outstanding. A simple and compact plastic cube (which is where Gamecube gets its name from) with a nice little handle so you can carry it over to a friend's house. Gamecube seems to last a long time if taken care of, unlike Playstation 2 where it takes over 4 tries to get a disc to load. Even better, this console has true Nintendo magic. A ton of amazing games are available, and each game seems to be entirely unique. I got angry with Nintendo 64 because everything was just a 3D redo of the already existing hits with the suffix \"64\" added to the end of the title. It seems Gamecube is quite the opposite, for Wind Waker is nothing like Ocarina of Time and Star Fox Adventure isn't just an updated Star Fox 64. Some new titles have also been added to Nintendo's list, such as Pikmin, Animal Crossing, and Custom Robo. Gamecube is a perfect mix of what you would expect a game console to be like. It is superior to the Playstation 2 in every way imaginable and not quite as technologically advanced as Xbox yet still beating it in game libary and creativity. Plus, a refurbished Gamecube cost only 15 dollars at Gamestop, and that includes the controller and cables, so instead of buying Halo 4 you could have 4 Gamecube consoles... lol. Plus all of the great legendary games are cheaper then dirt right now due to the commercial failure of this console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2012"}

When you begin the game, it starts off as your standard video game: you play Woody and race to save a runaway train, etc.  It's a rail-based system (if that's correct terminology), in that you can only go in one direction (forward) and have no choice of other areas to explore.  It's a lot like the old Crash Bandicoot games - just keep pressing forward and dodge/shoot things.  It's not BAD - but kinda dull if you ask me.  There is another part to this game, whereby you can build a town, which has an open-explore feel to it and you can complete missions at your own leisure.  That was really cute and fun and addictive!  You get gold by smashing boxes or using a pickaxe on gold deposits or doing missions.  You use the gold to buy more \"toys\" or buildings for the town, etc.  I had more fun with this part of the game than the rest.  You never die - if you fall into water or get into trouble, you just regenerate nearby.  That goes for the main game as well.The voice acting is OK.  Lots of people from the movies, but sadly, no Tim Allen or Tom Hanks.  Instead we get Tom's brother doing Woody and some other guy doing Buzz.  But, it's ok.  They're pretty good.

Each and every level simply oozes with creativity, and most importantly the game is a blast to play. This game was developed by the same team that gave us Mario Galaxy, so that really shouldn't come as a surprise. The graphics are phenomenal, about on par with the Galaxy games, and the 3D is not only great but actually assists in gameplay. Unfortunately there is occasional 3D \"ghosting\" but it is a rare occurance and it's hard to get hung up over it. The platforming is best described as Mario 64 meets New Super Mario Bros with a heaping of Galaxy-level creativity. Throughout a level perspective might change from side-scrolling to top-down to 3D-Mario style a-la 64. I can't emphasize enough how incredibly fun it is to play this game. If you own a 3DS, buy this asap. If you don't, go get one quick. This game blows away every previous handheld Mario, even NSMB, and in comparison to the console Mario games I'd say it's somewhere in-between Mario 64 and the Galaxies, which is to say its as good as it gets. Ladies and gentlemen, the Nintendo 3DS has arrived.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Wiltshire","summary":"Breathing new Vita into the handheld market","reviewText":"There's no doubting that the hardware itself is pretty impressive and vastly superior to its competitor. The graphics are top notch and the system feels very comfortable in my hands (also differentiating itself from its competitor). The screen is a nice touch screen and using the online browser with it is pretty navigable. The price is definitely pretty steep considering it's almost as expensive as the 360 console when it first came out. $40 for a game also seems a little expensive.With that, the system has huge potential. Currently after about 8 months after launch, there really isn't much to play. The library is pretty stagnant, but will probably pick up exponentially here soon. I recommend just getting the WiFi version as the 3g cost does not seem worth it at all unless you happen to use the system all the time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Rondy","summary":"Most powerful handheld out there","reviewText":"I have bought the 3G/Wifi Vita about 1 month ago, and tried a few games on it. Here are my thoughts and experiences.The PS Vita (\"Vee-ta\" not \"Vai-ta\" according to their creators) was first known as the \"PSP Vita\", but shortened to PS Vita for simplicity. Thus one would expect it to be the evolved version of the PSP.During unboxing, I have to say the packaging is not very impressive. It seems to be made up of mostly medium grade cardboard. Nothing too fancy. In comparison, the Nintendo 3DS box looks more elegant and expensive. This is not important to gamers, but might matter to someone buying a gift.Opening up all the flaps give you a thin and small instruction manual, which seems to be the trend for all things electronic nowadays, the console in a protective pocket, a USB cord, and a charger. It might come with accessories or a game, depending on which bundle you bought.The USB cord's input jack is proprietary to the Vita (unlike the PSP which features a miniUSB jack). This is used to connect the system to the PS3 for file transfer. To charge the system, you connect the USB wire to the charger, which goes to the power socket. The light turns orange during charging just like the PSP. There is no separate power input like the PSP.Taking the system out of the protective pocket, it looks and feels like the PSP. The console is bigger and it feels heavier. It looks sleek and expensive, in contrast to its packaging. In elegant black, it is aesthetically very pleasing.Turning the system on, the OLED screen is very crisp and clear. This is the most impressive part of the Vita. The sound is very clear.The display is also a touch screen, and the back doubles up as a second touch pad. Using both while playing Uncharted: Golden Abyss, I found them to be responsive, even for men with fat fingers like myself.The interface is no longer XMB. You navigate entirely with touch. Each icon looks like a coin suspended on a wall. You touch it to run the program/game, and you can rearrange them.There has been a lot of discussion about the Vita memory card. Yes you need to use the PS Vita memory card to save your games and download PSN/SEN content. Unfortunately, everything you heard is true: only 1 PSN account may be accessed on the Vita at any one time. The system and the memory card in use will be linked to the current account. Also, everything is saved on the memory card, not the internal memory. If you wish to use a different PSN account, you have to reset the system, lose all current settings and use a different memory card. Game saves/media/DLC/downloaded games from a different account would not be accessible.To prepare for the long term, I would recommend the largest capacity card, if you can afford it.One gripe I have is that I did not like the game card slot. It is designed like a SD card slot. You slide the game card in, and close it with the cover that is tethered with a small cord. You really have to use your fingernail to pry the cover open before replacing the game. Most protective cases in the market will need to be unfastened when changing the game.In my experience, the battery runs out of juice with 2 hours of full gameplay. I wish it lasted longer. As the battery is built in, there is no possibility of swapping it for a high capacity cell in the future.3G support is convenient but not a necessity. You can send messages and browse the internet on 3G. But for PSN downloads, the system forces you to have a Wifi connection. I would also suggest playing multiplayer on Wifi.The internet browser is nice if you need to check on something on the go. But I found that java-incorporated websites do not show properly.I have tried transferring games downloaded from the PS3 to the Vita, and media files from the Vita to the PSP via the provided USB cord. It is very fast and easy. Quite impressed there.Game library is limited for now but already a few titles are worth picking up. Typical of Sony, launch titles include major titles like Uncharted and Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3. Hundreds of PSP titles and Minis on the PSN also run on the Vita.Despite its shortcomings, this is an excellent, powerful handheld.  It feels like a PSP2 and a portable PS3 combined. I strongly recommend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}

There is a TON of reading to be done in this game and none of it is worthy of a novel...Another bad part of this game is how easy it is. I went through the entire game without using one healing item, like potions, and such.

In fact the only reason it didn't score 5 stars from me is because I'm sick of games that don't allow you to save your progress when you want. Several times I lost progress because the wife needed something done or I had to leave.Regardless, the graphics and gameply were superb and set the pace for how I believe all gaming experiences should be. The movies and voice acting were top notch and play like watching an actual movie, which by they way you can pretty much due from the library after beating the game. A+ and thanks Capcom! Never too hard and never too easy there is always a good balance of fun and strategy.You start off as Nero, a sort-of outcast, someone who likes to think for himself rather than being controlled (by religion) arriving late for Kyrie's singing performance. Queue Dante who true to his demanor makes a grand dramtic entrance followed by a performance that will have you questioning whose side he's on.While you begin the game as Nero you'll later switch to Dante's perspective furthering the story along. The movies before and after each boss fight will keep you talking and smiling long after turning off your XBox. My peronal favorite is the movie after Dante defeats Belial and receives the Lucifer.The games weapons almost take on a persona of their own as you play thru and learn to master their skills and exploits. Just wait till you get Pandora's Box! One piece of advice would be make sure you acquire the Air Hike (for both Nero and Dante) and to max out Nero's Devil Trigger Grab.There are really only 2 complaints that I have for DMC 4. One, as I mentioned before is the lack of saving except for after a mission has been completed and the second is that the game was pretty short, approximately 10-12 hours of gameplay. However I did not play through all the side missions and I my original pass-thru was on the Novice setting. Having said that, unlike many of the other titles out there this one has me anxious to get home to my XBox.One side note is make sure that you keep Kyrie alive during the credits for an additional \"secret\" ending involving Dante.- Dan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2008"}

On my Multimedia super killer Dell wide screen notebook with the new Pentium M processor, Nvidia FX 5650 Go Video with 128 mb video RAM and 1 gig of main memory, Halo performance is abysmal.I figured the others who said this may have been a bit over the top. They werent! For Microsoft to have released this piece of drek is irresponsible in the extreme. It is the full Halo game and if you set to the higher resolutions, the scenery is Gorgeous, But, But, But!Unfortunately, even with virtually all the pretty video features turned off and resolution set down to an abysmal 800x600, the massive frame rate (and motion update) slowing (to as bad as less than 1 frame per second) that takes place whenever major scene motion occurs (especially in the middle of gunfights and always during in battle reloading). Make the game practically unplayable. I completed Halo on the Xbox in Normal and Heroic mode. But the PC version in standard mode is going to be a real challenge because the frame rate and sluggish mouse update are so bad. Really, Really Bad.There were things that could have been done to fix these issues before release, but lets face it with Halo2 looming, Microsoft had to dump it out here now to have any chance of selling it at all. Half Life works on the PC and has a truly excellent interface. They do use lower resolution figures and scenery, but the whole thing works together. Halo on the PC is on the other end of that spectrum.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, IT IS AWFUL! Go out and buy an XBox and get Halo for it. XBox Halo, alone is worth buying an XBox for.

The gameplay is as tight as ever, the controls work very well, and the graphics are significantly improved from the first game. The new characters, as well as the various histories of Aperture Science are well fleshed out, and the writing continues Valve's penchant for colorful, interesting dialogue. The single-player campaign is 8-10 hours, which is a good length in general. And there's no mention of cake, showing that the writers know how to not give us too much of a good thing.The game's co-op mode is also very user-friendly, though I haven't yet tested it online. Valve's idea to include a \"ping\" button to mark where your partner should put their portal is a welcome addition. The puzzles in this mode are also often very challenging and rewarding. Play it with a friend for the best effect.So, why 4 stars instead of 5? There's a dearth of small issues that I feel keep Portal 2 from reaching its full potential. The first is that the game, on the whole, feels a little easy. Part of this seems to be that the game revels in is huge environments, which is fine, but many of the puzzles only require one or two moments of \"ah-ha! That's it!\" before they're solved. Many of those large environments simply involve finding the one wall on which you can place a portal and going from there. For me, these were the times which I quit for the evening.I'm a little sad to say, as well, that the novelty of the portal gameplay wore off before the game was over. I did see it to the end, and I think the game's humor makes up for the stretching of the gameplay. What I am saying is that I'm not sure I'll be looking forward to a Portal 3, if there is one.The answer to \"should I play Portal 2?\" is an unequivocal yes. The question of whether that experience is worth paying $60 for is something that only you can answer. I'm going to say that it's not quite worth that price tag, though I notice that Valve has been quick to lower the price to $40, which I think is about right. If you haven't played the original Portal, you should give that a try first. After, if you want more, Portal 2 is a fine purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2011"}

I decided to abandon the game minutes from completion because at the end the developers ripped off Resident Evil 2 and you are just constantly chased by a Nemesis-like necromorph who will not die.  It regenerates almost instantly from when it is killed, and since I am near dead and almost ammo-less it just means the game is broken.  I refuse to lower the difficulty because I've played the whole game on survivalist.  It is a shame because I liked Dead Space as a new IP, and I figured Dead Space 2 would be better because the first was repetitive but promising.  But this game has turned me off to the point where there is no possibility I would ever play another Dead Space game again, even if someone gave it to me free!  Trust me, this is not a ooh I accomplished something difficult thing like the Mile High Club achievement in COD4.  No, this is a pointless frustration festival that just ensures that despite having 4 guns, healing, and stasis you'll still be swarmed by more necromorphs then you can kill.  On countless occasions I died 30+ times just trying to get through ROUTINE (non-boss) sections of the game.  You will loathe this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-05-2011"}
{"product_name":"B004LLRYOY","description":"Square Enix FF IV:The Complete CollectionFinal Fantasy IV:The Complete Collection PSP","reviewerName":"Adol A.","summary":"One heck of a game for one heck of a deal, even if it's been released several times!","reviewText":"Without a doubt, Final Fantasy IV probably has the most releases of the game out of all the Final Fantasy series, closest would be how much the first game was released. A lot of people who already have the DS version would probably pass this up, but it also includes \"The After Years\" which is the Wii's $37 sequel to FFIV, and you even get a little interlude that explains the scenes in between the two. If you don't have the DS version, pick this one up. I'll tell you why.Final Fantasy IVPros:+You get the choice to play with the game's new music composed specifically for the game, or you can play the classic SNES music (which is amazing, by the way).+It's not extremely difficult whereas FFIV on the DS is brutal and can even be extremely frustrating to some - this doesn't really have difficulty problems.+The 'auto' function - you hit Select during a battle and it fast forwards the battle, making level grinding a lot easier instead of having to continuously press attack or whatever, and you can turn it off in the middle of a battle too.+All of the bonuses from the GBA version are here.+You can rename your characters unlike in the DS version where you couldn't - I know it's a small thing but it gets your creativity going too, you know?+It's easier to level your characters because everybody gets EXP, even if they're not in your party (ex. Palom and Porom are level 20 when you lose them. When you get them back at the end of the game and your characters are 50-60, they'll be 50-60 too)+Complete bestiary and art gallery.Cons:-The random encounter rate is extremely high at times, which can get very frustrating (guess it's our compensation for not having as much difficulty as the DS version)-If you're crazy about graphics and refuse to play any game that doesn't have 3D, this isn't for you.It's Final Fantasy IV, you really can't go wrong with it. Now, onto \"The Interlude\".Final Fantasy IV - The InterludePros:+It clears up any surprises and gives backstory to \"The After Years\" whereas when the Wii version came out not much was really explained.+More additional gameplay!Cons:-It's short, taking me less than TWO HOURS to beat.It's not that long but you still get additional content, and for the $20 you pay for, you're only getting a better deal. Now, \"The After Years\" will save you a lot of money rather than spending $37 to get all of the content packs on the Wii, so even if you aren't sure whether you'd like TAY or not, spending $20 on this version is still a killer deal.Final Fantasy IV - The After YearsPros:+You will get more gameplay hours out of this than the original FFIV.+You can still play the original SNES music, but TAY also has some new tracks added in, and they just feel fit in and extremely well done (especially all parts of the final boss and fights with the Mysterious Girl).+A huge cast of characters, each with their own abilities and stats, so you can customize your style of gameplay further... there is a downside to this however.+A few additional extras appear in the game as well, including a boss fight where you need three parties, an additional challenge dungeon, and several items to find.Neutral~The moon cycle system - it's cool and it adds more strategy, but it's kind of stupid just because you fight an enemy and get your butt kicked because the moon powers up their special attacks and weakens yours. I'd rather have it like FFIV.Cons:-It's going to get really boring to have to play through each of the tales and see the same scene with everybody looking at the two moons.-Most of the tales cap your character out at level 40, which can be bad if you're item hunting or completing challenge dungeons because you'll have wasted experience.-There are no real indications of \"points of no return\" or the chance of losing a member of your party for good or an item. Example - In the last tale, you have to fly around the world and find everybody and acquire Rydia's summons again. Once you step into the castle, you can't go back on the overworld and complete any miscellaneous tasks you may have missed. You can lose up to seven teammates in the game if you don't have a certain item/party set up, and you could lose Rydia's summons too! If you fight the summons in the last dungeon without having Rydia with you, they die and you can't get them back. If you don't fight a certain enemy in a certain moon cycle, Luca can't repair her Calca and Brina characters in Rydia's tale. If any of your ninjas die in Edge's tale, they're gone for good. If you don't have Golbez, Cecil, Rosa, and Ceodore in your party when you're fighting the Dark Knight in the last dungeon, you lose Golbez for good.-In various Final Fantasy games/remakes, you were able to fight bosses from the other games optionally. Here, it's forced on you, and it's the same bosses that are in every remake too! (Particularly the first one - none of the bosses you kill climbing down the depths will mimic the optional bosses in FF1 remakes, except for the FFII enemies, Ultima Weapon, Shinryu & Omega (though they're completely optional), and any of the Mysterious Girl fights. I love enemies like Ultros and Gilgamesh, don't get me wrong, but they could've mixed the bosses up a little bit, or make them all optional.-The difficulty is sometimes ramped up in the final dungeon - I was getting my butt handed down to me by one of the Final Fantasy I bosses, but I easily took care of every other boss, including Shinryu (I only died once and that's because I didn't heal everyone's health to 100% before opening the chest) and the Ultima Weapon! Even optional bosses stand no match for some of the required bosses.-As I said earlier, you can only fight certain enemies on certain moon cycles, which can make it frustrating if you're trying to complete the bestiary or acquire certain loot.-The encounter rate is even higher in this game than FFIV! I can barely cross 10 tiles before the screen fades away or shatters and I'm fighting level 20 enemies when I'm level 60+! Well, let's just say thank god for that auto ability... =)The only reason I knocked a star off this collection is because of the occasional frustration TAY brought me. Still, if you haven't purchased the DS version yet or you have but you want an easier version, or even if you just wanted to check out TAY but didn't like its $37 price tag, definitely buy this game. It will keep you occupied and entertained for hours to come!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2012"}

I was never a first-person shooter fan at all until I picked up this game off the rack on a whim one day.  I have never played anything quite like this, and I doubt that I will anytime soon.  It is one of the best that I have ever played.  This game is a great shooter, with a heavy dose of stealth, and a lot of good character development (role-playing).Deus Ex has a 3-D, fully explorable, virtual world in each mission that is so detailed, it's breathtaking.  If you can stack crates up high enough, or jump far enough, or find a crawlspace, then you can get anywhere on the screen.  You can run into a room with machine guns/rocket launcher blazing, or you can quietly sneak to the rooftops and pick off the bad guys with your sniper rifle (the coolest weapon in any video game).  The sound is excellent.  It's not just fancy, but it is very precise.  You have to pay close attention to the sounds that you make, so that you will not alert your enemies to your presence.  The closest game that I have ever seen in this respect is Thief.  But Deus Ex is not Thief.  In Thief, your character never develops throughout the game, and he is very weak in direct combat.  In Deus Ex, you use skill points and augmentations to increase your abilities throughout the game, and you can survive a good fight.Everything in Deus Ex is precise.  The entire map for each mission runs simultaneously in real-time.  Let me give you an example.  Suppose that you set a booby trap in room A, run into room B, hack the security computer, and then take control of the security cameras in room A.  You can watch the room on the cameras, and wait for a bad guy to walk into your trap and get taken out by it (it will be just where you left it).There are a lot of other features that I loved about Deus Ex.  One is that it is not a pure fantasy game.  It is set in a possible futuristic world at real locations, like the Statue of Liberty, Paris, and Hong Kong.  Almost all of the opponents are humans, robots, or technologically augmented humans, somewhat of a nice change from the usual assortment of demons, zombies, and monsters that you find in most games.And finally, the soundtrack for this game is fantastic.  Each mission has its own regular music, and then action music that kicks in when combat begins.  Some of the action music is cheesy, but the rest of the music is great.  It is just what you would want for an action-packed, futuristic game.Does Deus Ex have any drawbacks?  I believe so.  One is that the storyline is pretty uncreative, and it drags on a bit too long.  The plot twists are your basic conspiracy bent on world domination cliches.  Another disadvantage is that the AI in the game leaves a lot to be desired.  Enemies become alerted to your presence, but if you disappear, then they soon become unalert and patrol around again like you were never there (even if one of their buddies has been killed).  You can get past a lot of heavily guarded rooms by abusing the AI.That said, Deus Ex makes my Top Five games of all time.  I recommend it for anyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2001"}

If you love tons of kick a$$ action, fighting monsters with cool sword combos, combo style points, and beautiful artistic graphics then you'll love this. At first I found this game very difficult, but once I got comfortable with the control of Dante I began to actually look forward to more enemies. The more the better. The moody, evil atmosphere that permeated the entire game was perfect, and resembled the same moody, evil atmosphere in my apartment when my girlfriend is mad at me for playing Playstation too much. The graphics, are a pleasure to the eyes. I liked the main character Dante and his sarcastic, cynical attitude, especially in the face of boss monsters that barely fit inside your tv set. However, they are no match for the boss monster that is my girlfriend.After beating this game I tried it on \"hard\" mode, thinking I was all bad now with my complex combo prowess, but I was in for a rude awakewening. It is incredibly difficult and I gave up after a few levels. Still, I enjoyed the challenge and that's where Capcom failed in the sequel. The best part of Devil May Cry was the incredible, but FAIR, challenge. Make it too easy and it's not the same game. (I never went near easy mode and never do on any game, except Return of the King shh).A few complaints: Many have complained about the camera and I agree for the most part. On the one hand I love a cinematic camera as was used here, much of the time effectively. (For the best use of a cinematic camera see Ico). But on one too many occasions, mainly during boss fights, it seems the cameraman was trained at five towns community college and panned away from the central issue: me fighting a boss monster. It happened so many times, the playstation controller was in serious danger of mysteriosly ending up underneath my feet, to be stomped repeatedly into smaller, more fundamental sub-atomic particles.Also, I wasn't too crazy about Dante's voice. It should've been deeper. Other than that, this is one of the most enjoyable and inventive games I've ever played.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-30-2002"}

Instead, the game is centered around timing, recognition, and a lot of pure luck.For pure entertainment value, this game is a riot for children (at least I know mine loved it). Our three year old beat my wife, my seven year old, and myself so this is definitely a game for all ages. One of the mini games involves choosing a color for your monkeys and then hoping that they don't get crushed by a hippo when they stand under it. Another involves elephants shooting baseballs from their trunks, and timing your monkey's swing of the bat just right. Goofy games like these are bound to keep smiles on the faces of young and old alike.As far as replay value, it's one of those games where your children are probably going to love it for a certain amount of time, and then grow tired of it after a while. There's not much depth involved here. No real storyline or objective, just hook everything up and have some fun with it. Even with the shallowness in content Buzz Jr. Jungle Party brings to the table, I still have to recommend it!

{"product_name":"B002I0J82G","description":"","reviewerName":"GamerBoy","summary":"Battlefield 3= Fun, exhilarating, realistic visuals and sound","reviewText":"Battlefield 3 is such an amazing game that I was left with my jaw dropped to the floor and my mouth grinning so much it got to the edge of my cheeks. The single player is extremely fun and it takes a good amount of time to beat. The story is great; certain games do not have as much of a story as Battlefield 3 does. The first thing I notice is the graphics. They are wonderful. The people look so realistic that I thought I was watching a movie. The guns look nice and the scenic route through Paris, New York, and the Iran-Iraq border were created to look like the real thing. The details in the buildings being destroyed, the flying through clouds while in jets, the destruction and explosions of vehicles, all are very realistic and entertaining. The other thing I notice is the sound is exactly the same as if it were actually on the battlefield, way better than any other video game, maybe even movie. With every explosion from RPG's, every bullet flying past your face, every jets engine fueling up getting ready for take-off, they all are made to resemble real life. If you have a headset you are in for a ride. The multiplayer is even better. After finishing the amazing story mode, there is more that awaits in the addictive multiplayer that makes people say \"Just one more game mom!\" The graphics and sounds are great and the ability to fly jets, helicopters, drive tanks, all that good stuff makes the game even more enjoyable. Other games do not allow driving vehicles but that is what makes Battlefield even better and different from any other game. Conquest, rush, death match are much more improved and the maps are just marvelous. The only minor thing is the part when trying to assassinate someone in the single player is not very well made because you keep on pressing A or RT etc. and it takes approximately 8 seconds when all you need to do is knife them but it is fine. It does not change my thought on how amazing the game is. So if you are looking for a fun, exhilarating, realistic visuals and sounds kind of game, you will not go wrong with a game like Battlefield 3!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}

So I was eagerly anticipating the release of this here sequel and I have to say that I am thrilled with the end result of all that waiting.The big things for me with Portal was the challenge level of the actual \"tests.\" They were hard but more in a clever-brain-teaser-kind-of-way, than a throw-your-controller-at-the-wall-kind-of-way. There was that great \"A-ha!\"moment of figuring it out and realizing how simple it was all along. Add in the fantastic writing and music and it's just a grand experience. I also liked the way they differentiated the challenges from the \"Testing Area\" and when you go \"off the rails\" as it made the experience more real.The sequel picks up right where the first one left off and just get's deeper into it. The voice acting is far and away some of the best you'll come across in the video game arena, and they did even more to bring the world of Aperture Science to life. The writing/story/characters are still totally awesome and the gameplay is even more fun with the all the little additions they threw in there (light bridges, goo that makes you bounce, lasers, etc).The graphics still use the old Valve Source engine but I'm not complaining. Some of the texture is a little flat - but whatever. Game looks great.If you liked the first one - then go get yerself some of this. If you've never played the first one but are intrigued by how much people seem to dig this?

{"product_name":"B0050SXI6K","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Mindblowing Games With Fantastic Gameplay","reviewText":"I've been known to get my hands on a lot of games and play them.  During the PS2 era I managed to get my hands on a ton of games.  Strangely, however, I never actually picked up Ratchet and Clank.  Despite the games being one of the biggest selling franchises on the PS2, I never got around to playing them.  My first foray into the Lombax's universe and the little robot backpack was playing Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction.  Upon playing that game, I was in pure awe of everything it had to offer.  As I planned to dust off my PS2 and find the previous three games used, I was told by the clerk that perhaps I should wait, as an HD collection was right around the corner.  Sure enough, that collection hit and I got to experience the first three games for the very first time in splendid HD.It has been ten years since Ratchet and Clank debuted, and as I sat there playing the collection I found myself in awe.  They were amazing games.  Games that, with each installment, actually got better and better.  And what was remarkable about this progression was that at no point in time did I ever feel one game had to \"fix\" the flaws of another.  No, rather each new game just adds the right amount of new stuff to keep it interesting and make the experience more rewarding.HD Collections are slowly being debated about in the gaming industry.  But Ratchet and Clank is most certainly one of the better ones.  When it comes to gaming and graphics one little known aspect that is hardly talked about is the aesthetics themselves and how sometimes that is what makes a game hold up.  During the Playstation 2 era a lot of games tried to do character models that were closer to looking photo-realistic or something along those lines.  This makes HD Collections like Metal Gear Solid look great, but their age shows a little bit more.  A game like Ratchet and Clank, however, uses incredibly vibrant colors and cartoon like qualities.  And one thing seems to be certain: These kinds of aesthetics most definitely age better than the ones going for a more \"realistic\" look.  Case in point, if you didn't know the Ratchet and Clank games were originally Playstation 2 titles you might not assume they were right off the bat.  There's A LOT of detail put into these games and they've actually aged rather well.  No, they've got nothing on say... Ratchet and Clank Future: Tools of Destruction, but it's still admirable the amount of detail put into these games.  In crisp HD they're amazing on the eyes.  It is by far one of the best looking HD Collections you can find.  It made that transition smoothly.There are moments where the aspect ratio is still 4:3 and, of course, that can't be helped.  They're pre-rendered cutscenes.  But at the very least these scenes were updated as well.  This is really only noticeable in the first Ratchet and Clank, however.  The sides of your television will be black for these scenes.  However, it's a step up from some HD collections that left their pre-rendered stuff untouched.  There are moments in game, however, where it's still kept at the 4:3 ratio when it could've been stretched.  Again, this mostly noticeable in the first one, as it has a lot of those moments.Gameplay wise, Ratchet and Clank is familiar.  You usually play as Ratchet, running around with Clank on your back.  You'll be able to buy and find an assortment of weapons throughout the entire experience of all three games.  In the first game it's merely finding and equipping them.  But in the second there is more variety and they level up.  By the time you get to the third you'll have a whole host of weapons to play with.  As you move from one game to the next you can also carry over some weapons from one game to the next.  Although with some weapons there isn't much point to carrying them over.  For instance, in Going Commando, you start off with a Gravity Bomb that has a huge blast radius as it is.  There's not much reason to carry over the original Bomb Glove from Ratchet and Clank in this instance.  Often you'll find the new arsenal in each new game better than the last.As with most HD Collections, however, you begin to see how some games have really aged.  Despite just being ten years old, it may take some gamers a bit of time to adjust to some of the controls.  In the instances of swimming it took a moment to adjust.  It also took a moment to adjust to the camera controls and to the idea of pressing the O button to fire when most modern day games rely on using R1.  These are, of course, minor complaints.  Namely because the Ratchet and Clank games were state of the art.  It's just how games were made in 2002.  The controls, for the most part, don't really improve much as you go from one game to another.  This is actually not so bad as once you settle in you'll pretty much be okay for the whole set.  The games aren't long either so you'll easily pass through all of them.  There is trophy support added for those who want it, though, and some of them are quite fun to try for while others just seem silly to go for (collecting 1 million bolts in the first game is just tedious without exploiting a well known glitch).That's not to say everything about the collection is perfect.  There were times when there was some noticeable frame rate issues.  And normally this happens when a game is overcrowded with a lot of data on screen, but this wasn't the case here.  Sometimes the frame rate seemed to dip for essentially no reason.  Likewise, sometimes when the audio would loop it would hiccup for just a second or two.It's actually quite amazing how well the games have aged.  I am sitting here playing these games for the first time after having played Future: Tools of Destruction and it's hard not to be impressed.  Certainly the controls aren't up to speed, but they're still solid and tight that learning them is all that is necessary.  It never really trips you up.  The progression through each planet is also simply amazing.  It's also nice to see how the games evolved in every standpoint.  The production values in the first one are stellar as it is, for instance, and jumping into Going Commando once I was finished with my first adventure showed a major step.  Simply put, each game just kept getting better in every sense of the word.  More weapons.  More variety of levels and exploration.  Other aspects just simply got better.  The cutscenes in each game looked and sounded better.  The voice acting got better with each game.  The writing got better with each game.  The humor got better with each game.  And most important, each new adventure was better.It's hard not to recommend the collection.  All small hiccups aside, these are phenomenal games.  There are hardly any platformers out there that can best Ratchet and Clank.  Many come close but few truly eclipse it in terms of quality and substance.  Not to mention it has moments of just pure action and amazement.  To revisit them in HD or (as is my case) to discover these gems for the first time is well worth the investment.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-07-2012"}

A decade has passed since the events of the first game, and the face of E.D.N. III has changed dramatically. Terraforming efforts have been successful and the ice has begun to melt, giving way to lush tropical jungles and harsh unforgiving deserts. Players will enter this new environment and follow the exploits of their own customized snow pirate on their quest to seize control of the changing planet.GameplayLost Planet 2, like the original game in the series, is a third-person shooter featuring huge boss battles, challenging terrain and the ability to pop in and out of battle mechs, known in-game as Vital Suits. The primary difference in gameplay this time around hinges on the inclusion of RPG gameplay elements. Players can now customize many of the aspects of their playable snow pirate, including his physical attributes, clothing and to a certain extent, weaponry and gestures. Players will control these customized heroes across 6 interconnected episodes, creating a truly unique and interactive experience that changes depending upon the actions of the players involved.

However,Lost Planet 2's biggest weapons come on two legs: the heavily armed and armored robotic Vital Suits return in greater numbers and variety than the first game. There are Vital Suits that transform into other vehicles, and even some that hold up to three players and take multiple players to operate. Also, the grappling hooks that made the gameplay inLost Planeta true 3D experience are back, allowing gamers to gain tactical advantage by quickly scaling buildings.Key Features4-player Co-op Action- Team up to battle the giant Akrid in explosive 4-player cooperative play.

To get them back, SOra will go on a series of unique card duel -- where she'll summon characters from the popular Final Fantasy games!","reviewerName":"K. Ostrowski \"bra1n1ac\"","summary":"Am I even allowed to review this game?","reviewText":"Let me start by saying that no, I have not played all the way through this game, and from the looks of things, that might never happen.  However, I have played a large percentage of this game, and I feel I am in a position to tell you, honestly, a few things about it.This game revolves around how Sora, Donald and Goofy, after their adventure in the first Kingdom Hearts, enter a place called Castle Oblivion and are very nearly destroyed/controlled by something called \"the organization.\"  All of Castle Oblivion, according to the required tutorial character near the beginning, is one huge territory where everything is ruled by cards.Joy.Now, for those who have never played another RPG, let me say that card-based battle has a reputation for being just plain bad.  I don't like it, and chances are you won't either.  Squaresoft has added some minor improvements to their card battle system that makes it bearable for most of the game, but only because I was a fan of the original and felt I owed it to the franchise to play this game.So as I progress through the game, I discover that Sora is reliving (with some significant differences,) memories of his journey in KH1.  Each floor of the Castle represents a world Sora has visited in the past, and for a while, that's that.  You go back over the same territory, which is a little tedious depending on how well you remember the first game, while Sora and the others say depressing things about how much they've forgotten.  Ultimately, the story takes a couple of nice turns near the end, but you hardly have any time to enjoy it.This game, however, suffers from some pretty massive gameplay issues.  First, it tries to be both an RPG and an action game and fails pretty miserably.  The first Kingdom Hearts did RPG level gaining properly, allowing you to get upgrades for HP, MP, AP, defense power, attack power and special attacks.  This game gives you HP upgrades, and a type of unweildy special attack called a \"sleight\" that forces you to arrange your cards in a certain order, which, even if you manage it, you wind up losing one of your cards for the rest of the battle.  They also allow you to upgrade your \"CP,\" which is short for \"card power,\" and influences how many cards of what sort you can have in your \"deck.\"  Each card type costs a certain amount of CP if you want it in your deck, so, the more CP, the better.In theory.I think you may already begin to see an issue here.  No strength upgrades means that later battles against stronger enemies with more health quickly become tedious and what's more, the bosses are very poorly designed.  After the first boss, the bosses are all either MUCH too hard or so easy as to be tedious.  Hades is very hard, Maleficent is hard, Hook is MUCH harder than anyone has a right to be as are the final forms of Riku and all the organization members, and virtually every other boss in the game is so easy, I could practically beat them in my sleep.Normally, making one boss enormously harder than another is a big no-no for video games.  I seriously doubt anybody but six or seven gamers out of everyone in America will EVER beat Axel, much less Marluxia, a person I have only once gotten past the first (of four no less) health bar of.The original Kingdom Hearts was at least new gamer friendly with a difficulty setting to allow less experienced gamers to learn the game's story and appreciate its characters without banging their heads against a wall.  This game doesn't even have that.Is this game worth playing?  Are you looking for a challenge?  If so, you may find one in this game.  I haven't screamed at a game so much since Earthworm Jim 1.  I think I may keep playing this game every so often just for humility's sake, but I don't expect to ever find out what happens to Sora at the end of the castle.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2005"}

Figured I would give this a shot, and the experience is incredible.  Co-op mode is so much fun.  There are so many things two people can do as far as having one person drive the other shoot in the same vehicle.  There are a variety of different vehicles to choose from as well.  You can flank different enemies, its not just two people shooting at the same thing.  I found it to be long too, two 5 hours sessions and we're only about half through.  We didn't rush through it though. Seems a lot less juvenile also.  One gripe, when you play co-op mode the screen reverts to a 4:3 aspect ratio and you have vertical bars on each side of the screen.

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"J. Shafer","summary":"good game but still flawed","reviewText":"Left 4 Dead follows a simple setup:  4 people move from point A to point B while shooting zombies, and thats it, no backstory to anyone, how they met each other or why the infection happened and somehow these 4 are the only ones somehow immune to it.  The only thing we really are given is how the 4 made it to the top of the roof in one of the 4 campaigns (No Mercy) from watching the opening cutscene which was very well done.Even though there are only 4 campaigns, each one is broken down into 5 chapters for a total of \"20 levels\" with each campaign ending in a finale which all follow the same setup: call for rescue and survive the oncoming zombie menace while barracading yourself in a building for 10+ minutes.The game says that your given around 10 weapons when your acctually given around 4, 2 of which have a stronger upgrade of the previous one while the remaining weapons range from pipe bombs and molotov cocktails to a mounted machine gun which in only in a few chapters which is fine because the weapons are all balanced out and get the job done, but sometimes it just leaves one wanting more variety.Aside from the co-op focused zombie shooting game that it is, one of the main selling points of the game was something new dubbed the \"Ai Director\" who changes the game based of various factors which is only a good thing in theory.  While the idea behind the director is smart (it was designed to make it so that one playthough of a campaign would always be different but in the end it boils down to \"zombies will be around this corner instead of that one\" or \"weapons and health items will in this room instead of that one\"), its actions are fairly cheap and you will be constantly severly punished for doing extremely good or reasonably well, sometimes if your even doing bad the director will decide to screw you over and the way he does this is usually through special infected or numerous hordes (large zombie group).There are 5 kinds of special infected: the hunter (who crawls around on the ground making it harder to see and pounces on someone where they proceed to claw you to death until one of your friends deicdes to help you), the smoker (who sits back hundreds of feet away to ensanre you with its tounge and dragging you away from everyone, usually into a horde where anything can hurt you and you must wait until someone helps you), the boomer (a large zombies that tends to just hide around corners and vomits on you, upon which a horde will automatically attack anyone who got puked on, also if you kill said boomer while hes close to you, his vomit will still spew on you with the same results), the witch (a passive-aggressive zombie that once prevoked by anything (walking to close, shooting in her general area, acctually shooting her, walking by her, looking at her, shining your flashlight at her, etc.) will proceed to attack the person who startled her and incap (once your HP reachs 0, your on the ground and must wait for someone to pick you up or you bleed to death and your also still a sitting duck for everything else) in one hit regardless of your previous health and will continue to claw at them until they die or she dies and on harder difficulties she will not incap but kill in one hit and proceed to attack everyone else so it is vital you sneak past her) and finally the tank (a zombie Hulk on steriods that the director constantly throws at you and its guarenteed to kill atleast one person and it requires the power of everyone in your group to kill it and if everyone is busy killing off even common zombies, everyone will be severly hurt).The game also provides a versus mode where 4 people play as the survivors while another 4 people play as special infected.  While it may be the funnest mode, its probably more flawed than the regular campaign.  The infected are extremely underpowered and will die within a few seconds of being near the survivors so the only way the infected can really win is if the opposing team are idiots or everyone coordinates their attacks simultanouesly and hope for the best.  Also if you do manage to become the tank while playing versus (the infected you play as is chosen at random), your practically screwed because you are nowhere near as powerful as a regular tank and will die almost slightly slowly than a regular infected.  You can also only play versus on 2 maps, no mercy (where the infected have the advantige) and blood harvest (where the survivors have the advantige.)In the end, Left 4 Dead is still a great and fun game, given the right circumstances are met and its hard to justify a purchase with a price tag of 60 dollars and even harder if you do not have live.  If you can find this 10-20 dollars cheaper somewhere else and if you have live, than its a definite buy, if you dont have live, then its a rental at best because while you can still play the game by yourself (or with one other buddy via split screen), its just not as fun compared to playing online because this game is meant to be a multiplayer game, and a good one at that too.Update: January 28th, 2009This games community has become beyond horrible on xbox live and is by far the worst gaming community I have ever seen.  Half of the people think they are better than you and will constantly shout orders at you every few seconds.  The other half are whiney 10-year-olds who typically do the same thing, only they curse more profusely and attempt to do the entire game by themselves because they think theyre playing Halo and dont understand the concept of co-operation.  A majority of the people will just boot you if you do good, bad, or because they just feel like it.  If someone does get booted they will more than likely run up and start shooting everyone until they leave, severly crippling your team and more recently they have decided that re-joining the game and repeating this multiple times is fun to do, thus taking any fun away from this game.  If you do intend to play this, make sure you have friends.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2008"}

In many senses a fanciful retelling of WWII, the game doesn't shy from harder topics (even reflecting on interment of Jews/Darksens) but also keeps things looking up with determined hope and throws in moments of laughter right when they're needed. A few of the characters seem to have obligatory personality faults (Rosie), but everybody has virtues, vices, and a past you can understand if not empathize with. I guarantee you, by the end you WILL be attached to many of them.Story: 8/10Maybe not \"pushing the limits\" of the PS3, but everything is crisp and colorful - though like many PS3 games, some menu text is hard to read on non-HD screens. You may have to get used to the artwork - everything within looks pretty much like the game cover - but I find it beautiful from portraits to scenery. The realism is there in muzzle flashes and acceptable smoke from explosions, though some may find the onomatopoeias (\"Foom\") too quirky. Don't judge before you see it in context, I find everything works well and if you don't like it you might be surprised at how easily it fades into the background.Graphics: 7.5/10General sound and music volume can be independently altered, and there's even an option for the Japanese dub from the start - though both dubs are good, I found some of the female Japanese voicing to be annoying. Unfortunately, voices are tied with effects, so if you mute one the other is also lost. Sound effects all sound fitting, from bolt-action rifles to Valkyrian energy blasts.Sound: 7.5/10I take special notice of music, but it's rare that I find one that is both fitting throughout and enthralling both in-context and out. The opening is a little slower than I think could have been done but everything is beautiful and does an excellent job of carrying the emotional intensity. Once you beat the game the first time, the whole soundtrack is even available for listening between missions. Many of the tracks are sedate enough out of context that I wouldn't recommend the soundtrack, but that falls to each person's tastes.Music: 8/10This game has something for everybody, and that's both a plus and a possible problem to watch for. RPG fans will love upgrading equipment from your tank to the troops, action fans will like directing the soldiers through fields, forests, and trenches (complete with a beach invasion that practically says \"No, this isn't Vierville-sur-Mer! Really!\") However, people not normally fans of those elements need not despair: they don't tend to form bottlenecks. I'm not a fan of console shooters, but I still enjoyed slipping troops through front lines and lining up head-shots. Unlike Fire Emblem, when soldiers are shot down you have a chance to send an ally to save them.Gameplay: 8/10While you have to watch what you upgrade or level in the first play-through, \"training missions\" loosely replicating certain story missions allow you to build experience and money. After completing the game once, besides a plethora of bonus options, you get to play through the campaign again - and can replay story missions at will to either improve your rank or rake in the money. The glossary even gives you information on what every single of your soldiers did post-war, besides all the nifty stuff you unlocked along the way.Replayability: 8/10Combining colorful visuals, elegant music, engaging gameplay, and a great plot, there's almost nothing I can say against this spectacular game. A pity it's not multi-console, but gamers who are sitting on the fence should take notice of gems like this. Internet-connected may want to try the free demo on the Playstation Network to give you an idea of how the missions feel, even if it misses the grandeur of the full game's heart and scale.Overall: 9.4/10","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2010"}

Covered by soot and dust, the survivors of the impact must stay alive amidst the warring factions that seek control of the chaos. To sum it up: imagine if \"Advance Wars\" met \"Mad Max\". That's this game. The game follows Will, a survivor of the Rubinelle armed forces, as he teams up with other survivors from his army to protect the citizens against bandits and hostile forces.The basic rules of Advance Wars still apply, and all the units from previous games (minus some of the setting-specific units like the Neotank) are present. There are a couple things that have been changed, gameplay-wise. New units have been added; these include the light recon Bike, the fog-of-war-destroying Flare launcher, the specifically designed Anti-Tank Cannon, the missile-launching Gunboat, the carrier-built Seaplane, and the anti-air/anti-ground plane, the Duster. The most distinct new unit is the Rig, which can build certain temporary structures like makeshift airfields, ports, and radar stations. Also, more conventional units from previous games are available - tanks, infantry, artillery, and so on. Another change is the scarcity of supplies. In previous games, there were counters for fuel and ammunition that would deplete after use (moving depletes fuel, shooting depletes ammunition). In AW:DR, these empty much more quickly to indicate the status of the destroyed world. There is also the added bonus of veterancy for units, granting bonuses in attack and defense for each kill the unit gives. This doesn't carry over between missions, but it goes up fairly quickly. Finally, the use of Commanding Officers (or COs) has changed - to confer their unique bonus on their units, they must be leading them. A unit can have a CO attached to it to make a zone of effect around it where the CO's bonus applies. Defeating enemies with units in the CO zone fills the CO's power bar and allows them to use a special technique that can change the tide of a battle. If the unit is defeated, the CO simply returns to headquarters.Online gameplay is now available as well. The pre-made maps can be used, or design maps can be traded. There is also an option to add friends and make a friends list. The system is simple, but it works pretty well.The graphics have been changed to reflect the more serious nature of the game. The cartoonish, bright, mis-proportioned characters of the previous games have been replaced with a more washed-out, somber color tone and realistic character proportions. As a whole, they are pretty good, though the use of colors like red, blue, and yellow for the uniforms is still sort of disorienting. The sound is pretty good, having been changed to an overall more rock-based sound than previous AW games.As a whole, this is a pretty neat turn for the Advance Wars series to take. I like that it's more serious, though it seems kind of odd to jump straight to \"post-apocalyptic scenario\" with the new graphics instead of doing a regular wargame first. Either way, \"Days of Ruin\" is a solid game that carries on a good tradition.9/10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-15-2008"}

THIS is a next-gen game. What's so awesome about this game, besides the eye candy, is your Darkness powers. You get four powers that you can unlock throughout the story and you can use them to kill and wreak havoc and even solve simple puzzles. The other great things are the Darklings which you can command to kill your enemies.The story is wonderful and keep you sucked in throughout. One thing that I really loved was the voice acting...it's top notch stuff. The best voice is the Darkness he has this insane sinister voice that constantly changes pitch and it's really awesome. I also love when you can eat everyone's hearts after you kill them and you can watch the demon heads pull it apart and munch on it...it sounds nasty but looks awesome. I love the way the story flips between two different worlds: 1940 New York and The Darkness world during WWII.Now there are bad things here. Even though everything is top notch and spiffy there just isn't enough of it. Four Darkness powers and Darklings just aren't enough in this type of game. There are enough weapons (DUAL WIELDING!!) however, but everything is just too short. Also, the story just doesn't seem quite enough either and it's not a terribly satisfying ending. The campaign is also short...you can beat it in between 10-15 hours even if you do the side missions. I also found the Darklings to be almost useless since they die in the light and they take too long to run after enemies. The unlockable content is neat but not enough to boost replay value. The only reason why you'd play this again is to get the alternate ending. If you want a true next-gen experience pick up The Darkness...you'll love it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00149MEVY","reviewerName":"Tierra12 \"Tierra12\"","summary":"Worthy Addition","reviewText":"I have been a fan of the Silent Hill series ever since I purchased the first game which regardless of how dated the graphics are now is STILL an absolute masterpiece.  It has throughout the years been able to maintain a sense of fear and urgency throughout.After playing that game I was hooked on the series and I have purchased all the Silent Hill titles that have come out since then.  There have been some worthy additions to the series and there have also been some less than stellar parts.  For some reason or another I couldn't really get into Silent Hill 2 (maybe because I didn't like James).  I thought that Silent Hill origins had an improved combat system in comparison to previous games and that the grapple ability was a good idea; however, overall story wise Origins didn't add any value to the series which is a shame especially since that was a prequel.  In addition to this some of monsters were disappointing like Carrion, Caliban, and the Butcher (who unfortunately was just a watered down version of Pyramid Head).Silent Hill Homecoming does a whole lot things right and gives me a lot of enthusiasm for the direction the series is heading in.  For instance the main character is a very likeable guy with a tragic past.  He is also one of the most cable characters/victims in the series which is a good thing.  His skills allow you to do things you wanted to do in other Silent Hill games but couldn't because of the limited combat system.  So now you can target enemies, block, dodge, and perform very satisfying finishing movies on monsters and people.This is the best looking Silent Hill game period.  The environments are rendered beautifully and realistically.  The visual superiority of this game gives the game a film like quality.  The people also look like real humans and they make realistic facial expressions.  These are important things to have in a scary game.  It's also important to have realistic facial expressions for the characters during emotional points of the game as well and trust me there are plenty in this game.I also really like the design of the enemies. The new enemies are twisted and frightening to behold and some can perform a pretty violent death on Alex.  This is different from past Silent Hill games because in those games if you died it might have been inconvenient but it wasn't scary or graphic like it is now except for in Origins where you had a violent death if you goofed up during the fight with the Butcher.Like the first SH game the storyline still pacts a psychological and emotional punch that stays with you long after you've stopped playing.  I can't really get into it without giving some really important things away so I'll leave it at that.Other things I like about the game are the fact that you can control and rotate the camera anyway you choose.  I like the fact that you can also choose the way Alex responds to other characters during conversations.  This is a fun option especially since the voice acting is top notch and the things the people say are believable.  There's none of that uneven voice acting, odd, and just plain goofy dialogue that is present in all of the Resident Evil games.  Also when you're looking at the map you can select objective and find out what this is instead of just running around mindlessly like in previous SH games.  Once again the music is well done and appropriate in every scene.  In addition to the aforementioned things the replay value is superb.  There are multiple endings based on what you do or don't do, so you can unlock new costumes, and new weapons like the circular saw, and the laser pistol which has unlimited ammo.  You can use both to perform some really fun finishers on enemies.Score:  A","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SZ49Y","description":"","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"A must-buy for Playstation fans who want to taste 3D gaming at an affordable price.","reviewText":"Like many of you, I spent a lot of money for my LCD TV several years ago. When Sony announced their firmware update that allowed for 3D gaming and viewing of 3D Blu-Ray movies, I was tempted to buy another widescreen TV, but couldn't justify shelling out a few thousand more dollars for it. 3D would have to wait.Sony did something clever with this product. They bundled a 24\" monitor with 3D glasses, the game Motorstorm Apocalypse, and an HDMI cable and priced it under $500. Suddenly it was a lot more affordable.The monitor comes packaged in a large box with a carrying handle (another benefit of ordering a smaller TV is that you don't need a crew of people to carry it upstairs). There's a slight amount of assembly required, which is a snap (literally). You attach the monitor to the stand and the stand to the base. Then, you just plug it into AC (the power cord is only about 5 feet, which was a bit small for my needs), and then plug the HDMI cable from your PS3 to the unit.It took me a while to find the power button, which is on the back of the unit to the right. There are six buttons in total: a power button, an input selector button (which switches between two HDMI connectors and one set of component (yPbPr) connectors), two volume buttons, a menu button, and a 3D button. They're all pretty generically shaped and lined up in one column, but to help you out an on-screen diagram will pop up when you press one to make sure you're pressing the right one. From the menu you can adjust the picture, including Backlight (0 to 10) and Picture Mode (dynamic, standard, cinema). You can also define a custom picture mode, setting your own brightness, contrast, color, hue, sharpness, and color temperature. It can be quite a pain to adjust menu settings with the buttons behind the unit, but you get used to it soon enough.The PS3 recognized the monitor immediately. I was pleasantly surprised by the crispness of the display. The colors and clarity on the LED display were definitely deeper and crisper than my current LCD TV. Likewise, the sound was powerful (it has 2 channel stereo output at 3W and a subwoofer at 5W built in).The 3D glasses come in a separate felt pouch, and the lenses come protected with some plastic over them (you pull off the plastic with convenient pull-tabs). It took me a while to figure out how to turn them on--there's a power switch on the inside for \"battery\" and then a separate power button on top, both of which need to be switched on. I was very happy to see a micro-USB connector on top (you need to pry open a little door to see it). I was afraid that like other Sony 3D glasses it'd be powered by a watch battery, but it looks like these glasses can be charged. Note that the connector is a smaller micro-USB connector and not a mini-USB such as the one used to charge the Dualshock and Move controllers. But happily there's a small USB-to-micro-USB cable included. I wear glasses, but the 3D glasses fit comfortably over them.I popped in the game \"MLB: The Show 11\" to test it out. No 3D. I went to the menu options, and the 3D option was greyed out. I finally realized that I had to go to the PS3 menu under \"Settings\", and select Video Output Settings > HDMI > Auto and set the screen to 24 inches before 3D would be enabled. Once I did that I returned to the game where now I saw all kinds of new disclaimer screens I didn't see before referencing 3D.Within the game, I adjusted the 3D settings. The first settings I tried had a lot of ghosting. But by adjusting the sliders a little I finally got a picture that was absolutely perfect. I wish that Sony had a \"universal\" setting instead of having us control it game-by-game, but bottom line, if the game developer did it right you will have control over the depth of 3D you can see.Next, I tried a 3D Blu-Ray which I happened to get today in the mail, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1. The disc started up and went right into 3D mode, with the opening menu gloriously popping out of the screen. It was a clean, crisp picture with no ghosting as far as I could tell. As is typical with these active 3D glasses, the picture was very dark even with the backlight set at maximum (it's like watching a TV screen with sunglasses). But if you sit close enough to the TV and/or adjust the menu settings, you should find a viewing setting that's comfortable.Last, I tried connecting it to my laptop, which happens to have an HDMI output jack. To my delight, I was able to go to YouTube's 3D channel, play videos with the \"side by side\" viewing method, adjust the 3D mode of the TV, and see the videos in full 3D! Not surprisingly, the picture quality, resolution and color fidelity were excellent. I hadn't planned on it, but I will be most likely be making this my second computer monitor of choice.The set does support \"SimulView\", which allows two people to play a game watching the same screen with both players seeing their own (2D) view of the game. I wasn't able to test because I didn't buy a second pair of glasses (which is kind of pricey at $70), but I'll update this review once I do.To sum up, I was honestly a little afraid that at this price Sony might try to push a cheap TV on the masses. But everything about this set screams high quality, from the crisp picture, to the 176/176 viewing angle (meaning that multiple people can be between 2-8 feet from the screen and still see perfect 3D as long as they all have the 3D glasses), to the 5000:1 contrast ratio and 240 Hz refresh rate. Aesthetically, it's quite gorgeous too--the black, polished screen really looks distinctive, especially next to the sleek lines of the PS3 itself. And surprisingly, I put the 24\" TV next to my 42\" LCD and didn't really miss the fact too much that it was smaller (granted, I grew up watching a 25\" cathode ray tube TV).The one possible caveat I'd have about this set is what I'd have about all 3D sets--there are some people who might experience some mild-to-severe nausea. For this reason, I'd recommend you play at a friend's house or spend a good couple of minutes in front of a store display to make sure you're not one of those who are affected. For me, I experienced a tiny bit of nausea, but I'll admit that the coolness factor definitely made up for it. Worst comes to worst, you can switch off the 3D and still have a very high quality LED display.One other thing to note is that this isn't a \"TV\", as there's no TV tuner. But with the extra HDMI connector, you can easily plug in a TiVo or a cable box. Ironically, I also plugged in an Xbox 360 using the component cables, and that picture looks crisp as well.Long story short, if you've been tempted to try out 3D, this makes an excellent entry-level display.Unfortunately, I have to end my review with a couple words about Amazon. I have always been blown away by Amazon's customer service and I routinely pre-order games and systems from them. In this case, I had ordered the PS3 Display back in September, because they promised that everyone who pre-ordered would get a free copy of Resistance 3. Lo and behold, like many of you probably did, I found out that my order was cancelled--my invoice of September had the correct price of $499.99, but some klutz in Amazon evidently repriced it after I ordered it at $4.99 and then $49.99. Because of this, my order was cancelled. I called their customer service, and the rep \"Bill\" was very kind and understanding, but said he had to \"check with his manager\" to see what he could do. A few minutes later I get a generic email basically telling me tough luck and that I should re-place my order--which meant I wouldn't get it for another few weeks AND I wouldn't get the free game. No apology or anything. Needless to say, I immediately drove to GameStop where they gave me the system and a free copy of Uncharted 3 to boot. My message to Amazon--clean up your act or you'll see a lot more people doing the same.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"Chris Chapa","summary":"Lara, redefined.","reviewText":"CONCEPT:Lara Croft has been through numerous reincarnations over the past 17 years; some of them were epic...others flopped. The same could be said for the films as well (perhaps). This time around, Lara Croft has been given a whole new makeover that succeeds in giving her more depth and character than she ever has before. TR 2013 depicts a young (and a little naive?) Lara that quickly gets in over her head when unlucky providence lands her in the middle of a dangerous cult that inhabits a well hidden region of the Dragons Triangle (think Bermuda). Lara must acclimate herself to this hostile environment quickly if she is to survive the elements and the inhabitants, even if that means taking someone else's life.GRAPHICS/SOUND:TR 2013 is beautifully rendered and the ambient movement of the environment runs fluidly with no issues such as lag or \"busying\" up the system, like you see in some games when there is just too much happening on one screen. The goal of the creators was obviously to take what we knew and came to expect from previous TR titles, and replace it with dirty, grimy and very unique settings that Lara had never visited beforehand. A little frustration arises when sometimes the graphics get in THE WAY of the gameplay, where tree limbs obscure your view, or the somewhat excessive water droplets that \"spray\" on the screen keep you from clearly seeing where you are going (which happens rather often, since waterfalls and rivers are a common sight). The sound effects and background music is well presented, with music rising and falling with the tempo of Lara's current predicament, and setting the appropriate mood when need be. Gunshots don't sound too recycled and generic, and the voice acting is well above par, sounding very genuine and fitting, second only to what the guys at Naughty Dog put out (Uncharted, The Last of Us).GAMEPLAY:Running around as Lara has a different and revamped feel as well, but some mechanics feel very familiar as well. There is still plenty of climbing, strafing, and (ahem) Tomb Raiding to be had, but her movements both in exploration as well as combat are much more fluid than before. There isn't really anymore \"diving over crates with dual guns a-blazin\" this time around, and has made way for more realistic mechanics such as a (semi-automatic) covering system, and a few more alternate ways for Lara to better herself and her situation with an in-game leveling system that you can access from HUB locations (campsites) throughout the game. These campsites give you an opportunity to \"level up\" Lara's Survivalist, Hunter, and Brawler attributes, as well as upgrade weapons with found salvageable material and parts, and fast travel between campsites. Needless to say, with all these changes and a more realistic feel to the game, being able to run around the Croft mansion and change outfits is no more. Although outfits CAN be changed via DLC.REPLAY VALUE:Once the game is complete, you have the option of revisiting previously explored areas of the island via fast travel locations to search out and find any artifacts, documents or tombs that you missed on your first play through. Enemies have increased in number this time around, and if you're sneaky, it's pretty entertaining to hear them chatter back and forth in conversation: before you beat the game, they would be talking about looking for Lara Croft and talk about all the damage she's done, and stuff that moves the plot line, yada yada yada. After you beat the game, go back, and you'll hear those guys say things like \"Did you see where she went?!\" Who? The outsider? (that's you). \"No idiot, my pet rat Skittles!\" and so on. Its kind of a cool move on Crystal Dynamic's part to have a whole new dialogue recorded just to change things up when the game is over. That aside, being able to go back and earn 100% is great for completionists, and the increase in enemies still manages to keep it pretty fresh for anyone just wants another go-around with a challenge. Replay value - moderate/moderately high.OVERALL:While I hate to resort to comparing one game to another, TR 2013 does seem to have closely modeled itself after the Uncharted series (which I always considered to be basically Tomb Raider with a dude, in concept). In this case, it's a very good thing, because there is really no argument against the fact that the folks at Naughty Dog know their stuff, and how to do it right the first time. Given the chance, I think Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix can definitely continue to breath new life into Tomb Raider and  take it to a whole new level. Also, without giving away any spoilers, it was great to see the makers of this installment come from a different angle than previous games: a heroine who's been taken down to a human level, who isn't dressed in a blue top and khaki shorts. She's got a blood and dirt all over, she's got a little limp from the bear trap she stepped into, and a deep gash where she impaled herself on a piece of rebar. But she's still strong willed and determined, making this incarnation of Lara Croft the strongest and most admirable one yet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

{"product_name":"B007UM59L6","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Game of the Year candidate!","reviewText":"I want to preface this review by stating this is the first Devil May Cry game I've ever played. I heard the combat was outstanding, so I figured I'd give it a shot and see for myself. I don't understand all of the 1 star reviews because this is one of the better games I've played in quite some time.Combat - This is where DmC really shines. In regards to most action games I've played, the combat is either average or pretty good. Combat in this game is at an elite level. Most of the attacks are melee, with a touch of 3rd person shooter added in. Every movement and attack is very fluid and responsive. I'm usually not very good at executing combos, but they were surprisingly easy to pull off. Unlike many games, I didn't feel overwhelmed with a ton of unnecessary moves to learn. With that being said, the list of combos to learn is expansive enough to satisfy a hard core gamer. After every kill, I felt a level of gratification that I haven't felt since God of War III, and that's saying a lot. Regardless of what some reviewers have stated, I feel that an abundance of time and energy was put into making the combat flawless, and it shows.Weaponry - Ahh, the weapons... When compared to similar games in the genre, there really isn't a huge selection of weapons to choose from. However, this isn't an issue because I had an absolute blast with the few weapons that were at my disposal! You'll have to excuse me because I'm nowhere near smart enough to remember the names of these weapons, so I'll do my best to describe them. Dante starts off with a sword that does a great deal of damage (all weapons can be upgraded). Now here's where things get interesting: Once you proceed a little further in the game, you'll acquire demonic and angelic weapons. In order to use the demonic weapons, hold down R2 while attacking, and of course, hold down L2 for usage of the angelic weapons. I think this is a very nice touch, and it surely beats having to constantly press start/select to enter a cumbersome weapon menu. The demonic weapons are an axe and a pair of gauntlets, while the angelic weapons consist of a scythe and a set of shuriken-like blades (my favorite weapon in the game). Just to satisfy the third person shooter in everyone, you'll unlock a total of 3 guns as you progress through the game. I liked that I was 'forced' to make use of each weapon at some point in the game. I get very annoyed when I have weapons in my inventory that I never have a reason to use. Not a huge variety, but I had fun using them.Enemies - Similar to weapons, not a huge variety here. With combat this polished, who needs a large variety of bad guys? Personally, I thought the enemies put up a decent challenge, but what the heck do I know... Some of the enemies could only be damaged by demonic weapons - and you guessed it; others could only be killed with angelic weapons. Again, I think this is a nice touch that I haven't seen before. Although there were 20 missions in total, I believe I encountered around 6 bosses (not the boss per mission/level format I'm used to). This was a different approach to boss battles, but it worked out nicely. Many reviewers have talked about how easy the boss fights were but I completely disagree. I died several times while facing each boss because I had to approach each battle differently. Without spoiling anything, the final battle was epic! It's probably in my top three boss battles of all time. No gimmicks, no tricks - just mano e mano. Will you be the last one standing of the two?Miscellaneous - If exploration is a 'must have', you probably won't like DmC. Sure, there are things to collect, but you will not have to look too hard for them. I kinda wish there were a few more puzzles, but this is not a big enough issue to raise a red flag. As for game length, I'm really not sure. I take my time with games, and I usually die a lot, so it takes me longer than most. I would guess around 10 - 15 hours for the average gamer.This is definitely one of the better games I've played, and should be in consideration for Game of the Year. If I had to point out a negative -  it would have been cool if the game offered a bit more exploration. I know it's a fixed path type of game, so I understand why they didn't. If you're a long time Devil May Cry fan, I'm sure you've already made up your mind about this game. But, if you're a newbie like me, I -HIGHLY- recommend this!

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"CastleD","summary":"A one of a kind experience + Elena","reviewText":"I couldn't stop thinking about this about this game for days after I finished it. All the promise of the first game was fulfilled as Naughty Dog absolutely nailed it with this one. Everyone has already talked about the beautiful graphics, unlike anything I've ever seen on console and even PC, and everything else so I just want to mention the characters.I was sad the game ended because I grew very attached to them, particularly Elena who brings charm and innocence but also a strong determination. I adore her. She is just as much the heart and soul of this franchise as Drake is. Naughty Dog have pushed the industry forward with characterizations and dialogue so natural and realistic they have no peer in gaming. So many genuinely funny lines, great voice acting, and some emotion too. Everyone should try this game, even if they're not really a gamer or not good at games, just put the difficulty on 'very easy'. The platforming should be doable for most people.Not everything is perfect, nothing is, maybe the platforming is too easy, maybe one character is one-dimensional, but this game transcends nit-picking. The totality of the experience is a roller-coaster ride of sights and sounds and action unlike any game ever made.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

However, all good things must soon come to an end - and the picturesque resort falls into madness, carnage and chaos after a mysterious and contagious zombie outbreak claims its once peaceful atmosphere. Cut off from the rest of the world, only four individuals who strangely find themselves immune to zombification have the power to protect the remaining survivors from the horrors of the island, to discover what's really going on and find a way to escape before their own fatal ends.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gameplay HighlightsIn keeping with an atmosphere of desperation and survival by any means, Dead Island focuses on serious,first-person actiongameplay with a close-quarter,immersive melee focus.Dead Island'sseamless 4 player co-op multiplayerseeks to provide the most immersive multiplayer experience to date.

Garrelts","summary":"A Deeply Flawed Game","reviewText":"I'm going on about 15 hours playing Dead Island and though my experience with the title is limited I feel qualified to provide a review on what I feel is a deeply flawed game.First for those not in the know the basic premise of Dead Island takes place on the fictional island of Banoi. Your character - which you choose from a selection of 4 playable characters - wakes up after a night of heavy drinking to a scene of blood, gore, and chaos unfolding around him/her. An apparent infectious disease has turned the guests and staff of the tropical resort into mindless zombies and your mission is simply to survive. The four playable characters differ by specialties and abilities and skill trees reflect each characters specialty by offering the chance to upgrade specific abilities. It is a system that most folks who play games will be immediately familiar with.The game takes place entirely in the first-person view mode to include driving vehicles. The camera seems to work well for the most part except for the driving segments where the camera seems to be bogged down and the option to not include a back-up camera or view restricts certain maneuvers. It's a bit frustrating but with some practice the driving segments become tolerable. For zombie fans there's an undeniable gratuity on seeing the undead splatter across the hood of your vehicle whilst cruising at full speed.Graphics are a highlight of Dead Island and are highlighted by the brutality of your attacks on zombies. Just about anything in the environment can become a weapon - a paddle, a piece of pipe, hammers, baseball bats, machetes, brass knuckles and the few firearms scattered along too. Your attacks on zombies can crack skulls to pieces or hack off individual body parts. It's amazingly brutal and something that younger kids should probably avoid altogether. Blood and gore will splatter liberally on the ground, walls and just about anywhere else. The environment of Banoi is rendered beautifully albeit there seems to be some sort of hazy filter put over the entire game. Palm trees sway in the wind, waves wash up on sandy beaches and fragments of what was a tropical paradise lie scattered about.Another excellent aspect of Dead Island is the upgrade/weapon creation system. As you progress through the story you'll stumble across recipes for different weapons that you can then create by finding or purchasing specific items. You can for example early in the game create a \"nail'd bat\" which is done by combining a baseball bat and nails. You can then upgrade the bat at an upgrade station by using cash that you find around the environment or on zombies you dispatch. Upgrades affect four distinct categories: damage, durability, force, and handling.So far my review has focused on the positive aspects of Dead Island. Unfortunately there are many, many negative aspects to the game.First, the amount of bugs and glitches in this game is truly astounding. As of this review Dead Island in its current state is better described as a beta rather than a product ready for commercial release. There are numerous multiplayer related glitches including connection problems, PSN friends not populating the \"friends list\" on the multiplayer menu, random drops and game-ending freezing issues that may strike at any moment. In one multiplayer session my friend's game froze 3 times in about 1.5 hours of gameplay. In the last session drivable vehicles disappeared entirely. The only indication that my character was in a vehicle was my floating character in the sitting position mimicking driving motions. In another bizarre glitch my friend and I descended a flight of stairs only to have them become unclimable slippery-slopes that we couldn't escape. This particular glitch has forced us to modify our play style only sending one of us down a flight of stairs lest we should both become stuck. If the glitch strikes (and it has multiple times) then one of us is at least able to keep the game session open whilst the other drops out and then re-joins the game. In short this game is a frustrating mess and I find myself hoping that the game doesn't glitch long enough to complete a mission and progress further more than just enjoying the game.The story while intriguing quickly dissolves into a mindless mass of fetch quests dominated by the nasty habit of the developer to quickly repopulate the zombie population in areas you've already progressed through. The comparison that comes to mind here is to the game Borderlands. That is to say that there are countless \"travel to location x, get item y and return to person z, while killing the same enemies you've already killed hundreds of times\" missions. Dead Island bogs down in repetition so quickly that I'm already finding myself wanting to play less and less.Personally Dead Island is a hard sell. I would only recommend this game after more patching is done by the developer and even then only at a discount price.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2012"}

The art style is charming, both 3D models and 2D character sprites. The voice work is quirky and great, albeit alittle cheesy at times. The soundtrack is arguably some of the best ever featured in a Nintendo game.The graphics, in visual effects and 3D effects are currently the best on the 3DS. Its the 1st game of my 9 3DS game collection where I exclusively play in 3D. I don't even 2D 1% of the time. Character models, although vibrant in animation and charm, kind of turn me off when I see their hands. Animated facial movements are a given these days, but what I really appreciate is hand/finger movement. Block-hands are way too outdated.Controls of the game seem to be a hot button regarding this game. Some love it, some like it, and some just flat out hate hit. In my opinion I love the controls, and don't think they're in the least bit difficult to use. While there are a ton of ways to customize the controls, its the default controls that are the best way to go that offer faster, more accurate input than can ever be done by button. The controls are pretty much what you'd expect out of a 1st-person shooter on the old-NDS. Most notably Metroid Prime Hunters. Of course people who never used their 3DS to actually play an action or FPS game, would naturally not enjoy these controls. Kid Icarus is NOT for casual gamers. It is for hardcore enthusiast, and a welcomed addition to Nintendo's long history of way-too-easy games.The amount of content and stuff to do in the game is immense, and the trophy/treasure side-quest part of the game encourages playthroughs. Adjusting the difficulty alters levels and enemies to behave more aggressively, and also grants you access to previously locked rooms, or alternate story-sequences. The fact that playing higher difficulties costs you to risk your game's currency, brings an urgency to the game thats very welcomed in a handheld. Weapons also play a big part of the game as they radically change your playstyle, van be fused to create other weapons, and what you earn, buy, or make can be used is multiplayer. and this paragraph barely scratches the surface of in-game content as you may invest you time to weapon crafting, treasure hunting, idol collecting, or collecting some of the 400+ Kid Icarus AR cards that are to be available in the world the comming weeks/months.Multiplayer is shallow, but brutally fun. Particularly the online multiplayer. only 2 modes, team battle and typical free for all, with practically little-to-stats. Multiplayer can be a little chaotic almost all-times. Playing nearby friends allow you to fill gaps in with bots, assuring you that you can always play this mode even without internet, or others to play with. Weapons and powers you collect in solo-mode can be used in this mode. This almost makes online completely one-sided at times.Anyways, I used way too much space for this review. Bottom line is Kid Icarus is the most fun, beautiful, feature-rich game I have played on the 3DS. Perhaps because the game and gameplay is so fresh to me, I'm more satisfied with this title compared to other games like Mario Kart or Ocarina of Time which I've played abillion times.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-31-2012"}

I'll say again THIS IS NOT FALLOUT 3! I have read to many reveiws about hoiw people keep comparing this game to fallout. Yes fallout was and is a great game but let's really compare the two:Graphics:Fallout 3- Great graphics and real world feel to the post DC area.Borderlands- Cellshade and almost cartoon feel world with lush colors.Mechinacs:Fallout 3- life like in the way you move, shoot, and see the world.Borderlands- Same but more fluid movement through the maps.AI:Fallout 3- Some are more smart then others. For the most part the canoon fodder is challenging at times but nothing to stress about.Borderlands- Challenging at times but nothing that you can't handle with the right equipment. Sometimes more challenging when you level up to quickly.Stroyline:Fallout 3- Great mainline story and side stories when you come across them. Not so much fetch and return quests but more of a story derived quests. Nothing really engaging until you get to your quest.Borderlands- More engaging while on the quest even though you are killing skags all the way and maybe some bandits. But nothing more then that while on the quest. Storyline is vague but there is one if you can follow it but it is there.Weapons:Fallout 3- Great guns and some that are note worthy like the garbage shooter that allows you to shoot whatever you find like books, cans, boxes and anything that you can get your hands on.Borderlands- there is more guns then all the US armed forces combined. But and this is a real big but each one is no different then the last and only by the damage that it can do. I found myself only carrying certain ones even though there were tons to choose from. Even though there are tons of guns they really should have put just a little more thought into the guns that are given or come across. Some you will keep others you will just walk by.character development:Fallout 3- No end to how your character can come out and there is no end to the choices either.Borderlands- Character tree is a good touch and only good for what you want to do in the game. But that is about it. Nothing to really change how you look except for the color but then you can't even see that. Somewhat flat in this area.Replay value:Fallout 3- There is a high replay value to this game cause there is a lot that you can miss if you are just following the storyline. And you can have the same character but be totally different then the first one.Borderlands- Only way you can get something different is to change the character completely by choosing a different one. This is not bad cause each character has a certain special ability that does come in handy while in combat. But the tree is still the same for the most part. And the only reason to replay the game is to play with other characters which is not bad thing either.Online:Fallout 3- Have not played this game online but there is one.Borderlands- Have not played this one online either but have played the co-op though and its great.Highpoints:Fallout3- the highpoints to fallout are that the worlds and maps are massive. The storyline is great. The graphics and physics are great and the weapons are one of a kind if you can find them.Borderlands- The highpoints that I like are the co-op, the tons of guns (even though you don't need them all) and there is always something to kill. Forgot to mention that there is a guntruck that you can ride in to move more quickly in.Lowpoints:Fallout 3- Can't really see at night, world is too life like at times and you die a lot if you don't plan well. And you have to walk everywhere.Borderlands- repetive quests, to many guns that you may never use and a vague storyline.So I hope that I cleared somethings up to anyone thinking that this is a Fallout 3 copycat. This game holds its own in so many ways that makes it worth getting. I almost forgot that there is some comdey to this game and that makes it less lifelike when it comes this game. In some aspects it does have a Fallout feel but Borderlands is its own game in its own right. I have played to many short and good games along with some bad and long games not worth the money. Borderlands is one to play and have. If you are not playing COD:MW2 you should be playing this game. Bottomline is its worth the $60 if you put the fact out of your head that this is a Fallout clone. Borderlands is good, rent if you don't trust the hype but buy it if you want something completely different. Trust me you will feel like you are getting your moneys worth with this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0HCNI","description":"","reviewerName":"Gabriel Young","summary":"A near-perfect Star Wars experience","reviewText":"After several hours of playing (who sleeps during these launches anyway?), here's what I think about Kinect Star Wars:-GRAPHICS- (8/10)Was really hoping for 10 here but I'll take a solid 8. The colors are vivid, the motion is fluid, and the use of shadow/light is decent. However, the environment could be better and the characters look a little too `cartoony' for my taste.-SOUNDS/MUSIC- (8/10)The audio is consistently well done throughout. Obviously the use of timed sounds is nice, like the lightsabers' voomps or speeders soaring. The music is reminiscent of typical Star Wars.-CONTROLS- (6/10)Pretty good for Kinect but not perfect. Perhaps I need to lower my expectations since Kinect sensors could never be as precise as game controllers. Some movements are also slow, even using lightsabers seem like semi-slow motion.-FUN FACTOR- (10/10)I guess this is what matters most. If you fancy the idea of wielding a lightsaber (albeit even a make-pretend one) to play a game, the moment has arrived.-REPLAYABILITY- (10/10)Yes, you can spend a lot of time in the game, especially with all the different modes of play.1. Jedi mode - Training to become a Jedi is the key to this game. Swinging a lightsaber or waving your hand (for the force) has never been so fun. This is the mode you'll be spending the most time in.2. Duel mode - Eh. Just a bunch of one-on-one battles. Even a fighting game fan like myself found this mode got old pretty fast, especially since you can only duel NPC opponents.3. Podracing mode - A half-decent \"driving\" game within the game! Just six races but podracers can be customized. Beautiful backdrops on the various planets too. `Controller-free' piloting isn't all that great though.4. Rancor mode - Surprisingly lots of fun! You are one of five monsters who run about destroying things. Grrr, break stuff. Then break more stuff!5. Dance mode - I can't believe this is in here. Is anyone really going to be spending a lot of time dancing for Jabba? Really? I guess it's supposed to be funny but there's not much value here. I've played DDR (circa 2002) and this isn't even remotely close to that.-OVERALL- (9/10)For Star Wars fans, this game is exactly what we expected: a fun, new medium to immerse ourselves into that world. The scenes we've replayed in our minds for years are no longer reserved for our imaginations only. This is as real as it gets until a holodeck version comes out. It's not a game without flaws but it met my expectations. I can appreciate this for what this is -- a nice rendition Star Wars using body-control technology; hopefully you can too.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2012"}

New special moves and attacks, including the groundbreaking Final Smash. New items and assist trophies.","reviewerName":"Siklootd","summary":"The Best Nintendo Game Got Better","reviewText":"Who would win a fight between Mario and Luigi?  How about between Link and Samus Aran?  Fans of video games always pose these questions to one another, and with the Smash Bros. series it's always been possible to finally fulfill these fantasies.  Starting off as a small release for the Nintendo 64 that simply contained under 20 characters, Smash Bros. has evolved to a more in depth game that even the most hardcore can appreciate.  Being a fan of Guilty Gear, Street Fighter, and Tekken, I have always appreciated a good fighting game, however Smash Bros. is not a technical fighter.  Instead, the series has always relied upon items and other such things to turn the tide of the battle in your favor.  Brawl is no different.  It has added and build upon the item system previously seen in Melee.The latest inclusion is the \"Smash Ball\" which initiates the character's \"Final Smash\" attack.  These attacks are super-powerful, and over the top trademark moves related to the character.  For example:  Kirby's Final Smash is reminiscent of the 8bit days where Kirby could obtain the \"Cook\" ability, while Fox's summons his trademark \"Landmaster tank\" in which he uses to attack his rivals.  Turning off all items within the game can make for a more evenly balanced fight based upon skill rather than luck.  The game is rather deep, with each character varying greatly from each other, yet still maintaining a balance to the degree where victory is still possible as each character.  This is a great improvement over Melee where characters such as Bowser/Koopa where either too slow or too weak to ever have the same chance of winning as others.  Brawl expanded upon the already fantastic roster of Melee with the addition of many new characters:  Wario, Pokemon Trainer (Squirtle, Ivysaur, Charizard), King Dedede, Diddy Kong, Lucario, Lucas, Ike, Wolf, Captian Olimar, Pit, Metaknight, Toon Link, R.O.B. (a robot that came packaged with the original NES), Snake (Metal Gear Solid), and Sonic.  The inclusion of two third party characters shows the tremendous impact that the series has had over the years.There are several modes included in the game, including a stage builder that allows the user to create their own levels using a wide variety of tools.  The game also includes online gaming that offers two modes, one in which you can battle friends whose \"Friend Codes\" you have obtained, or one where you may battle against random people.  When battling a friend the game includes several different \"taunts\" that can be associated with each of the various directions corresponding to the desired taunt position.  The main mode of the game is the \"Subspace Emissary\", a long story/campaign mode, in which the game forces you to play as varying characters in order to complete the storyline.  Upon progression you will unlock several new characters and will gain trophies and stickies as well.  This mode can take a while to complete, but with the added benefit of co-op play, \"Subspace Emissary\" can be rather entertaining.  The game features several different control schemes that can be utilized:Wii Remote + NunchukWii Remote Only (Sideways)Wii Remote + Classic ControllerGameCube ControllerIf anyone has played the previous installments of the Smash series then the ideal control scheme is that of the GameCube Controller.  The ease of use and the layout design of the GameCube controller make it the best choice in which to control the game.  The Wii Remote + Nunchuk layout plays rather similar to the GameCube controller, mapping character movement to the control stick, and has the added benefit of performing \"Smash Attacks\" by moving the remote to the desired side associated with the attack.  The Classic Controller layout plays very similar to the Gamecube layout, and has the added benefit of being wireless.  The Wii Remote turned sideways plays by mapping character movement to the d-pad.  In my opinion this layout offers the best overall control over your character due to being able to control the character through a d-pad versus an analog stick while using 1 and 2 for the various attack commands.  I recommend trying out all of the layouts and see which one fits you the best.Overall, Brawl takes what the last two games did and mixes in even more things to create a better overall experience.  The levels are more interactive (such as the \"Wario Ware\" level in which you must do as the stage tells you in order to receive bonus items), and the characters are more equally leveled.  If you're looking for a game that can be fast paced, chaotic, entertaining, and addictive, look no further than Brawl.  It's possibly the most exciting game I have played on the Wii, and with so many modes, characters, and ways to play, you will never run out of things to do with Brawl.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-08-2009"}

Mullins","summary":"Still one of the best western RPGs on Consoles.","reviewText":"In my opinion Bioware has never made a bad game, but with so many games under their belt some are naturally better than others. Dragon Age Origins was a fantastic game with compelling stories, characters and plenty of options all the way up to the end in regards to story.Dragon Age 2 takes all the great gameplay elements from its predecessor but also changed the formula that made DA so good. The combat moved to a much more hack and slash style from the more tactical style of the first. The game takes place over a ten year in game time frame and has very little gamewise to do with Origins. Several familiar names from the first game appear as well as from Awakings, but with the number of fantastic characters from Origins I would have expected them to pick some of the more popular NPCs.I enjoyed the game and the story as well as the NPC companions, but not as much as I did in Origins. There were a good number of interesting quests and some of the companion specific quests I really enjoyed. But after a 20 hour play through I have no real interest in going back and playing through it again. The story seems more linear and your effect on the game world as the main character just don't seem as weighty and important as Origins. I also missed the great camp setting in the first game, in DA2 you are required to run all over town to talk with your companions. Some of the NPC/Companion interaction while in the party I found very fun and interesting. I even found myself laughing at the interactions between Isabella and Aveline. But when compared to the first Dragon Age and other fantastic Bioware games like Mass Effect I think they could have done even better. It is well worth the investment but keep your expectations in check.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-13-2011"}

I'd recently been burned by a shoddy Madden 2005 game which is just awful, but that's another review.  ESPN has long been my favorite series of games for NFL and NBA due to their amazing graphic qualities and spectacular gameplay.To start, the presentation is awesome, ESPN styled menus throughout the game, and relatively easy to navigate.  The first thing I did when I got it home was jump online and download the lastest rosters which were approximately 2 weeks old, so they're quite up to date.Getting into the gameplay, the graphics are just too good.  If you've seen screenshots on the web, they do it no justice, the game's look is just great.  The players are built like their counterparts, and have practically identical faces.  During Jamal Lewis' player of the game interview it was stunning to see the detail in his face.  The fields look awesome, and ESPN has great in-game stats, like showing how well the QB is doing to different parts of the field, or how the running is progressing.  I was also digging the on screen drive results showing what the team did in each of its drives throughout the game.  I didnt see anything as analytical as this on Madden 2005.The sound is pretty damn impressive as well.  The commentary is the same chatter as last year throughout, but at least it's not Madden and his \"witty\" remarks all day long.  A nice addition is Suzy Kolber on the sidelines doing some awesome reporting, and a new feature this year is cutaway sounds.  In previous incarnations of ESPN, there would be cutaway to fans, players on the bench, coaches on the sideline and other type scenarios, but they were always silent.  Now there's full chatter amongst the players, the fans, the coaches and the sideline reporter.  Also it was awesome seeing a Raven's fan taunting the crowd in Denver.Overall, great game once again, and the newest additions are just awesome.  I haven;t played online yet, but will do so soon, though Im sure its just as fun as always, and ESPN's league format makes a great tool for tracking your seasons online.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-04-2004"}

Never having owned an N64 or a Gamecube, this was my first entry into the 3D Zelda world, and my first Zelda game since the brilliant Link to the Past over 15 years ago.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that much of the feeling of the classic Zelda games that I loved as a child has remained.  The game looks and sounds great.  The inclusion of motion controls is what made this a very cool experience.  Just swinging the remote to swing your sword and incorporating the two controls together to shoot bows & arrows really adds an entirely new dimension to the gaming experience.  The controls work very well for the most part, although some of the special attacks you get as you advance further in the game were hard to pull of consistently.The action and pacing of the game are done very well.  I really enjoyed working my way through the dungeons and gradually opening up new areas to explore in the overworld.  The boss fights are incredibly epic and thrilling experiences.  The only thing I didn't like a whole lot was some of the cumbersome missions that you had to complete in wolf form in the twilight realm.  They got aggravating at times, but not enough to deter from the overall quality of the game.  Overall, I highly recommend this game.

Washington \"CogsnWheels\"","summary":"A few glitches, but the force is strong is this game","reviewText":"Overall I can say that I have been happy with this game. Being a big Star Wars fan & also playing previous installments of the game on older generation consoles I had big expectations. Did this game meet them? Yes.. But when I say this game met expectations I also expected some flaws.. There are very few games that are perfect. Even the most fun games have flaws. Did this game utilize the next generation technology of the PS3. Yes it did... The graphics are amazing. The vivid colors of the environments & characters are stunning. The different colors of the light sabers & the light that it emits in action looks like it's straight out of the movie. The sound & music are incredible too. The music is straight from the movie & the sound effects of the saber & the sound of the force energies (lightning, force push, etc) are straight from the movie. I have a 7:1 surround system with a huge subwoofer that shakes the room whenever I use the force push lol. The game play is really detailed too. The technology of the Euphoria & Havok Physics system is really cool. Your enemies act independently & opposing forces fight against each other. There are parts of the game where you can actually release captive wookies to fight against the Imperial troops. I love being able to lift a terrified, helpless storm trooper & throw him into a energy charged force field to watch him disintegrate hehehe..  How cool is that? Where I first realized there were faults in this game, was on the level of the junk planet. It was very hard to distinguish between what part of the environment was interactive & what part was for display. I found myself jumping to my death several times on that level. Also the camera angles can be cumbersome at times & you find your self taking damage while you try to gain a better view of your perspective. Also, like another review stated, the lock on system for using the force powers can be very frustrating. The targeting system for Psi-Ops on the PS2 console was in deed much better.. But this game kicks Psi-Ops in the a** everywhere else though. The force upgradeable force powers makes the game much more enjoyable because you find yourself attempting to use better combos & find hidden bonus items to gain more points & upgrade your saber so you can overpower your opponents. Like I stated the 2nd level was the worse & most awkward because your character is relatively weak because you are still learning the controls to the game, his force powers are not as strong, & just like any new game you have to learn the flow of the game to get comfortable in playing. But after that it is all uphill. As you play your character is reminiscent of the real concept of the Star Wars saga. You start off as an apprentice, but the more missions you get through you become a master of the force. Also the storyline is pretty good because your character has moral decisions to make & you see that he indeed has humanity. Overall I think this game is well worth the money. I plan on beating it. And then going back through & beating it again with style & finding all of the hidden bonuses..","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2008"}

However, take note that if you really need a 2nd nunchuk also, you're going to have to get that separately.This game works out all right as a kind of 'learn to use the wii-mote' game, and also all right as a \"hey, we have company, let's put that in because it's really easy to just pick up and start playing\" kind of game.  It's definitely fun to mess around with for a little while, and seeing the pictures of your Miis in the shooting game (where you're supposed to shoot the targets that don't have your portraits, and then rescue the Miis from alien kidnapping) is fairly amusing.It's definitely easy to understand and if you need a game that virtually anything can at least take a try at, so that you can play with friends and family who aren't awfully adept with video games, you'll get a worthwhile value out of this.As a game to just play by yourself in general, I think it doesn't have enough depth to hold the attention of most games for large amounts of gaming time.

When I heard about the GOTY Edition and some friends said it was easily a 5 star game, I thought I would go ahead and give it a try.There is very little that I can add to the reviews regarding gameplay, art direction, writing, etc. Cartoony style, loot collecting, split screen and on-line co-op and competitive play are the hallmarks. I really haven't done anything with the DLC yet becuase I'm still early in the game, but my first impression is that the game is virtually flawless. The variety is endless and I can see this will be a massive time suck and will be cutting into GT5 and Black Ops both. The online community is thriving and the online co-op is a blast. If you are not interested in playing online and just want to go solo, you can play all the way through the main portion of the game that way as well.I really wish I hadn't wasted as much time as I did on MW2 after playing for just a short time in Borderlands. If you are like me and passed on Borderlands but enjoy RPG's or FPS's, this game cannot be missed. I would also encourage anyone to buy a used copy of the original and purchase the DLC seperately to make sure you want all of it (and it's cheaper than the current list price). As many reviews have stated, the DLC is online, not on-disc, so there is no reason to pay full price unless you really want a box that says GOTY Edition on the cover.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2010"}

Allen","summary":"A game that doesn't pretend to be anything else!","reviewText":"Is this one of the best games of all time, or does it come close to Modern Warfare or some of the other more developed first person shooters, no!  But this game doesn't pretend to be anything else than an arcade shooter, which any true gamer and first person fan can enjoy.  It's simple point and shoot fun, and so far the game has been great.  The story is what you would expect of an arcade shooter, simple.  The graphics are not COD or Ghost Recon detailed, but they're still good and get the job done.  Giving this game a five not for the story or graphics, but for the simple fact of living up to arcade style fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2011"}

This game was fun for the first 10 hours but then it got so repetitive. I wish this game had more things to do.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2012"}
