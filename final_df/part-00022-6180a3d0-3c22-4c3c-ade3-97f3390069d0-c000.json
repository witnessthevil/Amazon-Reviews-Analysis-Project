{"product_name":"B002EE1P2W","description":"Set several years after the events of the first game in the series,Dead Rising 2contains all the fun and over-the top carnage which gamers associate with a zombie apocalypse. As with all releases in theDead Risingseries, it is a survival horror game. Players take on the role of an all-new character, with equally new motivations to survive and resources to do so. These resources include new weapons, expanded weapon combination/creation possibilities, and even two-player coop functionality. The game also features a 4-player online multiplayer mode and a dramatic increase in the number of zombies that can be faced at once.","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"If you didn't like the first one, stay away from this.","reviewText":"When I first saw footage of Dead Rising 2, I immediately noticed it looked identical to the first game in nearly every way, except that you didn't get to take pictures anymore. That was a key feature in the first game, and was actually a lot of fun. Now a few years later, ps3 owners have a chance to try out a Dead Rising game for the first time. Is it worth the wait? Well, it depends on what kind of gameplay you like. If you like straight up action, hack 'n slash or shoot 'em ups, Dead Rising 2 might not be for you. If you like to plan things out and are big on time management, you'll probably have a better time with DR2 than other people. Oddly enough, I'm not in either one of those categories, but I went into this one with a clean slate, and found myself not having a whole lot of fun. Maybe it's because I'm sick of zombies, the current overused game/movie enemy, but I thought I'd be having a bit more fun than I ended up having here.This time around, you play as Chuck, a motorcyclist who's stuck in a mall with his daughter Katey, who was bitten by a zombie. She hasn't turned into one yet because Chuck's been giving her Zombrex, a drug that fights the infection, but when you start the game, you're all out. You main objective is to run around the mall and other nearby locations, looking for Zombrex, which needs to be given to Katey at a precise time (never before the time frame either), otherwise she's gone. Later as the story progresses (and this is an early story point in the first 30 minutes, so I'm not really spoiling anything), it turns out that the military is on their way to the mall. If they find Katey in her condition, they'll take her away. So now Chuck needs to start fixing up his motorcycle in order to escape. While out and about, you'll find other survivors who you can help save, and you can even have a friend join in for some good drop in/drop out co-op gameplay, which is a HUGE help in getting missions done, and provides a distraction from the seemingly millions of zombies you'll be taking out.That's one thing the game definitely does right- overwhelms you with zombies. There aren't just a couple hundred in the mall, no, there are tons. Check out the trophy list for DR2 and you'll see that you only get bronze trophies for taking out huge numbers, which takes a while to do. Most of the zombies aren't that tough, and can be taken out with a few hits of your standard melee weapons, but it's the sheer numbers that'll get to you. I found myself dying a few times as soon as I entered the first section of the mall. Chuck's inventory is fairly small at first too, and since you need item slots to hold everything, even healing items, it's a good idea to carry two food/drink items with you whenever you can. As you go through the game, you'll be able to carry more, but it takes time. Leveling up is done via PP, which is earned as you kill zombies, usually with powerful attacks or with customized weapons. This is another good thing about DR2- the number of customizable weapons, and how creative they are. You want a chainsaw on each end of a boat paddle? You got it. Machine guns on the arm rests of a wheelchair? Check. Drill spear? Bingo. Finally, while the story isn't anything special, I did like the father/daughter aspect, where Chuck's top priority is Katey's safety, and showing how much he cares for her. Even in the opening cutscene, someone brings up 'your next of kin' and Chuck tells him, with a bit of attitude, that she has a name.Alright, it sounds like the game's fine based on that, right? So why give it 2 stars overall? The gameplay is too slow for my tastes, especially in the beginning. Yes, I know your speed gets better as you progress through the game, but there's just no excuse for Chuck to be moving as slow as he does in the first part of the game. I kept trying to figure out if there was a run/sprint action by holding a button down, because his normal run sure doesn't move much faster than say, Kratos walking in God of War 3. A big garbage can hits pretty fast, but some smaller weapons take a while to swing, and the recovery time is horrible. Chuck's movements could've also used some polish, and I was never positive when I'd be able to evade an attack by jumping over a zombie. Evading would've helped the game big time, and is almost standard in most action game these days, but the right thumbstick is set to moving the camera (something you'll be doing a lot of). Also there'll be times when so many items are available for Chuck to grab, that you'll have to be in -just the right spot- in order to get the one you want. Positioning him just right can take a few seconds, and most of the time you won't be wanting to waste time just to get a tomahawk instead of vinyl records when there are 20 zombies 5 feet away. And like I said earlier, time management is very important. There are a good number of times when multiple missions will be open at once, or you'll have a chance to help a survivor before finishing the main mission. An example that comes to mind immediately is when I had Zombrex for Katey, then found another person who was infected and needed Zombrex as well. I could either leave him for dead, or give him the Zombrex, then try to find more for Katey or get enough money to buy some at the pawn shop. Guess what happened to him? Yeah, he was toast. If there was enough time to help him, I would've, but with the time limit on giving Katey her medicine, you just can't afford to help people sometimes. Add to this some frequent loading screens (even after a quick 30 second cutscene) and bathrooms, the game's take on save points, that are usually very far away from one another, and you have a game that is often challenging but not in a good or fun way. And for what it's worth, the visuals look pretty dated too, almost like this could've been done 3 years ago.If you haven't played a Dead Rising game before, I'd recommend renting DR2 before spending money on it at the current price. Good voice acting, a good main character, smart customization in the weapons, and truly making you feel like it's a zombie apocalypse are all some big selling points to me. But the cons build up to the point where the game frustrated me too much to care about giving it a second play through.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Keogh","summary":"Pinnacle of Playability - most Lackluster of the stories","reviewText":"Must play game! I feel that AC games have all grown and built on their predecessors. However, UbiSoft has a particular knack for fixing one thing only to add something else equally annoying. With AC4 they built on some really great aspects of their previous games and added a few new surprises: ship to ship fighting is challenging and legendary ships will require strategy, free run and counter attacking is far more natural, diving challenges were a very welcome addition, less jumping in and out of the animus. On the down side, there are annoying and frustrating aspects: hacking mini-games were fine but the last few \"frogger\" hacking game are complete BS, Kenway's fleet is also worthless on the XBOX - this mini-game is apparently available through a phone app which would have been cool but it didn't work on my Droid Maxx, additionally the white whale community events never pop up, there is no 'precursor' story line this is a stand alone - you are just some deadbeat Dad looking for a quick buck or collecting pay checks from Abstergo, the 100% mission completion is again 100% too OCD - some of the optional objectives did not even appear in the mission status until afterwards. UPDATE: Freedom Cry DLC - this was so much easier than the DLC for AC3! When doing 'The Tyrany of King Washington' I was hard pressed at a number of places. The Freedom Cry DLC was more of a side story than new content. No new powers or anything like they did in King Washington. As a result, can't recommend the additional cost for the DLC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-02-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00CQ7CIMS","description":"","reviewerName":"hwrose379","summary":"As a piece of DLC, this works. As an actual retail game, not so much","reviewText":"PREFACE: I bought this game as DLC for New Super Mario Bros. U back in June and I have completed it since.New Super Luigi U is an interesting piece of DLC (downloadable content). It's basically a brand new game. Imagine this: Take New Super Mario Bros. U, redo ALL 82 levels, reduce the time limit of every level to 100 seconds, and make Luigi the main playable character. Take away all the extras (the challenges, Boost Mode, etc.), and you have New Super Luigi U (NSLU).NSLU is a fantastic piece of DLC. The levels are brilliantly redesigned and contain some of the best level designs to be found in the NSMB series. Each level contains 3 star coins (as usual) and trust me, these coins are deviously hidden. With the reduced time limit, it's rather difficult to go around trying to find each star coin in one run. This game pretty much requires you to do multiple run-throughs of the levels to find each star coin. With the world map being the same as NSMBU, it's kind of saddening knowing which levels contain secret exits, but within the levels, the secret exits are masterfully hidden and it will take a keen eye to discover them. Since each level only has 100 seconds, they are naturally pretty short. But to make up for this, there are no checkpoint flags and each level has a higher concentration of enemies.With this DLC, Luigi's classic (and famous) moveset returns. Luigi will now jump higher than Mario and it is more difficult for him to come to a complete stop. Luigi also has an interesting new flutter kick, similar to Yoshi's flutter jump. This allows Luigi to gain some extra air after making your initial jump. Luigi's new moveset takes some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it practically becomes second nature.With Mario nowhere to be seen, a new character would have to fill his slot during 4-player mode. The new playable character is Nabbit, a thieving scandal that steals almighty Super Acorns and forces you to catch him in order to reclaim the prize. Nabbit is immune to all enemies, making him a perfect match for beginners. But, to balance Nabbit's immunity, he cannot power-up and is still prone to pits and lava. Nabbit is accessible during single player for those having difficulty with a level. If you're using the GamePad or Pro Controller, simply press L/ZL while selecting a level (if you're using the Wii Remote, press B while selecting a level) and you can play as Nabbit. It's a handy feature to have.NSLU has an insane difficulty level. With the reduced time limit and the higher enemy concentration, this game offers a true challenge. This will even put master 2D Mario players to the test. If you are looking for a truly challenging 2D Mario game, this here is your answer.I only have two complaints with this DLC: 1) The story is EXACTLY the same as its Mario counterpart. Peach is held hostage in her castle and Luigi must fight his way back to save her. It's rather shocking that with all of the changes Nintendo made, they could've at least changed Peach into Daisy. 2) The boss battles are exactly the same as they were in NSMBU. It's rather disappointing as I can now play each boss battle with my eyes closed. Even though they didn't change the story, Nintendo could've AT LEAST changed the boss battles a little bit. So if you've played NSMBU, don't expect anything new in regards to the boss battles.All-in-all, NSLU is a fantastic piece of downloadable content. However, I think this game should've remained DLC-only. Buying this game in retail form is not a good value. You pay $10 more than the DLC price for the exact same content...only with a nice looking case. If you buy this game at retail, you ONLY get the adventure...you won't get any of the extras found in NSMBU, and those extras really extend the game's playability. It's a better value if you buy NSMBU + NSLU as add-on content, because you get TWO adventures plus all of the extras. Of course, this is only my opinion...you might see more value in the retail version, but I personally think the retail version is not worth the extra money. So if you plan on getting this game, you best decide which package is better for you (NSMBU + NSLU or NSLU only) and then make your purchase. You won't want to miss out on this adventure...it will put your Mario platforming skills to the test.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2013"}

What is it?  It's a lot of the same as the first Rainbow Six Vegas, with a few tweeks here and there.  Graphically, it's not really much of an improvement over the original.  The textures and particle effects aren't really anything to write home about, but that's not to say they are bad.  It's just that next gen titles should meet a higher bar as time goes by.  We do get to see the seedier side of Vegas in terms of strip clubs, back alleys, and the like.  The gun play is still a lot of fun and challenging.  The ability to customize your character is also a lot of fun.  There are a whole host of different multiplayer options for you to choose from.  I thought UT3 had a lot, but that's nothing compared to Vegas 2.  Because there weren't a lot of other improvements to this edition, it seems more like an expansion pack than a sequel.

Not only can you chain such incredible moves, but there's just so much nuanced depth to the combat system; you'll constantly be learning new things when playing Bayonetta. I have never experienced such elegance in a combat system. I've played them all, including Ninja Gaiden, Devil May Cry, God of War, etc., and Bayonetta takes the cake and eats it all up. This one's that darn good.The graphics are colorful, crisp, and overall just very pleasing to the eyes. The levels can be really imaginative and detailed. Bosses are huge and animate wonderfully. Bayonetta also animates beautifully as she's pulling off a ton of cool moves to take out her foes. It all looks and performs admirably on the Xbox 360 hardware.The story is 100% insane. Not only is it cheesy, but it's also heartwarming at moments. There's some really likable characters on display in Bayonetta. Great voice acting and great music round out an excellent production.If you like a fun story and incredible gameplay, you can't do any better than Bayonetta. Buy this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2011"}

I read all these reviews saying that this is the most gore filled game ever made.  I hear that a lot but i'm pretty good when it comes to gore.  This game I still maintain pretty good to the gore.  But overall this is a great game.  You get to walk around as a convict and no one knows that your alive it's great.  You are getting taped killing all these different gangs.  You will eaisily get 15 hours of gameplay so you'll get your money's worth.  The graphics are kick ass and so is the sound.  This game has some pretty funny stuff in it.  You will have to repeat a lot of the levels over again to know where stuff is and where to go and what to do.  It does get a little annoying but the story line keeps you going.  This is probably one of Rockstars best story lines ever.

Now I got this game on launch day along with the system and although I have already beaten it once, it hasn't stopped me from playing again. One of the problems that many people have been complaining about with this on the DS is that the control schemes  are bad no matter which one you choose. Well, I think the controls are perfect and have never had a problem on here. In some places, the camera can be a hindrance but its nothing that ruins the game in any way. All the good memories you have of this on the N64 will surely return when playing this game along with some new areas as well as the ability to play as multiple characters besides just Mario. There are also new minigames that are a addicting to play and also make great use of the new touchscreen on the DS.

And what makes this game even more Interesting is that on a certain day and time each gym leader will be taking a break from their Gym and go off some where. That's where you come in and find them, When you do, talk to them and you will get their phone Number for your Poke' Gear and they even tell you what day and time to call em for a rematch.This time they're tough with their new team. Especially some of their pokemon are from the Sinnoh region. And what makes this game better than the Original is that You can collect lots of phone numbers even more than the Original cause on the Original you were only able to keep a certain amount to the point where you had to delete some to make room for some.

{"product_name":"B00DC7O77A","description":"","reviewerName":"Bryan","summary":"Stands up next to New Super Mario and Rayman Legends","reviewText":"People can say whatever negative things they want about the Wii U's library and sales numbers, but with the release of Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze, the system is shaping up to be one of the best consoles for platforming games. Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is a classic platformer through and through. Before we get started, one thing to note is that the game is largely still featuring tropical locales and sunny beaches. There isn't any ice to speak of in the first 50 levels of the game. Don't worry about slipping around on annoying icy levels. They come, but much later.Postives:-Large amount of variety in the levels: blasting around barrels, flying, mine carts, swinging, swimming, bonus rooms, and good basic platforming.-Choice of special jumping abilities: hovering, bouncing, or helicopter.-Tons of replay: hard mode, time trials, puzzle pieces, figurines, and secret levels.-Over 60 levels which are each fairly long on average.-Getting 100% isn't necessary to unlock all the levels. Puzzle pieces only unlock artwork. Unlocking all the levels is much simpler.-Consumable items can help get you through trouble areas, and can be bought with coins that are scattered all over the levels. Power ups include extra hearts and the ability to float out of a pit you fell into.-Online leaderboards for time trials which will show you replays of all the best times in the world.-Great presentation. Many imaginative backgrounds, like level 3-1 which features colorful dancing baobab trees and giraffes in the background.-Solid physics and responsive controls. The game is being noticed by the hardcore crowd for its excellent design. There are already people hoping to run this game at future \"Awesome Games Done Quick\" charity events.Negatives:-Boss battles are extremely long with no checkpoints; an average gamer will spend an entire night beating a single boss, I'd imagine.-There is a little bit of trial and error in some parts.-You can't choose which character to be in single player normal mode. The other Kongs jump on DK's back and give him their special abilities. In hard mode and co-op you get a choice.-Hard more isn't unlocked until you complete the game.-Hard mode is single player only.-Extra lives system similar to Mario games, which Rayman did away with for the better. It's annoying to have a limit on how many retries you get, especially when you can just continue your save file if you do run out.Overall, I think you can see that the positives hold far more weight than the negatives do - all the most important aspects of a good platformer are here, and the negative points are mostly nitpicking.As for which game is better between the various Wii U platformers available, I'd give Mario 3D World the top spot, but DKC:TF is about tied with Rayman and New Super Mario. It's really that good. I'd give all these games 5 stars, and as a bonus, Donkey Kong released for $10 under the normal $60 price tag! It's a bargain. The only way I wouldn't recommend Donkey Kong is if you don't have patience for challenging levels.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-12-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00HRKE1SI","description":"","reviewerName":"Stephen M. Lerch","summary":"Disappointing -comparing to othe headset options","reviewText":"If your only desire is to own a Titanfall branded set of headphones for your PC, Xbox One or 360, this is your only option. The problem is, if you're buying them for comfort, sound quality and/or build quality, you will be sorely disappointed.Short review:Compared to other similarly priced options, the Atlast Titanfalls headset falls on its face. You can buy the superior sounding XO Seven if you want just XBox One capability. If you want similar sounding audio as the Atlas for PC, 360, PS3 and PS4 support, the PX4 headset from Turtle Beach is a MUCH better option, and if you want Xbox One capability from that, just buy the Microsoft Xbox One Chat Adapter and you are done. And the PX4s, at current sale prices plus the chat adapter will end up costing less than these (keep in mind that's a sale price, dating my review but it's still relevant).Don't buy these.Longer review:Unboxing:Turtle Beach headset unboxing is generally a fun thing, though the experience has become a bit of &#34;more of the same&#34; as all their headsets are packaged similarly across the board. That's not a bad thing, and doesn't contribute to the 2 star review.These, however, are different in a &#34;this set is cheaper&#34; sort of way. Instead of using a magnet to keep the box closed, it's a simple standard box style with pieces that slide into sleeves. Other than that, the experience is much the same, with the headset being held in place by a plastic piece and beneath that, the cables and other accessories you need.Build quality:This is where this set shows that TB likely paid through the nose to get the license. The headset feels super cheap, like the cheapest plastic available was utlized. The headband feels stiff and the padding is NOT comfortable, unlike other TB headsets I've owned and still own and use. Wearing glasses with these, if I chew on something or have to talk, I hear creaking and cracking in my ears. It's not a sound caused by the headphones, it is the interaction of the headset with my head and ears. Without glasses, they are fine.Then there is the breakout box needed for 360 or PC gaming. I have other TBs that need a breakout box or adapter to use with the 360 or PC, and comparing this one just screams &#34;CHEAP.&#34; It's highly disappointing, as once again it feels like they skimped on the quality of the materials to justify the license cost.The artwork is OK on the headset, but it feels generic. Sure, it sorta matches some of the Titanfall art, but it just seems bland to me.Audio quality:Here's where this headset really falls apart. The sound quality is really, really poor. On the Xbox One, as you can't adjust EQ or anything, the sound has a harsh treble profile - highs sound horrible. The low end, the bass side, suffers as well, not thumping like you would expect when things explode and so on. The quality is the same on the 360 as there is no way to adjust these settings. Granted, this capability for DSP audio only comes with more expensive (not the above mentioned PX4s) TB headsets, but in this case the default profile is sad, lifeless and harsh.Of course, on the PC you can fix this with proper EQ, but that all depends on the software. Most games don't offer that capability, so you have to rely on the OS to handle that. Windows 8.1 is OK at it, but even with the enhancements it offers out of the box it really only gets the audio to an &#34;Acceptable&#34; quality for me. Using JRiver Media Center and the EQ they have I can get exactly what I want from them - too bad I can't route music and game sound through JRiver when playing games.The sound from these is stereo only. You have NO surround capability. Granted, all the &#34;surround&#34; headsets, or most, utilize two speakers and simulate the surround experience through DSP magic, but at least they offer it. This limitation likely comes into play as a Microsoft constraint - MS own headset is stereo only as well. But couldn't they at least offer surround on PC and 360?And the 360 connection - you have to use the stereo out of your system. Older 360s, if utilizing HDMI, will need a breakout box to get these to work, meaning an added cost above the already stupid price.In comparison to other headsets:TB XO Seven - the XO Seven only offers Xbox One support, but the audio quality is much better from them than these. I would only buy these if you know you want use the headset for anything elseTB PX4 - sound quality is better, and you can use them on the PS3, PS4, XBox 360, PC and Xbox One w/ the MS Xbox One Chat adapter.TB XP400 - wireless, can't work with the Xbox One, but works on PS3, PS4, 360 and PC. Sound quality is great, chat quality is great.TB XP Seven - wired. Works with PS3, PS4, 360, PC and Xbox One with the MS Xbox One Chat Adapter. It's also MUCH more expensive than the Atlas or other TB options mentioned. Sound quality is great, plus it comes with a programmable DSP, allowing you to customize the sound to the way YOU want to hear it. Great option if you can afford it.SteelSeries H - wireless, except w/ 360 chat. Works w/ PS3, PS4, 360, PC and can work on Xbox One w/ the Xbox One Chat Adapter. The audio quality from these are amazing - second to none I've ever tried. Comfort is super high. Build quality is top notch. Of course, the price matches the quality, but if you can afford the H, I'd recommend that hands down above all others I've ever used.Overall:The TB Titanfall Atlas headset is poor on many levels. It doesn't offer as much system support as similarly priced TB options. The build quality is the poorest TB I've ever used, even comparing to similarly priced models. Sound quality is the poorest TB headset I've ever used. Lack of EQ customization, on a headset designed only to offer stereo support, really kills the sound quality - this phenomenon is sad given other similar priced options from TB sound better out of the box even without EQ.The only reason this deserves more than two stars is if you really love Titanfall. And even then, you better REALLY love it to be able to see past all the short falls of this set, given the price. If they were $80 like the MS Xbox One headset, and offered PC support (unlike the MS headset), the price might not be so bad.Not recommended at all.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2014"}

More than just a cutting-edge game system, Xbox 360 also integrates high-definition video, DVD movie playback, digital music, photos, and online connectivity into one sleek, small tower, and in the process puts true Next-Gen power right at your fingertips.Xbox 360, shown with wireless controller, is a sleek, customizable gaming and entertainment systemUnder the HoodXbox 360 is much smaller than its predecessor--it measures approximately 3.3 by 12.2 by 10.2 inches and weighs 7.7 lbs. It's powered by custom IBM PowerPC-based CPU with three symmetrical cores each running at 3.2 GHz. It also carries a custom ATI graphics processor loaded with 10 MB of embedded DRAM, 48-way parallel floating-point dynamically scheduled shader pipelines and Unified shader architecture. This is powerful enough to draw 500 million triangles per second. In other words, it makes for great looking games in standard TV definition, and even better thanks to built-in support for HDTV 1080i televisions. It also supports the widescreen 16:9 format.The unit has a 12x dual-layer DVD-ROM drive, which plays both the game media and progressive-scan DVD movies right out of the box. For game-save and media storage, users can choose between the detachable and upgradeable 20GB hard drive, or a separately sold 64MB flash Memory Unit. Along with storing files, the hard drive will make the Xbox 360 backward-compatible with part of the existing Xbox game library.Control your GameplayXbox 360 uses a refined button layout for its controllers. Back and Start buttons sit at the center of the controller and between them is a new Xbox Guide button, which instantly takes the user to the Xbox 360 user interface. From there, they can check for friends online, access personal digital content like photos and songs, and more. The black and white buttons of the first Xbox controllers have been replaced with new shoulder buttons placed above the left and right triggers. Xbox 360 can accommodate up to four wireless controllers and has three USB 2.0 slots to use for wired controllers or for streaming your digital media from digital cameras, MP3 players, and any Windows XP-based PC.

It is revealed by 3 red flashing lights on the manual power button on the system; the usual color here is green. Make sure that you get a NEW model of the system, since my system, a 2007/late 2006 model, just got the RROD recently. I called MS, and they are sending a free box to mail the console to their nearby HQ. It could take up to a month to have it fixed and have it return to me.I don't have a PS3, but I do have a Wii, which I highly recommend, especially if you're eager to play classic games that otherwise only appear in broken cartridges (Probably less than 1% of NES systems haven't been destroyed by dust). The bottom line is; if you get the newer model of the 360, or the elite model, you should never see this horrible sign.

It still remains the most unexplored side of WWII, and this is the best portrayal of it, with barbaric Japs out for blood and unique weapons thrown into the mix.  The Russian conflict is obviously well-worn, familar, and predictable, but is still satisfying and ends with you placing the Soviet flag on top of the Reichstag while severely wounded.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2014"}
{"product_name":"B003Q9RG9K","description":"","reviewerName":"M.D.C. \"Tempting Reviews\"","summary":"Still not a 5-star game.  Impressive...but not perfection.","reviewText":"That title will either confuse you or infuriate you.  If you don't know what I'm referring to don't worry about it.  Those that get mad, well...(and as an aside, I note how many people are flagging the review as not helpful, which are likely people who disagree with the 4 star rating.  To those people abusing the rating system, you need to understand that based on the reviews that are up right now, mine is easily the most informational...don't be a fanboy.  4 stars won't kill the game.)Skip to the very bottom for summary judgment.  For the purposes of this review I will refer to the first VC as just VC, and part two as VC2.  As an aside, it is NOT required to play VC to enjoy VC2, but your enjoyment will increase somewhat if you had.  You'll also understand the gameplay much easier if you do, as VC did a great job of teaching you how to do things.  VC includes little helpers but they're not nearly as good.I initially had my doubts aboutValkyria Chronicles(VC).  I didn't buy it when it first came out, even though GameStop and many others had advertised it as the next big thing.  First off, SEGA is notorious for releasing obscure games amidst other more notable, more popular games.  They've done it with almost every game released on either Dreamcast or the next gen systems; a lot of notable games came out around that time, and even though I didn't play them, a lot of people skipped VC like I did.  It wasn't until later that I got the gumption to actually download the demo and found that it had some potential to be good.  When the price dropped I picked up a copy, and quite frankly, it's the only PS3 game I enjoyed through and through - almost more than my other games.  VC1 had a special something about it that really cannot be replicated, beyond the simplistic gameplay.  I did put up a review and you're welcome to read through that for my thoughts.  In summary though, the only real complaint I had was the fact that they punished you for being dominant.  In a game as fun as VC, it was a real heartbreaker to see that you got piddly experience for dominating each map and instead were encouraged to rush through things.When SEGA announced VC2, a lot of gamers who had later picked up and enjoyed VC were ecstatic, except for one thing: its system of choice.  Why the PSP after releasing the first one on the PS3?  It was explained that this change was primarily done to target a larger audience in hopes of drumming up enough interest to get a third game out on the PS3.  In retrospect it's rather humorous that people are upset at SEGA for doing what Square Enix is already doing (since Kingdom Hearts has had an iteration on PS2, cell phones, DS, and PSP thus far), yet SE gets lauded for \"innovating\".  In any event, I'm here to review VC2, and one thing is readily apparent: the limited hardware of the PSP does not hinder the experience at all.  In fact, I would daresay that the core engine is quite impressively done, and likeKingdom Hearts: Birth by SleepandWarriors Orochi, VC2 maximizes the experience so much that it almost feels like a natural fit on the handheld.VC2 takes place a few years after the first.  Though the war has ended and Cordelia has accepted her Darcsen heritage, there are still some who believe that the Darcsens caused the Calamity that ravaged the land and thus find it hard to follow a Darcsen leader.  This new faction is referred to in game as the Rebels, who hold various public events denouncing Cordelia as the reason for the unrest.  Your primary character is Avan, the younger brother of Leon, who was a hero at a local military academy.  One of the teachers stops by and informs you that your brother has fallen in battle, but he is unable to tell you why or how it happened.  Some rebels attack Avan's village, and he organizes a small team of stronger villagers to fight them off.  Afterwards, he decides to apply at the Academy himself in order to eventually find out what happened to his brother.  From the start it's clear that Avan is not the school type.  His academic prowess is less than ideal, though he is quite good at military movements and strategies.  He, along with Cosette and Zeri, are placed in Class G - the lowest and least regarded of the school classes.  It is here that Avan begins his development.VC2 is strikingly different from VC in that you are not initially involved in a large-scale war situation.  Here, you'll spend the bulk of your days at the Academy, participating in war exercises and minor skirmishes, and training and developing Class G.  You don't have to deal with the school side so much (alaShin Megami Tensei: Persona 3), only the military and training side.  As a side quest you will also have random encounters with other members of Class G; these encounters occur similar to the events inRecord of Agarest War, where you go to the area that they're located and watch a small cutscene play out.  Depending on how many times you have encountered that character, you may also be asked to participate in a special character skirmish, and if successful, the bond between you and that character will be strengthened and they will unlock hidden Potentials.  This is key in battle; the Potential usually improves upon a negative Potential, or adds to their skillset in battle.  A good bond between characters improves battle performance which is critical in most of the boss battles.  A lot of people have referred to this as \"dating sim\" but it's far from that.  They are short, quick ways to develop bonds between Avan and his troops, and it feels quite natural and realistic in a school setting like this.Academy time is broken out in months.  Each month reveals a certain number of required skirmishes that you must participate in to unlock the primary objective.  These objectives, as you will learn in the first month, are instances where you are called into primary combat, either to defend or lead an attack, or to escort important citizens.  These primary objectives are often substantially more difficult than the skirmishes, thus the need for ongoing training and development of your squad.  Secondary to the training is the R&D;, where you can develop new weapons and improvements for your team and tanks; however, unlike VC, improvements don't just randomly appear.  You will have to kill notable enemies to steal plans for the weapon enhancements.  I have a mixed opinion about this, but in any event, it adds to the overall difficulty by ensuring you don't just run to the final base and take it over.  What's more, very few objectives even care about taking bases.  There's a good reason for this.Most large-scale PSP games section off maps in order to facilitate navigation on handheld units.  VC2 is no exception, but the difference here is that the sections actually lower the difficulty somewhat by allowing the player to control the inflow of new troops.  It also allows for faster deployment to remote areas, which was a big issue on VC and led to a lot of people using \"Undead Alicia\" to speed to the final base and take it in order to get the highest rank.  As I stated, very few missions call for you to just take the enemy base.  Some require you to escort an APC vehicle to a destination while protecting it.  Others may want you to dominate everyone on the map (YES!).  Some just require killing of a main commander.  There is variety here that was sorely missing from VC and I was happy to see it, as it was clear that they listened intently to some of the complaints.  Battle has been streamlined as well: there's no longer a \"Medic!!\" per se.  You can evacuate incapacitated characters at the cost of 1CP (replaced one of the orders in VC).  You can also have characters retreat from the field and if needed, redeploy elsewhere, also at a 1CP cost (replaced another VC order).  If a character is in an allied base they can retreat at no CP cost which allows quick redeployment at an adjacent area.  Animations such as the CP badge shatter, the successful kill animation, and the enemy movement animations have all been simplified down so as not to affect the overall flow.  Everything just feels touched up and improved.Another positive to the game is the (in my opinion) corrected grading system.  In VC, the lower your grade, the lower your points gained after battle, and if you got a D, you got nothing except some piddly experience from the peons you killed in battle.  While VC2 kept the grading system and also the lessening of points, the effect is not nearly so severe as to amount to a punishment.  Even a D rank will net you some basic experience for the killing you did in battle, and it doesn't feel like you got shortchanged due to an unbalanced battle (Dirk anyone?  More on that later).  Of everything this was the biggest improvement to the game.  You also get Credits, which are basically troop-specific accolades, for each active participant in the battle.  These Credits are then used to adjust your characters' class, creating almost infinite opportunities for customization, another big plus.  While I wasn't keen on all of the changes (more later), it still felt refreshing to know I wasn't stuck with the same basic formations like in VC.  Additionally, they fixed one other big complaint on VC: much later in the game, you can assign leaders to the squad.  You still will have your primary mates (who aren't required to go into battle, but must be on each group), but you can delegate who your commanders are in an effort to increase your CP count.  Great to see that you can now customize this and control who your leaders really are.You can define groups of combatants and even name them, with different tank customizations and formations.  I didn't really find much of a value in this except to provide quick access to different configurations of troops.  In VC, you had to pick a certain number of teammates and that was it; you had to use some variation of those people in every battle, unless/until you went and swapped them out in town.  Here, you'll get so many people assigned to your class that you almost have to eventually use the group system to delegate different specialties to each skirmish or battle.  A maximium of 19 people, including Avan, Zeri and Cosette, will be allowed per team, but you'll have access to many more than that, and sometimes you may need more Scouts than Shocks, or more Lancers than fighters.  The group system allows you to create these configurations to assist you in battle.  Each group can also have a different tank configuration, which is both helpful and annoying (if you use the same configuration no matter what, you have to customize the tank the same way for every group, which can get a little tedious).Speaking more of these customizations, everyone has a primary job, with potential to change to a subjob once the required Credits have been obtained.  Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, and Armored Tech are the main five (there is another one, for a special character that I won't go into, that you get later).  The changes are basically as thus:- The Sniper is no longer a primary job (boo!) and must be earned as a subset of the Scout job.  Tradeoff: WAY more accurate than the VC Snipers.- The Scout can no longer gain the Grenade Launcher upgrade (boo!!), which was given to another subjob.  Tradeoff: they're not nearly as fragile as in VC.- The ShockTrooper can no longer equip flamethrowers (boo!!!), again, given to a subjob.  Tradeoff: none that I can see.- The Engineer can no longer defuse mines; that was given to the Armored Tech (err?).  Tradeoff: The Engineer can now heal from a distance.- The Armored Tech, a new job, is basically a high defense, high AP melee \"tank\" (for those who understand MMORPG terminology).  You might think this weird, except for the fact that from the front, they are impervious to any and all gun fire, and often, one swing of whatever they're equipping can kill their enemy, even stronger enemies that you'll encounter later.  They also have the ability to defuse mines.Everyone will start as one of the above base jobs, then they can earn Credits to learn one of the subjobs under the main job.  For example, a Scout can eventually learn to be a Scout Veteran or Sniper over time.  At least initially, Avan is the only one that can basically employ any of the jobs once he's earned the required Credits.  Unlike Welkin, Avan is constantly on the field as a footsoldier, as another character is manning the tank.  Welkin wasn't that good as a Scout, but Avan definitely can hold his own.  His specialty by far is interception and counter fire from cover; he can hold down bases like nobody's business.  Being able to give him any job gives you confidence to send him into the battle without worrying about him getting killed.  Another nice point here is that unlike VC, most skirmishes don't end if Avan gets hospitalized; you just don't get the CP bonus that he gives you by being there.Time passage in VC was decent, supported by the various cutscenes that ran through the game which told the story of Welkin and his cohorts.  In that game, the story was so powerful as to give you the sense of actually being there, in that time, during a period of war.  VC2 took a different route to illustrate this passage.  During the month, as you complete skirmishes, you will be sent back to Avan's room to review notes or to go to sleep for the next day.  Every so often, a new classmember will join the team and be available for battle.  If members are incapacitated in battle, they are \"hospitalized\" for three cycles (days) and not available to be used.  This adds to the illusion of the passage of time, as does the ongoing development scenarios with other members of Class G and the bonds that are created between teammates.  While it doesn't really have the same inclusive feeling as VC, it works for what the PSP offers in terms of \"pick up and play\".  I was bothered by a few things here...more on that later.Some things I didn't quite enjoy about VC2 (And they're all compared to VC, so if you never played VC, they probably wouldn't affect you any, but shame on you).- I'm not really a fan of the type of cutscene used here, with the cards and still images.  It's not a big deal, but I at least would have preferred fully animated images like VC.- The AI is still not that smart.  There were many times the enemy was standing inside my open main base and could have taken it yet didn't, allowing me time to go over and take him out.  Unlike VC, the enemy tanks are also not hell bent on assaulting your main tank, probably because they know it's now a useless endeavor (for the most part, your tank is not a loss condition).  They don't duck nearly as much as they used to, and rarely have I seen them chuck a grenade.- The cost of Orders went up substantially, and I don't just mean the cost (in XP) to buy them, I mean the cost to execute them. 4CP seems to be the average, and the only scenarios I needed to make use of one, I had 3CP available on each turn.  Fortunately, they don't seem to be nearly as needed as they were on VC due to the lighter difficulty.- In Classmate skirmishes, you'll often be feuding with other female students who challenge you to battles.  However, on the field, they just look like normal footsoldiers, no names, nothing.  It would have added to the immersion to see these students actually look unique and like the cutscene that preceded it.  A minor detraction.- Some scenarios are just unbalanced.  There is one with a character called Dirk where, depending on how you clear the map, he may withdraw to the final area and then basically sit on one of the two entrance bases.  Problem with this is that there's really no defeating him and he's obscenely strong; so bringing someone in there is a death sentence.  Many people ended up in the hospital that day.- A lot of the maps are basically reused over and over and over again for skirmishes.  Unlike VC where you had different areas of Gallia that you battled in, VC2 has oversimplified this down to reusing of the same map.  I suppose this is logical, given you're stuck at the Academy, but it would have been nice to see some more variety here.- The character development.  IT's good, but it pales in comparison to its big brother.  It feels forced and not nearly as natural as the first.  In VC, I felt emotional bonds with Isara (definitely), Alicia, Welkin, Largo and even Rosie, as well as a lot of the other lesser members of Squad 7 (Edy, Susie, Marina, Cezary, Audrey, etc).  It just naturally happened as I played through the game and it never felt forced.  VC2 feels like it wants to force these bonds upon me and while I don't begrudge them this approach, it just feels...I don't know, less than the first for some reason.  I admit that VC created a standard in character development that no game may ever reach.  Persona 3 came close, but I was not affected by any Shinjiro nearly as much as I was Isara (trying not to spoil here), which is telling in of itself.  The anguish felt by Squad 7 was palpable, and VC2 does not come close to that level.  May be a good thing for some who felt overpowered by VC, but for me it's a big negative.So in summary....do I recommend it?  Absolutely.  Despite what the detractors say, VC2 is a solid sequel that unfortunately, many people will pass up because they don't want to buy a PSP for whatever reason.  It's a shame, because the game is crazy fun and deep.  There are some shortcomings which keep it from a 5 star ranking, but a lot has been improved here and I encourage you to pick up a copy and try it yourself.  Though, since SEGA decided to release this around the same time as Metroid, I'm certain it'll yet again be overlooked.  Silly SEGA.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2010"}

And, as another reviewer pointed out, you don't go back to the start screen, or have to restart the level, or wait for it to load. But you still have to sit through it every time.Elsewise, the game is fun enough, if underexplained. There's lots of customization, but no explaination of what any of it does. There's some story tying together the norse and sci-fi aspects, but I'm not sure what it is or how it relates to the game play. The combat is fairly fun; point in a direction and shoot or swing your weapon, no real aiming required. Some of the enemies are fodder, and some are just devastating. Some of the bosses are best killed by targeting various parts of their body in turn. Graphically, it reminds me of Ult Alliance, with a Mass Effect color-scheme. Lots of folks complain about the camera, which takes a little getting used to, but I didn't think it was that bad.People say you either \"get\" this game or not. I guess I don't. I'll finish it, but I'm sure I won't miss it when it's over.---------UPDATE---------I think I can honestly say I've given this game a fair shake: after 10+ hours, reaching level 20, and *almost* getting the achievement for \"Die 100 Times\"(!). Do the math for how much time I've spent watching the death animation.I feel like I need to take a class to be good at this game. There's so many unexplained bits and pieces. I've ready forums, FAQ's, game guides, etc, and have had a share of \"D'oh!\" moments, but way too little is explained in game. The phrase \"steep learning curve\" comes to mind.COMBAT is a huge problem. When it works, it's beatiful. You gracefully pummel, shoot, slide, jump, etc and slaughter the colorful baddies. It's really fun, and it's probably what keeps me playing a game I'm so frustrated with. More often than not, however, it doesn't work. My character won't target the enemy, or at least not quickly enough. Yes, I've continued to target dead enemies while shooting. Sometimes a lone enemy will be running right at me and my guy shoots all around him. The camera also contributes to this, adversely. If you run away from an enemy, you have to turn around, reset the camera, and then attempt attacks. This often takes too long, and you take significant damage. If there are multiple enemies, forget it.SAVING: When I continue my game the next day, I often seem to start in the middle of a throng of baddies, meaning I die 2 or 3 times just to start the game. I'm trying to be more judicial about when I quit, but it doesn't seem obvious.Despite the major flaws and frustrations, this game is -somehow- really fun. I just can't figure out how to properly play it. I'm also horrible at \"Street Fighter\"-type games, because I can never be bothered to learn all the combos; this feels like a similar experience.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000G6SPHI","description":"Sony God of War 2 PS2 God of War 2 PS2","reviewerName":"Charles B Valentino","summary":"A perfect way to end the PS2 generation","reviewText":"If you liked this review, feel free to click my name and check out my others.I'll admit, like most of the reviewers you'll read from here, I'm quite biased. I played through the original God of War multiple times and loved it. I find this game to be just as exemplary as it's prequel as a practically perfect fantasy hack n' slash platformer. This game will go down in history as the PS2 game that consistently outsold PS3 and Xbox 360 games for several weeks straight upon its release. There's a good reason for that, it's brilliant.Story 5/5: The developers are cheating here. They are drawing from the most famous works of greek mythology to provide the player with a rich universe of jealous and fallible Gods at war with one another. Many of the scary beasties from the era show their ugly faces here, some with new twists since the first game. You'll face gorgons, satyrs/fauns, cerberi, cyclopes, and even other classical greek heroes like Theseus, Perseus, and Jason. I won't ruin the story except to say that it deals with the classic greek cycle of generation after generation of supreme beings rebelling against their forebears. For most players it will be entertaining, and for people such as my self with more than a bit of familiarity with greek mythology, it's a neat fantasy that falls right in line with the types of things you'd expect from ancient Greek characters.Visuals 5/5: Stunning. From the very beginning you are treated to eye popping visuals. As you clear out your first room of enemies the sinister glowing eyes of a newly animated colossal \"Statue of Rhodes\" peers through the windows searching for a way to get to you. Like most background objects in the game you eventually come face to face with the menace. You won't see a single structure in the game's background that you won't eventually visit. One of the highlights include seeing 4 Titan-sized horse statues reigned to an island far off in the distance as you hack up baddies. It won't be long before you've fought your way through various situations to find yourself atop the magnificent horses themselves, all the while battling to gain access to the next area. Enemies are well rendered and range from statuesque to grotesque. The art direction was well done. The realization of the titans themselves is something spectacular. Sounds like the designers drew more than just a little inspiration from \"Shadow of the Colossus\". It's fantastic having these living speaking goliaths cursing you as you attempt to climb them and overcome the obstacles they create for you. Definitely some of the most memorable graphics of any game I've ever played.Combat 5/5 (I'd give it a 6 if I could): This is one of the few games where the player's reflexes are the most powerful tool in the game, because the game actually let's you use them. You don't have to be frustrated by sticky controls, useless delayed moves that have no practical use, or moves that get triggered accidentally because of poor layout. Let me put it this way, Kratos can be controlled with the finesse and versatility of a fairly agile character in a \"Street Fighter\" style video game. In fact he'd probably be right at home in a street fighting game. But even with the most impressive weapons and moves, Kratos can get a good beating if you do not make effective use of his blocking/parrying/dodging abilities. Also, though Kratos learns many super combo moves to dish out dozens of hits in a few seconds, many enemies can break through or evade them and make you pay for \"spamming\" the moves foolishly. It's important to utilize these combos at moments where the enemy is compromised to capitalize on their effectiveness. The nice thing is that even then, a lot of Kratos' moves can be canceled if you need to do an emergency block/parry. You really have the flexibility of control to let your reflexes do the work, especially in the extremely challenging \"Titan\" difficulty. This is one of the few games where I actually get more addicted trying to complete the hard difficulties because despite it being extremely tough, it's fun to try and out-box the opponents knowing one false move could end it all. Another nice feature is the addition of new (and wow, even effective) alternate weapons. I am on my second playthrough of the game and found the Barbarian Hammer to be a devastating weapon if you familiarize yourself with the many moves it has. I've heard others remark that they have become just as adept at fighting enemies with the Spear of Destiny as Kratos' Blades of Athena. Finally, the Blade of Olympus which can only be used to play through the game once it's been beaten feels like cheating. But then again you sort of are.Puzzling/Platforming 3.5/5: The puzzling in this game doesn't approach Zelda proportions but a few moments might stump you for a while. The cinematic outcome of each solution tends  to be fairly rewarding. Still, nothing to pat yourself on the back too much for, but just enough to add some breaks from the slaughter. There are more than enough hidden items and chests to keep you looking around for weak walls and obscure nooks. My one complaint would be that the first games seemed to have more of these in lots of devious places. But then again that might just mean that I've missed a bunch of them in the new game still.Sound 5/5: They got rid of the repetitive nature of the previous game's musical score. The music here has the advantage of a little more variety plus it benefits from the same type of  context sensitive music environment. The music makes fairly smooth transitions as you travel from area to area, swelling for dramatic effect where appropriate such as when a battle has just been completed. Voice work is high-quality as well. The characters are all voiced by competent talent without making the mistake of kitschy cartoonish voices. It all works. The only complaint I have here is the sound effect that occurs when you successfully block attacks with the Golden Fleece item. It's a high pitched sort of screamy sound. In places where you do a lot of blocking, it can really get on your nerves especially considering that if you counterattack after blocking there is a loud explosion that follows. So you might get tired of hearing SCREE-BOOM, SCREE-BOOM, SCREE...you get the idea.Conclusion: They save the best for last. If you liked the first game, then you owe it to yourself to play this as well. If you've never played them, then get the original God of War first, right now. They are setting a standard for exciting well-designed gameplay with awesome characters in an awesome universe. Ancient greek mythology is like society's first comic books. It's even more exciting on your console than it is in your Edith Hamilton book. Check it out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2007"}
{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"It sinks...","reviewText":"Dinner last night may have been great, but it's not so great when you heat up the leftovers for supper the next evening. Maybe it's soggy now. Or lukewarm. It just doesn't taste the same, despite consisting of all the same ingredients. Which brings me to \"Bioshock 2.\" I loved the original. It was one of the greatest, most original and atmospheric games ever released. It may have been the spiritual successor of the equally amazing \"System Shock\" series, but it was entirely its own thing. As for its sequel, well... I liked Neil Marshall's horror flick \"Descent\" too, but that didn't mean they should have made \"Descent Part II,\" a pointless, unoriginal retread that had very little new to offer, and what was new wasn't very good and reflected negatively on the original. I feel exactly the same way about \"Bioshock 2.\"I never saw the need for a sequel to begin with, in all honesty, as the first \"Bioshock\" wrapped itself up quite well. Now, \"Bioshock Infinite\" is in the works, almost acknowledging that a straight \"Bioshock\" sequel was always a bad idea in much the same way as the \"Prince of Persia\" franchise decided to go back to what worked with \"The Forgotten Sands\" after that next-gen reboot that might as well have played itself. Granted, \"Infinite\" is trading an underwater city for a flying city (very imaginative), but it's DIFFERENT. It has the potential to do what \"Bioshock\" did the first time around -- take what we love about that game but make it fresh again. Basically, everything that, I feel, \"Bioshock 2\" failed to do.In \"Bioshock 2,\" you get to play as a Big Daddy out to rescue his abducted Little Sister, and that's about as far as the game goes toward forging its own identity. You still tool around in Rapture, which looks almost exactly the same as it did when you last left it. You still scavange everything you can find while squaring off with those Adam-addicted freaks. The gameplay is identical in almost every way, but with one difference -- we've already done this, and there's no compelling reason to do it again when you could just as easily pop your far superior copy of the original \"Bioshock\" in and give it another playthrough. Even the game's most tauted feature, playing as a Big Daddy, is weakly executed. You feel every bit as fragile as you did in the first game, and aside from your armored hands filling the screen, it's hard to tell you're not the same protagonist from game one except for the fact that you can now march around with a Little Sister riding on your shoulder and directing you toward the next source of Adam.I think critics put on the kiddie gloves when this game stepped into the ring earlier this year. My admiration for the first \"Bioshock\" doesn't cloud my judgment though when it concerns the sequel -- in fact, quite the opposite. The overwhelming feeling of sameness just kept creeping in on me during my time with \"Bioshock 2,\" like I'd done all of this before only better. The first game's story was far superior on top of it -- especially the \"Would you kindly?\" revelation near the end, perhaps gaming's best ever \"Gotcha!\" moment. There are no such moments here, although the chance to see things from an entirely different and very eerie perspective near the game's conclusion is certainly the best moment in \"Bioshock 2.\" But it can't hold a candle to learning the truth about your supposed benefactor in the original game.And that's the problem. There's just not enough that's new here, and what is new just can't compete with what came before. Even the whole playing as a Big Daddy angle, were it executed better, still wouldn't be all that fresh since something similar essentially happens at the end of the first game. Basically, there are two camps of people who \"Bioshock 2\" is for -- those who missed the first one (Why?!), and those who played the first one several times and still can't get their fill of Rapture. On those grounds, this glorified expansion pack is certainly worth its weight in gold. But if you loved the first game, and let's face it you probably did, but expected much more out of a proper sequel, you'll probably be just as disappointed by this return to Rapture as I was. This makes it a hard game for me to actually score, but let me put it this way -- I was playing this and \"Metro 2033\" at around the same time, and constantly found myself being wooed away to the mutant-haunted tunnels of Moscow and turning my back on the undersea mess that was Andrew Ryan's supposed utopia...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2011"}

While it retained the feel of its namesake, it just didn't have the replay value I remember.It could have used some additional animations and a bit of flavor or feeling amongst the various towns.  Each and every tavern, Governor's Daughter and Barmaid seems repetitive.  The new features of sneaking into town and keyboard ballroom dancing didn't add enough enjoyment to the game and I would have rather development time been spent on sword fighting and ship modifications.There just didn't seem to be enough differences in ships and I found that If I took a smaller faster ship, the ship battles were always victorious.All in all it's a decent game worth playing as it does retain most of it's predecessor's feel, but it didn't have enough draw to make me want to purchase it even at reduced prices.

You'll be wishing for the usual Resident Evil zombies!","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Leon Help!","reviewText":"Next to San Andreas, Resident Evil 4 happens to be the biggest game ever to appear on the Playstation 2... which makes it one of the largest games ever developed. If you are looking to play survival horror, then RE4 is the new scream queen. RE4 breaks from convention like no other game has done to date. This is a huge leap from the traditional Resident Evil that we knew. No longer is there the Metal Gear Solid style running around a room with set camera angles. Instead we are given true 3D with a twist - a semi-first person third person integration that has never been done before. U.S. agent Leon Kennedy has been tasked to look into the abduction of the President's daughter and his investigation has led him to a mysterious location in Europe. As Leon encounters unimaginable horrors, he must find out what is behind the terror. RE4 boasts three huge level designs - a village, a castle and an island. Each level contains a vast network of areas that are all unique gaming environments including farms, valley camps, water works, kitchens, tunnels, cemeteries, storage areas, waterways, lakes with monsters, caves, churches, foyers, prisons, sewers, mazes, dinning halls, servant's quarters, hives, clock towers, mine entrances, furnaces, ruins, cathedrals and radiation labs. Several memorable scenes include laser grids like in the movie of the same name, a chopper shootout and a radiation lab with mutated monsters that can regenerate damaged tissue. RE4 has roughly seven hundred and fifty monsters to defeat with numerous boss guys, puzzles to solve and pieces to collect, including money that you can steal from the local village goons and spend on buying weapons and upgrades from a mystery hooded salesman that can be found near the various typewriter checkpoints. Like \"God of War\" and \"Fahrenheit/Indigo Prophecy\" RE4 uses mini-games (button combinations to perform unique moves at specific intervals) even during the cut sequences. It has an approximate playing time of 17 and half hours at the minimum. The way the gun is controlled makes aiming less than steady and so accuracy is hard to obtain without lots of practice. This is a good thing because it means that when a hoard of villagers are making their way towards you it is hard to get the kind of headshot placement that you need and so the blast reactions of the zombies ranges from toppling over, being blown aside, catching fire and of course, loosing their brains when you eventually get that headshot on target. It terms of headshots, RE4 redefines it. It must be seen to be believed. Also when a zombie is on the ground you can close in and perform a round the house kick that can crack open a few craniums. You can shoot down boulders from a cliff to crush bosses or blow up booby traps or a truck loaded with dynamite to take out a village lane cram packed with zombies. RE4 is quite graphically gory. Where previous entries in the series required you to actually perform hard manoeuvres like climbing ladders or jumping gaps these are instead replaced by action sequence and so make the game more fluid from start to finish and thus more enjoyable. The load times have been significantly reduced from the almost unbearable waiting periods that Resident Evil: Outbreak turned up with. It is hard though to say that Resident Evil has ever died. Capcom have always delivered. RE4 is maybe the best instalment in the whole series... if not one of best games ever made. 3D survival horror is here to stay.Pros:- Immense Game- First Class Level Designs- Headshots- Story- Multiple CharactersCons:- None","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2005"}

The only cool looking adult PS3 game is Resistance: Fall of Man. So before I crack that open, I'm thinking: \"I liked the movies, the movies are based on the games, so why not try out RE4 to get started?\"So, I pop open a cold one, sit down with my new RE4 game and proceed to have a heart attack from the terror it causes. No, not really. I'm old, but hopefully not that old.The game starts you (Leon) out in the woods in front of an old house on the outskirts of a Spanish speaking European village. You're a third person controlling Leon. The graphics are 3D and there's Dolby sound.As you walk through the spooky woods towards the house your footsteps in the leaves are clear. Upon entering the house you are immediately attacked by a crazed local that doesn't seem to be a zombie. Based on the movies (and previous games from what I hear) you expect zombies.  As you exit the house you are attacked by more locals (that will viciously kill you unless either you do them in first or safely make your way past). Zombies would have been a welcome adversary versus this unexpected enemy.A map is provided for you to follow to your chapter destinations. There are typewriters scattered sparsely through the game where you can save progress.As you make your way to the target destinations, you are introduced to a variety of enemies that will try to stop you at every turn. As you are successful in doing so you are rewarded with the opportunity to explore areas that have a barrage of items that will be useful for you to take. A word to the wise, however, clear any area of enemies (if possible) before going exploring!The main objective is to rescue the daughter of the President of the United States. But I'm miles away from that at this point. After 3 total hours of play I just got through the main village and the farm to chapter 2. And that's a good thing. Because this is dog-gone fun. The day I finish--if I ever finish--this game...it will be a bittersweet moment.Combine some red herb with some green herb for better health, then sell a Dirty Pearl Necklace and some Spinals to the Merchant so that you have enough pesetas to add Resident Evil 4 to your Amazon cart.P.S.--Is there a rule about writing game reviews prior to actually finishing the game? Certainly that's not something I'd do with DVD or my other item reviews. This is my first real game review, and the rules just seem a little different. If I had to wait to finish a game before I reviewed it...well, I question whether I'll ever be able to \"beat\" a game.

I didn't really know why they said this, but now that I actually had time to play the game, I understand why.  However, I sort of disagree with their statement.  The games, starting with the first one, were done incredibly well.  I wouldn't change a thing from the originals.  I think if all the games were like this, they'd get boring after a while.  At least they kept the franchise fresh!!  Now, this game is incredible.  The graphics, the mood, the sounds, the music the gameplay, it's just great.  I started playing the game at 9pm and actually didn't stop it until 2:00am!!!  That's how much the game sucked me in.  The whole time I played the game, I feel that I was being watched and that I was genuinely cautious for my character.  Not too many games really suck you into the gameplay at that level, where you don't want to see anything happen to your character.  I kinda like the fact that they are \"somewhat\" zombified.  The communicate with each other, in a different language of course, but nevertheless, these zombies aren't the ones from all of the original games.  The AI is much, much better.I like the fact that you can buy/upgrade weapons.  The only thing I think doesn't fair well, that you can't carry a whole lot of stuff to begin with, but you can always by and upgrade the attache case.  I'm at a \"Large\" one now so it's cool.The story is really good.  The cinematics are theater-worthy.  Really puts you in that mindset of danger everywhere.  Everything is a mystery and as it begins to unfold little by little, it pulls you in even more.Currently, I'm playing the game at \"Normal\" mode, I know there is a harder level, I just don't know if there's an \"Easy\" mode, which I should've tried first.  I also wonder if I can \"carry\" over items when I play the game over again.  I'll have to play and see.It's still a great game.  I highly recommend this game to everyone who wants a movie-like experience on their PS2.  Play it in the dark with the sound turned up!!!

Dent \"Aragorn\"","summary":"On the Move","reviewText":"The Motion Controller and the PS Eye are the minimum needed to bring 'Move' to a any PS3 console. No exceptions. If you already have a PS Eye then the controller alone is the only purchase necessary. On the other hand, to fully enjoy certain games, you may want TWO Move Controllers.It's hard not to be impressed by the Move. While I can't see how the Move's Motion Controller can become PS3's 'main' controller, I believe that it's going to find lots of good uses and hopefully in hard-core games and in the RPG games that I'm usually playing.SETUPPress the PS button. If the controller is charged... you're done.Of course, to do anything useful, you WILL need a PS Eye camera and maybe a game :). You CAN use the controller to navigate the PS3 XMB menus but it may take some getting used to - I am still reaching for the DualShock.MOVE'S MOTION CONTROLLERThe Wikipedia has a very thorough review of the technology inside the controller - impressive. It's probably worth going there to get an idea of what's under the hood.From a user's point of view, the Move could be viewed as approximately the right side of the DualShock 3 where the motion tracking function is the R3 analog stick, R1 is the MOVE button and the R2 becomes the Move's T(rigger). You also get the 4 Square/Circle/X/Triangle, in a square (not 'diamond') formation, the PS button as well as the START and SELECT. So far, the most used buttons during gameplay were the MOVE and the T(rigger).In addition, you get a wrist strap. At the opposite end of the microphone or thick wand-shaped Move there's a USB Mini-B port for charging and another port that seems to be proprietary - must investigate.The controller is quite substantial as far as both size and weight - I like that and liked its being shaped in a way that makes it easy to grab and hold. Very much like a microphone or a very thick magic wand; NOT a remote control.Based on my experience so far, Move's ability to track your motions far surpasses anything that I'm aware of in the gaming universe. Every single movement, up/down, left/right, toward/away and wrist rotation are accurately captured and almost instantly reflected on the screen and so is acceleration that would usually translates as 'force' in games such as sword fights or ping pong. In addition, there is haptic (tactile/rumble) feedback, a little too weak in the games I played so far, making the gaming experience that much more realistic.I am not writing a lot about the Eye camera because... it's just there and it's not the subject of this review. For as long as it can see you, it simply does its part so that you may enjoy your game.PLAYINGI've tried so far everything in the Champions game and one puzzle game demo downloaded from the PSN. Our little girl is playing the Eye Pet demo and my boys are playing mostly the sword fight and the archery games in Sports Champions. Considering that Sports Champions is an early game, my expectations were not that high but, surprisingly, Ping Pong did meet my expectations. I've been playing real Ping Pong ever since I was 11 or 12 so I probably know what I'm talking about and the Move version of Ping Pong is GOOD. As for the others... sword fight, kids like it. Archery was okay, Bocce was so-so, Frisbee Golf not too bad. Three of the six Champions events benefit significantly from using TWO Motion controllers.For the games I've played so far, this is NOT a couch experience. On the Sports events I was sweating after a few minutes and I had to get off the couch and stand up even when playing the puzzle because of its depth element. This is probably a good thing.I am sorry for having to do this but, absent 'hard core' games, the only comparison I can make is between Move and Wii and... to put it VERY mildly, the Wii shows its age when placed next to the Move. Except for it lacking a built-in speaker, the Move controller is ahead of Wii in every single respect: precision, responsiveness, ergonomics. The fact that the Eye camera can and in certain games DOES track your body not just the controller helps too. Of course, the Wii has the games but the Move games should be coming fast so I'm not worried.MY RATINGIt's 5 stars for the technical merit, ease of setup and for the overall experience. Hopefully, the games will be coming quickly and in good quality.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2010"}

Then, some games like Burnout require the hard drive, so you have to pay for that upgrade. In the end, the xbox is a trap because online play is something you will eventually want to do and if you pay $50/yr, this is the most expensive console in the long run. There are also durability issues, which many early xbox 360 had and this device is so big, noisy, and the white color just doesn't fit with other gray and black devices you have next to the TV. Also, the resale value of these consoles drops pretty fast. The system gets extremely warm, specially after hours of playing.

The main quest is very short, and many have argued that the idea of earning the necessary gold to save the kingdom was pretty short-sighted. The side quests can get repetitive, and the relationship quests are nothing more than fetch/escort tasks. The voice acting is decent, but the character models need to be improved.The weapon choices are very simple: for melee you have mainly swords or hammers. For ranged weapons, you have rifles or pistols. For spells, you have 5 different ones where you can combine any 2 together. Vortex and Fire was my favorite because of the amount of area damage it inflicts per second, although I am now biased towards Fire and Shock.Replay capability is excellent. Even after I ruled Albion, and defeated Cthulhu, er... I meant the Crawler, there are many side quests that lead to additional legendary weapons, more guild seals, and even new areas to explore.Some of the achievements are mundane (find the books, keys, flowers, gnomes), and others require Xbox Live and a friend to complete (fashion victim, legendary weapons, marriage, business partnership, child), while one is impossible to complete if you got knocked out.Some of the random enemies are annoying as you level up. The Balverines have a high DPS attack that you can barely block. They get in the way of your mundane side quests. With all level 5 attacks and my melee and ranged weapons fully upgraded, the enemies seem to have toughened up as well. This was similar to the leveling in Oblivion where the enemies increase in strength/power based on your level so as to not kill you immediately if you walked to the wrong area.Overall: 4/5 starsUPDATE: I purchased the Understone Quest Pack DLC via Xbox Live (only 400 pts) which includes a new quest underneath Bowerstone, and 2 side quests that involve the Mercenary shooting range and Reaver's wheel of misfortune. However, my character is fully leveled up and I have no use for additional Guild Seals. The Understone DLC was only 400 Microsoft points, but wasn't really worth it overall.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-11-2010"}

I don't care much for zombies, but I've had a great time with a few Resident Evils, and this game doesn't hold up to that. There is zero story. The characters aren't likeable, or even developed enough to be likeable. The weapons are cool at first but before long it's more than a little repetative and boring. I guess some people like feeling like they stand no chance at surviving, I prefer a game that has  solid mechanics, an actual story line, and doesn't tend to be just plain impossible.

E Jackson","summary":"new mario- just the same as old mario","reviewText":"I honestly don't believe New Super Mario Bros. for the Wii is a bad game by ANY means.  However it basically does nothing that the original SMB NES series hasn't already done and perfected, not to mention uses several of the Super Mario World concepts as well.  This game is basically just a graphically enhanced version of the classic Super Mario Bros. series and copies what's already been done and the only real addition are two new power suits- the overrated penguin suit that gives Mario the ability to slide around, and the admittedly pretty awesome propeller suit- a VERY convenient and popular item that lets Mario reach the star coins in tricky locations (more on that below).Look at the backgrounds in the first few stages and worlds.  The grasslands is basically nothing new- the first Super Mario Bros. and SMB3 games already perfected these similar backgrounds many years ago.  The concept of collecting coins, stomping on goombas, avoiding koopas, etc, has all remained *exactly* the same, so this definitely means Nintendo is cashing in on the improved technology of the Wii to bring back an old platform favorite of millions.  And you know, I actually don't mind the decision to bring it back *that* much (hence the 3-star rating).  I just wish the game wasn't so identical to the classic Mario Bros. games in so many crucial areas.  Gameplay, level design, and backgrounds all resemble the original SMB games.  This makes New Super Mario Bros. Wii nothing particularly noteworthy or original- just something intended for newbies of the 2D sidescroller series and hardly providing anything original for any of the older Mario Bros. fans.The similarities are obvious, everywhere.  The ghost houses, moving platforms and lava stages shamelessly copy what's already been done in Super Mario World *especially* in the case of the ghost houses.  They are boring in this game.  The desert world looks a lot like the one from Super Mario Bros. 3 on the All-Stars edition.  The same similarities present themselves in the ice and water worlds.  After a while you totally forget about the graphics being Nintendo's selling point here since you're so caught up in the cliched gameplay (which admittedly is *fun* gameplay, but nothing original).  I expected Nintendo would make the overall experience more impactful by taking advantage of the Wii's technology.  The platform jumps themselves are really bland in the first few worlds since the stages themselves aren't very memorable.  The one with icicles falling down and creating platforms to progress forward is too bland for words.  This stuff wasn't boring back in the 80's and early 90's, but bringing back the same concept in today's world doesn't really work in my opinion.  New Super Mario Bros. Wii just falls short of greatness.Some of the things I love- the challenge of the special world (World 9).  It's a VERY challenging world to acquire all the star coins.  Collecting 3 star coins per stage throughout the first 8 worlds is important since they enable World 9 to open.  World 8's very first level is *incredible*.  A fast paced run to the finish with cool music in the background with a rockin' rhythm.  That's clearly the best music in the game.  The challenge is actually pretty high starting around World 7, but World 9 takes the cake in that regard.  World 9 is almost unbearably difficult at times (at least, if your intention is to collect the 3 star coins and this *should* be your intention otherwise you'd be missing out on the bonus world).  The Bowser fight is amazing too- much better than any of the fights in the classic Mario series.  Now you have to outrun his wall-destroying fireballs to reach safety!  Really exciting race to the finish.  Unfortunately the same cannot be said for his Koopa kids- those fights are basically not much different than the ones in SMB3.  They're actually easier and most of them are lame.  One Koopa kid fight has platforms moving up and down while you try and land on his head 3 times.  It's really easy believe me.  They dumbed down Wendy too- her rings are easy to avoid now.  Boo!  Mini Bowser, or Bowser Jr., presents a few interesting fights along the way however.  The battle where you have to ram his spaceship into an electric wall is REALLY fun.  The airship-type levels aren't nearly as memorable as the SMB3 ones I'm afraid.  They aren't lengthy or bomb-explosive enough.Still, despite the first half of the game being derivative and bland, the second half of the game is actually a pretty big improvement (though inconsistent at times, but I'm in a generous and forgiving mood).  I wish the game wasn't so generous with 1-ups though.  You can easily max out at 99 by World 8.  This is a result of the game just being too darn easy.  It's okay to lose lives once in a while, something many new gamers don't believe in.  You had to grow up in the NES days to understand that it's okay to die when encountering an overwhelming challenge.  In fact you're *supposed* to die until you find a way to complete it.  I recommend skipping over this game and picking up New Super Mario Bros. U instead- despite being another copycat of the classic SMB series of yesteryears, THAT game is incredibly fun and harder overall with more exciting platform jumps and item collecting along the way.  SMBU fills in all the tiny details that effectively makes the levels more exciting and creative compared to this average Wii New Super Mario Bros. game.  Lay down the extra bucks for a Wii U and go with New Super Mario Bros. U instead if you're in such desperate need of a new 2D Mario game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-26-2008"}

Keegan \"Keegs\"","summary":"Now one of my all-time favorites!","reviewText":"This game doesn't hold your hand from the beginning. When you start, you start in a prison and within a few minutes you will already encounter a major boss. You don't have to take him on right then. You won't be equipped well enough. Now this game does things great like its spiritual predessor and that is giving you an enormous challenge and a sign of relieve after every major enemy you conquer. You will die a lot but your death is your own fault. It doesn't cheat you and while it is extremely hard and progress is slow, you will often unlock short cuts.Often times you will be surprised where that shortcut came from. It is always a sign of relief knowing if you die, you don't have to constantly backtrack. The level design from that is intelligent but they also done a great job not just making diverse looking places but making them structured incredibly unique in how they are horizontal and vertical. They are very creative in their level designs and each place feels very different and diverse. It is all done in graphics that might not be the very best but close enough to impress. It is a beautiful and the enemy designs are some of the best you will come across.Now if you haven't played Demon's Souls than you will experience one of the most innovative titles that done things just like the last game. It allows you to leave messages. You can't chat with anyone in the game otherwise it would make them almost useless. You can't chat but it helps give an aura of mystery to them just like the world your in. It blends the phantoms you get to help you within the world. Now phantoms are those that can help you take out challenges by leaving a summon on the ground. The game is so hard that it encourages you to summon help. Now while you do this, you open yourself to black phantoms that will be out to kill you and take your humanity (as in when alive). It is pretty deep and would take a lot more time to talk about but I will just say that there is encouragement for people to invade others. Beyond that there is blood stains on the ground so you can see how someone died and you will see a grey shadow form of other players playing as you are.Now the structure is much different in how you move around the world. The game is all interconnected and you save, level up, and change up your spells by bonfires. It is all done in a great way to keep moving along and will also act like a check point.The length of the game is extremely long if you want to do everything. You would think the level cap would be like 99 but its over 700. It is pretty crazy but unnecessary in order to beat all the bosses. It does have a Game Plus so you can continue to play through with your stats and equipment.The game's music is always fitting within the world and I would just say that it never gets old. I always enjoy exploring the world and when I see a shiny object, I am drawn to it. I want to know what it is. This game also has some of the most diverse enemies that you will encounter in game with bosses, sub-bosses, and various regular enemies. I can go on and on about little things. There is a lot to this game and it is one of the best. I just wish the collector's edition lived up to the game or was as good as Demon's Souls. Its pretty bland for such a high caliber title. This game I have to say overall though is a must own. It is one of the best I played this generation!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2011"}

My favorite Castlevania yet.","reviewText":"I have known about the series ever since the NES was out (I think Castlevania 2 was the second game I played, right after Zelda).  It's one of those series I'd always rent a game from if I ever saw a new one out.  To this day, I still consider Castlevania 4 (for the Super Nintendo) a classic.  Sadly, these days my opinion of the series is not so cheery.  Part of this may be because I'm more able to tell how bad a game is before I play it just by checking the internet.  Even then... I didn't like Circle of the Moon, and it got rave reviews.But enough history.  Aria of Sorrow is a truely exceptional game.  Everything I didn't like about Circle of the Moon (which was a lot) was fixed here.  The visuals are clearer, the controls are solid, and the gameplay is more balenced.  Despite certain qualms I have over elements that shift the difficulty toward easy a little (like health healing potions), the game is still difficult without being cheap, perhaps with the exception of hard mode, but they don't call it \"hard mode\" without reason (not to mention it's entirely optional).For anyone not familiar with the series, there are two types of gameplay standards in the series.  One is stage based gameplay (think Contra, or even Mario), which some of the older games in the series have.  The other, which this one utilizes, is what some like to call \"Metroid-vania.\"  This basically means you can explore this huge castle and backtrack to different areas at will.  However, that's not exactly as derivative as it sounds (in fact, Castlevania 2 used this format, so it's been used a long time ago).  This game uses it in a sort of an Action RPG-esque method.  This does mean your character levels up throughout the game, though this does provide one minor weakness in the game.  Areas you went through at the beginning will become VERY easy should you come across them again later in the game.  This is not much of a problem, since you'll basically be looking for a different area to go to anyway, and that new area will almost certainly be loaded with challenge.  Bosses are particularly rough and very funWell, lets go to one of my favorite additions to this game.  Weapons.  Unlike previous Castlevania games, the main character isn't restricted to a whip (he also isn't a Belmont, so that would explain why he has no whip).  This isn't new, as Castlevania: Symphony of the Night also had this.  However, Symphony of the Night had a rather basic weapons set (mostly swords), and basic weapon dynamics.  This game has a full arsenal.  You have anything from knives and swords, to lances, hammers, and even guns (the game takes place several decades after 2000AD, so this isn't out of place)!  Not only that, the soul system gives you several abilities you can snatch from enemies, at times, to use.  Most of these are in the form of secondary weapons that use Magic (MP), which does recharge over time.  The customization is great, so you'll undoubtibly be able to find several ways to customize your character to be ready for more fighting.Overall, this game is easily recommended to any fan of Action games (with a dash of RPG), and is certainly recommended for any Castlevania fan.  If you do buy it, I recommend you look through an FAQ after you finish it.  Chances are, you may not have finished it as much as you think.  ;)(P.S.  I didn't play Harmony of Dissonance, so I can only compare it to Circle of the Moon).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2004"}

LOVE IT!","reviewText":"When I first bought my copy of this at a local big blue and gold retailer, I was worried about the comments made by early purchasers of a problem with buying and downloading new songs to that retailer's version. Well, Ubisoft must've gotten on that, because as soon as I'd unwrapped this and popped it into my console, I went straight to the song catalogue to test out purchasing new songs after the initial game loading. No problem! I was SO relieved to see that the glitch has been fixed, and I'm able to enjoy adding new songs to this version of \"Just Dance\". I really started to enjoy playing the first \"Just Dance\", and use it (along with a few other dance games, and plenty of the other traditional exercise games that Wii has released) for my regular workouts. The only big thing that I found to be a bit of a drawback with \"Just Dance\" was the inability to add and download new games. Thankfully, \"Just Dance 2\" has rectified that, and even made the game MORE fun than it was before, and quite a bit more challenging than the first version for those of us that might be just a bit rhythmically disinclined! ; )  The songs on \"Just Dance 2\" seem to be selected by the same folks that chose \"Just Dance\"'s playlist, which is just fine by me, as it runs the gamut of musical styles, while still giving everyone plenty of fun options to dance/workout to.Overall, if you're hoping for more of the same, but better, with \"Just Dance 2\", go for it! I hesitated for quite a few weeks on picking this up because I didn't want my bubble burst by loving the first version of the game, then being let down by \"Just Dance 2\", but there's no reason to be worried about that here. Ubisoft did a bang up job of continuing to dole out the happy here! And, for those naysayers that might suggest that this game, and \"Just Dance\" WON'T give you a good enough workout to count as your regular workout? Don't believe it! YOU get to decide how good a workout YOU are going to put in, and, between the dance games that Nintendo has released for the Wii, and keeping an online food consumption journal, I've already lost over ten pounds in only a few weeks, just using my Wii! GO for it! It CAN be done, and this is one of the games that'll get you there, if you work out hard enough with it!Enjoy the dancing!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2011"}

When I played this one it lacked that enchanting and glowing atmosphere that Sands of Time held. The characters were also not as..how should I put this..\"stable\" or solid as they were in Sands of Time. What I mean is, in Sands of Time every character was flawless during GAMEPLAY. There were no choppy features and they were good, strong characters. In Warrior Within, if you notice during gameplay Kaileena's hair is a bit..odd. It looks too \"choppy\" and even the Prince and Shadee looked a bit odd sometimes. Overall though, Warrior Within delivered a stunning ending (a possible two ways to beat the game), with beautiful scenery and a great storyline. It is a bit darker than the first one but I believe that it fits with the story well, telling of how much the Prince has changed. About how much this obsession with keeping himself alive has worn on him. The gameplay was fun and the Dahaka chases were awesome. I actually got scared every single time he chased me. And I LOVED the music in the game. Godsmack's I Stand Alone played during the Dahaka's chase and they even played Straight Out Of Line at the end of the game during the credits. Along with that \"dark\" and \"rock\" edge, the apparent Persian music was still there in the background during gameplay. The rock music only added to the dark and angry atmosphere. Overall, this game was fun, great, and beautiful. I have beaten it well over five times. Ubisoft keep em' coming!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-21-2008"}

The game is beautifully crafted, the backgrounds are absolutely magnificent, the characters are beautifully developed and the graphics and frame rates are by all token beyond amazing.  When the characters are fight they are flawless, their moves, combat and actions are seamless and there is not a skip or a frame miss between them.  The backgrounds are much more developed than in SC2, and they even allow you to manipulate the scenery, for instance if a fighter hits a wall it will break ect.  Next the game is filled to the hilt with tons of extras, tons of mini games, and you are able to buy and absolute plethora of weapons, armor and items, almost mirroring the final fantasy series in a great way.  Lastly the music isn't bad and the story line is pretty good too although it an get convoluted at times.  Finally, I absolutely love that you can build your own character, but I hate that you are relegated to the weapons and moves that the dictator computer forces on you.Now for the negatives which unfortunately far outweigh the positives.  As amazing and as wonderful as the above aspects are, they really dont make the game fun, and for me a video game needs to be fun for me to enjoy it, it needs to entertain me, not give me rage and frustrate my like this game does.  My contention with this game comes in the following areas.(1) The games difficulty is absolutely ridiculous and is not made with common gamers in mind.  I am not serious about video games, I play them to pass the time or on my train commute, but this game is developed for serious gamers and this is clearly reflected in the lack of difficulty settings.  No, \"easy\" mode or \"medium\" for guys like me, only hard for the fan boys.(2)The AI is completely unbalanced.  One stage is super easy, the next one is super hard, than followed by easy and so forth in a random order.  This is angering when I am getting my butt handed to me in the first stage because I got stuck against a genius AI.  At least with MK the game gets harder as you progress, and as you get better, this is completely random.  Also how the hell can a massive behomoth such as Asteroth deal tiny amounts of damage, but a little shrimpy girl like Taki can deal mass amounts of damage and over whelm you?  Yea, someone is a feminist!(3)Like in SC2, the computer can pull of these ridiculous moves that you can not even dream of pulling off.  When you get stuck fighting against a hard AI, the computer will have you bouncing in the air for 6 or 7 hits with 3/4 of your life gone before you even know what happened to you.  The computer will block you every 20 seconds and you wont get a good hit in at all, and it will pull off a counter every 3 seconds as is the same with breaking your grabs, but you as the player can forget about any of that, the probability of you timing it right is 1/1,000,000.(4) Who ever designed the characters, clearly had favorites in mind and was by all means close to being a feminist.  All of the female characters are far better than the male characters, are far faster, stronger, more elegant and the computer works their AI much better.  Also when fighting Mitsarugi's AI, he was clearly a favorite of the developers as his fighter wether it is your first or 10th fight is unbeatable and is insanely hard to beat.(5) What the hell, they got rid of all of the great charatcter moves and replaced them with boring moves.  For instance, Ivy cant swing her sword/whip around any more with the L2 button, instead she just stabs.. BORING.. On the upside Taki has a good move where she stabs the ground, with L2 so i guess the got rid of great moves and added some good ones.. Leave the great ones and add more great ones! Also, some of the fighter's outfits are just plain dumb, I think they were better fashioned in SC2.  Asteroth looked better in SC2, as did Taki (I hate her mask).(6) Chronicles of the sword is so dumb, childish and pointless.  I hated the weapon master in SC2 because of its difficulty, but this puts it to shame, makes me love WM.(7) This game is all about practice.  If you have the time to practice and play for 8 hrs a day like a good fan boy should than you will have no problem mastering the moves and combos.  But if you are like me and you are getting a degree, working and conducting a personal life, you can forget about getting anywhere in the game.(8) The memory card currupts if you save another game after playing Chron of the Sword.  This is kind of idiotic considering that I really dont feel like paying for 2 memory cards just to have an entire card for one game that genuinely dislike.I gave this game an additional star becuase its good aspects are phenominal.  Unfortunately none of the good parts make the game enjoyable or fun.  This game is so hard and so frustrating that you will either put it down in a minute or you will toss your controller out the window in sheer rage.  If you have time to invest in practice and all that BS buy this game, but dont buy into the little fan boys and girls about how great this game is.  If you are like me and are a suckie,  casual gamer, this game is not for you, if you are a great gamer.. go for it.CASUAL GAMERS BEWARE... SC3 DOES NOT HAVE US IN MIND!!!

Now, let me begin. When I first got this game for the Wii, I kind of doubted it. I mean, it's like buying a singing game if you don't like singing. The Legos just attracted me to it, otherwise I wouldn't have bought it. But after buying it, I didn't play it much. I played the other new games I got. After trying to play it, I just left it with my other unused video games to collect dust. After being bribed into it by my sister, I finally decided it was time to play Lego Indiana Jones again. I had a really good time playing it. My sister was always Indy while I was the secondary character, whether it be Short Rounds or Willie. You'll find that, throughout every episode, Indy is always running or chasing after the bad guys with his team and, also during each episode he develops a crush with a different girl. Also during every story, there's a little humor as there is in every Lego game. Lego proved itself worthy of my playing yet again and I can't wait for the second one. I also can't wait for Lego Harry Potter, because I'm a big fan of the books and I'm currently reading all seven through again.

Zombies!","reviewText":"And much much more of course...Resident Evil has made a name for itself by being a fun, stylish and very stratified game.  Either new players love it, like me, or they cannot stand it.  If anything, REO goes a long way towards breaking this mold through more intuitive controls and &quot;simpler&quot; menu screens.  BUt it is still a zombie game with puzzles and so if TOmb Raider wasn't your style of gameplay, REO likely isn't either.As for the game itself, many of us Resident Evil fans have been highly excited by the prospect of finally playing side by side in a game.  Unfortunetly, the dreams we had of a massive city with numbers of small groups running around in it proved not to be possible.  Instead players are given 5 scenarios, all fairly short, which they can play with other folks online.  Which brings up a problem.  There is no 2 player support for one machine, a strange oversight which might be explained by the need to share screens but it would have been welcome all the same.  Because then the players could communicate with more than the very simple commands that are available to players in this game.  I cannot tell another player to combine 2 items and then take them to a certain room.  All I can do is ask for them, hope he gives them to me, then do it myself.  No keyboard or voice systems are available.Realistically, it doesn't matter too much.  The single player game is still classic RE and although you must trust NPC characters to support you, they are not entirely worthless as they are well capable of surviving.  And although each scenario is short, they prove fun all the same.  My only real gripe in this area is the need to complete the entire thing (there is a save option but...lets just say it is lacking) which up the anxiety (a good thing) and the frustration (a bad thing).  There is nothing worse than making it all the way to the end of a scenario and then falling dead seconds from completion.Overall, in comparison to games like Resident Evil Zero on Gamecube, this one is better and worse.  Better because it encompasses a huge amount of area and fun, as well as letting players interact more, worse because it is disjointed and has little of the story line that makes RE so engrossing.  But since REO came out on Playstation, to the consternation of Gamecube RE players like yours truly, this is a great way to whett some appitties for zombie blasting.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2004"}

It was fun and I thought added a lot of things that Killzone 2 didn't have, which made this a much more diverse game than KZ2 in my opinion. The capture troopers were cool as hell, plus was the fact that you could melee and stealth kill 'em! I like how the campaign added different vehicles to drive, missions that involved stealth and opportunities to use mounted machine guns along with the usual choice of weapons. I didn't care for the jet packs, but at least they made an effort to mix up the usual FPS campaign.One of my favorite parts of the campaign was where you infiltrate the Helghast industrial military complex disguised as a Helghast soldier. That was a cool environment and there were many cool environments with nice detail. The \"red planet\" at the beginning of the campaign was also very well done. However, at times the environments seemed almost comic book like - the red and green environments specifically. But then again, it is a fictitious planet, so it's to be expected I suppose. But it reminded me a lot of the Lost Planet series.My only real complaint of the game is the ending, which I felt was a little too reminiscent of something like Star Wars or Battlestar Gallactica or something equally nauseating.FINAL GRADE: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

While all 3 of the campaigns seem to make it well worth the price, what leaves something to be desired is the controls, which is something that seems to plague all Sega games in the last 7 years or so. I'll admit there Genesis days were awesome and even the DS sonic games are good, but look at how bad all the Sonics and some of there sports game have been in the last few years, its always about controls. The Marine campaign was really my only interest, i've gotten a lot of the way through it but really dread going back because of accuracy shooting, and movement issues. The graphics are top notch, the atmosphere is totally spot on, and the feel is that they really did take the time to get into the movies and get it right. As i tried to play the other two campaigns i found myself wanting to toss the stick across the room, especially being the alien, which wasn't my cup of tea anyways. Climbing around on walls is just a mess, sometimes you can sometimes you can't and it moves so fast even when adjusted that you just get fed up and want to quit. The same goes for the predator campaign which i didn't care about in the first place, tried it, realized that jumping was sloppy, as was the shooting and i had so much vertigo i had to readjust my eyes and head. So while the game isn't a total loss its a enough for me to only give it 2 stars because i wanted so much more from the game, and just didn't get it. I payed 60 bucks for one mediocre campaign, when i should have only had to pay about 30. I use to think awesome visuals could overshadow cruddy controls, i was wrong. If you have a gaming rig, download it for free on a torrent site, then you won't waste a trip to the game store, and your money.Another note: Even Condemned 1 & 2 had control issues but were much more stable than this game. Also try Sonic Unleashed, wow talk about a train wreck.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-17-2010"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers. Learn how to adapt to Cole&rsquo;s evolving powers in an attempt to save Empire City and its people.Super Powers- Feel what it is like to discover, grow and use a wide range of electricity-based super powers (good or bad); and grasp the responsibility that comes from being so powerful.Epic Battles- Experience what it is like to be a true hero, taking responsibility for every action, as players battle against powerful iconic villains.Open Dynamic World- Coupling rich powers with a reactive environment and population, experience complete freedom to explore a deep, open interactive city.

Instead of various firearms and explosives, your character uses electricity to kill opponents.  Just seems like a gimmick to me that creates the illusion of creativity.

For a free roaming sandbox-esq game, it feels very linear and there's little benefit to going off the beaten path.  Fallout is far superior as an RPG/shooter mix.

If you ask me, any one of the levels in Yoshi's Island is TWICE as long as the ones in Super Mario World, and probably three or four times bigger than the ones in Super Mario Bros. 3.  Nintendo really went out of their way to bring Mario fans the biggest adventure yet, and the funny thing about the game is how it didn't receive as much attention as you'd expect when it hit stores in 1995.The levels in this game are positively PACKED with TONS of goodies.  Flowers, stars, coins, 1-up's, enemies, P-switches, you name it.  The thing that amazes me is that 10 years after owning the game, I'm STILL finding more of those invisible floating clouds (usually containing stars inside).  There must be THOUSANDS of those babies!Speaking of babies... CRY CRY CRY!!!  Yeah, Mario is PRETTY darn annoying but you have to remember he's just a baby!  YOU were crying like that, too!  You have to forgive him.  Cuddle him and be thankful YOU don't have to raise this child!The only problem is that the music could have been better.  It's not bad, I mean, it SOUNDS really good, but most of the themes don't really impress me.  They're still pretty catchy (you will remember them after you turn off the game) but... I don't know.  Just not the kind of music you'd expect to hear in a Mario game.  It's like Nintendo wanted to progress the typical Mario themes into something bigger.  Actually, the music is like a soundtrack to a children's book.The challenge is excellent (which means \"just right\").  One of the hardest Mario games to date- you will be playing this game for a long, long time.  Trust me, you'll WANT to dig in and replay this bad boy over and over because of the amount of fun it offers.  The challenge isn't in reaching the end of the level.  It's in trying to get a score of 100% in every level.Yoshi was just starting out in the original Super Mario World and Nintendo weren't entirely sure what kind of things they wanted to do with him.  Look how much Yoshi has improved in this game!  You can jump on enemies, stomp on enemies, spit enemies at other enemies, turn enemies into eggs, and shoot eggs with a sliding target thing (it's hard to explain but it will make perfect sense once you see it).  You can also aim your tongue upward, reaching for things above you (including baby Mario when he floats away).  You control Yoshi throughout the game which explains all the new things he can do.This game is just incredible.  Please pick it up.  You won't regret it!  I've played Yoshi's Island a lot and, thanks to TONS of practice, I've become pretty good at it (I STILL can't get 100% in every level though, but that's a pretty difficult task).  I have to say the final boss battle with Bowser simply blows my mind.  I simply LOVE shooting eggs at him while having to jump around on tiny rocks.  A fantastic battle.Also, a reviewer below named linda mccormick says you need some kind of special equipment to play Yoshi's Island.  That's not true.  Just a regular controller will work.  She may have meant the Nintendo 64 Yoshi game, or a different game entirely.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2004"}

The main deciding factor was that the GO has a smaller screen size which is just not cool with me. Also the 3000 WILL take 16gig memory cards so the GO has no advantage there and may be at a disadvantage without a UMD slot.The 3000 is slim, well built, and has a nice feel in the hand. The screen is large and brilliant though glare and fingerprints remain to be a problem. The speakers sound great for how small they are and the system has lots of power with reasonable battery life.I do not think it deserves five stars though because the web browser is clumsy and slow. I also wish that the PSN was more integrated for those of us who also have PS3s. Trophies and profile info should be the same for both systems and both systems should be able to contribute to your collection of trophies IMO.Also, you can count the games worth owning on one hand.

For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"Michael Pappalardo","summary":"Deadly Alliance: The Rebirth of MK...with a few defects....","reviewText":"Long have I waited for a great Mortal Kombat game to hit once again.  And finally the wait paid off.  Not since Mortal Kombat 2 has Mortal Kombat been as much fun.  But i'm sorry to say that all is not as good as it seems...I give the game 3 1/2 stars really.First off, the fighting system is completely revamped.  Finally stepping into the realm of true 3d (Mortal Kombat 4 was nothing more than a 2d fighting game with 3d models), the game play is as fast and furious as ever.  With the ability to switch between 3 different fighting styles, one of which is weapon based, the combo possibilities are increased more than ever.  Full 3d movement and detail make this probably the best MK since MK2...But then there are the problems.  The fighting styles, while a great new addition, aren't all they're cracked up to be.  The amount of combos you can do are limited, and the stance change button does not always work when you want it to(namely in the middle of a combo when it is most useful).  As with most MK games, the AI is extraordinarily cheap at times...it always seems to know exactly what you're going to do, and beats the crud out of you before you can even pull a move off.The juggling system is awful.  The AI abuses it so much that you'll find yourself walking away from the game in frustration.  You can easily lose in about 10 seconds if the computer keeps you backed up against the (invisible)walls surrounding the arena, because you'll be juggled so much you'll probably never even hit the ground.Some characters are just completely worthless, namely the new character Drahmin, who has absolutely no combo moves whatsoever.  The only way to defeat an opponent is by furious button mashing and pure luck.  He relies far too heavily and special moves.  The same goes for returning character Cyrax.  While he has a few good combos, his moves are far too limited and he must rely mostly on his special moves.  And many weapon styles are far too similar...some of them are totally identical to each other, except that the actual weapons look different.Fatality fans will be very disappointed...each character has only one fatality.  While a few of these fatalities are quite good, the greater majority of them are just awful.  Quan Chi's fatality in particular is by far the worst Fatality that the Mortal Kombat series has ever seen.  And there are no arena-based fatalities...how the creators can even dare to have an arena called the 'Acid Bath' or the 'Lava Shrine' and not have an arena based fatality is beyond comprehension.  It seems that once again, the design team opted for total laziness in the Finishing Moves department, as they have ever since MK3.Story, which has always been one of the best parts of MK, is no let down in this game.  The addition of Konquest mode, which takes you through 10 missions to help explain character story and train you in the use of that particular character is a great addition.  It helps you to earn 'Kurrency' which can be used to be secrets in the 'Krypt', a room full of 676 'Koffins' that are bought using your earned 'Kurrency'.  The problem there is that out of 676 Koffins, about 620 of them are total 'Krap'.  Character endings also leave alot to be desired...some just make no sense whatsoever, or are too short to explain anything.  Others, however, are shocking and surprising.Overall, the game just suffers from two major things: the feeling of being incomplete, and something that all MK fans should be used to by now: Empty Promises.  Some characters are just too limited and feel like they were rushed.  Some character's Konquest modes also seem to be completely rushed, being devoid of story and lacking rhyme or reason.  As far as empty promises, many things that the development team promised when they were creating the game just did NOT make it in:  Torn clothing on characters is nowhere to be found, weapon combat is far too basic(it was said to 'Rival Soul Calibur'), and a few other things that just seem annoying when you realize they aren't there.If it seems that i'm coming down way too hard on this game...I apologize.  I have been a fan of MK since it first debuted in Arcades in 1992.  I just feel that Deadly Alliance could've been so much more than it actually is.  To close this review off, I will list some of the high points of the game:The story is outstanding.  I challenge anyone to find a fighting game with a story as deep as this.  Even Soul Calibur's story pales in comparison.  The combat is fast paced and action packed...unlike Tekken or Virtua Fighter, which is slow paced and dreadfully boring.  Characters look better and more detailed than ever.  Arenas, although simplistic and basic in terms of interaction and maneuverability, are highly detailed and gorgeous.  The addition of Kurrency, Konquest Mode and The Krypt fuel the replay value and will keep you coming back for weeks.  Tons of characters both old and new offer lots of variety.Overall, a great game that could've been perfect, had it not been for that feeling of being incomplete, or being victim of laziness.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2002"}
{"product_name":"B002BSA1MQ","description":"","reviewerName":"R. Reining \"Old School Zinger\"","summary":"Skippable","reviewText":"Crysis 2 reminded me heavily of Avatar. The two are dissimilar in almost every way except the one that matters most. In both I was left feeling like despite the amazing visuals, neither connected with me because everything contained within them felt contrived and unbelievable. I could not relate to anyone or anything going on because it was all so one-dimensional.How could you relate to the events of the game, it's about an alien invasion, right? Well, yes. But that isn't the issue. The real problem with the game is that things happen that are so illogical you can't even suspend your disbelief to enjoy the game, even as fun popcorn schlock.So I'm just going to say it: I don't know what the big deal is about the graphics.Obviously this aspect is a lot more important to some people than it is to me. But to me, graphics in video games are much the same as looks are when evaluating attraction in another person. Good looks aren't everything, but they aren't nothing either. However the greatest looks in history don't stop some people from being rotten and horrible people. The same is true for good graphics. They aren't nothing, but if it is all you have, you don't have very much. Not to me, anyways. I have an HDTV and I was underwhelmed by he graphics. Probably because it is common now. Metal Gear Solid 4 probably still has the best graphics I personally have ever seen, and that is just my objective opinion. But my point is, you can't just make things shiny and smooth and have that make it a great game. That's not how it works. I suppose that might be the easiest way to appeal to the most people, but for people like me, who appreciate even decent storytelling, I just spend the game looking at the plot inconsistencies instead of immersed in the action.With such high production quality focused on the detail of the game environment, it is very unfortunate that seemingly so little attention was paid to the fluidity and cohesion of the story -- what little of that there is. The whole game you are ordered around like a mindless grunt. Crysis 2 also uses one of my least favorite game techniques, and that is playing a main character that never speaks. I assume this is so that the player can imagine the character having whatever voice they want. But to me, it just gets irritating, especially when another character calls you over the radio and asks you a question, and then continues talking even though you have not made any indication that you can hear them. Voiceless main characters should be used in RPG's only, if it must be done at all, because typically in an RPG there are multiple variables depending on how you make choices. Crysis 2 is not that. It is linear storytelling. And there is nothing wrong with that, except that your character essentially has no personality whatsoever because he never speaks and never makes decisions on his own.The last big problem I have with the game is the AI. Crysis 2 is unique to me only in that it is an FPS stealth game. Especially on the hardest difficulty, you really can't have an out-and-out firefight with enemies, you die after just a few hits. So what that means is you will spend a good portion of the game cloaked. Which is actually interesting to me. However, being cloaked from enemies and having to sneak by them is only tenuous when the AI is decent enough to detect you. And they aren't in Crysis 2. I played the game the second time through on the hardest difficulty, and it is actually really boring. I spent most of the game cloaked, and the rest of the times were \"boss\" battles where you have to fight in order to progress to the next area. Considering that cloaking is one of the two main abilities of the Nano-Suit, the developers really didn't make it very exciting to be cloaked.I really cannot talk about what plot inconsistencies there are because they involve spoilers in the game. But they are there, if you pay attention.However, I couldn't do a fair review without also talking a bit about what Crysis 2 did well. The levels are big, and there is quite a bit to explore if you have the inclination. Weapon models are good, and the graphics are very well done. The game is also very smooth, considering the on-screen action, explosions, and everything else. It is also a fairly lengthy game, considering that it's a shooter.In the end, I felt Crysis 2 was a game I could have lived my whole life without playing and I would not be sad to have missed it. I am glad that there seems to be a highly positive response to the game, but I just cannot agree with it because of so many blatant problems in the final product. If you enjoy good shooters regardless of plot, or if you like good multi-player FPS games, buy this, it is definitely for you. But if you're looking for something with any sort of complexity or originality, look elsewhere.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

It also comes in verious colors, but I prefer the Glacier.As most others already mentioned, the display is not backlit. But either my eyes are exceptional, or other people's are really bad, but I can see the games crystal clear. It is a trade off, not having a backlit screen means that your batteries go further. Anyone who remembers the Game Gear from Sega surely can remember how it gobbled batteries up like mad. Given a choice, I would rather go with the non-backlit screen. The old Gameboy and Gameboy color did fine without backlit screens, so the GBA doesn't suffer by not having one.The best thing about the GBA is the gameplay. Despite the small size, you get amazing depth to your games. With Super Mario World (a handheld version of the SNES classic), every apect of the original is preserved, and the controls are like second nature. The graphics are 32-bit, but on the small screen, they have the look and feel of 16-bit. This is not a bad thing, mind you, but you can't expect Playstation quality on a screen less than 5 inches tall and wide. The graphics are impressive enough, but the sound quality blew me away. The music is amazingly audible, and comes through with excellent clarity.With an ever expanding library of games, the GBA is likely to live up to it's older brother, the Gameboy, and dominate the handheld video game market. Despite the other complaints about the non-backlit screen, I think you will be suprised at the quality of this little system. If you can afford it, buy the battery pak. You'll save money in the long run.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2002"}

However, all the positive reviews couldnt be ignored, so I went ahead and gave it a go. I'm glad I did. The art and setting were pretty spectacular. The world Media Molecule crafted is lush, unique, beautiful, and engaging, The game play itself could be viewed as basic if it werent for the complete interactive nature of the game and the versatility showcased by the Vita features. This game actually interacts with the real world, which is fairly unique. The Vita camera takes images of you and superimposes them onto the Sun in the Tearaway world. The rear touchads are used to have your fingers erupt into the game to move and disrupt things, create force, and fight baddies. The front screen touchpads are used to move things, and in certain circumstances, to defeat enemies, in addition to crafting in game paper decorations and such used to complete quests and dress up various things/creatures in the game. You also use the actual motion sensors to shake up and s*** things in the world. At certain points, pictures of you are used by in game characters as idols for worship, lol. There is really a lot going on with this game, and I cant think of another original IP in recent years that has managed such a complete level of success.

Mills","summary":"How can it be so full of win?","reviewText":"I loved the first SMG but this game is head and shoulders above it.  Its not really a sequel to the first, on one had it begins in almost the same fashion, but without the adorableness of the original \"lost luma\" story or the (much hotter than peach) galaxy princess, who i think they removed because Peach couldn't handle the competition.  But in general the begining is much more the point because SMG2 knows what its all about and doesn't waste any time getting out there, everything has been slimmed down to increase the awesmness ratio.  As much as I loved all the little rooms and silly luma in the original, the first time through, after you'd been there once it got old, the new game cut the fat down to the core of Mario game-play joy and multiplied it by 1o fold.I can't say enough about this game which truly excels at what it is.  to make the point, just consider how much it fails at what would be requisit for any game: sotry? laughable, although I suppose that laughable in its most literal sense isn't a true fault.  Role-playing?  Well a several points the character can choice between responses of: \"that's right\" and \"yes\".  But in this game thats all part of the fun because its like a theme park ride from beginning to end, and no one asks you then where your gonna go, but you know you'll love the ride.Chances are if your interested you know you like Mario games but maybe money's tight enough that of the bajillion out there, half-a-bajillion are great and which to buy?  Buy this one!  If you don't own the first and can't make time in your life for both, get this one, even though the first is great, this is greater.  Don't own New Super Mario Bros Wii yet?  Get this instead.  I guess what I'm trying to say is its special when a game can do what its always done so well, and do it better then you imagined it could, not since SM64 have I had this much fun with The Italian Plumber.Side note the game looks fantastic, even in SD, and Yoshi is so much fun you'll literally feel guilty about it, the tounge thing works perfectly on the Wii how did this no occur to them before?All in all SMG is to 3D Super Mario's what Super Mario Bros 3 was to the 2D iterations","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00005YTYJ","description":"WithGrand Theft Auto III, Rockstar proves that not all  developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games.  This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular  predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any  criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the  local population for their money (or weapons), make time with  prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking  more structure can embark on dozens of plot-driven missions or steal  cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and go on vigilante  missions. Grab a cab and play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi.  Take a fire truck and earn money putting out fires. The game just never  gets boring.As in real life, there are consequences for your criminality. As your  random acts of mayhem mount up, the police start hounding you,  eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you  continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily  the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are  packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every  category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump  trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically  when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific  detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic,  pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing.  Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine  different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a  monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages  to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerNote: This review refers to thePlayStation2 versionof  this game.Pros:Offers an enormous world for players to exploit, rendered in  staggering detailEqually fun whether you go on plot-based missions or run around as  a freelance crookCons:Ultraviolence, foul language, and adult situations mean you'll want  to keep this far away from kidsIt takes too long to get from one island to another, making some  missions tedious","reviewerName":"impitbosshereonlevel2 \"impitbosshereonlevel2\"","summary":"Excellent game","reviewText":"It seems that people writing negative reviews about this game fall into 1 of 2 categories:1) Those who have never played a console game port and2) The \"holier than thou\" types, who .... in their pants at the thought of video game violenceTo those in the first category, the solution to your whining is simple: don't buy GTA3 expecting a PC game. Yes, the graphics are way nicer compared to the PS2 version, but the game is still a console game deep down inside - hence the absence of saving wherever and whenever you want.That said, I'm glad GTA3 PC is true to its console predecessor, as the game would have been way too easy if players were allowed to save anytime. If you don't like console games, don't kid yourself - GTA3 is not for you.The second category should just refrain from buying games in general, and instead stick to Martha Stewart specials and Barbie video games. You might also be interested to know that Rockstar was aware of people like you before the game was even released (three words: Pogo the Monkey).This said, there is something inherently excellent about being able to play GTA3 without having to turn on your Playstation 2. Graphics in this version are nothing short of incredible - even though the requirements are a little high, with a good video card (GeForce4) and a Pentium 3, you can get good results. Sound has also been improved, and even though I will probably never use this option, you can add your own MP3's to create a radio station all your own.For those unfamiliar with the game, check out the reviews for the PS2 version - the game is a very faithful port (even some of the glitches, hehe). The story is very well written, and I think the tagline one of the magazines used suits this game very well (\"A mafioso masterpiece\"). Even after having played GTA: Vice City I find GTA3 no less interesting and captivating - it's a different game every time. The city is teeming with life, and the radio stations alone are worthy of an award.I will conclude this by saying that if there ever was a reason to buy a Playstation 2, GTA3 is it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00006599Q","description":"Turok: Evolutionis a prequel that takes us back to the origins of the Turok lineage. In the beginning of the game, we see our hero, Tal'Set, fighting nemesis Captain Tobias Bruckner in 1886 Texas. During the battle, a rift between their world and the Lost Lands opens and Tal'Set is sucked into it.Features and enhancements to this new installment in the Turok franchise include the groundbreaking Squad Dynamics System (SDS) for realistic enemy and allied squad AI, and an entirely new game engine built to take full advantage of the next-generation hardware platforms. All-new weapons including Variable Payload Cruise Missiles, Gravity Disrupter Beams, and the Swarm Bore--each with unique traits and damage. Flight sequences now enable players to soar through the skies on a winged pteranodon, and scripted event sequences bring the world to life with stunning detail.Turok: Evolutionfeatures 32 types of prehistoric and indigenous life rendered with frightening realism. The game is full of destructible objects and environments: shoot down trees over your enemies and collapse massive rock spires onto dinosaurs. The environments consist of lush, living jungles. Plants move as dinosaurs brush against them while trees sway in the wind. The game also includes stealth- and action-based gameplay directed by context-sensitive, mission-based sequences. Great care was also taken with the multiplayer modes, which were developed by a dedicated team of designers, programmers, and artists.","reviewerName":"\"andrew007_jjj\"","summary":"Excellent, with an exception here and there.","reviewText":"The Turok series started out on the Nintendo 64 with a game that blew numerous other First Person Shooters away for several reasons. One, it was revolutionary in gameplay. Two, It went off the beaten path. Three, unparalled amounts of gore. WHile four Turok games were released for N64, only the first two were decent and worth stealing away any time from your life. Turok: Evolution for all three major competing systems has once again proven that the game can be revolutionary in its own way. However, it loses a good deal when trying to implement too much one would consider new. The storyline/plot is basically a prequel to all the other Turok games to date. While this may turn off some who may have never played the other games. The plot isn't incredibly important, this game focuses a good deal on gameplay. The sound first off in incredible with the ambient noise throughout the levels excellent, easily putting the gamer into the Lost Land where the game takes place. The playability is easily acquired with the standard left stick moves/strafes, right stick looks. Visually, the game is impressive with the graphics being used to the max to show off the world the developers wanted you to see. Replay value somewhat lacks as once you beat the game, the only reason you'd ever go back to it is incredible bloodlust in order to kill over and over again. The weapons are expansive and instead of having a lot of weapons that do one thing, you grab attachements to existing weapons (i.e. turn a flachette gun into a triple 30mm assault weapon with a simple attachment) which is what the game basically preaches. My only true beef with this game is the flying levels that seemed arduous and needlessly drawn out. While the game overall was incredibly short for me, I did derive a good deal of fun out of it. I can't recommend this as an immediate buy, what I can do is insist you rent it and go from there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-15-2002"}

After she survived an X attack through the use of a vaccine made with X parasite DNA, she can now absorb the parasites to regain health and obtain special powers, like the morph ball, space jump, and wave beam. The problem is that the parasites are quickly making their way through the research lab's many dangerous projects and subsuming their abilities.As a special bonus to GameCube owners,Metroid PrimeandMetroid Fusioncan each unlock special features in the other game via the Nintendo GameCube Game Boy Advance cable.

Morales","summary":"Classic Metroid Enhanced","reviewText":"THE GOOD: Awesome graphics; great music; solid controls; interesting storyline; nice powerup progression; challengingTHE BAD: Too many \"hidden\" paths; general scope is pretty small; shortDIFFICULTY: Medium-to-HardSince I missed the boat on the much loved Super Metroid for the SNES, this is really the only enhanced side-scrolling Metroid game I've ever played besides the original NES debut. When starting off I was surprised to see such a story emphasis on this game, basically you get sent to an intergalactic biosystem to investigate a virus \"X\" in which is destroying the place, and you are also infected... and later on, a couple of twists ensure. Nothing tremendous, but interesting enough to hold your attention. You get briefed on your objectives by voice command coming from headquarters, therefore you always know where to head to and what to do - whether it be to update suit powers or seek and destroy an enemy target (this may be seen as a negative to Metroid veterans who want to figure things out for themselves, but it works very smoothly here regardless).If there's one thing Nintendo always excels at, it's the gameplay department, be it the controls, character progression and music and graphical presentation, it all works extremely well. The GBA's hardware is definitely pushed as you'll notice very nicely shadowed and crystal clear environments dolling up your GBA's screen. Action and sound effects move swifty and never slow down or chop up even when there's plenty of action on screen. So all in all, the gameplay and presentation is top-notch. This is a solid game TECHNICALLY.What disturbed me during my playing experience could be seen as more nitpicky by Metroid veterans, but a good point by most casual players and newcomers. First off, I found myself becoming annoyed by not being able to progress because I didn't find that one hidden path I needed to sneak into. Usually I'm more used to hidden paths containing hidden items, NOT as a means to actually progressing through the game. The only reason I got the hang of it quickly enough was because these paths were prevelant to the original metroid game (although thankfully this time there's actually a map). Newcomers may find themselves scratching their heads as to where they'll need to go next, as many of these paths aren't clued in AT ALL. And constantly rolling around placing bombs everywhere and shooting walls to find the next path gets pretty tiresome.As stated before, you're constantly briefed on where to go next, and because the general area of the entire game isn't very big, the story pushes you to progress at times when you'd rather be exploring for those hidden items you couldn't reach before because your powerups wouldn't allow you to.That's pretty much all the compaints I have. When it comes to the action and the meat of the game is where it excels though. Climbing on walls, platforming puzzles, using different weapon abilities to destroy certain enemies one way and another a different way... it's all incredible fun and adds a good deal of variety to the gameplay. On top of this, I didn't find this game all too easy either. Boss fights are tough, and simply running and gunning won't always do it, so strategy plays a good part when trying to take down those bosses (and prepare yourself for the final boss, which is more like 4 separate fights which have to be beaten without saves). They're all pretty big and animate great.BOTTOM LINE: A solid game with a classic Metroid feel which will interest veterans, but enough leeway and helpfulness to where it's accessible to newcomers... yet these features tend to cross over giving each side something to complain about.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-09-2006"}

The greatest 3-D weapons-based fighter will provide non-stop action, excitement and surprises as you go one-on-one against your favorite challengers.","reviewerName":"C.E.","summary":"WOW!","reviewText":"Soul Calibur 2 is simply put: ONE OF THE BEST.  This game is an awesome achievement on so many levels.  It is a visual treat and a fluid experience in terms of gameplay.  I purchased this game on the release date of august 26th 2003, and am still to this day finding new things!The game is great in terms of gameplay, and even better when it comes to replay value and head-to-head competition with your friends.  The single player mode is great.  Weapon master mode is a way for you to unlock everything from a new weapon to nifty pieces of artwork and concept sketches.The plot isnt something that you really need to know about, so i dont think that i will delve into it here.  Fighting games arent loved for their plot lines, their strength lies in their ease of play and level of mastery.Soul Calibur 2 is a great game that anyone can pick up and have a good time with.  For those players who like to discover every combo move and every special attack, this game is full of them...almost too many!  If, on the other hand, you are a player that just wants to button mash and pull off some cool moves with very little effort, this game will allow you to do that as well.Although some of the charachters seem a bit over-balanced, this game is still a great one to play.The graphics are good, and there is only a minimal amount of frame rate slowdown and choppiness.  The control response is like lightning and the camera is superb.  Environments are colorful and unique, ring outs have been minimized and best of all...weapons galore!!  over a dozen weapons for each charachter.  You can obtain weapons that are all powerful, weapons that break through an opponents guard, and even some weapons that make silly noises on impact.All said and done, this game is great.  Obviously, becuase it is consistently within the top 10 selling games for all systems.  Legions of fans have lauded its praised and deemed it worthy of the 50 bucks you have to shell out for it.  Dont rent it...just buy it!  Its awesome.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2003"}

No jagged edges, smooth colours, motion flows more fluidly. No blur. Smash Bros Brawl especially looks wonderful with this. No jumping light particles in the graphics. Everything is calm and stable.

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait. You can't buy a much better game.--John CockingPros:A story to beat all storiesCharacters worth caring aboutHey--it's from SquareSoftStunning animationsCons:Too many random battlesCombat is, as always, turn-based and offers minimal excitementWeak souls might give up after two or three discs of play","reviewerName":"dark54555 \"dark54555\"","summary":"The First Big Disappointment from Square","reviewText":"Well, this was the first in a series of disappointing games from SquareSoft released for Playstation (followed by SaGa Frontier 1 and 2, Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana, Vagrant Story...)  Don't get me wrong, even the poorer SquareSoft titles are a cut above most games, but compared to the innovation and quality of previous stories, Final Fantasy VIII really falls short.  The magic system is irritating at best, and the story isn't nearly as compelling as Final Fantasy 6, 7 or 9.

{"product_name":"B00178631E","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Fig.","summary":"A+ All Around. Amazing Graphics, Sound and Story.","reviewText":"I have written reviews for the console versions of this game, and in both, I have said how good the game looks and sounds, but the PC version blows them out of the water, it is a graphical jewl, but of course, this will depend on your hardware.I have 2 EVGA GeForce GTX 570 Classified 1280 MB GDDR5 PCI Express, 12 GB of RAM and an i7 950 CPU. I'm able to run the game \"close\" to its max settings, even with the hardware I have, the game still needs a power horse to run at its fullest. This however, does not mean it doesn't look amazing, because it does. I have taken pictures of the actual settings available under the graphics options and how much memory they require. If you played the PC version of GTA IV, then you pretty much know what this is all about.I have a minor complaint, everytime a cut scene ends and the games resumes, you no longer are holding the weapon you had in hand before the cut scene started, you have to switch back. The hand gun will be in your hands every time a scen ends...This issue can be quite annoying, specially if there's a ton of dudes shooting at you. And I hope RS releases a patch for that.Graphics:The console version (360) looks amazing, but the PC has much more detail and looks better all together. With setting such as High Defenition Ambient Oclusion HDAO, Anisotropic Filtering, Tessellation, etc.Sound:Botht the console and PC version are Dolby qualified, so in order to truly appreciate the games amazing musical score, FX and ambient sounds, you definitely need a high end sound card, such as the XFi series.The Story,As mentioned before in previous reviews, the story is top notch, well written and performned. The developers kept the local language without translation, wich makes the game that much more realistic.You are Max, older, but still hooked on pills and booze, you take on a job as private security for a rich real state tycoon. His wife is kidnapped and you find yourself caught in the middle of a huge conspiracy, the end is one of the best I've played.Some gamers have complained about the amount of cut scenes in the game, which I have to admit, are a lot, but they add to the game's overall drama and suspense. I honestly think they are needed, so there isn't any gaps and so I can better understand what's going on.The Musical Score:I had to review this individually, because it is incredibly good, it adds a level of drama, suspense and adrenaline that will immers you deep into to the game. A slow-mo, techno beat samba that it's simply amazing. You will have to go through an airport level...there will be a song playing in the background that I promise you WILL LOVE, the name of that song is \"Tears\" by Health...trust me, it will pump  you full of adrenaline...headshots abound.The Controls:You can use the mouse and keyboard or a 360 controller for windows such asMicrosoft Xbox 360 Controller for Windowswhich works great. Since I have the console version, I decided to try the M & KB combo, which I'm glad to say, is spot on. I had no issues playing the game. Each key has been mapped and can be re-mapped to your liking. In fact, the mouse and keyboard, is much better than the console version, you will have more accuracy and better control. This of course, is from a PC gamer's perspective.The Download:Huge! Huge file! but worth it. Remember, this game's graphics, sounds, etc are so good, that I wasn't expecting it to be smaller than it is. Downloading took about one hour, over a 20MB cable connection. The download went smoothly without file corruptions. The Amazon download version (there's two) does not require a Steam account/activation. But you will need Rock Star's Social Club to take advantage of the MP and other online features.Multiplayer:Much better than the console version, at least for PC gamers, you will rank up better thanks to higher accuracy and control. You can customize your character with unlockable items. All in all, the MP is much better than I had expected.So there it is, Max Payne 3 for the PC, a better looking version of this awesome game. But know this, you need a powerful rig to run the game at higher settings. This is a true PC game with plenty of options to tweak its graphics. A+.Enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2012"}

Coming from Brotherhood, a third act would have tough shoes to fill, but the tying together of Altair and Ezio worked very well and gave a that nice warm feeling that a lot of games tend to gimp up after an adventure.

It has a smaller detachable Vita case for those times when you don't need the extra bulk.  One feature i really liked was the strap sewn into the smaller case, it allows you to easily remove the Vita without having to squeeze your fingers inside it.  It holds lots of games, 20 in the main part and i think about 4 on the detachable Vita case.

Sony is somehow getting away with charging $30 for half a dual-shock. Only, it's not really half a dual-shock as it features NO RUMBLE. So, you're getting half a six-axis, right? NO. There is NO motion control feature included for your $30. This, to me, is the most disgusting thing about the Move setup, especially considering you REALLY DO need the navigational controller for games like RE5 and Heavy Rain (you can play with half a dual-shock, but it gets to be very uncomfortable very fast).I can almost guarantee Sony will add rumble to the navigational controller within the next 6 months (probably prior to the release of Killzone 3). So, if you're not a hardcore gamer, I'd wait. If you ARE and you REALLY want to use motion control on RE5 and Heavy Rain, I would recommend this, albeit reluctantly at this price.Is there anything wrong with the controller? Not really. It's well designed and mostly comfortable. The bumper button is too close to the thumbstick, which can lead to numb fingers and a sore wrist, but if you don't have large hands, this may not be a problem. Sony just needed to add either motion or rumble or both to justify this price. Nintendo charges $19.99 for their sub-controller (IE - \"nunchuck\") and it has motion control.The navigational controller would be priced right at $19.99 with rumble. Or at $9.99 as it currently is. Better yet, Sony could have included it in the starter pack and made everyone happy.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2010"}

I rushed my package from the door right to my Wii.  My hands shook so violently with the anticipation that I nearly took a doctor's prescribed pill to settle my nerves then i reminisced ever so quickly that such an act would render my finer acuities and reactions to a dullard pitch of unresponsiveness.  So I trusted my fragile psyche would handle the overwhelming overload of sheer emotionalism as I waited for the load screen to appear.But all for naught.  My Wii sat there perched upon my entertainment center spinning the disc a few times and then the big viola of nothingness.  I hit the eject button on the off hand chance I put the silly thing in upside down.  But nope.  after back in it went still nothing.  I dreaded that my Wii finally gave out after all those games of Carnival Games and Bowling.  So I put in Metroid and that worked.  Zelda too.  But each and every time I place Mario Kart 8 in there ain't a doggone thing occurring.  Heck, I even tried blowing on the disc old-school style.  Still it don't play.Anybody know why?  I tried reaching out to Nintendo.  As I sat on the hold line for 15 minutes I kept thinking over and over why Nintendo would even wait 6 years to release a sequel when all they really need to do is set a few designers down to come up with some more tracks and slap different colors on the side of the carts.  Not like these games don't just about make themselves with what little true innovation comes along and gets stretched out over 20years of this particular franchise.Either way I just hope they figure out what ever problem I'm having cause I hear there is a sequel to Super Smash Brothers after 7 plus years.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-11-2014"}

I simply connected the usb and powered them on and that was it... ready to play.Once in the game all your controls and menu choices are performed with the buzzers, after you learn the order in which the colors are in the control, playing should be pretty simple.THE GAMEI had been looking for a while for a game I could play with my family/friends on my PS3, I am more of an adventure-game-player so the games I own are not the type of games you can have multiple players join you.Well, the game I wanted is finally here!I understand this is like the seventh game of the series, to me this is the first one I play. Graphics in PS3 using HDMI look very good. The character designs are funny and the animation is ok for a game of this kind.The game play is pretty straightforward and I highly recommend this to be played on multiplayer mode (single player can be a little bit repetitive) with friends. I found many of the questions to be of average difficulty (not too easy yet not too hard) and in the many times I've played it since I got it I have seen few questions to be repeated. The box states over 5000 questions are included and there are also downloadable packs (users can create their own quizzes too)The trivias cover several topics (music, movies & tv, brainiac, sports and lifestyle), you can select the one of your choice or play all topics at the same time. Being this a competitive game, it is perfect to play against friends and form teams, however, I would not suggest to play against the wife  :DI've seen some complaints about the animation and dialogue being repetitive but believe me, when you are playing in group and having fun that is the least of your worries. It can also be played online.The only downside I can think of is that there are no difficulty levels to choose so you have to stick with what is available. Again, the MyBuzz website incluides more trivias and they can be sorted by difficulty so that kind of compensates the lack of difficulty levels in the game.This is a perfect game to play in groups, it is not complicated at all and a lot of fun to play... great trivia game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2008"}

He has been in so many wonderful video games including the vigorous racing game Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, the challenging and strategic Mario Party games 4, 5, & now 6, and the golf game that isn't just like any ordinary game, Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour. Those games have all done well, and yet from another Nintendo 64 classic, Mario Tennis, the game proved so well as one of the final games for the N64 system. Yet, the people at Camelot and Nintendo knew there had to be a sequel that was even more challenging, and yet it has happened.Mario Power Tennis, follows through very well in the same path that Mario Tennis had for the Nintendo 64 in 2000. The game features Mario, Luigi, Bowser and company through several different and challenging courses including the traditional courses, as well as themed courses just like the Nintendo 64 version. The game also fatures new games and challenges like Artist On The Court, Mecha-Bowser Challenge, Ring Shot, and many more. The tournaments also range into differnt patterns as well, with a Gimmick version that has obstacles all over the tennis court, on themed courses for Donkey Kong, Wario Ware, and the original Mario Brothers games. The graphics are outstanding and improved the detail of each of the characters nicely in detail beyond the N64 version, and the gameplay is very challenging.There are some downsides however: one of them is the overused motions for the power shots during the game. In exhibition mode, they can not be available if optional, but in tournament mode that is another story. Another is the control, on some of the characters which can be frustrating in certain cases including Yoshi who is very weak, but gets a power-up bonus later on, before he is as skilled as the other players. Yet, with a lot of practice, anyone can be the ace.Mario Power Tennis happens to be a very well put Gamecube game, since there really isn't anyone out there for the Gamecube, unlike the other systems. This is a very enjoyable game for all gamers alike. It is exciting playing it alone, but better with a partner against you. I really know that his game is a must for any part of your Gamecube library.Graphics: ASound: B+Control: B-Fun and Enjoyment: BOverall game: B+","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2004"}

{"product_name":"B002I0GX88","description":"","reviewerName":"dgdbear \"David\"","summary":"The Good and The Bad of inFAMOUS 2","reviewText":"The first thing I noticed when starting the game is that it features new voice acting for Cole, done by Eric Ladin. Originally voiced by James Cottle in inFAMOUS, it was widely criticized that Cole's voice was too dark, deep, and gravelly, and made him sound menacing. Though it took me a while to accept the change, I actually grew to like Cole's new voice, and I thought Ladin really brought out a more multidimensional character than what was depicted in inFAMOUS, although the rugged gravellyness stayed. Caleb Moody returns to play the iconic Zeke Dunbar, and the interactions between Zeke and Cole are much more interesting this time around, largely because of the context from inFAMOUS and Sucker Punch's greater emphasis on Zeke and Cole's friendship, but also because of the more genuine feel that comes from Ladin's acting. This is further assisted with improved graphics and animated cutscenes. The level of detail, both in character models and in the environment, have been improved dramatically, and make both the city of New Marais, and the characters in it, feel more alive and real than in Empire City.The original soundtrack effectively captured the energy of Empire City and the parkouring protagonist with its unique urban percussion, but it was also very ambient, and so deeply mixed into the background noise that there was little opportunity to really appreciate it. In inFAMOUS 2, the music defines the moments, and the compelling tracks are made to be prominently heard over the sounds of the city to really get you into the game. While the unique and characteristically \"inFAMOUS\" sound can still be heard in the music, strings dominate, and some jazz flairs match the lively, but classic feeling of New Marais. The sound design isn't too bad, either, and I quite enjoyed the chaos in my headphones.The gameplay is solid enough. With the introduction of a new \"quick-select\" system, Cole can have a diverse set of powers that still fit comfortably into the PS3 controller, making Cole more of an electric Swiss Army knife than ever before. And that's great, because the game is also noticeably more difficult than its predecessor, and even as an inFAMOUS veteran, I found the medium difficulty to be overwhelming on my first playthrough. This is partially due to the change of making Cole's \"Alpha Bolt\", his most basic power, cost energy, which was not the case in the original inFAMOUS. This means that by running out of energy, your options become limited to either brawling it out, or retreating to find some sort of power source-- something easier said than done in some parts of New Marais. Luckily, with an improved melee system, beating down the bad guys is no longer the impractical feat it was in inFAMOUS-- in fact, it can make quick work of many tougher enemies. Still, for the game that was supposed to mark Cole's graduation from \"superhero\" to \"super-superhero\", the need to constantly restore your energy just to do basic attacks can make you feel weaker than you ever felt in inFAMOUS. The climbing seems essentially unchanged from inFAMOUS, which is a formula that works well, although can still be clumsy at times. I experienced occasional strange glitches and rogue physics during the game, which, in some cases, would result in Cole spontaneously dying. Drops in framerate have also occurred here and there, but it has always been negligible. The game did crash once within the first hour of play, although it never has since. Lastly, in regard to gameplay, I thought the sudden mid-game introduction to the UGC (user-generated content) was a bit annoying, as I didn't know why I was suddenly seeing an online user agreement when I was in the middle of playing. I felt like the UGC was being pushed onto me, although I had no interest in it at the time. While I can understand that Sucker Punch is proud of their new feature and they want to show it off, in the end, I never bothered with a single UGC mission until I finished both good and evil playthroughs.Much like inFAMOUS, the storyline is intricate and complex enough to be engaging, without ever being too difficult to follow. The moral choices presented to you are actually much more nuanced than in the original title, and although it's always highlighted to you which path is \"good\", and which is \"evil\", these karmic decisions progressively become more difficult to make, and eventually lead to two very different, but equally astounding endings, which invite you to play the game at least twice. All in all, it's a story that feels inFAMOUS. And yet...As a major fan of the original inFAMOUS, inFAMOUS 2 leaves me greatly divided. The game, by itself, is easily comparable to, if not better than the original. However, in respect to the continuity of the story of inFAMOUS, the sequel does more than fall short. The loose strings at the end of inFAMOUS seemed to perfectly set up a sequel that would have taken place in Empire City-- military intervention was in its beginning stages, two powerful enemies had managed to escape your grasp, and the inevitable encounter with The Beast was looming ahead, all while you were personally dealing with the new burden of responsibility for Empire City, and the fallout from Kessler. It was all of this that had made me so excited about the sequel when news began emerging about it. I wanted to see these conflicts develop further and eventually meet a resolution. I wanted to see what more Empire City had to offer. It was not only the logical setting for the sequel, but it was, to me, the right way to go. But inFAMOUS 2 moves in an entirely different direction-- one that not only disregards Empire City and all of its history and its potential, but literally incinerates it. Why this is, is baffling to me, and only made more bewildering by the fact that this game seems to be the end of the series altogether. The end result is a troubling paradox that both greatly impresses and sorely disappoints-- an excellent game that, at the same time, does a severe disservice to its predecessor, and squanders the potential it had as a series. Ultimately, it boils down to what you're looking for-- if you were impressed with the original inFAMOUS, but could really care less about the storyline as a series, inFAMOUS 2 will do more than satisfy. If, however, you were a fan of inFAMOUS largely because of the plot, I warn you to proceed with caution.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2011"}

Incredibly fun, but incredibly disappointing as well.I love Mass Effect and play a few replays, as well as numerous saves to get all the good options.  I took off half of a star for the release date DLC, which was 10 dollars.  I purchased it, foolishly, for the extra conversations with my teammates.  I didn't feel chock full of great conversations like I did in Mass Effect 2.  I liked that the support roles played a bigger part... the reporter, the Kelly Replacement, the shuttle pilot.. but I was able to have very few conversations with my teammates, Liara seemed to have the most options for talk.  I imagine if I had one less conversation with every member because I didn't purchase the DLC I would have been pretty disappointed.Okay.  Second, so many early quests are \"Do something that helps the war effort and happens to bring you in contact with one of your old crewmates.\"  I took off a half star for this because it wasn't natural.  Everyplace I went, I met an old buddy.  It just didn't feel natural, and each time I was surprised like, \"OMG, I thought I'd never see you again\" but the reality was, I was pretty much in the phone book looking up old contacts.I took off a half star for the endings.  Literally, there are 3 endings, which apparently they call 16 endings even though they only have teensie weensie minor differences based on your \"War readiness\".  I took off half a star for the fact that I have to play Multiplayer to get my war readiness high enough to get the good ending. I have a feeling this is an anti-piracy ploy, but for those of us who don't really care to play non first-person-shooter multiplayer, it kind of sucks.  Mass Effect doesn't have roots in online multiplayer, why should I have to do that?  Edited again :  I did have a bug regarding my ending availability that did occur again from the end game sequence but didn't occur again from the end game mission.  Instead of getting three options, I only got two.I added a star because of the cute conversations that happen when your team roams around the Normandy.  My favorite?  Catching two beloved friends having a day-before-we-die makeout session.  I also loved how they would be on the talking on the intercom with the others.  Cute.I liked the new and improved weapons loadout, which was simple but not as simple as ME2. The addition of weight and it's affect on your power-recharging speeds is pretty neat.  Gameplay and strategy feels great on hardcore, and I'm looking forward to some frustration if I do decide to play insanity.I liked the balance of powers.  I didn't much care for the fact that there wasn't a biotic-combat (vanguard) character on the squad.  Yeah, the DLC new guy is one, but that kind of doesn't count.  It makes the release-date DLC seem that much crummier.  I also feel like I didn't have enough playable characters.  That said, I wish they had picked push over pull as far as biotic powers.I removed a half star because there were a few parts that didn't make sense with the plot.  They're not huge, but just kind of nonsensical.  No spoilers!  Not all are focused around the messy endings but a lot of them are.On one hand, I want to play to see if I had not saved some characters in ME2 how my experiences would have gone. On the other hand, I realize it just brings me to those three bland endings and I get kind of sad. I do want the character interaction, so perhaps I'll just replay the first few quests (the meet-former-squadmates on the war effort ones) and see what happens there.I'll tell you after romancing the Drell (Thane) in ME2, I can say I was pretty short on romance in my life and pretty high on tears.  Those scenes were great.  The growing desperation of other races and the scope of the game?  Fan-tastic. Bringing the universe together to fight on a single front?  Oh my!  I had feared that side quests would either be phased out or seem out of place, but they all seemed quite reasonable.  They're all \"Bring this to me if you see it during your search\".  What's really cool is that your shipmates come aboard the citadel, so you can speak to them elsewhere.  I thought this was a nice touch.  I was impressed with a lot of things, but I don't think it's the same caliber as the first two games.If I hadn't played Me1 and Me2, I would probably give this game a 4.5, but coming down from SO MUCH CONVERSATION and these great cinematic endings that just made you feel so goddamned good to these weak cinematic endings that pretend to give you options and choices.  I think it's a natural progression, though.. when handling something with such scope it's very hard to strike the balance that pleases.Also, it's not that the ending is bittersweet or unhappy that bothers me, it's just the way it's done.  It's almost worse than the Matrix.  I know the writers are great, so I'm going to have to ask for an ending re-do!OH.  And I read the Dietz book in the Mass Effect universe, so if you have, look forward to some nice bits from there.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SX9VO","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Borderlands 2:  The rare sequel that improves on everything","reviewText":"Rare is the game that comes out today that's not associated with a major franchise (i.e. a new IP) and has success.  The original Borderlands was released to little fanfare in 2009, however once people got into Pandora and got sucked in (i.e. 17 million guns!!!), it gained steam and sales, and ultimately resulted in 4 DLC packs being developed.Gearbox Software had a huge task in fixing the many issues that BL fans overlooked in the first game (co-op online auto-populating your mission list and breaking certain missions, a mostly lifeless environment, dead-lack of a single player story and a less-then-enjoyable ending, among others).  I am happy to say that after 20+ hours of gameplay, they have absolutely nailed in BL2 what made the first so great.These are just a few highlights; I will try to keep this review as \"spoiler free\" as possible:- Single player storyline:  1000% times better.  You're one of 4 new Vault Hunters looking for \"loot\" and in your way is Handsome Jack, who wants to open the \"newly discovered\" Vault and use its riches for himself.  It's your job to stop him.  Along the way, you'll laugh your butt off and find a very challenging and fulfilling campaign.- Side missions galore:  And in most of these, you feel a much tighter connection vs. the \"pick up the items to build this weapon that you'll be discarding 5 minutes later\" ones of BL.  Yes there are the annoying missions which have you running between locations, but with the improved Fast Travel, that really isn't a huge dealbreaker.  you DO want to do the side missions as they are the only way to get specific Purple weapons/shields and maybe even Legendary ones (I haven't seen one from a mission but that doesn't mean they don't exist).- A gazillion more guns:  Some people were disappointed/put off by this claim but all I can say is go play the original BL game, come back to BL2 and tell me the weapons and the way they fire/effects aren't superior.  From Assault Rifles that first explosive rounds to the new Slag weapons (which adds a nice bit of strategy to the gunplay), to TRULY rare Legendary weapons (I've read on the BL2 message boards players who went through an entire playthrough and didn't get one Legendary weapon), it makes the hunt for loot that much more addictive.- Controls are mostly carried over from BL1, however you have to go into a menu and selecte the BL1 control setup (which you are most likely familiar with).  Was just a strange choice by Gearbox to not keep the same control scheme.- Menus are SIGNIFICANTLY improved, as is the ease in managing your inventory.  No more selling off a weapon you didn't want to by accident; you can mark weapons \"favorites\".  You also end up with a safe where you can store weapons, as well as Claptrap's \"stash\", where you can put weapons for future playthroughs with other characters.- HUMOR.  OMG.  If you don't laugh while playing this game, you don't have a pulse.  It is SO refreshing to see a game like BL2 that gets a Mature rating but isn't cussing at you every 20 seconds.  (It was 20 hours into the game before I saw a sign that I wouldn't want my 9 year old to see in the Wildlife Preservation Reserve.  Though it still made me laugh and chuckle :)The bottom line:Presentation-9Menus are cleaner and more managable, great story, easy to followGraphics-9.5I don't see how BL3 can be better unless it's on the PS4Sound-8.5I liked the music from BL better, not saying the music in BL2 is bad.  And yeah, all the gun sounds are great as you can imagine.Controls-9Once you actually get back to the BL1 scheme, everything is tight and you won't die due to cheap controls, that's for sure.Replay Value-10With 4 DLC packs coming as well as a DLC character (maybe more, depending on fan reaction), the main story and the sidequests, if you're looking for a 100+ hour game, you've found it.For me, BL2 is the Game of the Year on the PS3.  Without question, if you like shooters at all, buy it.UPDATED 8 Oct 2012VERY late last night with one of my co-op friends, I finally got through the single player part of the story.  The great thing about the design of this game is that you can go right back in and fight the final boss over and over again, for the chance at getting arguably the best shotgun in the game.  Just another reason why BL2 is such a great game and improvement.  From dying at least 10-15 times to now, when the only way I die is because of my own stupidity/aggressiveness, I have felt my character continue to get stronger.  There are plenty of RPG's that fail to capitalize on this feeling.  I can't wait to go back and continue to try and get that Legendary weapon and then mop up the side quests/Bad*** quests before I move onto \"True Vault Hunter\" mode!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-03-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00000K2R4","description":"The Dreamcast system is, in a word, awesome. Fire upSoul Calibur, and instantly you'll appreciate that the graphics and gameplay are even better than in the arcade version. AndSonic Adventure, with its light-speed gameplay, is sure to wow even the most jaded gamer.It's amazing that such a small machine (it's about the size of your mouse pad) can deliver such incredible performance. Chalk it up to superior engineering. Dreamcast's only downside is that it comes with only one controller and a demo disc. In order to truly take advantage of Dreamcast's capabilities, we recommend outfitting the controller with a Jump Pack and a Visual Memory Unit. Getting one or more extra controllers is also a good idea, because some of the best Dreamcast games support up to four players at once.Why it's so cool:Ultramodern components:Custom-made video, audio, and processor technology blows away the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation and puts Dreamcast in the same league as PS2 and XBox.Integrated modem:In another video-game first, Dreamcast comes with a 56K modem. Use your regular Internet service provider and the separately sold keyboard to access e-mail, shopping, and the World Wide Web. Not only can you upload high scores, participate in chat discussions, and download updates and enhancements for your games, but, through a membership to the SegaNet Internet service provider, you can playQuake III Arena,NFL 2K1, and other games against Dreamcast owners over the Internet.The Visual Memory Unit (VMU):More than just a memory card, the VMU is a miniature portable game system that fits inside a controller--so its LCD screen is easily seen by you but hidden from your opponent.All-in-one entertainment:It plays games. It plays audio CDs. It connects to the Internet and lets you browse the Web or e-mail friends. Our note to the cost-conscious: If you have a Dreamcast system, you just don't need a separate CD player or a separate computer. Dreamcast does it all, and does it well.--Mike Fehlauer","reviewerName":"Strategos \"The Guardian of Time\"","summary":"One of the Greatest Game Consoles Ever Made","reviewText":"My two favorite game systems both had short lives and a great software library (partially due to the fantastic imports available from Japan and elsewhere). They were also both made by Sega. The Sega Saturn and the Sega Dreamast. Even when the Dreamcast was set to launch, people feared it wouldn't last long. Ultimately they were proved right. Sony and Nintendo (not to mention Microsoft) were just too big, and their advertising too effective. And let's not forget one of the hard and fast rules of commericalism: original ideas don't usually make money. Let's face it, most of the games to come out for these new game systems were copy-cat versions of previous games (don't get me started on the sequel subject, just how long do we have before Tony Hawk 22 and Tomb Raider 13 come out anyway?). But unlike the game systems that now rule...Dreamcast was something different.Perhaps the greatest strength of the Dreamcast was along its undoing. Sega wanted to rule the game market of the future. They invested a fortune in making the Dreamcast online capable. Every dreamcast came with a built-in modem (take that Nintendo adn Sony). Out of the box, the Dreamcast was internet ready. And the games that were released over the life of the Dreamcast...man. But like I said, original games are slow to be accepted, and more than that, a lot of the games that were released needed to have the bugs ironed out and the gameplay adjusted. Sega was just in too much of a hurry. And as many undoubted know, the console world STILL doesn't seem to be ready to embrace the internet (I have NEVER seen anyone play a console game online).But if all this is so, why does this system deserve five stars? Why is it one of my favorite game systems? Why do I play it more than my PS2? Because for everything that Sega did wrong, they did so much right. Take controller ports. The system supports FOUR! That means that the PS2 version of Tennis 2K2 supports two players, while the Dreamast version supports four! But the real kicker is...The Dreamcast has more great games for it than any system ever except perhaps the Saturn. Name any kind of game. Sega has something for you. Like multi-player strategy? Worms Armageddon and Worms World Party. Like fighting games? Soul Calibur (the greatest fighting game ever made). Like arcade racing games? Sega Rally 2 and Hydro Thunder, both as arcade perfect as it gets. Want a shooter? How about the import of Ikaruga? How about Mars Matrix? It goes on and on. The first cell-shaded game was on Dreamcast (Jet Grind Radio). The first 3D sonic game (Sonic Adventure). Not to mention that many great Playstation games came out in superior form on Dreamcast (Spiderman, Hydro Thunder, Worms, Tomb Raider, Dino Crisis ect).Really I ask you, what more can you want from a game system? You can buy one for less than $50.00. The games set you back $5.00 or less in many cases. And a whole heck of a lot of them are better than what's out or coming out for the game systems everyone else is playing. This is truly a game system for the hardcore, the master game player, the collector, and even the person on a budget. I'm never getting rid of mine. I hope you buy one now and come to the same conclusion.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2003"}

Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film.

Rhodes","summary":"A Classic story ruined by crude voice acting and cutscenes","reviewText":"The original Metal Gear Solid has been widely considered to be one of the greatest games of all time.  It created a genre and for its time, gave us the best voice acting we'd ever seen!  The story was well defined with its incredible plot twists, and well developed characters.  Now, with the help of Silicon Knights, Metal Gear Solid is being presented to us the way it should be.  The gameplay and graphics have been updated to perfection.  Unfortunately, with these upgrades came other problems.  Metal Gear Solid was a game that was obviously made to suit the Playstation.  Bringing it to the Gamecube wasn't such a bad decision, but a lot of the mechanics added to the game just feel out of place.Terrorists have taken over a base in Alaska known as Shadow Moses Island.  These terrorists are demanding that the government hand over the remains of the legendary Big Boss, and that if their demands aren't meant, they'll launch a nuclear warhead.  Snake, called out of retirement, is the only man capable of taking on these terrorists and stopping their nuclear weapon known as Metal Gear.  For anyone who has played the original, the story is unchanged.  Every plot twist, every original guard, every original boss is still there.The gameplay this time around has been very much improved from the original game.  Snake can now perform more tasks than he could in the original game.  Anyone who has played Metal Gear Solid 2 knows exactly what to expect.  Snake can now hang over ledges, hold up guards and shake them down for items.  Likewise, Snake now has to hide bodies when he kills someone.  The guards are also smarter in this version and do things such as make status reports, and will hear more too.You'd think all this would add much more challenge to the game, but since they also threw in the M9 and PSG1-T (both weapons put guards to sleep) the game is much easier.  Since you can now hide in lockers and hang over ledges, the challenge presented from the original game has been taken out.  Also, your life guage now starts out full.  In the original you had to defeat bosses for your gauge to extend.  This alone, makes the game several times easier.  Not only that, but you take a lot less damage than the original game.  A lot of the gameplay additions and changes make what was already an easy game even easier, and that's rather sad.Not all the changes are fantastic, however.  The voice acting here is far worse than the original game.  The original Metal Gear Solid had some of the best voice acting ever in a video game.  They've brought back the original voice cast, but they're not full of as much energy and emotion and some of them just sound different.  Any character that originally had an accent doesn't have one anymore.Then there are the cutscenes.  All of the cutscenes have, like the voices, been redone.  Not all are for the better, however. They look good and sound good, for the most part, but they lack the emotion of other Metal Gear Solid games.  Metal Gear Solid has usually been a game series grounded in reality, but here even for a video game, the cutscenes are just all out unbelievable.  In other words, fantastic storytelling is sacrificed for the premise of making cutscenes that look \"cool\".  This includes putting in things like bullet time pauses and making Snake do things that he would otherwise be incapable of doing because of what the story has set up such as being able to jump off a missile and hurling it back to his enemy.  Some of the dialog has also been changed, but for the most part it doesn't hurt the game.  Though some of the more memorable scenes have been tampered with.The music has also been changed.  For the most part most of the new tunes sound really good.  Some of the music is remixed, but it sounds better than it did before.  Each boss also has his or her own boss fight music.  While most of the new stuff is forgettable, it's not bad by any means. Some will definitely miss the classic tunes like the boss fight theme, but there is a lot of good music here.Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes is a good game, but messes too much with something good to try to make something better.  It doesn't succeed because it tries too hard to do so.The Good+AMAZING GRPAHICS+New and improved gameplay+Same classic storyThe Bad-Clunky controls-Far easier than the original-The cutscenes have lost their emotion-The voice acting is changed for the worst","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2005"}
{"product_name":"B003171CEW","reviewerName":"Robert T.","summary":"Great game with some design flaws","reviewText":"Overall, this game is great. This game is a blast. I love it. That said, it can be one of the most frustrating games you'll ever play. Just a few points to make on the more frustrating elements. Yes, hitting comes with a very steep learning curve. It has taken me approximately 25 full games played to really get a handle on the hitting. Now I strike out 3-4 times per game instead of 18-20 times per game. Hitting is tough to learn, but you will learn it and the challenge of hitting actually becomes part of the fun as a result. That said, the physics of the baseball itself are ridiculous. Any time the ball hits the outfield wall, it takes an unpredictable bounce with all the force of a cannon. It's like you're trying to run down one of those small rubber bouncy-balls, and can kill you if you're closing in right before it hits the wall and bounces with lightning speed in an unexpected direction. If that happens, the hitter's already got a triple. If the physics were more accurate here, fielding would be less frustrating. Also, keep track of your pitcher's level of energy. When it gets low, the opponent can score 3-4 runs on you in as many swings. That seems a bit ridiculous too. All in all though, great game.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0000488VP","description":"If you think it's hard to flag down a cab in a big city, try driving one in Sega's zany straight-from-the-arcade port ofCrazy Taxi. If you're one of the teeming fans who eagerly playedCrazy  Taxiin the arcade at a buck a pop, then this game is a must-buy, if only from a purely economic  standpoint. Even those who don't know the difference betweenCrazy Taxiand the long-running  TV seriesTaxiwill immediately recognize the appeal of this game. In fact, this game is so  impressive and addictive that it should easily convince a whole new wave of buyers to purchase a Sega  Dreamcast.What's so hot aboutCrazy Taxi? For starters, the graphics sport the most impressive re-creation of  a living city ever seen in a video game. The level of detail is astounding and never ceases to surprise the  player as block after unique block speeds by. The city is a distilled version of San Francisco with some  landmarks and neighborhoods left intact. Making it seem all the more real are apparent product placements  of real-world retail locations such as KFC, Tower Records, and Pizza Hut. And just about everything you  see on the screen is interactive: boxes, phone booths, and mailboxes topple when bumped or smashed,  pedestrians leap and tumble out of your path, and the myriad of traffic attempts to avoid your erratic  high-speed antics. While some driving games brag about a lack of boundaries, this one delivers--players  drive on the ocean floor, off the second floor of a parking garage, through parks, and down stairs. A helpful  hovering arrow points drivers in the correct direction, but you can truly drive wherever you want at any  time, making for tons of replay value.While the game is a direct port from the arcade game of the same name, there's plenty more depth in the  home version. In addition to the city that appears in the coin-op version, the Dreamcast version also  includes an entirely new city.Crazy Taxiincludes a trunk-load of mini-games that help to teach  drivers how to perform the special speed boosts and maneuvers in the game.Though this game would be plenty exciting without any sounds at all, it has an adrenaline-pumping  soundtrack supplied by punk crossover bands the Offspring and Bad Religion, as well as some good, if  sometimes monotonous, dialogue between the driver and the passengers.--Jeff YoungPros:Wonderful, realistic graphicsEasy to get into, and full of many long hours of addictive playEven more to offer than the fantastic arcade game upon which this is basedCons:On very few occasions players will encounter some graphic slowdown","reviewerName":"drqshadow","summary":"Intense, adrenaline-pumping fun","reviewText":"As one of the big ticket titles for the fledgling Dreamcast, Sega's final venture into the home console market, this game needed to replicate and improve upon the quality established by its arcade counterpart. Naturally, die-hard fans of the arcade machine would flock to a home release, regardless of quality, to save themselves a bundle on quarters... but the real trick was capturing the hearts and minds of the home market. Crazy Taxi's arcade release came near the very end of the out-of-home market's lifespan. Like it or not, gamers just weren't leaving home with as many tokens in their pockets as they had in the decades beforehand. Sega had captured the arcade market with this imaginative gem, but they'd only reached a dwindling fraction of the gaming market. To really consider Taxi (and the early quarter of the Dreamcast's life) a success, they needed a grand slam here.As with any good arcade title, there's no lengthy, thought-provoking back story to the world of Crazy Taxi. It's instantly accessible, mindless fun. After ten minute of gameplay, you feel like an old pro. You could take a wild guess about the premise just by looking at the CD jacket and get 90% of it correct. OK, get this... you're a TAXI driver.... who is rewarded for driving all CRAZY-like... and your only purpose in life is to earn more money. End of story.As seems to be the case with any arcade game, the physics of CT have been mussed with just a teensy bit, aiding in the transformation of a taxi driver's day from monotonous, mundane errands to wild, exciting rides. Your car will never sustain any damage, nor will those of the game's various citizens. Instead, vehicles bounce off of one another, roll over and sail through the air like so many cartoony bumper cars. The lack of any real visible consequences for your actions (aside from the obvious loss of game time) really help to set a player's mind at ease and let the relaxation set in. Sure, you're rushing around the city like a madman... but at least you're at ease in doing so.A new addition to the home release of the Taxi is the refreshing &quot;Crazy Box&quot; mode, which takes the tweaked physics engine of the regular game and applies it to other varied driving games. You'll drive down a bowling alley, complete with oversized pins. You'll cruise down a skier's long jump ramp and sail off the edge. You'll navigate a teeny stretch of road, complete with sharp turns, instant death on either side and a relentless time limit. It's a great way to introduce new players to some of the more advanced methods of game play, while giving experienced players a set of new challenges and a chance to brush up on their abilities. It's exactly what the home release needed to set it apart from its arcade cousin and to intrigue the more demanding home market.In addition to an easily established (and notably improved) premise, the control scheme on my familiar white Dreamcast controller is damned close to perfection. The number of commands necessary to play a game of Taxi are relatively small: you just need to steer, accelerate, brake and shift. The Dreamcast pad, however, functions as though it were sculpted with this very game in mind. The left and right triggers are your brake and gas, respectively, and are pressure sensitive, which means you have much more control over your pedals. The analog stick is a flawless de facto steering wheel, to the point that I can't imagine controlling the game with a regular wheel any more. Likewise, the &quot;A&quot; button switches you to reverse and the &quot;B&quot; button guns it back into drive... both buttons placed logically in the exact spot where your thumb should be while holding down the right trigger. This placement makes shifting, accelerating and the various advanced play mechanics introduced in &quot;Crazy Box&quot; much more natural and easy to accomplish.Visually, there's no distinguishing the game from its arcade counterpart. They're honestly identical, which was really a big feather in the Dreamcast's cap at the time of the game's release. In today's world, alongside graphical masterpieces such as Gran Turismo 4 and Project Gotham Racing 2, it doesn't stand a chance, but at the time it was really inspiring to see. Each of the four selectable drivers are well crafted and easily recognizable, even in the heat of a tight deadline. They each cruise around in their own original cab, styled to match their personality and come fully equipped with their own custom license plate. There's a good selection of different models out on the roads,  but I'd be lying if I said you'll never see a duplicate out on the road. They're all pretty abundant, but there's enough variety that you won't be distracted by the same car lined up, bumper to bumper, all the way down the road.Finally, the audio... which is just completely over the top. Seriously, the amount of effort that went into acquiring, licensing, writing, recording, mastering and implementing the various audio aspects of Crazy Taxi is just mind-blowing. Everything from the musical score (provided by The Offspring and Bad Religion, respectively) to the driver / passenger voices and interactions (which vary depending on the individual) to the sound of oncoming traffic, rubber on asphalt and screaming civilians is spot on. The speedy, racing mainstream punk rock soundtrack perfectly accompanies the rushed, frantic pace of the game itself. Absolutely flawless.In short, Crazy Taxi was everything Sega needed to re-establish themselves in the home market. It's a superb experience, whether you're playing alone at home on a Friday night or taking turns with a large group of friends. Where it's lacking in depth, it makes up with replayability and a tight control scheme. If you've got a Dreamcast sitting around at home and you haven't picked this game up yet, now is most certainly the time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2004"}

SOCOM this is NOT!!!!OK, for the record, I miss the old SOCOM format...REALLY, I do! And for Zipper Interactive to release this game, the way it is, is just wrong!And before you guys start bashing me, play it first, and then take a moment, step back, and ask yourself, \"is this really SOCOM???\"I mean, why even make this game? There's a thousand run-n-gun type military games out there...Too many to list, actually. The original Socom format really had something different. There were NO GAMES like them! So, what does THIS GAME bring to the table, that the other shooters do not?????  NOTHING!I don't know where to start, and I'm just gonna be all over the place, as things make me angry....but, here goes:This game is basically run, get shot at, run, get shot at, get shot at some more, and get shot at some more. If you think I'm kidding, try the game yourself!The original SOCOM series was intense, strategic, organic, you could use a headset to use voice commands, use your teammates to help complete missions, use team mates to overwatch, command teammates to do all sorts of stuff...the original SOCOM games had SO MUCH to offer...this game????....NOTHING!!! All this cool stuff that the original SOCOM games had, is all GONE! Sure, OK, the graphics are awesome! OK? And sure, it's got a BUNCH of shooting in it...OK? but, so do a million other games out there, and graphics & shooting only goes so far. If you're looking for the old SOCOM here....well, you can forget it. The original magic of SOCOM, is forever gone.In this game, you can forget about shooting bad guys at 300yds, and staying hidden for a while. OH NO, NOT IN THIS GAME!!! You shoot ONE TIME, ONE ROUND, WITH A SILENCED SNIPER RIFLE, and 4 million rounds just seem to find you and rain down upon you like hellfire...Tanks, rockets, bullets, grenades, missiles...everything!!! Come on???...really??? Whether you're hidden or not...EVERY ROUND & BULLET just magically finds you, instantly. Hide behind a rock...YUP, you guessed it, bullets hit you!!! This is a joke!You can't even climb ladders in this game! So, your ability to snipe from high vantage points, is gone! Not that it would matter anyway.Another thing.....Why do you have to complete the game for better scopes & weapons? I'm sure the real Navy Seals have to do this in real life! So, I have to complete the game to get a better sniper scope??? COME ON???!!!!! What kinda crap is this????In a firefight, bullets come from EVERY ANGLE! You can hide behind whatever you want (Rocks, cars, trucks, WALLS), and, you guessed it! Bullets, rockets, grenades...etc...just all seem to hit you! People just appear from out of nowhere, and BAM! You're dead! It's actually laughable.No voice commands, no strategy, no stealth, no night-vision, no missions (to speak of), no sniper shots from afar, no decent choice of weapons, no nuthin'! Just come up on bad guys & tanks, and start shootin' like mad, because that's all the game will allow you to do. Don't bother trying to hide, either...COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME!Now, before I get flamed, and called names, yes, there are 2-3 levels in this game, in which you have to be stealthy....but, it's a joke. Shoot one guy, and once again, you either fail a mission, or get trampled by 30 guys at once with assault rifles. Hell, I've played ATARI 2600 games better than this.This game is just like every other military shooter out there, MOH, COD, whatever! (Just not as good)....It just left a bad taste in my mouth, after being a HUGE SOCOM fan since day one. It's a real bummer to play this.....The original SOCOM games (1, 2 & 3) really made the player feel like they were actually IN the game, and actually hiding in the bushes & shrubs. Not here.Bottom line: I don't care what ANY reviewer says, this game sucks! PERIOD! It's a cheap, unrealistic, generic shooter, with a SOCOM label on it.So, here's my PRO & CON list.....are you ready?PROS:Guns.....CONS:Just about everything else....Am I being too harsh? No, I honestly don't think so. And the general public shouldn't accept this. Considering all the cool things that the original SOCOM games offered, I'm actually being too easy on the game, and the folks at Zipper Interactive!So, to all you folks at Zipper Interactive, I ask you:\"Is THIS the BEST you guys could come up with????? If so, then I'll buy another PS2, and start playing the old SOCOM games again.\"&lt;sigh>......","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2011"}

Killzone 3 is that game when played with the MOVE/Navigation controller/Sharpshooter set-up. There is quite a learning curve but once you dial in your settings it's very realistic and intense gaming to play a shooter like Killzone 3 with a gun controller like the SS. It seems that you need to recalibrate often but since the SS was meant to be used in a \"shoot from the hip\" style the calibration doesn't have to be accurate like older light gun games. I do hope that future games can better use the SS with more accuracy regarding the aiming. The Sharp Shooter is a high quality plastic build. Pump action reload, or tap the bottom of the clip reload is nice. Switch for fire mode is great too... extendable stock and just they way you attach the navigation controller and Move is well though out. It comes with decals for Killzone ISA and Helgast, plus decals for Socom if you choose to stick them on the SS. No real cons to this gun controller except maybe waiting for developers to make games based around it's function.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2011"}

In scenario play I think the balance between AI civs attacking each other and attacking the human is much better.  Also, at the lower difficulty levels the AI is in general less aggressive so it is somewhat easier to defend against those civs that happen at any given time to be at war with you.In the standard game at deity level however AI civs seem able to devote all resources to building military units, with very little or possibly without any risk of being destroyed themselves - just the occassional cultural flip or loss of v. new/weak city.  Additionally when you use diplomacy to pay for one AI civ to attach another there seems to be very little payoff in terms of the two civs being weakened by their battle and peace always occurs as soon as the turns you have paid for are complete.  And finally in close games the other AI civs (that presumably have the same level of overall status info as the human) never manage to defeat the leading AI civ in order to thwart their technological victory.I also suspect the AI cheats (or has \"bugs\" in their favor).  When you end up taking over cities from civs that have been throwing wave after wave of armies at you or are challenging you in the space race and find only +10 production and no harbor, no courthouse, no library etc it is very hard to imagine how the AI civ reached that same level using the same rules as the human.  Also I have seen a number of times where AI armies seem able to disembark from a ship and attack in the same turn.So overall I give three stars, 4 stars for fun.  It is a very fun game to master, but considering the potential number of possibilities for matching different civs against each other, different potential diplomatic approaches, and very poor online experience, once \"mastered\" I found the frustration level increasing, and the opportunity to develop reliable new approaches for winning at the higher levels limited.[Added 18-Nov-08: Needs an \"undo\" function.  At early critical stages a fat-fingered x vs o can leave unprotected settlers or seige units, and there seems absolutely no way to undo.  Combined with a somewhat tedious save game sequence this tends to wreck some interesting games unnecessarily.  Also multiple turn moves should cancel if/when obstacles are encountered rather than continue in circles or take silly avoidance routes]","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2008"}

Whitehead \"Werthead\"","summary":"An excellent SF RPG, let down only by dodgy boss fights","reviewText":"Detroit, 2027. The human race is changing, with nanotech research and cybernetics technology making 'augmented' humans stronger, faster and smarter than their 'normal' forebears. Numerous groups are opposed to augmentation on ethical and religious grounds. Adam Jensen, chief of security at Sarif Industries, one of the leaders in augmentation research, is severely wounded when terrorists attack and destroy one of Sarif's labs. Saved by augmentation, Adam must investigate the attack, discover the motives of those seeking to destroy Sarif Industries and, ultimately, decided which side of the argument is the 'right' one.Human Revolution is the third game in the Deus Ex franchise, serving as a prequel to the events of the original Deus Ex and its lacklustre sequel, Invisible War. Set twenty-five years before the first game, Human Revolution helps show how that world of nanotech and enhanced humans came into existence. As a prequel, Human Revolution requires no existing knowledge of the earlier games and makes an ideal jumping-on point for new players.Contrary to screenshots which suggest that it's a FPS, Human Revolution is a science fiction roleplaying game played from a first-person perspective. The game is built around the idea that though there is a central narrative the player must follow (this isn't an open-world SF RPG like Fallout 3), the player has tremendous freedom in how he or she follows that narrative. The game has a robust combat system which will satisfy those who like shooting things, but it also has a solid stealth mechanic for those who prefer sneaking around in the shadows (or, more often, inexplicably large air ducts). The game also has a hacking system so players can also hack into computer networks and turn automatic defences against enemy forces. Even within a particular play style, there is flexibility, with the ability to stun or knock out opponents rather than killing them being a particularly welcome feature (and the game has achievements for those who complete the game without killing anyone). Most players will probably mix and match styles as the mood takes them, or depending on the mission.Deus Ex was infamous for its tremendous flexibility and freedom, adapting its storyline to cater for the player deciding to kill off major NPCs on a whim and letting them simply escape from tough bosses rather than being forced into difficult battles (especially if they were not built for combat). Human Revolution isn't quite as liberal in its approach to gameplay, most notably due to the four tough and unavoidable boss fights which have been commonly and frequently criticised. In a game which enjoys giving you different options in almost every circumstance, being forced into situations where you have to break out the heavy artillery is annoying, especially if you've been upgrading your character for say stealth or hacking and are not optimised for combat.However, this is the only major criticism I can level at the game. In almost every other arena, Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a triumph. The game has a fantastic atmosphere and sense of place, backed up by an absolutely superb soundtrack and carried through some top-notch writing. Deus Ex is one of the most critically-acclaimed games of all time, and there were doubts that Human Revolution could live up to that precedent. These doubts have been laid to rest. The game is more than worthy of its illustrious heritage, and deserves plaudits for its clever design. It employs regenerating health and a cover system, two features of modern FPS games which are often groan-inducing and tiresome (is there a company somewhere that specialises in building chest-high walls and inexplicably littering them over levels?), but Human Revolution takes ownership of them. The regenerating health is justified as a force-shield, whilst the cover system (well-implemented as these things go) does double time as a tactical combat mechanic, allowing your character to move around whilst suppressed, rolling from cover to cover, firing blindly and finding sniper vantage points. Actually, the cover system pulls triple duty as a stealth mechanic in non-combat situations as well.The game has a lot to say about the rights and wrongs of cybernetics, augmentation and the power of corporations and governments, but tries not to get preachy. As the game progresses, your character can develop his own opinion on matters, informed by the events he's experienced and the choices he's made, and the multiple endings (there are four radically different resolutions, each with three different endings based on your character's actions earlier in the game, meaning a total of twelve possible outcomes) can see him reaching very different conclusions. Whilst you can't create your own character, you can certainly develop him in more depth than in most CRPGs. This is helped by an excellent 'dramatic conversation' mechanic where you must argue with a major NPC over an important topic, trying to convince them to help you or surrender without the need for violence. Major plot revelations crop up in these conversations. However, it's odd that there aren't more of these (there's only three or four in the game), as in their own way they are more critical to the game than the tedious boss fights.The game's central storyline is gripping, tightly-written and populated with memorable, well-acted and flawed characters. However, the game has two large hub areas (in Detroit and Heng Sha) where you can wander off from the main story for a while and pursue some side-quests. A couple of these side-quests are extensive, taking a couple of hours apiece to complete, and are a great opportunity to gain additional XP and increase your character's skills and augments. These hub areas are rich in incidental detail and flavour (overhearing citizens discussing the news stories of the day, being offered food from stall-owners etc), but arguably there's little to do in them outside of the (relatively few, for the size of these areas) quests and buying some equipment and weapons from a few vendors. A bit more going on in each zone would have expanded the play-time (which at 25 hours is reasonable but not particularly notable for an RPG) and made the game a little richer. Also, the game rarely strays far from the traditional FPS paradigm of having most of its actions set indoors in successions of corridors and offices. A little more variety in locations (perhaps more outdoor opportunities for stealth or combat) would have been nice.These kind of complaints are very minor. In a world of increasingly bland and 'safe' first-person shooters, Deus Ex: Human Revolution (****) stands out with its strong writing, well-defined characterisation and its refreshingly open approach to freedom and choice, whilst having compelling action sequences as well. It's one of the strongest RPGs, and indeed games overall, of the last couple of years and is well worth a look.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00008URUF","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Still as fun as it was in 1994","reviewText":"Donkey Kong Country was a revolutionary game on the SNES.  In 1994 it was one of the first games to use 3-D characters and 3-D backgrounds in an environment.  This single aspect alone about Donkey Kong still amazes some gamers who played it back in 1994. Unfortunately, in it's re-release it isn't nearly as good as it was nearly ten years ago.While the graphics were revolutionary then, they're not now.  The 3-D graphics are amazing on the GBA without a doubt, but they look a lot better on the SNES.  Some areas of the game look a little grainy and others don't stand out.  Plus the GBA has a bit of a pixel problem so some things look blurry.  That's not the worst part about the graphics. If you own a GBA SP there will be moments where you'll need to turn off the backlight because it'll simply be too bright to make out some things.  Other times there's too little light.  So while they were good on the SNES on the GBA they don't look nearly as visually striking since they're a little grainy and blurry now.The gameplay of DKC is great! Very similar to the classic Mario games.  You can jump on enemies and they die just like in Mario.  You can hurl barrels at enemies and bounce off tires.  What was really great about the game were the vast amount of secrets!  So many hidden bonus rooms and such that you had to find in this game.What's also nice is how we can come to enjoy our animal buddies and the kong family.  Finding your animals buddies is fun.  You find them in crates and then you can ride them around.  Each animal can do something different, others can be useless.DKC doesn't really have any sort of \"Power Up\" item or anything like that.  Instead you play as Donkey Kong and Diddy.  When one falls the other takes his place.  Each as their own strength and weakness and with no surprise it's the opposite of each other. Diddy is fast but weak and Donkey is strong but slow.  You can only gain your ally by finding him in a barrel.What's baffling about the gameplay is how the screen is.  Parts at the bottom seem cut off and it really is a con if you're looking to land on a platform below but you can't see it.  Some deaths I could've avoided if I just knew where the platform I was supposed to land on was.The story of this game is not very complex or anything.  King K. Rool has stolen DK's Bananas and has left a trail of them.  You're job is to find those bananas and defeat King. K. Rool.  What I find odd is that the banana trail represents the coins you gather in Mario.  Once you reach 100 bananas you gain an extra life.Now for the extras that Nintendo has thrown in for us.  For starters you can do more in the game by collecting photos to add to your findings, and play mini games with Candy Kong and Funky Kong, which results in obtaining more pictures.  Candy Kong has a dancing Mini-game and Funky Kong has a fishing Mini-game which really are nothing special and you'll quickly grow tired of them.  Also, once you complete a level you can do it again in a time trial to get a good time and later break your record.Then there's when you complete at least 90 percent of the game.  Do this and you'll be able to play a much harder version of the game in which there are no barrels to get a partner from, you're only one character.  These extras aren't anything special to me.If you played the original SNES version of this game you'll love it! Even if you played the SNES version to death and did EVERYTHING you'll still love it.  If you're new to DKC then its basically a love/hate thing. Be warned those who owned the SNES version, the difficulty level of this game has been brought down a lot and it's very simple.  Still, it's worth owning.  The only question I have are when is DKC2 being re-released?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2003"}
{"product_name":"B002I0KOSI","description":"","reviewerName":"Da Jester","summary":"Just Shy of Perfection, but Unforgettable in a very Positive Way.","reviewText":"I could make this review be an in-depth observation from one video gamer tall-telling the stupendous release from Irrational Games, known as Bioshock Infinite. But ultimately, I just want to elaborate that this is a game that one simply cannot explain in detail unless you play it. Adam Sessler's review from his youtube page spoke the utter truth. [...]Pick this title up, because I strongly beleive once you have played it, you will never forget it.Shot positive review: What the player will expect for another AAA title from Irrational games is more Bioshock gameplay that does set it apart from the previous installments. At some points it's better, then some points it feels like something was missing. There was one strong detail has not come up in most reviews though! Bioshock Infinite is like playing Halo. not that it made it good because of this, but more like comical when I realized this. You have a shield, that you can actually upgrade, but it does recharge. Once again, you can only carry two weapons (so far anyway) at a time. And last but not least, Elizabeth is like Cortana, but more she and Alyx Vance from Half Life 2 had a 1900s baby. She's VERY useful, interesting and NEVER GETS IN THE WAY. I'm pretty sure that I have not seen anything this flawless for buddy AI since Half Life 2.See, DICE, this is how you $%&#ing script AI for first person Shooters. Like Elizabeth, the protagonist you play as is also interesting with the meets more than what you are told kind of way. And let's not forget the main actor in this theater of American Zealotry: The floating city of Columbia. It...is...beautiful. Almost too bloomish with the lighting, but never a dull moment within her. Yadda Yadda Yadda, you know what, just play the game right now then come back to finish reading this review.*Now, this next section I must implore the reader to divert your eyes away if you do not want anything slightly spoiled, because the following pertains to why I only gave this game a 4 out of 5. Why are you even reading this? PLAY IT, DARN YOU! Anwway...YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.The previous installment to the \"Shock\" franchise did have a couple of gameplay features that I actually enjoyed. The first departed element are the big bad monster fights or encounters. In Bioshock 1 and 2, there were wandering monsters or something that you had to fight to either gain passageway or to become more powerful. This mechanic added to its difficulty curve and I loved it. There really is nothing of that here. Bioshock Infinite on normal difficulty was the easiest out of the three. 14 hours I played total of this game and it was 9 hours in when I died for stupidity. I was actually upset for the final confrontation to be just a slaughter the minions against time scenario or \"horde mode.\" It had a wince of challenge, but nothing as memorable as throwing my controller up in triumph as I defeated Fontaine in Bioshock 1. Also, I missed the idea of fighting big baddies that had different variants. When playing you think the dreaded Songbird is going to be it....it doesn't. It's still a surprised, but I was let down because I wanted to fight something bossish in the damn game! If the Handymen were it, they were more annoying than epic and memorable as a Big Daddy.The second departure is a notion of choice for the game's long conclusion. In Bioshock 1 and 2, depending on what you did or how much you did on a certain subject resulted with one of two possibilities. The player was rewarded with either the tear jerking happy result, or the awful bad ending. Well, from what I read on Wikipedia and what I received from playing, it seems that there is only one ending or outcome to Bioshock Infinite's  story. During my play through I wasn't even sure if there were anything within that was labeled a \"choice that matters\" situation. The ending  is of course hard to explain unless you play it yourself. After the two more positive emotional parts it then becomes, not exactly like, but reminiscent of Inception's  ending. Was this intentional from Irrational? Probably so because it was very unforgettable. I just wished there could have been something more.*But in all, is it worth paying to experience Bioshock Infinite? (insert DUH! noise) What this game does seem to lack of what I loved in Bioshock 1, it completely makes up for it with the  engrossing atmosphere, spectacular AI interactions, political and religious themes, hectic enemy encounters, erratic and awesome sounds, and an unforgettable story. I think the only people that might have issues with this are the pro gamer First Person shooter fanatics. This game is meant to pull you in for the ride and not rushed for just achievements. Bioshock Infinite is another example of how a good example player first person shooter can be without an unneeded tacked on multiplayer. After this, I look forward to whatever Irrational Games can come up with.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

I was not too found of the boss battles and the last one is particularly cheesy, no matter how good you are if you don't happen to get the right notes you can't win.

{"product_name":"B001TOQ8X4","reviewerName":"Nathaniel V. Graham","summary":"Bad but no monthly fee.","reviewText":"Although they have done a lot to improve the game since launch, it has many lingering issues that are hard to overlook. Basic functions that all triple A MMOs have are strangely missing from Guild Wars 2. You cannot /follow another player. There is no way to list who is playing in a particular zone. You cannot even simply hand someone an item (you must mail it to them). You can't inspect someone's gear to see what they have. There is no LFG system to find groups, or automatic dungeon finders, or even a global channel to chat.I've been playing MMOs since Everquest 1, and this is far the \"grindiest\" mmo I've ever played or heard of. Just about everything you want to accomplish is done by doing some mundane task hundreds if not thousands of times. Lets say you want to get a best in slot ring. The only way to get this is by doing one certain 5-man dungeon (fractals of the mists). In most MMOs you would do the dungeon and get the ring, or at least have a chance of getting it. Not in GW2. To get the ring you must first do the dungeon nine times, this enables you to receive \"level 10 rewards\". Then once you are level 10, you must do the dungeon once per day for your \"fractals daily\", which will give you a token. Save up 10 of these tokens, and finally you can trade it in for a ring. This means you have to do the same dungeon 18 times over the course of at least 10 days to get a reward.Another massive problem the game has is class balancing. They seem to not care that certain classes are incredibly powerful, where others are almost useless. If you decide to buy this game, do yourself a favor and make a warrior. As people stand around the main city spamming to form groups, the most common thing you'll see is the words \"warriors only\", because they blow away every other class as far as dps is concerned. The ideal group composition is four warriors and a mesmer (who is able to haste the group) to make the warriors do even more damage. Five warriors is almost as good.The fact the game has no monthly fee is a huge plus, and probably why it wasn't another \"3 monther\". The graphics are pretty and the music is pretty good. Without more improvements this is a 2 star product.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2012"}

Fig.","summary":"If You Own A Vita, You Gotta Have This Game.","reviewText":"Whether you are new to the world of Lumines or a veteran, this is a game that you should have in your library. Once again, Ubisoft, Q? and Rocket Studios have set the bar for action/puzzle games in this genre. From the gorgeous, fluid graphics to the awesome soundtrack, this game will keep you occupied for hours; it is an addictive, fun experience. Music ranges from electronica to old school like The Pet Shop Boys. You control blocks of colour to form a group of four of the same to clear that block; as the game progresses, so does the speed of the blocks, let it reach the top of the screen and game over. Each level looks different, the blocks are different shapes and colours, adding to the challenge, each level also has different skins and music. I only wish I could buy the soundtrack, it is that good.There's different game modes, including, Master, Duel, Stopwatch and Playlist. The main game mode is called Voyage, where you basically go through numerous different levels unlocking skins, avatars (in game avatars) which have powers once applied and of course ranks; once you clear a level, you can come back and play it without having to go through the whole bunch.Think of Lumines as Tetris grand grand grand child, well, more like Tetris on acid to be honest lol, a much more modern, better looking, faster paced, extremely fun, challenging, musical and graphical gem of a game and a MUST have for any Vita owner.

Insane driving and stunts and the chance to pilot the fastest hovercraft in the fleet proves that this isn't just a game that's set in the Matrix universe; it's an experience that's designed to be a true part of the entire Matrix mythos.

Also available for the Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Gamecube, and Windows PC.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"So Much Potential, So Many Issues","reviewText":"Let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of the Matrix. I grew up on Philip K. Dick novels, and the whole Matrix concept is one I've always loved. I thought the movie's plot, characters and special effects were great. Also, I'm a big fan of Splinter Cell and played it many times. I've always loved the Bond style games where you work your way through a level, finding objectives and taking out the bad guys.So while I really, really wanted to be blown away by Enter the Matrix, I just wasn't. It was a GOOD game, but not nearly as good as it should have been - not nearly as good as many other games that are out right now. I almost wonder if they rushed the game into production to match the timing of the movie, instead of finishing up some much-needed polishing.First, the good parts. It was directed by the Wachowski brothers and features the quite talented actors and actresses from the movies. It really ties in to the movie and sort of 'immerses' you in the experience. So that is quite neat. They do have Matrix-time \"focus\", much like in Dead to Rights, where you can temporarily slow time and do cool moves. Just like in Dead to Rights, it seems cool at first and is hardly used in actual gameplay.Gameplay is intriguing. You're given general objectives but then have to figure out how to get to them. So you're not exactly led by the nose. There are sometimes big rooms with lots of directions, lots of offices, lots of choices. Still, the game is about getting from Point A to Point B. I definitely miss Vice City's free-roam ability.I was pretty disappointed by the graphics. There are many other games out right now with truly STELLAR graphics, and this isn't one of them. Objects vanish from the screen. The rendering just isn't very good, compared to other games we play quite a bit. The physics models are a bit bizarre. People slide like hockey pucks across the floor. You can leap on some things but not on others, apparently at random.The sound has serious issues. My brand new CD right from the store started double-talking almost immediately in several scenes. Also, one of the hallmarks of a great game is that the sound is context sensitive - quiet and brooding at times, thundering at the exciting parts. But this game is ALWAYS thundering. It gets very monotonous after a while and completely destroys the atmosphere.The load time is incredibly long, and many missions are incredibly short. There are times that you almost load longer than you get to play that mission area! With the instant-reheal-totally, the instant-restart-10-seconds-ago and the lack of challenging enemies to fight, most of the game is a cakewalk.Add to that the quite annoying aspect that there are times that a door won't open until you kill all enemies in the room. So you go around and check the doors, but you have to slay everyone there before the \"special door\" will open up. Yes, some games use that technique. But this game in general is supposed to be a realistic adventure. In realistic adventures, doors don't sense when all enemies are dead and then spring open.AI, one of THE most important parts of any game, is spotty at best. Sometimes the guards hide behind cover. Sometimes they stand in the open when cover is right next door. I've had cases where a guard stood pointing a gun at a door even though I was right behind him, pounding the stuffing out of 2 of his friends. He didn't even turn around until I bashed him in the head.And finally, the camera is just plain annoying. Every friend I've had try this game says the same thing. They all play tons of adventure and action games. Somehow this game just does a bad job with positioning the camera anywhere useful.The game really had a great deal of potential and I think with another month or two in QA testing it could have shone. But there are many, many areas that appear to have gotten through in a \"good enough\" state instead of a \"ready for prime time\" state.Yes, I'll play the game. And yes, I'll see the movies many, many times and talk about them endlessly with my programmer / hacker friends. But I do feel let down that with all of the money and talent available to the Wachowski brothers, they didn't give this game the attention it merited. They focussed on the MOVIE aspect of the game, but not the GAME aspect.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2003"}

It makes playing games such as GT5-Prologue a lot more fun than playing them with the 'regular' PS3 controllers. For the more arcade-like games, I don't know. I see that my kids prefer the six-axis, probably because they are light and wireless.Let me list my biggest complains first:- WIRES: there's a wire from the wheel to the power brick, then a wire from the power brick to the electric outlet. Then, you have a wire from the pedals platform to the wheel body. Then, there's a wire from the wheel to the PS3. I wish that 2 of these were replaced by 'wireless'.- THE WHEEL BOOTUP: whenever you start your PS3 or your game, the wheel initializes itself but quickly turning right and left. The moves have so much force, they COULD injure a little kid's arm if it happened to be caught by the wheel moving.- GRIP TO TABLE: it's not TOO BAD but, from time to time, the wheel goes off whatever platform you attach it to.- GRIP TO FLOOR: there is some rough thing at the bottom that does prevent the pedals platform from slipping and moving but it's not perfect.What I appreciated the most:- CONTROL: it's perfect. It's well calibrated, balanced and precise.- RUMBLING/SHAKING/VIBRATING: this is AWESOME. On GT5 you can FEEL the road, you feel the bumps and you must fight the wheel when taking high speed turns.- OVERALL CONSTRUCTION: it feels solid, well-manufactured, durable.Things lacking that I don't miss but some might:- NO CLUTCH PEDAL: it's not there- THE STICK: shifting is not exactly imitating life. You basically move it up to move into a higher gear and down to go to the lower gear. That's it.Why do I give it 4 stars and no 3? BECAUSE IT'S FUN! Well worth the price - and it's coming from someone who tends to avoid Logitech stuff (long story).My next purchase should be one of them driving seats.

I know he's going to make millions of dollars off this game now, but I think he could of easily made millions more by making this game into a Star Wars movie.  When I was playing this game, I kept asking myself why wasn't this game made into a movie?  This game has I think one of the best story lines out of all of the Star Wars plots and it should of been made into a movie.  What was George Lucas thinking?The game itself is pretty awesome.  The graphics are great.  Using the Force and my light saber are a lot of fun. Actually I wasn't sure if I would like playing the game.  I'm used to playing FPS (First Person Shooters) and I like a weapon like a gun or a blaster in my hand.  But it turns out once I got used to the controls this game turned out to be pretty fun.It is so much fun to use the Force on different things especially Imperial Stormtroopers.  I can't tell you how many times I've used the Force to pick up a Stormtrooper and toss him up into the air and then watch him grab a nearby Stormtrooper and pull him up into the air too and then toss both of them across a room or across the sky. Sometimes I would pick up a Stormtrooper with the Force and toss him into a group of Stormtroopers who were standing behind him.  It sort of reminds me of bowling.  If I came to a door I couldn't open, I would use the Force to force it open then I would slide through the opening. I would also use the Force to toss objects at Stormtroopers or creatures that were in my way.All the great stuff from Star Wars is in this game.  There were so many parts of the game where I just had to just stop and look at the surrounding scenery with awe.  The music is just great throughout the game. It's typical Star Wars music.  There are so many cool creatures and so many different environments to look at throughout the game.I can already tell that the two new technologies, Digital Molecular Matter and euphoria combined with Havoc physics will definitely be used by a lot of new games in the future.I think this game is awesome.

Nintendo made this title with the casual gamer in mind to get the most attention and for the most part it pays off.Mario Kart lets you play through several game modes where you pick a character, pick a kart or motorcycles (new to the franchise), pick a stage (16 classic tracks from past MK titles and 16 brand new tracks) and then you race for 1st place against 11 other CPU racers. Along the way, you can pick up several power ups to help you or hinder your competition as well as multiple ledges to perform speed boosts. As you go through the single player mode, you start off at the lowest class (50 cc) and earn the right to unlock the 100 cc class (cars go faster) and the 150 cc (cars go the fastest.) Races take place in the form of \"Cups\" featuring tracks of various themes. Of course, Nintendo always pack in extra content waiting to be unlocked when you fulfill certain conditions. In the end you can unlock secret characters, karts and motorcycles. Anything you unlocked in the single player mode can be used in the online multiplayer modes, which is where you can race up to 11 other people from across the world. Win your races and you win rank points and improve your status online.The PROS: graphics, sounds and music. There are lots of characters to use. There are lots of karts, bikes and characters to unlock. The controls are very easy to use and you have a choice of Wiimote and Nunchuk, Classic Pro controller, Wii Wheel (included with game) or Gamcube controller as your means to control the game. 4 player support is available so you can play with your friends. Online multiplayer is fun and works (unlike the online multiplayer featured in Super Smash Bros Brawl.)The CONS: Remember when I said earlier the casual gamer can get into this game? It's because the overall difficulty of this game in general is low, EXCEPT for the cheap A.I. on the highest difficulty level. Racing in the 150 cc means dealing with the cheap, cheezy, rubber band A.I. of the CPU racers (very frustrating at times.) Some single player modes are not available in the multi-player modes. And yes, hackers have found a way to boost their stats and snag power ups without actually acquiring them so beware whenever you race online for any funny activity.I recommend this title because it is generally fun and anyone who plays it will keep on playing for years to come. I, myself, was never a fan of Mario Kart until I picked this one and I unlocked everything and still play it online. If you are looking for a fun racing game for the Wii, you can't go wrong with this one. ********HIGHLY RECOMMENDED********","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2011"}

This collection is valued at over $75.00 sold separately, and is perfect for entering the epic war between the races of Azeroth and the demonic Burning Legion.","reviewerName":"chaoslegion","summary":"Is this game a Game of the Year or what?!","reviewText":"In my opinion, this game is definitly a Game of the Year back in 2002 or 2003. This game is like the good old Starcraft; simple, quirky and FUN!!! This game is very easy to learn and not complicated unlike Blitzkrieg, Medieval, or Rise of Nations and it can be mastered within a month if you are already familiar with the Blizzard games.Requirements, like Blitzkrieg, is no problem. You can enjoy a single player with a Celeron 900mhz, 256mb ram, GeForce 2 MX400 (I have tried it on this PC) while the multiplayer needs a better rig such as Athlon XP 2000+, 512mb ram, GeForce 4 MX440, and at least a Cable or DSL (I have also tried on this PC) to play without any lags or any slowdowns. But speaking of lags, lags IS a big problem on Battle.net. Even though you have a good rig and a broadband, the opponent or an ally of yours might have the worst PC that you can ever think of but this is not very common.Multiplayer, is simply the best feature in this game. You can play many mods (you already know what those are) and play the multiplayer game itself. But more people plays mods and it's a good thing. Like myself, I like the original RTS multiplayer games but some might like mods better which gives more choices for people and raises the replay value.Finally, one word, a must have. Sorry, I meant three. Having to include a Game of the Year and its expansion, this Battle Chest is a must own. This game is one of the best that you can ever wish for but if you do not agree with me then you probably have never played the game before. (To make it simple, just think of it as  Starcraft with more maps, different units, and better graphics)P.S. But if you did played the game before and you don't agree wth me, you are out of your MIND!!!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-17-2004"}

Shimkus \"Movie Manji\"","summary":"Scary, very violent, and great 1 player game with lots of replay value","reviewText":"Dead Space 2 for the PS3 is a great game. I haven't even begun to play Extraction which comes with the game for free. It's taken me about a week to finish the game, and I have lots of great memories. As soon as I finished this game I started it again, eager to play with new suits and armour. The game carries over all your equipment and once you get to the first shop, it will all be waiting for you there.I am a big science fiction junky and this game did it for me. This is also a survival game, like the Resident Evil series. I had alot of fun going through the space station, although linear. The sounds were really scary in this game. Not sure I could have taken much more without having a heart attack. The sounds really made it intense. I have a home theatre set up, and I was always on edge as little sounds were all around me. When I was creeping down a dark hallway, with walls covered with blood, I could hear things not far off in the walls. Pounding, or even horrifying screaming. It was like a haunted house from hell! I wanted to put my hands over my ears or press mute sometimes. But even worse, was when you were hearing all this, and knew something was just around the corner, and then the lights go out! And all you have a is a little light on your gun.I played on regular difficulty and found it challenging and fun. Besides all the fun I had blowing off the limbs of monsters and then sticking them to the wall with their own claws, I had a lot of fun using my gravity beam to solve problems. You play as an Engineer, and he has to turn on gravity engines, and reroute energy, and figure out ways to open giant doors with little oxygen-like canisters of thrust. Sometimes you had to figure stuff like this out while running from monsters at the same time! I always had a great time doing it.The story was intense, and the characters were all great. I really wanted to find out if my guy was going to survive in the end, and I wanted to find out what was going in his crazy head! I never played the first game, but I never felt penalized for not playing it. I certainly think there are certain nods to the first that I have no bearing on. But there is an extra in the menu's that gives you some context. But I didn't read it. This game stands on its own. The backstory just makes it more mysterious for me.Dead Space 2 is an impressive game, that delivers a great science fiction, survival-horror, shooter game that is highly addictive. It has loads of extra content, including the game extraction, that was in itself an acclaimed game from Nintendo's Wii. It has lots of replay value, and once you beat the game, you want to jump right back into it. There is too much here to do in one play through. I'm deep into the second play through and I'm getting all kinds of new trophies. I just pinned a monster across a long hallway and got some awesome trophy for it! Great game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005QEFF","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"S.

This game actually reminded me of an interactive movie. **Spoilers** I thought it was really neat how they included a part in the game where you actually hang out with Jenny (girlfriend) at her apartment. It built her character in the game for the tragedy that occurs later. It was also neat how it actually included ghostly flashbacks from Jackie's childhood at the burned out orphanage. Good stuff...

Rarely has a game achieved so much hype, and as of late, any game that HAS been this hyped has been met with mixed reviews, or initial enthusiasm followed by general revile (cases in point: Assassin's Creed and GTA IV)so Killzone 2 has a whole lot to lose.Does Killzone 2 live up to the hype? In my opinion,it does. BUT: I firmly believe that all the hype all these months...all the expectations really did was detract from this game really shining out. The fact that this game has been in the public's eye for so long sort of puts a damper on its release, I think. But considering the game, whether or not the release is as successful as warranted by so much hype is really immaterial.-Graphics- this game looks awesome. Does it awe as much as it did a few years ago? Not really. Since then MGS4 came out, Gears 2 came out, Uncharted came out.... this game ranks up there with the best looking games, but it's not THE best looking game... that's really subjective, I think.... how good a game looks.-Sound- The music swells and epic tracks really surprised me on this one. It really got the job done to set the mood, but the voice acting was really, really bad on most parts. Some parts, like Scolar Visari and Radec were really well acted, but for the most part, awful; good thing the acting doesn't really detract from this game. The background noises I think are top notch, and I think they set a bar for other games with a lot of fighting and shooting going on in the background from now on.-Gameplay- The game feels tight; I still don't know what people are complaining about the controls feeling weird or floaty....then again, I'm already used to the Sony controller, so that might have something to do with it.... I do have my issues with the campaign gameplay: the game...freezes while saving/loading??? What? I know the game started being produced a while ago, but come on! Freezing? Then why not a 'Loading' screen? Because it's last gen, that's why. Freezing isn't that much better. The other thing would be the incredibly retarded AI. Allow me to specify: the ALLIED AI. The enemy AI is incredibly shrewd, and they cheat, hehehe. You'll be hard pressed to think before you rush any hallway. But your squad mates...boy....they sure die a lot. And then you have to revive them etc.... it gets annoying.  The campaign is pretty good, very fun, and so far, as far as length goes, it's longer than CoD4, so...it might be short (haven't finished it yet) but don't knock it because it's not RPG length. Either way, the MP will have you hooked. A lot of people have looked for a game to replace CoD4 as the mp fps par excellence.... and have been let down repeatedly. I think this game might be it. Although, truth be told, they are just two very different MP experiences....if I had to compare what it feels like to play KZ2 online, I would compare it to Warhawk before I compared it to CoD4. Plus, the classes  give KZ2  a depth the perks don't really achieve: with a perk, and unlocking guns, you can turn yourself into a tank, or be almost invisible, or be a demo expert etc....and you might run around with the P90 while some poor sap has the Mp5 because he's just starting out (the MP5 is a very good weapon, not knocking it  =P  ), but being a different class sort of puts everyone on the level. Since it's clan based, there's also a push for team work in every match you play...something that simply didn't ever happen for me in CoD4.- Storyline- Umm...what storyline?? Honestly, this game has all the storyline in the opening credits and towards the end. About 5-6 missions in the middle make you  go through the motions of killing stuff without any real plot point to justify it. It's really sad because the game DOES have a storyline...it's not the GREATEST storyline ever, but it's a fun one, kind of exciting....but it was paced horribly. Then again....if I had to compare this game to a movie...I'd compare it to either Rambo II or I dunno.. Starship Troopers. Both simply awful movies if you take into context cinema as an art form....but if you see them as what they are (namely, action flicks) then... what's there to complain?! Heck, all this game lacked was some sex and cigar smoking!Overall, this game will have me quite occupied in the coming months. It's funny too.... I hadn't bought into the hype until about 6 weeks before the game came out...I hadn't even thought much of the game.. \"just another FPS\". I'm glad I impulse 'pre-ordered' this little gem.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2009"}

It's brutal, dangerous, relentless, unpredictable and much more than a game -Motorstorm Pacific Riftis a way of life.","reviewerName":"R. Garrelts","summary":"Arcade Racing At It's Finest","reviewText":"MotorStorm Pacific Rift has roared it's way into stores in perhaps one of the most crowed points in gaming in recent memory. Huge titles like Resistance 2, Gears of War 2, Little Big Planet, Fable 2 and many others all released around the same time as MS:PR. Sadly because of poor timing many will probably delay purchasing this game or end up skipping it altogether. Don't be one of those people and miss out on a terrific game!MS:PR is a true sequel to the original breakout smash success. Capitalizing on all the experience from the first game, Evolution Studios returns with a bigger, better experience in MS:PR. Everything about the original MotorStorm has been improved, polished and soiled with mud.The game features a more varied landscape than the simple desert setting of the original MotorStorm. Now players can select from 16 levels broken across four zones: Earth, Water, Fire and Air. As you can guess from the names, each features tracks dealing with the respective element. Levels vary from lush tropical jungles to simmering calderas to edge of your seat racing on the lip of a mountainous course. The track designs are amazing and conducive to white knuckle racing the series is known for.Graphically few racing games shine as bright as MS:PR. Sure it may not be a photo realistic journey like GT5 Prologue. But then again GT5P doesn't have half the personality MS:PR has. The graphics in MS:PR are amazing. From levels which are both beautiful and grimy at the same time to detailed vehicles and impressive particle effects, the game has it covered.Speaking of vehicles, MS:PR maintains the selection of Motorcycles, ATVs, Buggies, Rally Cars, Racing Trucks, Mudpluggers, Trucks and adds Monster Trucks to the fold. Somehow Evolution has managed to maintain balance throughout the classes and a slow moving Monster Trucks can (if raced correctly) maintain and beat a rally car. The game just works.Major improvements to the single player offline mode feature a more diverse level set that spans 8 difficulty levels - or tickets as they're known in MotorStorm. As you progress through the tickets you'll unlock in game rewards such as vehicles paint schemes, driver skins and extras like concept drawings and behind the scenes movies. The game also fully takes advantage of Sony's trophy system and features 50 trophies to earn.Anyone who played the original MS will probably recall the soundtrack that featured bands like Queens of the Stone Age, Wolfmother and Monster Magnet. While somewhat limited in song count the songs in the game fit the gritty racing perfectly. MS:PR continues the hard rock trend the original set and thankfully expands the track listing. While I found the selection of songs to be good, I can't help but miss hearing classic songs from the original game.If I had to pick one element of MS:PR that is a bit disappointing I would pick the online racing portion. While certainly not bad, a few bad design choices keep the online mode from being great. The primary problem is that user options are extremely limited. You're allowed to select either a ranked or unranked match. After each race you're booted back out to the lobby to receive rank points and then have to select either a ranked or unranked match again. You can create a custom match and select your favorite tracks and vehicles, however, the matches are unranked and will not count toward your online rank. The online portion of the game is just a bit cumbersome and should give users the ability to create custom ranked races. To it's credit the game does implement a buddy system that will pair you with friends playing the game. Hopefully Evolution will hear the fans and patch the game to improve the online racing.All in all MS:PR is an excellent game and a must have for PS3 race fans!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2008"}

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"Michael Kerner \"Michael Kerner\"","summary":"Nintendo's Boxer Is Back, But Somewhat Down For The Count","reviewText":"There is no question about the fact that Nintendo right now is trying to bring in the success of video games to the casual games to the DSi and the Wii. While there are some who might feel very tired with the gaming turn that Nintendo has made within the past year, there are others that are getting a chance to play some really fun titles like Excitebots: Trick Racing and Mario Super Sluggers. But while that seems fine, Nintendo has decided to bring back some very strong titles on its virtual console for the Wii, and in the homes everywhere, that does include fighter games. With the success of Street Fighter 4 on the PS3 and Xbox 360 only, there just really isn't enough there for Wii owners. Well for them, it is a return of one of the most classic titles from Nintendo's NES era that is back with a punch. But is this absolutely a knockout, well not completely.Punch-Out! for the Nintendo Wii, brings back the enjoyment of Nintendo's original fighter Mac to a whole new generation of gamers. While it has been so long since Little Mac the boxer has been on a Nintendo game, fans have recently taken a new shine on him because of the original game being available on the Wii's Virtual Console. The gameplay brings in Mac to a whole new era of fans mostly well, but not definitively to capture the audience of fighting fans Nintendo has shown on the Wii with Super Smash Brothers Brawl. Still, Nintendo has shown to bring in the simplicity of the game as a whole to a new generation. As you fight your way to the championship belt, you'll tackle favorites from the original Punch-Out and Super Punch-Out eras like King Hippo, Von Kaiser, and many others. The graphics have been mastered noblely well, to bring in the classic feel from Nintendo's Puch-Out glory days, and the gameplay is a delight for hardcore fans.The control here is a bit mixed in the gameplay. While it works well for the classic fans, and of those who've loved Wii Sports, as you can choose to play the game, like you did from the early Punch-Out era, by holding the Wii-mote like the original NES controller, or using the Wii-mote and Nunchuck to bring the boxing appeal in well, like a pair of boxing gloves, using the balance board here from Wii Fit sadly doesn't give it your all here in the gameplay. Sadly that isn't the only disadvantage here. I was honestly a bit dissapointed that there could've been more in the multiplayer action too, like the ability to play against others online like other fighter games now like Street Fighter 4 and Super Smash Brothers showed well. That limitation doesn't completely show it as being as universal enough.All in all, with such a long absence from the eye of Nintendo's gaming library, Punch-Out!! isn't as definitive as it could've been for a comeback. Even Mario who was in the very original Punch-Out from 1987 would've been upset about this. So to be honest with you, if you're still hungary for a hard core fighting game for the Wii, stick with Super Smash Brothers Brawl instead.Graphics: B-Sound: B-Control: B for the Wii-Mote; B- for the Wii-mote & Nunchuck; C for the Wii Balance BoardFun & Enjoyment: C for solo players; C 1/2+ for multiplayerOverall: C+","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2009"}

Harrison \"The Sith\"","summary":"Decepticons Unite, All hail Megatron.","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of Transformers ever since G1, but I will keep this review unbiased as always.  I feel these reviews should be written to give the potential buyer a good overview of the game so he/she can make informed decisions.This game was very fun and has many cool features; however, it does have its flaws.  Transformers Armada (PS2) was probably the last good Transformers game, but this game is a lot better.  The story, the graphics, and the voiceovers are all excellent.  The combat system, friendly AI, and controls need some more polishing though.PROS: You really feel like a Transformer.  I remember a few times I was shooting at a guy as Megatron, then transformed into a tank and shot another guy, and quickly transformed back and melee attacked a third and it felt really cool to make your own combos like that.-Top notch graphics.-Great music score.-Cool weapons.-Big Boss Fights.CONS:  I have had a few encounters when I was trying to jump between platforms and my own guys bumped into me and knocked me off the edge to my death or bumped me into and exhaust flame.  At times the other two guys with you that are computer controlled tend to get in your way.  Additionally, I found myself trying to fight a wave of guys with no ammo and the melee attack was to slow and there was no ammo around.-At times the vehicle controls seem blocky and hard to control especially for the flying controls.-The melee combat system is almost non-existent.  On the DS version you can switch to melee weapons and throw a few strikes.  Why don't we see that here?-Not enough variety of cool weapons.-In some cases there is not enough ammo to be found during key battles.-I haven't tried the actual online multiplayer yet; however, I have started to \"create my character\".  Well there is not much to create.  You pick an already existing Transformer and just recolor it with a very limited color choice.  I really do not consider that to be a \"create a character.\"  Come on Activision, let me build my own robot!This is a great game, but if they come out with a sequel, I would recommend that they utilize a melee combat system like Batman: Arkum Asylum as that seems to have set the standard for melee combat, add a few more weapon systems, and make the AI a little more intelligent.In summary, I believe that this is an excellent game and I would definitely recommend it especially if you are a fan of Transformers.  Forget about the movie based Transformers games are they are garbage.  If you want more Transformers action and you have a backwards compatible PS3, try Transformers Armada.  It is not War for Cybertron, but it is still a pretty good game.Transformers","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-02-2010"}

{"product_name":"B0071NH8B8","description":"","reviewerName":"Facelord","summary":"Wonderful, not without its flaws","reviewText":"I've waited quite a while for this thing and I'm not even remotely disappointed; quite the contrary, I'm willing to overlook this thing's flaws and view it as the best game hardware to date.In terms of power, the thing is pretty much a PS3-lite. The analog sticks felt a little wobbly at first, now that I'm used to them I wouldn't have them any other way- I'm sure they're made that way to last long inside of pockets. The d-pad, on the other hand, is the single most comfortable and responsive d-pad I've ever used; if only I had gotten Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom to play with the d-pad in depth for hundreds of hours. The face buttons feel nice and responsive, they aren't hard on your thumbs after a long play session like the PSP's, plus they won't scratch anywhere near as easily. The 5-inch qHD OLED screen is amazing, so much more rich and vibrant than my $200 1080p monitor. The launch lineup is the best of any other game system in history, 26 games and around half are good enough for quality-spoiled, rich-tastes me. Multi-tasking with the Vita is so much more slick than you'd expect, it feels just magical. The UI didn't look all that nice in previews, but now that I have the thing in my hands I think it has the best UI of any handheld I've ever played by a mile- it's so entertaining to just flick stuff around and close programs by turning a page and multi-tasking is better than I ever would've imagined. This is also my first proper game system that gets achievements or trophies(besides my PC), and I have to say it really augments the experience in a positive way in each launch title I have, rewarding me for trying out all of a game's features and really sticking to my games; that's a subject for a different time, but I will say that synching trophies is fast and easy and that getting the trophy popups are even more rewarding than when they pop up on Steam.As I said in the title to this review, the Vita does have some notable flaws worth mentioning. From what I can tell you can't switch PSN accounts without a second memory card, that's a real killer for people like me who have two accounts loaded with games. Oh, speaking of memory cards, they're extremely expensive. Luckily if you only plan on buying games at retail you can't go wrong with an 8 or 16 GB memory card(included in this bundle is an 8 GB card, luckily, so there's nothing to worry about at the start). I was able to fit a few game demos, a few downloadable titles, some updates and some PSN videos onto my Vita and still had enough room for both seasons of Spectacular Spider-Man and some music- clearly I'm not hurting for space just yet. The web browser is fine for looking up game guides and things like that but apparently you can't yet look at Youtube videos or anything like that; as long as it eventually hits the Vita I'm fine, but it won't quite replace my PC as a complete entertainment hub any time soon. It totally sucks that you can't use the web browser while your game is minimized, but apparently Sony's working on an update to allow that so I guess I can wait a while to use online guides while in-game. Also, this is just exclusive to this bundle but apparently I have to wait for Super Stardust Delta to get it for free from AT&T; and can't just buy it now and give the code to a friend, this means I have to wait on the only downloadable game at launch I absolutely must have. :&lt;Setting up 3G was a bit of a hassle and it's definitely way too expensive for what it's worth, but I get Super Stardust Delta + its DLC along with two months of 3G service, so I pretty much just got a few months of free 3G. Heck, if you wanna get specific I only paid $15.10 for 3G service and Super Stardust Delta Complete would've cost more with tax, so I'm totally saving money on a purchase I would've made anyways. I recommend you go for this 3G Vita bundle over the Wifi one, if they remove the memory card and the free PSN game/month of service in future 3G bundles I'll leave you to decide whether or not future-proofing your Vita for when 3G isn't ridiculously overpriced and only comes from AT&T; is worth the extra $50 or not.I tested my Vita with Modnation Racers: Road Trip, Uncharted: Golden Abyss, Wipeout 2048 and Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus, along with some demos and videos. I haven't been able to try PSP games on it yet and I won't get to try out PSone Classics until the system is updated to support them, but I'm sure they won't disappoint at all. Apparently you can map controls to the right analog stick with PSP games and even upscale the visuals; sounds awesome, I just haven't had a chance to try it out. The Vita has never crashed on me or given me any errors and has only left me with the opinion that the hardware is as solid and stable as launch systems come, I cannot recommend it more highly. It's easily the best game system I've ever had and there are already enough games to satisfy me for the rest of the year, and yet there are even more triple-A handheld titles like Gravity Rush and Resistance coming to the system in the coming months. We haven't even had a chance to see what the end-of-year releases are gonna look like for the Vita, everyone's so busy playing what's already available to them that the amazing present clouds thoughts of the future(though I will say that what has been announced for the Vita's 2012 year already is killer).Throw your money at the Vita. Love it. Cherish it. Make your relatives and friends jealous. I certainly don't regret doing all of that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-23-2012"}

Underworld and legend were okay but there was some glitches where lara got stuck sometimes and in underworld it froze a few times also for no reason, once it froze when i was wall jumping in underworld and lara somehow jumped over the wall and out of the map boundry and froze my ps3, the random freezing has never happened with any other game i've played before as my ps3 is less than 1 year old so its not my console or the disc which was purchased new from amazon.

I have read many reviews about defective xbox one consoles and maybe they are real and maybe they are fake, but i hooked up my day 1 edition last night and it was nothing but a smooth experience for me.  The system feels solid and well built, and looks great cosmetically.  The controller feels very good in my hands and the buttons are responsive.  My initial update finished quickly, and the system booted back up rather quickly.  I then decided to test the disc drive with a dvd of mine at first fearing the grinding noise but it went into the machine nice and easy, made a faint whirring sound to boot it up and then played the dvd and was quiet as a mouse.  I downloaded Killer instinct and another arcade game with no problems whatsoever.

And that is not a good thing! Most of the time the directions your magic sword give you are very vague and can lead you to dead ends and such in search of these colossus'. It is not my idea of fun to run in circles for 20 minutes desperately trying to find something to do.Also, as a whole the entire package of this game is desolate. The manual is very vague and short, the blurbs on the back of the box are short, and the game is entirely empty. It is entirely possible to spend more time in this game FINDING a colossus than actually FIGHTING it.Running around the desolate land wouldnt be too bad if there were things to do. The only thing to do besides fighting those tall colossus' is to hunt and kill little lizards and to find fruit in trees. Both of these tasks are boring beyond belief and extremely unrewarding.But what about the colossus battles? Well, they are not as good as i thought they would be.Each colossus has these little glowing magical circles on their bodies that tells you that that is their weak point. You have to find a way to get to this glowing circle so you can stab it. After you stab this glowing symbol enought times it will magically reappear at another spot on the monsters body. You then have to find a way to climb to its new location so you can stab it again.To me this was very unrewarding gameply. It pretty much boils down to a game of find the glowing magical circle so you can stab it. Rinse and repeat 16 times.And i didnt even mention the games horrible controls and camera system which are a bigger challenge than any colossus turns out to be...In the end i was very disappointed with this title. This is one of those niche games that you either love or hate. I might be in the minority but this games slow and hollow gameplay did not impress me.

Together, these two titles laid the foundation for the series and spawned many hit sequels that have now sold over 42 million units worldwide.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Final Fantasy is the reason to own it, not II","reviewText":"Final Fantasy Origins is a re-release of Final Fantasy I and Final Fantasy II.  I started my FF gaming with Final Fantasy VI and IV but this isn't a bad buy. It's great to see how the series began but I warn you that if you started with the PSX games you'll undoubtably hate this and loose interests and it's easy to see why.Final Fantasy I I'll do first.Graphics: N/AI won't grade graphics. It isn't entirely fair to grade the game in this aspect. 8-bit wise they were astounding! 16-bit they're pretty good too.Sound: 2/5But I don't let up on other areas. Sound is one of those things that I'll actually expect someone to work on a bit.  It would have probably been nice maybe to just keep all the beeps and such in the game actually. The new tunes in Final Fantasy are nothing special.Gameplay: 2.5/5Final Fantasy I paces pretty slowly and you'll find yourself not to enthusiastic with the game at first. Until about halfway through it's pretty unexciting and has no real direction unless you talk to lots of characters.Story: 3.5/5For what it's worth, Final Fantasy has an excellent storyline considering it came out in a time where saving a princess was the theme in video games. It was one of the first games where you went and saved the WORLD!  It scores low because it moves at such a slow pace and has nothing to advance it. Your main characters don't say anything and if you began with FFVI like I did, you're used to direction which FFI doesn't have quite as much of.  Also, the story is pretty boring at the start.Now for Final Fantasy II. I'm sorry to say but this is probably the worst of the series and the way you raise characters was horrid!Graphics: N/AAgain not going to grade but I was actually a little surprised at how much time Square spent updating graphics for FFI and then not updating nearly as much with FFII. In battle is great but outside of battle was ummm...not so great.Sound: 4/5Actually better than Final Fantasy I. BUT! The sound was actually changed from the original!  It's good but I have to wonder what the original sounded like.Story: 2/5Easily the worst of the series as far as story goes.  While the game get's off the a much better start than the first one it isn't really worth it. The story doesn't pace nearly as slow and the characters aren't as stale but the story didn't focus on saving the world as much as FFI did.Gameplay: 2.5/5VERY lacking here.  Since FFII has no such thing as Experience points it's easy to say this is where the game lacks.  Depending on the actions taken in battle determines stats. It's pretty bad because if a character attacks their strentgh goes up.  It's easy to like this at first until you notice the flaws. Getting hit brings up your HP and defenese. Casting magic bring up intellegence, spirt and the like.The problem with this is that unlike other Final Fantasy games it's impossible to have a balanced character. I assure you that if you have a strong character they can't cast a spell worth crap! It sucks to see an Ultima spell only do 100 HP of damage and then a normal attack do 20 times as much damage.Also, magic levels up slowly unless you perform a trick mentioned by a normal reviewer. Not only that but you need someone who purely casts magic in order to actually heal a satisfactory amount of HP. Plus, this quickly drains MP and the battle engine isn't designed to let you use normal itmes in battle, which was actually a step DOWN from FFI.Replay (both): 2.5/5I'm not trying to be mean but when FFI moves at such a slow pace are you willing to actually sit through that. Not to mention that's hard to play FFII again. While the games have difficulty levels FFI is much too easy on easy mode and a little hard on hard mode (which actually is how it should be.)  FFII can be pretty easy.  FFII paces faster at least but the truth is, this is a collectors item after you're done with it.OVERALL: The game as a whole deserves a four. It's great to see how the FF series got started but it's actually probably better to forget FFII and buy FFI on the NES. But there is one nice side to the re-release.  Remember in FFI when you all selected to attack an enemy and then when it died before someone else got to attack they would swing at air? That's been fixed.  Not only that but the menu is easier and you can dash now (which will actually  make dungeons seem rather short).You'll love these two games but not enough to really play them again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2003"}

Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well.

Players begin their adventure as an angel-like guardian. In order to achieve a heavenly design players are sent to the world of mortals to retrieve the magical fruits of a sacred tree. These fruit have the power to grant wishes, but are also perilous, containing the unexpected power to transform those who eat of them into monsters. Together with up to three friends players must battle those transformed beings, and in the process improve their angelic skills and regain the heavenly fruit in order to gain their heavenly reward.CustomizationPlayers can create their own heroes, deciding how they would like their face, hair and clothing to look. As the story unfolds, players become stronger, smarter and more powerful, and can create custom companions to join their group as well. Players will also have fun discovering more than 900 pieces of clothing, armor, weapons and other items that will provide them with a unique appearance and special abilities.

This format rewards careful thinking and strategy over quick reflexes. The more foes players defeat, the stronger their characters become.

In Tag mode, treasure maps and customized greetings can be exchanged automatically by players who come within range of one another.

Angel \"americanpride\"","summary":"Worthy Addition to Dragon Quest","reviewText":"I have played all the Dragon Warrior / Quests except II, III, and VI.  IV and VIII were my favorites of the ones I did play.This is an excellent rpg for the DS.  The music is wonderful.  The graphics are excellent for a DS (played mine on the DS XL).  The story concept is original and good.  The story implementation is decent for a jrpg but I expect better from square enix/level 5.  It contains excellent leveling and character customizations that one would expect from a good jrpg from Square Enix / Level 5.  It does not compare to DQ VIII due to the DS limitations but it does add some nice changes (side quests, multiplayer, custom character look, paper doll, and treasure maps).My favorite new addition were the treasure maps.  You had to use clues from the map to find a dungeon and then traverse the dungeon and defeat a boss.  You don't have to do these dungeons unless you want to, although they help for grinding.It takes about 40-50 hours to complete the main quest.  You can take longer to do the additional side quests, treasure maps, alchemy completion, and monster completions.Issues that keep this from being 5 stars for me.No wi-fi (for multiplayer nor tag mode).  This game was created for multiplayer, but only with friends that are in the same room.  Since this game has turn-based battles, it just makes sense that wi-fi is easily possible and would do wonders for multiplayer needs.Tag mode is also a semi-multiplayer option, but is rendered useless since it depends on passing by a random person, who happens to own DQ IX and happens to have their DS in their pocket which happens to be setup for DQ IX tag mode...yeah...it's not happening.Party members have zero personality.  They add nothing to the story and you have no attachment to them.  They never speak...have no back-story...etc.  This is not mandatory in a rpg, but it makes a big difference to me (ie: FF VI, DQ VIII, Dragon Age Origins being among my favorites).I didn't care for the side quest system.  Side quests are placed around the world and can be difficult to find.  You have to talk to a certain NPC and they'll give you a quest.  There are plenty of side quests that I didn't see because I didn't talk to the right people at the right time.  You can only accept 10 side-quests at a time.  If you have 10 active side quests and are offered another one, then you have to cancel an open side quest in order to accept the new one.  If you complete a side quest, then it does not count toward your 10.  I forgot where to go back upon completion of a few so I never accomplished them.  This can be alleviated if you want to exit the DQ universe and look for hints or a walkthrough online (just not the way I like to play games).Don't get me wrong.  Overall, I had a good time with this game and would recommend it to any jrpg fan.  I just don't think it's the best in the series and it had the potential to be the best handheld rpg ever.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-27-2010"}

Next-gen gameplay, a deep storyline and top-notch visuals and sound made it a breakthrough for the industry. Not only was it a revolutionary title for its time that pushed the console to its limits, but it was supposedly a good sign of things to come. That outcome would ultimately be its sequel, Sons of Liberty, one of the most anticipated of all games. The return of hero Solid Snake gave gamers another chance to experience espionage action once again, but given its reputation for its movie qualities over gameplay, when does a game stop being a game? Sons of Liberty answers this and much more.Everyone was relieved to know Solid Snake made a comeback. With his newly formed team with Otacon, their mission objective was to discover the circumstances surrounding the new Metal Gear and make it known to the public. It started out great, drawing you in with the plot slowly unfolding and the continuation of Snake's story. Suddenly as a unexpected shock to everyone, gamers are soon placed in the perspective of a new character, Jack, a.k.a. Raiden. We are now playing as a whiny, snobbish and clueless rookie who gets in annoying conversations with his girlfriend, Rose. Why the developers chose to use the names 'Jack' and 'Rose' from the movie Titanic is beyond anyone's comprehension. Also, with film music composer Harry Gregson-Williams handling composition duties, it hints that Konami was more intent on creating a movie than making a game.Raiden is without a doubt the star here yet Kojima did an excellent job of hiding it, not to mention tricking and deceiving the whole world into thinking Snake was the only playable character. Nowhere in the previews or even on the packaging was Raiden spoken of. The game has also somewhat lost the gritty military nature of its predecessors, becoming more of a sci-fi fantasy drama. The convoluted storyline that no one wants to figure out and the uninteresting cast of characters (which includes a bisexual vampire and a roller-blading fat guy) don't do the gameplay much justice, which has you mostly defusing explosives as well as babysitting little sisters in between boss battles. Since the entire incident was a Shadow Moses simulation, a majority of the gameplay structure and plot elements are simple rehashes from the first Metal Gear Solid.The cutscenes and dialogue, which were more tolerable in the first MGS, are lengthy and often downright unbearable.  Many games, such as Nintendo's Ocarina of Time and Squaresoft's Vagrant Story, do a great job of balancing gameplay and cinemas. Sons of Liberty, however, does not seem to understand the difference between the two. The movies can be skipped over with ease, but doing so means missing out on vital information on the plot. If gamers want to know more of the story, they will have to sit through the movies, amounting to overly long periods of time. Watching the cinemas will make the game long and boring, while skipping them will make the game incredibly short. It's unrewarding either way you go.Visually, Sons of Liberty is one of the better-looking PS2 titles, even today. The in-game and demo music, sound effects and voice-acting will be some of the best you will ever hear in a console game. The inclusion of the first-person viewpoint is also a welcome addition to the franchise. The story is definitely difficult to fully comprehend, but most players will give up trying to even care anyway. These stand-out aspects still cannot save Sons of Liberty from falling into the category of games that emphasize cinematics over gaming substance. The game tries hard to give its life message, in which we are treated to a well-deserved ending. But what someone has to endure to see that ending is just not worth it. Not even Solid Snake's Tanker Chapter helps heighten the replay value and fun factor. For those who do value gameplay as the dominant characteristic of games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty will simply pass as a title that is disappointing. With The Twin Snakes and Snake Eater joining the series, Sons of Liberty should be easily forgotten (or at least remembered for its unforgiving experience).","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2004"}

Carter \"Ornery Gamer, Fiend Club ...","summary":"This is actually a really great controller...","reviewText":"So far, I've used the Afterglow Wired Controller for the XBOX 360 (Blue) more for playing PC games via Steam, but I've put it through its paces on the XBOX 360 and I'm glad to report that I've experienced no problems. In fact, this is a pretty darned good controller in just about any way that matters.Controls are responsive and both the D-Pad and analog sticks feel good. Playing a platformer like Guacamelee! calls for some pretty exact controls in places, and I was able to pull off some of the more complex combinations on this one with no more difficulty than I would have had with the stock X360 controller. The buttons are a little on the &#34;clicky&#34; side, but they're responsive and well-placed. The breakaway cable (which has been a staple of wired XBOX controllers from the get-go) is present and is welcome, as-always (I have small children...it's already proven its worth).Set-up is a breeze on either platform. On my PC (Windows 7), all I had to do is plug it into an available USB port. After a minute or so, drivers were installed automatically and I was able to play directly using Steam Big Picture. The XBOX 360 was obviously even easier as it was ready-to-go as soon as it was plugged-in.The controller is obviously plastic, so I was halfway expecting it to feel cheap and chintzy, but it actually feels pretty solid and well-made. There were no cracks at all in my controller (something I looked for as soon as I received it, since some other reviews mentioned them).As for the lights, this is a take it or leave it &#34;feature&#34; for me. They're kind of cool, and playing in a well-lit room, you'll probably not even notice them. They're probably a bit too bright for playing in a dark room, at least if you're playing anything a bit more ambient or atmospheric (might be a bonus for a game like Space Giraffe though). Fortunately, you can turn the lights off completely, so it becomes a non-issue. I've found that once I turned them off, I've rarely felt the need to turn them back on.If you're looking for a solid wired controller and aren't afraid of going for a 3rd-party controller, then the Afterglow is a great option. The price is good (and likely to get better in the coming months) and you shouldn't have any complaints as far as the functionality goes.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2014"}

On the surface, I thought DMC might have been an RPG-like game.  I was very wrong.  I only wish I had bought this one sooner.Pros:  Very difficult, you genuinely feel like you've accomplished something when you beat a boss or clear a level that you've been working on countless times until you clear it.Great graphics, the world is not as interactive as say the Grand Theft Auto Series, but it sure looks great!Decent Storyline:  Half man, half demon, I know, sounds ridiculous, but video games are like hollywood, and this one has some solid production value and the story line works.CONS:Camera angles:  The game changes views frequently as you progress through the game and there are only a few screens where Dante can actually control the camera angle.  There should have been more, perhaps this is corrected in 2 or 3 when they come out.Too many tools/options:  I was about half way through the game before I realized you could 'un-lock' other abilities and 'buy' other 'stars' that give Dante special abilities.  Stupid me, but the amount of weapons, specials, and different attacks seemed a bit much to manage.  The Ifrit is clearly the best weapon of choice!Level of difficulty:  This is as much of a pro as it is a con.  Sometimes you wanted to pour cold water into the CD-ROM of the PS2 just to get even with the pesky monster on the other side.BOTTOM LINE:  Great story line, tough challenge, pretty environment, great production value, very worthwhile.

The drivers even react to your racing style.I've played a wide number of racing games over the years. I love them. Some are arcade style where you use walls like redirection tools and the other cars are more like bumper cars. This is definitely NOT the case in Grid. You tag a wall, and your door dents. You get hit by another car, and you might lose a window. Your car is incredibly mutable and can warp in a wide variety of ways. The game is nice and generally lets you keep driving - but if you go head-first into a concrete barrier, don't expect to keep going.The drivers around you act like real humans. If you start annoying them, they will get irked and start badgering you right back again. Sometimes they spin out and do other things. It makes the racing a ton of fun.The graphics are great. You quickly get immersed in the world. If anything, sometimes the graphics are too good, making your track view a bit challenging. That is, on a simple-graphics track there isn't much to distract you. There's the road and maybe some green things on the side of the screen. Here, you get complex details of streets, buildings, and other objects. When the track is weaving around objects, it can be hard to make out which way to go.The soundtrack is OK. I've certainly heard FAR worse in racing games - but I've also heard better. This might be a case where you choose to put on your own music while you play.It's important for me to note here that I pretty much always race alone. I don't play multiplayer in my house, nor do I race with other people online. I like the solo challenge of pitting me against the computer entries. But for people who do enjoy the multiplayer aspect, I've heard that the online server is no longer available. Also, there's no in-person multiplayer. So this game is now apparently a solo-only game. For me that is quite fine. Depending on your gaming style, this may be fine or a game-stopper for you.So highly recommended for solo players: 8/10.

(EDIT: really started to enjoy it after a month)","reviewText":"I bought the Xbox One bundle that came with the digital download of Titanfall. I do find the game somewhat enjoyable, but I guess I expected more because of all the hype it was getting. Anyone that says it's just a COD clone with mechs is clueless. There is a lot more to grasp in this game than there is in COD. It takes time to get used to it, and learn the controls. Right now I'm not loving it, but not hating it either. It's definitely not your ordinary first person shooter. I played a few matches randomly during the day, and didn't experience a single issue, so don't listen to the negative reviews talking about how it's \"unplayable\" or whatever they're saying. I can't say anything bad about the game really. Who knows... Maybe ill start to enjoy it even more once I get more time into it.EDIT: So after a month I started to enjoy it more. Understanding the mini map helped a lot. You need to know the difference between Pilots, Titans, and Minions on your radar. I regenerated once (which is nothing compared to some of the other day 1 adopters)and what I'm liking now is this isn't exactly like prestiging in COD. You get an XP multiplier for each generation which makes you earn XP slightly faster. You also have a list of challenges that need to get done before you can regenerate again. So basically, if you want to keep regenerating you CAN'T keep using your favorite weapons. This was a breath of fresh air for me because I enjoy using ALL of the guns in the game, and I like challenges... It also keeps people from using the best guns ALL the time. This gives Titanfall more replay value for me. I've learned to really enjoy it... So after a month I'm bumping my 3 start review up to a 4 star. If you're an XB1 owner and enjoy multiplayer shooters this is a must buy! You just have to give it a chance!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2014"}

Heavy Rain definitely qualifies. It tells its story in a way no previous game has been able to pull off. It's a competent mystery tale with plenty of twists and forks. Also, at times it's amazing graphically -- excelling in facial expressions, water effects, and cinematography.With all this said, why not give the game 5 stars? Two things really bugged me. First off, the control wasn't as good as it should be. Granted, I played on the most difficult level, but the Sixaxis steering was constantly flat-out wrong. And at times, it just plain didn't recognize the correct inputs. This can be the difference between succeeding at a task and failing.Secondly, I had some problems with the story -- don't worry, I won't spoil anything. In a game like this, which gives you so many choices, there are times the characters just aren't allowed to do things you think would be second-nature. If I'm a cop fighting someone and there are a bunch of police nearby, why wouldn't I yell to them? It seems everyone here is a mute unless it befits the story.Heavy Rain is an experience I recommend all serious gamers try. You may not love it, but it's an important step in gaming. Its fork-in-the-road choices make it different for everyone who plays it, and it evokes emotions not common with video games as a medium. Stick with it, and you won't be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2010"}

Being only their third game produced since their inception in 1997. Even though this is not a new genre, it has evolved considerably. It's really nice to see game developers taking more risks and branching out from FPS games.Pros-Multi dimensional story with solid characters and a twist-Stunning graphics and motion capture-Real consequences from choices i.e. people die permanently-Multiple ending sequences-Voice acting in most cases is excellentCons-Not really a gamer's type of game-Replay value is only ok despite story choices (I'll explain this)-No true extras or secrets in the game---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Graphics 9 of 10Once in a very long while a game comes along that bucks the trend and I don't mean just takes what others have done and overhaul it; I mean a whole new genre is created. Heavy Rain is reminds me of some of the games back on the Sega Saturn where motion capture was just first being explored. In reality it was just video meshed with the game graphics to produce more realistic stories. However, Heavy Rain takes it much further than that. The power of the PS3 is really showcased in this game. Movement and animation is masterfully done and realistic beyond anything I've ever seen. And it appears that the developers literally did motion capture of the face muscles so you could tell not only what the characters were saying but how they felt about it as well. The detail on the faces shows as close to photo-realism as I've seen in a video game. The people also look believable as real people. There are overweight people in the game as well as average looking men and women.Mechanics and Gameplay 7 of 10To understand this game you have to think of it as an interactive movie. The majority of the time you'll be pressing and holding a few buttons all at once or even shaking the controller. Walking is kind of awkward and not really intuitive. You hold the R2 button and then \"direct\" your character with the analog stick as opposed to other games where you just walk with the stick. Most of the other mechanics are basically just pre-recorded so there isn't really any precedent.Now, I have to give a disclaimer to those who aren't into games with deep storylines or don't consider themselves patient. It is not really what you'd call a real video game. There is dying, but the characters don't come back to life. There is very little shooting and it's not skill based; it's time based. So from a pure gamer's standpoint the game is going to be disappointing to say the least. But from a technical and plot view it is really an impressive game. For me personally, it's the opposite of my usual ideal open world game. But I feel like it was so well produced that it deserves acclaim.The reason why the gameplay is lower is because in terms of gaming it holds a lower value. It's not to say that overall the game isn't good or even great. It just doesn't offer very much true skill based parts other than button mashing and the occasional need for quick reflexes. Aside from that, I don't see how there could be a physics program used or needed considering all the movements are pre-programmed or recorded into the game. You have just take into account this is super heavily based on the story and the gaming part is kind of just in addition to it.Voice Acting and Music 9 of 10The people cast for this game really had to fit the character for the game to have that wow factor and it is easy to see in the intonation the voice actors. They make you feel for their characters as opposed to just hearing the words. Even the child voice acting was really great. And the musical score felt very suited to the game. It really resembled a thriller or murder mystery movie.Story 10 of 10The story in Heavy Rain centers around an architect (Ethan Mars) with a wonderful life who loses his oldest son in a car accident. And the characters show a human quality rarely seen in a game. Ethan's wife divorces him after the accident and you can see the toll everything has taken on him as well as his other son. The other main players are Scott Shelby - private investigator, Norman Jayden - FBI agent and Madison Paige - a friend of Ethan's (her occupation is told later on in the game). And the basis for the plot is the Origami Killer, who kidnaps children and drowns them and leaves an origami figure in the child's hand. It is a really well put together story, with vibrant characters and a really impressive final twist. For obvious reasons this is the most detailed and clearly thought out part of the game.Replay Value and Extras 6 of 10My only serious complaint with the game is this: replay is appealing for only one reason - to change the final outcome. Despite the ability to affect each chapter, you can't really make the investigation go faster or slower and you can't really even solve the crime differently. It's this that keeps the game from being stellar. For example, Jayden solves the crime via his ARI device, but you literally can't advance to the next chapter without finding the specific things you were \"supposed\" to find in the evidence. In fact, after I'd seen a few different types of endings I didn't want to touch the game again. Once you've played all the endings you likely won't want to play ever again because you know the twist. Also, you can't make your own saves.There is no reason to go searching around in your environment for anything but murder clues. There are not any collectables. So if you're not playing as Jayden, most of the actions have no direct effect on the story and are superfluous. If I want to go and wash my hands for fun; I'll do the real thing. At least I'll get rid of some germs. The actual extras involve some \"making of\" and concept sketches but are hardly worth looking at and you have to earn these.ConclusionI can't recommend this game to just anyone. And the problem is that even though it's really well executed, it has a fairly small niche. People that own a ps3 would probably profess to be seasoned or even extreme gamers, which means they likely appreciate games for their pushing of boundaries. So, for example it isn't likely that a person who enjoys the Uncharted series would be interested in Heavy Rain. I'd put this game closer to the casual category, more for people who play for like an hour at a time - max. So this is a rental game in my opinion. And even though I appreciate it for what it does well, it's not something I'd play all the way through ever again.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-13-2011"}

When you go around corners your car will slow down regardless of how much you want to accelerate. The game gets repetitive although it is pretty short and you can get the top level car within hours.Multiplayer is exactly like Burnout Paradise where you go to an area and perform challenges, races etc. Which is fine although the Burnout Paradise challenges were more fun and varied.If you like open world racer titles then I would recommendForza Horizoninstead.

That's exactly what SOUTH PARK: THE STICK OF TRUTH does though and that is hands down the genius of the PS3 game creation. It makes fun of RPGing and other gaming elements like you'd imagine South Park would.The more of a fan you are of South Park, the more of a fan you will be of the game and the more you will enjoy its elements. The game references tons of moments from the television show over the years. I haven't kept up with the series in a few years now. Not that I don't enjoy the show and watch it from time to time but I have an 8-year old son now and this show or this game are not for 8-year olds, much less 14-year olds.... or anybody who is offended at all.. about anything... no matter how remote or innocent.It's a lot of fun exploring South Park and controlling the characters and the story and writing are genuine, original and unique. The only real downside is that the game engine isn't all that complicated and while it is fun bopping through the South Park culture, it doesn't grow and continue to adapt to pop culture like the television show.

{"product_name":"B002I0JAJ2","description":"","reviewerName":"Scott Peterson \"I.T. Sme\"","summary":"Well, what were you expecting?","reviewText":"So the game that was in the longest development mess in history finally was released; I got it on sale in January and was so disinterested I didn't play it until recently.The famous Duke Nukem 3D was two things; first it was the third episode of a game that had previously been a scrolling 2D shooter.  Considering this was even before Half Life it was revolutionary; offering an interactive environment with varied combat everywhere from Los Angeles to the Moon. You flew in a jetpack, shot big guns, and saved the world.  It was also a game than ran in DOS with graphics so primitive it still used sprites.Second is the lowbrow and campy humor.  Duke is a crude and amped up version of an 80's action hero, a one man army who when it's all over is heading to the first strip club. The audience was mostly males in their teens and twenties, and this wasn't epic storytelling.So the makers set out to create something revolutionary, and it took them 12 years (according to the game) to bring the product to market.  As the years ticked by people wondered just what could take so long in development to justify it.  I honestly can't see why, especially when many modern games have sequels out in 2-3 years.After so many years, especially with changing the gaming engine a few times and developers, it would be reasonable to expect a complete disaster.  The result is actually a cohesive game; what you get is an amped up, louder, and more developed version of the Duke experience.The question being is this what you want? The graphics, as many people have pointed out, are dated, but more Doom 3 quality than some ancient history engine.  You don't have a jetpack or secret places in anything I could see, and his one liners seem mostly recycled.  Otherwise it's the same gaming style, replete with episodes and bosses, as before.And that's really the problem.  The world has changed a lot since 1996; 80's action movies are a distant memory and the crude/sexual humor is out of vogue.  Guys who played the game in college are now in their mid-thirties with kids and a career, and the younger generation is raised on games like Mass Effect and Dragon Age.After finishing it I was disappointed.  It's set all in Nevada at Vegas and Hoover Dam.  The first part showed promise--Duke is the king of it all with adoring fans at every corner.  By the later third it was a tedious go into a room, solve a physics puzzle and/or blow up some bad guys, go to the next.  There were so many missed opportunities for the over the top campiness of the original and the pop culture references were very dated.The driving and getting shrunk episodes were sort of fun but already old hat today.  In particular I didn't like the boss levels as it was lob rockets or explosives (nothing else causes damage) until the boss's health runs down.  You have to keep moving and reloading and a good part of your survival depends on luck rather than skill.  Once down you rip or tear some part off, the boss magically regains all health, and you repeat until it finally dies.Duke is basically a relic game; boss fights aren't popular today, and the audience wants cut scenes, interactive dialog, and and non-linear maps to play in.  Had the game made it to the market in 2001 with Halo quality graphics it would have been a big hit, and probably even as late as 2005 looking the way it does now.But today---aside from the protracted development it's nothing to write home about, just a fun game to play for a few evenings.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Darth Sabreth","summary":"Good story game but","reviewText":"Hi all I bought the colectors edition but i will just stick to the game play in this review, there are some pro's and cons to this game and will leave this up to you weather or not you want to buy it. I will start with the pro's.PRO'S1. first and for most the best part of this game is the story, pound for pound this is the best part of this game. The writer's pain stakingly created a very dynamic story for both your individual charecter and non charecter story I.E regular quests. each class has their own story and every one is absolutly wonderful.2. the PVE is awesome, every Flashpoint, and operation also is story driven and is wonderfully done. some have small puzzles to them which add to the fun.3. holocrons, this is in itself a mini game, through out all of the planets there are holocrons which when found will add to your base stat's.4. The cash shop has items that are useful and fun, though there is a con to this see below.5. The planets / graphics are very good and the charecters looks are also fine.6. The Legacy system is really great esp for alts it adds to the abilities of Alts most importantly.CON'S1. The customer service is the worst i've ever seen in any major game, god help you if you ever have to call them. To say they cant speak any English is an understatement. I have no idea which country they out sourced to but it is certainly not india. most of the people whom call them will be on hold for up to 45 min only to get disconected, you cant understandthem so ull have to get bumped up (Eventually) to an escelated dept. If you have issues with the game or your number thing gets lost or dies then plan on being on the phone if your lucky for several hours.2. Most of the original Devs have been laid off, evey patch that comes out breaks something new. The content is very slow to come out. They do try and some of the events that they do have is fun but its very slow.3. The PVP is some of the worst in any MMO, Why might you say, it's the ultra excessive CC in the Game. At launch the game's pvp system was less fustrating, i would say it was really fun. But in patch 1.4 they made the CC 110% worst with a resolve change, now you will be stunned so many times it will make you want to kick your wall in. They did this because the class imbalance is very rampent. some classes ultimately dominate the war zones, so after some atempts to balance them they just made it much easier to CC players so now its just a CC fest. people call the pvp in this game PVCC now. Literally a sorc / sage can spam toss out bubbles onto their entire team and if you attack them you will be stunned, so pretty much they can hold an entire team CCed. If you are a pvper and like to pvp in an MMO then stay far away from this game you will be more fustrated than anything else.4. There is no cross server que system in place for both flash points and War zones. This is one of the must ridiculous things that i have ever seen for any modern MMO on the market, you can wait in que for some time. Bio Ware flat out refuses to put one into place it is not so bad for PVP per say but for PVE it is an horrible experiance trying to get into an flash point. if you are DPS the average wait time is 45 min - several hours. which leads me to my next point.....5. Consumables: The cash shop has some items that you can purchase with real money, some boost XP some boost Valor, ECT. The problem is while you are waiting in que for an excessivly long time being there is no cross server que you will watch this cunsumable that you paid RL money for just tick away. What a waste.6. There is almost no comunication between the devs and the comunity, there are tons of the same subjects on the forums that are issues and no feed back from the devs about those issues.in a nutshell If you love PVE and story in a game this is for you, if you like pvp this is not for you. This is a modern game but feels like its a 1990's game, has very few ease of use features that most MMO's have and lousy customer service. I dont blame Bio Ware though I love that company and all of their games, but the massive layoffs they had really took a toll on this game and you can tell, there was so much love thrown into this game and the attention to detail in the environment shows the love. But if your coming from another game to this one you might find it lacking in a few areas.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2012"}

I encounter some frame rate issues, a few bugs, the occasional bit of slowdown during the more intense combat situations and I just didn't find the story, graphics or camera to be as good.Blacklist also feels like it is dumbed down compared to other Tom Clancy and specifically Splinter Cell games. Everything feels easier and the A.I. seems less powerful/intelligent. I also feel like the writers for the game have beating a dead horse. We're starting the see the same thing over and over again.The much vaunted \"Killing in Motion\" isn't anything truly new or special as it's been done (better) in other games. I was also disappointed to see the PS3 version get the short end of the stick. The 360 version has Kinect integration, but the PS3 version didn't have Move? The Wii U version even had some nice additions put in. So the PS3 version gets the least amount of frills but costs the same. It's disappointing and it's why I feel the PS3 version is the least of the game. I also played through the 360 version and I found it to be less buggy and prettier, and this is coming from someone who generally prefers Sony's system.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2013"}

Yes it looked really good, the dialog and story were top notch. There were many really good things about this game, but I really didn't find it that fun to play. Reasons were the gun fighting mechanics were really bad in my opinion especially compared to so many games today like resistance 3, crysis  2 , cod games and on and on. The hand to hand combat and stealth also were not very good, nor was the heroes movements. The game is also very linear, that would have been no problem if the shooting was decent but it is not, it simply feels like some old computer game. My biggest complaint is I almost always like to play a game more than once through and really had no desire to play this one again, once you have seen the story that's pretty much it.Anyway, I am sure I'll get ripped for this review but its my honest opinion.

I've always liked Mario and figured I'd enjoy the game, but I kept asking myself, \"Is this game really worth what Nintendo wants for it?\" So, I waited a year or two before picking it up used for what seemed like a less wasteful thirty bucks. Friends, let me be clear: This game is well worth the fifty dollars you'd pay for it new. This game is the best Mario game yet. Here's why:Difficulty: This game could have been titled, \"Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels 2\" if Nintendo had been so inclined. As most Mario players know, The Lost Levels is the most difficult game in the Mario canon. If New Super Mario Bros. Wii wasn't so forgiving in terms of the amount of readily available lives, it would be harder than The Lost Levels. I beat the game in two days without a single game over, but I what must have been at least one hundred times. You will be challenged, and you will be insulted when Nintendo's \"Super Guide\" feature offers to play the level for you! (although, this is a nice option since the game is really hard and probably even harder for someone who hasn't played that much Mario).Graphics: I like the style they employed here. It didn't try too hard. You don't want your Mario to look too realistic. Although, I think that HD capabilities might have made a few spots look a little better.Overall Gameplay: It's Mario my friends. It most closely resembles the style of gameplay presented in Mario 3, but some elements of Super Mario World and other titles come to mind at points.Controls: For the most part, it's NES-style gameplay with the Wii Remote held sideways. You can basically play the entire game just running with B and jumping with A, but you have a spin jump that can be employed by shaking the Remote. There are also some platforms that are moved by tilting the Remote. The only time I was really annoyed by the motion controls was on 7-4 where I kept spin jumping when I wanted to move the platforms. It actually made rather mad that the controls got me killed so many times, but it's just one level and not a big deal.Music: Most of your favorite themes from Mario games long past make a return here with new versions. I was particularly happy to see the Hammer Brothers battle theme return from Mario 3. The Castle levels seem to have a more \"epicy\" soundtrack that makes you think, \"Hmm, I didn't realize Mario's quest was so important!\" It's kind of weird, but also kind of awesome. If I have one complaint, it's that the main level theme is a little overused. It would have been better if they'd used different melodies on the different worlds.Multiplayer: I've only played it for an eve with a single friend, but I wasn't too too impressed by it. You and your friends always seem to want to jump to the same places, and the camera zooms out to cover everything when you're spread out. Also, I'm lamenting the lack of a traditional alternating Mario multiplayer.Lasting Appeal: I've only had it for a week, but this game is one that I'll play until I've completely conquered in ever way imaginable. And then, I might even play it again. It's that good.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0086V5V9A","description":"","reviewerName":"Jonathan","summary":"A lot of annoyances keep this game from greatness","reviewText":"I've played and enjoyed every Splinter Cell, so I've been waiting for Blacklist since it was announced. While I like some of the new features, a lot of flaws in the execution make what should have been an awesome game fairly average.First off, you better make sure you have some room on your 360's hard drive. The game is spread over two discs, and has some significant loads times even when installed. If you want the HD texture pack - which I highly recommend, because gives Blacklist some of the best graphics I've ever seen on the 360 - it's another three-and-a-half gigs (installed from disc two in-game, i.e. not installed when you install Blacklist from the dashboard). The game's first patch is 6MB, and that's before release day.I was worried going in that the SC franchise would move further from the hardcore stealth roots of the early games to the more action-oriented style of SC: Conviction. I was pleasantly surprised in how Blacklist combined the best of both worlds. The customization of Conviction has been expanded tenfold, the in-environment objective updates are back, and Mark & Execute returns (and can now be done in motion), but the Blacklist really puts the emphasis on stealth - and punishes you if you fail, though not so severely that it's game-over.The game scores your performance based on Ghost, Panther and Assault play styles, and while every map can be played in every way, Blacklist clearly rewards stealth more. For example, the highest point total you get for a takedown is 175 (for a stealth takedown and hiding the body), but simply avoiding the same person nets you 200 points. if you want to play Assault, you have options, but don't mistake this for Call of Duty or Halo - if you get hit with a shotgun blast at close range, don't expect to shake it off.Another thing I liked is that you access all in-game features from in the game at your base. There's no \"main menu\" to speak of. If you want to upgrade your suit, for example, you head over to the workshop. If you feel like tackling some side missions or multiplayer (which was not very populated when I played as I'm writing this review based on an advance copy), head over to the tactical map and select the area of operations to get your briefing.If you want to experience all Blacklist has to offer, make sure you have a local or online friend, because while the solo campaign is obviously single-player, the side missions I've come across are all either solo/co-op or co-op only. The game does support split-screen.All of this is well and good, and lays the groundwork for an awesome stealth action game. Unfortunately, more than a few things really grind my gears, enough for me to have actually stopped playing Blacklist and switch to another game for an hour at times because I got so fed up.There's a few annoyances that I would otherwise forgive, had they been isolated. Every now and then an enemy gets stuck in a closed door. Selecting gadgets requires you to press and hold the D-pad for a second, meaning that hot-swapping really isn't an option. Climbing up and down can't always be done via up/down on the joystick and require you to press A/B, even though you're using the joystick to move left/right at the same time. An early-game section where you play as a sniper covering Sam is terrible in that it's just not executed well, and features light red target reticles on a black-and-white thermal readout - difficult to see under normal circumstances, and a game-breaker for people with even mild colorblindness.There's Kinect integration that let's you say \"Hey you\" to distract guards (also done via the \"Back\" button on the controller), but it doesn't work very well - not so much that it doesn't pick it up when I say it as interpreting background noise as a voice command. You can imagine how well that works out when I'm crouch-walking behind a pair of bad guys.The checkpoint system is also kind of funky. The checkpoints themselves are usually a reasonable length apart - you'll probably hit one every ten minutes or so. However, how it registers your side objectives is strange. Every mission I've run across has a USB flash drive dead drop to pick up, a laptop to hack, and a high-value target to take down non-lethally. For the first two, once you perform said action, it's consider done for any subsequent playthrough of that section. I found this out because I had to reload a checkpoint (see my issues with Kinect in the last paragraph), sneaked back to the laptop and ... it was already hacked. Just to make sure it wasn't a fluke, I restarted the entire mission, which is when I noticed that my dead drop from earlier in the mission was already considered retrieved when I got to that point. The HVTs work similarly, but only \"lock\" after you get to the next checkpoint, so if you secure the HVT but then die before getting to the next checkpoint, you'll have to secure him again.It's very easy to game this system for points and cash - just go through the mission to do the secondary objectives, and once you have all three, just restart the mission. Since it already logged your objectives as completed, you won't have to deal with the enemies in those areas, meaning (if you avoid them entirely) that's 200 points per enemy for doing nothing. Why Ubisoft went with this instant-reward system rather than an end-of-mission reward system is beyond me.My biggest complaint about this game, the one that made me rage-quit three times in a single day, is the context-sensitive A button. A is how you interact with your environment, and in theory activates whatever you're looking at. I say \"in theory\" because more times than I can count Sam did something completely weird. For example, in the first mission after the tutorial, I'm looking at a door. It says \"A - Open door.\" The prompt changes to \"A - Flip switch\" the instant I press the button and Sam turns and flips the light switch next to him. Two missions later, I'm in a sewer standing under a pipe. Grim tells me to use the pipe as cover. My prompt says \"A - Jump.\" As I'm hitting A, without me moving, the prompt changes to \"A - Climb\" over the balcony next to Sam. Sam climbs over the balcony into the spotlight and is promptly killed. Don't even get me started on peeking under doors.I really, really wanted to give this game a great rating. Don't get me wrong, it's Splinter Cell, so it's not terrible, and a lot of problems I'm seeing can be fixed with later patches, but as it stands right now this game has some serious issues. Unless you are very patient when it comes to reloading checkpoints and/or dealing with false inputs, I would wait until this game is patched once or twice before buying it. The Blacklist house is built on a solid foundation, but needs some fixing before most people are ready to move in.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Matt","summary":"Great family console, short-lived fun","reviewText":"Unlike all other gaming consoles, Nintendo Wii is made to be shared with family and friends.  And while most of the games are arcade-ish, they're entertaining for anybody who does not call himself a hardcore gamer.  If you're looking for realistic, movie-like graphics, get an Xbox 360 or a PS3.  But if you want a system that people of all ages will enjoy, get a Wii.That said, there is also a downside to the Wii.While the games are fun, many of them get old in a hurry.  With the exception of Mario Kart, which I'm pretty much up for playing at any time, the games I've purchased at the store have all been at least decent and I enjoy them for a week after purchase, but then they collect dust for months until I have interest in playing them again.  It would be acceptable if the games were less expensive, but dropping $40 on a game that grows old quickly is not a mistake a Wii gamer will make too many times.  I feel like I need a couple dozen games to keep me playing Wii every day.  And for that to happen, I would need to see most games at $15-20 and premium games like Madden NFL 10 at $30.Many of the games you'd like to play online, such as Wii Sports (we all think we're the best at power bowling), are not available for online play.  There are hundreds of games to purchase online inexpensively (including classics like Super Mario Bros and Tecmo Bowl), but unfortunately there is no option to try before you buy and I've regretted buying every title except the classics mentioned above and Tetris Party (you can play Tetris online).There are many benefits to having your Wii connected to the Internet (I use my wireless signal).  In addition to being able to play and buy many games online, you can also download: Nintendo Channel, which has video clips and lots of other valuable information if you're looking to buy Wii or DS games; the Everybody Votes Channel, where you pick an answer and predict the most popular answer (i.e., \"Would you rather do dishes or laundry?\"); Internet Channel, which allows you to browse the Internet; and you can check the news and your local weather forecast.The Wii also seems to have the least negative feedback regarding console durability and performance of any gaming console on the market.  I'm knocking on wood with one hand while I type that I've had my console for nearly one year and I've had zero freezes or other issues.While the Wii has its share of short-comings, the Wii is a great buy if you're looking for a family console.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"drollere","summary":"postmodernist fantasy and gameplay","reviewText":"i'm a mature gamer who bought a dozen or so videogames along with a new xbox to see how the technology had evolved. (the digital animation in most recent films had piqued my interest.) i opened and started many games but bioshock was the one i played through first. this game has the unique attribute of putting videogaming on the psychoanalyst's couch: without spoiling the plot twists, i'll say it basically takes all the \"external control\" features of traditional \"first person\" videogames, which are always left unquestioned as narrative premises, and uses them instead to motivate major plot twists -- things you must confront explicitly through your role in the game. (control is someone or something who tells you that you are going to do a mission and why, as well as the social control of authority figures, the physical control of built infrastructure and surveillance devices, the threat control of monsters and risks, the ability control of which weapons you have and how you can use them, etc.) most games just pick one version or another of \"control\" and weave a plot inside that, but bioshock puts you through different versions or pretexts of control that make you question control rather than submit to it. but all that comes up only if you bother to think about it. if not, then the fantasy realm of an underwater city, genetic mutants, children who collect corpse juice, mad scientists and a very retro visual design are entertainment enough. the visual design is very good and the gameplay was flawless, no glitches that i could find. the game is both gory and gruesome and is not for kids. the missions and tasks flow from one to the other in a way that keeps the narrative arc ambiguous and also does not let you anticipate when the \"boss battle\" will come -- at least, not until the game is near the very end. the weapons are quite novel, although the best ones resemble the \"gravity gun\" and crossbow in half life 2. you are explicitly required to manage them by purchasing abilities or ability slots at vending machines -- a sardonic comment on consumer culture. however the game does not end in a way that says \"you adopted a role and you perfomed it well as instructed\" but rather \"you did many things in this game because you were told to, but who are you really?\" i found that the most interesting thing about this very interesting, enjoyable and engrossing game is that it opens up many narrative possibilities that the mission oriented first person shooter games have not been able to explore.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2008"}

On your journeys you will have to make some tough choices, sometimes it's a lesser of two evils, some times it's about greed (your own) or doing what's morally right. There are some puzzles to figure out, dungeons of course, plenty of places to explore. Some of these choices actually will make a difference in how the game plays out in a major way. I tried to do most every quest I could get my hands on, which resulted in 70 hours of play. I was a bit hesitant to get this versus the PC version, but I have become console oriented in the last few years, so thought I would take a chance. The controls are very well done, and it's very easy to control a group of 4, you can and will need to fiddle with default tactics for your party, but it's very easy to do. But it's also just a simple matter of a button press to switch characters, which you can do while the game is live, during battle. As a mage, I often played support keeping my party healed, as well as scouting, buffing, resurrecting etc.  Seriously this game has it all, crafting, weapon upgrades, lots of armor sets, plenty of skill/spell choices. I actually even went back to a previous save game to pick a different choice, and see how the game ended with that choice. I'm very much looking forward to more DLC. If you enjoy RPG's this is a must have!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

If me reviewing the game before completing is a problem for you then please stop reading here.It's truly difficult to talk about Dead Island and do it any justice. This is an experience, one that each player will make unique for his or herself. I can't tell you how sprinting away from a horde of infected and listening to them screaming in rage as they give chase makes you feel. Or locking yourself in a bungalow, frantically searching for a couple of energy drinks just so you can descend a little further into the nightmare that is Dead Island.It's those moments that make it so hard to describe. It's amazing how much this game changed me in the nine straight hours I played last night. The minute I was unleashed onto the breathtakingly beautiful Island Resort with only a paddle in hand I thought I had this game figured. At first I ran into every encounter headfirst, merrily swinging my paddle around like a manic zombie slayer. After being torn to shreds several times I rethought my strategy. I became a survivor. The enemies in this game are dangerous and relentless and melee combat is brutal and unforgiving. I will now avoid large mobs if I can and when I can't I am using my head and searching for a way out while trying to keep the zombies in front of me. I am no longer trying to rack up my kill combo; I am fighting to stay alive.I could draw many comparisons on this game comparing it to the likes of fallout, borderlands, resident evil, dead rising, left 4 dead etc. But tons of other, better reviews have already done that and yes I will concede it does take things from all of those titles but the game itself is completely original for one big reason. It's the feelings you have when playing this game. Never in my life have I ever felt so much dread in rounding a corner praying I don't walk into a group of the infected. Then the sense of complete and utter hopelessness when I do, you back yourself into a corner and get ready to fight with whatever you have on hand and the sense of grim victory when you finally win the hard earned battle. Yes this game takes parts from all those games, but this isn't a game, this is an experience and I urge you to go in with that in mind.

At least, I know that to be the case for me. But I have to say that, in this case, I really do feel that \"Your Shape; Fitness Evolved 2012\" really gives you a good workout and lots of exercise options for the retail price.I bought my Xbox 360 with Kinect this summer with the intention of using it as a hands-free exercise tool. I've got a Wii already, and, while I DO still enjoy exercising/dancing around on a few games with it, I've really enjoyed using my Xbox and Kinect to give me a thorough, fun workout.Dance Central with 240 Microsoft PointsandDance Central 2are great, fun ways to get your body moving, but there's no dedicated, clearly defined move that's clearly identified as targeting specific muscles in any dance game that I've encountered, much as we all know that they'll get you moving and sweating while still having fun and toning muscle.With YSFE 2012, there's a wide range of exercises to choose from, from runs through different venues in New York City that really ARE pretty accurately gauged as far as exertion and effort are concerned, to true cardio and strength training exercises (in small doses, which is perfect to build on if you're in for a nice, long, thorough workout), and right on to dance routines that'll satisfy those dance game cravings, while giving you a cultural experience via the dance style and country that it originates from, along with the appropriate music (I, personally, can't get enough of the Bollywood dance routines).The tracking in this game seems much better to me than what the original \"Your Shape: Fitness Evolved\" delivered, and considering that I'm struggling with the same space issues as many other Kinect users out there (and the Zoom's ineffectiveness helped nothing), I'm sure that most users will get lots of enjoyment from the software tweaking that seems to have been applied here (what I'm saying is, if your living room isn't the size of a castle dining hall, no worries with this game, thankfully)!!!I was SO excited to receive this game, open it up, and try it out, and thankfully, it didn't disappoint!

They kept the RPG elements of Tricky, and SSX 3, and have brought back all of the main cast of characters, while ditching the ugly art style of \"On Tour\" and the gimmicks from \"Blur.\"I am a long time fan of the SSX franchise. I got into it with Tricky on the original XBOX, and followed the series all the way to \"On Tour\" before calling it quits when \"Blur\" came out.What I can tell you after having sat down and played the game for a couple hours tonight on release night, is that the controls feel like the controls from SSX 3 (once you get out of the tutorial mode, and they allow you to reset them to \"classic\" mode, anyway), with some minor tweaks -- and the gameplay feels like SSX 3 + Tricky.  It has the better controls and deeper/wider field of play of SSX 3 + the cheerful & arcade feeling of Tricky.  They even brought back the song from \"Run-D.M.C\" from SSX Tricky, which will play when you hit \"super Tricky\" in your trick boost meter.Over all, the game feels solid, the controls felt natural to me as a veteran SSX 3 and SSX Tricky player, and the story/characters and mountains all look and sound good, and are fun.  I dinged the game 1 star for the somewhat dated graphics of the player models rendered in the in-game engine, and for no ability to customize what EACH button does in the controller layout (all you can choose from, from what I could tell, was the new \"standard\" layout, and the \"classic\" layout, which is more or less the SSX 3 layout), and that EA is offering in-game \"credits\" for purchase with real money (and I don't like where they are pushing the micro-transactions/DLC in gaming, in general), and they have online multiplayer locked behind a game code again.  I don't buy used, nor do I rent, but I can still understand how that is going to irritate a lot of people.But, none of that detracts from my joy that SSX is back, my favorite characters are back with it, and they even brought back most of what made Tricky great, as well.4 stars!I will update this review after I finish the game, if I come across any information that changes my opinion of the game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2012"}

The vehicles take 10 mins to get the hang of and the car handling is close to perfection. The missions are innovative by having to go up ramps to land on to a moving boat and jumping through moving trains and alot more.Most of the missions are impossible to do on your first go. I realy liked the James Bond type mission where your in a white sports car and your bombing it down the motorway whilsts dodging traffic then towards the end you go up a ramp to trash through office buildings windows. It gives you an addreneline rush especialy when on the motor way.The bad thing is the loading times take something like 20 secs and that's twice as long as your average game and it happens when failing a mission so frustration might creep in but I was always looking forward to starting again.Not all the driving bits are fun because you have to romote control your car in a birds eye view at 1 time and it tries to make you imagine the James Bond bit in Tommorow never dies or the world is not enough and it doesn't work.This is worth buying if your intested in stunts.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-29-2004"}

I've enjoyed some aspect of every entry in the series, but I'm still waiting for someone to present a \"perfect\" Twisted Metal game.I agree with other reviewers that the multi-player mode is simply awesome!! I love building and creating a stable of henchman that go out into the world to destroy other players. So much fun, quite challenging and almost makes up for the games other faults. A couple other new things I liked about the game was the ability to customize (to a degree) each car, and the ability to create your own soundtrack. I also liked that the version I bought came with \"Twisted Metal: Black\" as a free download.Where \"Twisted Metal\" falls apart for me is the central \"Story\" mode. Unlike previous entries where you could pick a car and try to complete the Twisted Metal tournament, the new \"Twisted Metal\" gives you one story, which starts off as Sweet Tooth, becomes Mr. Grimm, and wraps up as Doll Face. That's it. Axel doesn't get his own story, nor do Warthog, Outlaw or any other driver?!?! The individual stories have always been the backbone to the \"Twisted Metal\" series, the challenge to compete and win with every vehicle is the reason these games were never far from my console.

And Metriod other M was sopposed to be no exception because of how legendary the fanbase is and the fact that everybody waited years since the gamecube release(which was not bad at all really). Let us go further on to the point and explain why you should skip Metriod other M, and instead buy the classic gamecube version(15 dollars) and the SNES for WII Virtual console(15 dollars) besides you can play Metriod from gamecube on the WII.I played the whole entire game, there were 5 of the same enemy types the WHOLE ENTIRE GAME, which means all the enemies were generic in the fact that you travel through each element and it is the same monster painted differently but they use different elements which could give it replayability but in essence falls short due to lack of variation OF enemies.Last but not least is the cutscenes with robotic dialougue and uninspired voice acting which did not make me want to listen after playing for the first hour and a hafl. Also what will make most of the Metriod community mad is the fact you have to wait until you are authorized to use some of your weapons, yes you heard me right, AUTHORIZED because in the beginning Samus joins forces with the galactic police and the head officer has to authorize even though Samus is a lone bounty hunter. But the reason is because somehow there are hidden items and he needs to restrict you over time until he authorizes it.Nice try Team Ninja, no offense, but you RUINED this game, you are not clever, and you owe the gaming world an apology. Excellent graphics and good diolugue do not get you anywhere with this series, this is METRIOD. The fans desearved better than this, and of course this will get alot of sales because of the LOYALTY fans have, but fans will realize that this is Team Ninja's fault for not putting enough effort into different enemies, bad controls etc. All i can tell Team Ninja or anybody in their staff is to go back to making Ninja Gaiden and Dead Or Alive those are the only games you guys are auctully above average on.Also to Nintendo, they should have let Silicon Knights do a remake, or a sequel down the road, they certainly did a great job with Metal Gear Solid Twin Snakes(Technically a remake) for the gamecube.

{"product_name":"B004FUL9YW","description":"","reviewerName":"Gustavo \"VidGame Junkie\"","summary":"Prototype Evolved","reviewText":"Back in the days of Prototype, I was drawn into the theme of becoming a shapeshifting madman who could claw or pound his way through three New York block's full of infected people. When I heard that Prototype 2 was coming, I was surprised. Prototype 1 wasn't a perfect game, but it didn't really need a sequel. Apparently, it still got one anyway. After playing the game for about 6 months, I've started to like 2 better than 1. Shall we say...it has become much more EVOLVED.In a nutshell, you, once again, play as a prototype, only this time you play as a former soldier named James Heller. Story-wise, this was a wise decision for the game developers, seeing as that most players could have already leveled up Alex Mercer to the max in Pr1; can't really top it. So, get a new guy in, who is actually brought into the trade by the original. In gameplay, you rip through lines of soldiers, bring choppers out of the sky by ripping their tails off, and turn a person into a bomb....that's the fun part. The game is good for stress-relief; just take it out on the nearest tank. You can also consume others to fill your health and give you a disguise; wouldn't mind having that..minus actually consuming a real person.For those of you who are Prototype vets, here is what you can expect:Better power management: Remember when you had that long list of abilites for your claws that you could use xp on? Well that's been changed. All the actual \"moves\" of each shapeshifting weapon is imediately available, with upgrading things as range and damage available through earning xp. Instead of (for Xbox) combos for X button and combos for Y button for one power (which some you may never use), you get a multi-hit combo by mashing the button and a special move by holding it down, a pounce for claws and a shockwave for hammerfist for example. Plus, since each power only needs one button, you can assign a power to the X button and another for the Y button, so slash away and end with an earthquake! Now, this means you do get less moves for each power than in Pr1, but what they have in Pr2 are the best picks and all useful.Better power balance: Claws became easily useless when the blade was acquired, due to the blade's advantage in overall damage. In this game, each power is much more balanced, allowing uses for all powers in different situations.Better ways to take down a helicopter: In Prototype 1, some ways to take out vehicles was to hit it yourself, chuck something at it, or highjack it. Now, with a little adition to the leveling system, you can hit one button after grabbing a vehicle and highjack it, or rip its own weapon off and use it, or just destroy it right there.Mission-wise, don't expect too much different from Pr1. You go out, destroy stuff, consume people, cut a soldier in half, and some infiltration to bases here and there. What I dislike about Pr2 is that they don't offer bases to sneak into in free roam. Those are only available in main and side missions. But, you still have a good amount of fun in free roam as is.Over all, this game is a good sequel to its predecessor. It adds a lot more to the original construct, almost making you feel like a god when you get fully leveled up. It has good replay value thanks to the New Game+ feature. And, even after 6 months, I still find myself messing around in free roam like it never gets old. Sometimes it may, but it is a good long bit of gory entertainment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2012"}
