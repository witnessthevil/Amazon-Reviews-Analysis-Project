{"product_name":"B00004YUWA","description":"Icoweaves the tale of a young boy trying to escape his  imprisonment in a large, vacant castle. Along the way, he discovers another  captive--a beautiful princess named Yorda. Players control Ico with the goal of  escaping the castle with the princess safely in hand.Although it looks like an adventure game and has some rudimentary action  sequences, Ico is mostly about solving puzzles. Players will run, jump, and  climb their way through the gargantuan castle as well as figure out which  objects and environments are interactive. Yorda is very much a damsel in  distress, and isn't nearly as capable as Ico. A great deal of the puzzles  require the player to create a safe path for Yorda, who isn't physically able to  get to the places Ico can. The puzzles are quite brilliant, although a few are  so tough that players will feel like ditching the princess.Graphics, particularly the lighting effects and animations, are fantastic. The  developers did a superb job of conveying the enormity and beauty of the castle.  When Ico and Yorda move and interact, their actions seem totally lifelike. The  ambient soundtrack and simple controls let the player focus on the tasks at  hand. Sony has crafted a very unique game that anyone can play. Few games are as  elegant in their simplicity as this puzzler from Sony.--Raymond M.

Joining this list of games is \"ICO\" for the PS2. So what does \"ICO\" redefine in terms of innovation? The experience.\"ICO\" at its core is a platformer and puzzle-solver with some basic combat elements, but its deeper aspects make it far more than that. The title character, Ico, must lead a young girl called Yorda out of a rundown castle and protect her from shadow creatures that try to reclaim her. The gameplay is very simplistic and yet contains one of the richest experiences ever found in gaming. The way Ico leads Yorda around is so beautiful, so powerful than it makes the player forget that he's playing a game and is instead living a dream. The dual-shock controller adds to the experience by causing the player to \"feel\" Ico leading Yorda by the hand. Add in realistic body physics, and the feeling is one that remains etched in a player's memory.Adding to the unforgettable experience are superb graphics, some of the best the PS2 has seen. While the characters can look a little hazy sometimes, they always look, act, and seem real. The environment itself is a work of art. Unlike games like \"Myst\", where puzzles are just put there with no purpose other than to be solved, the castle is a living and breathing puzzle that is there for a purpose. Textures, lighting effects, and water effects all add to the magic the gameplay already casts.Soundwise, there isn't a lot of music in the game except during cutscenes, pause menu, and the ending. But had there been music duing gameplay, it might've actually ruined the experience. A whistling castle with dripping water, crackling fire, and the footsteps of Ico and Yorda is all that's needed here. It simply adds to the experience. Also, the original voices were left in the game, and subtitles have been provided.With all the good that \"ICO\" has, is there bad? Unfortunately, yes. The game is sadly quite short. Seasoned players can finish this game in 7-10 hours or even less, and replay value isn't very high for some players. The battles in \"ICO\" are very easys, usually requiring hack-slash-and-retreat tactics (although, personally, I feel a grandiose fighting system would've been ridiculous). Also, there is a small bug in which the pause menu sometimes pops up and freezes the game. I've only come across this once, but it is there.But in the end, \"ICO\" outshines all its faults. From beginning to end (the ending was one of the most satisfying endings I've ever seen in gaming, far more satisfying than the ending of \"Final Fantasy VII\"), \"ICO\" is a masterpiece, albeit sadly a short one. Some players will want to buy this game and relive the experience again and again. Others will only want to live it once through a rental. Either way, this game deserves to be played by anyone and everyone.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-19-2002"}

{"product_name":"B001YI0Z2U","description":"Blurring the borders of good and evil, this cinematic and stylized adventure stars Bayonetta, a heroine bent on sending supernatural forces to the depths of hell. Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Sexy, fun, and one of my favorite games of all time","reviewText":"The Good: Super sexy protagonist, great fighting system, lots of elements, epic boss fights, beautiful visuals and audio, excellent storyThe Bad: Brutal rating system, extremely frustrating, too few weapons, occasional technical hiccupWhen you think of sexy and video games they usually don't mix. There have been a lot of attempts at using sex to sell video games and while some were successful such as Dead or Alive, BloodRayne, and Tomb Raider some weren't such as Red Ninja, Cy Girls, and Rumble Roses. Where does this put Bayonetta? On top as queen and as one of (if not THE most) stylish, sexy, and witty female protagonists ever created in any media period.Being a good and bad Umbra witch trying to unlock her past. Bayonetta has witty dialog, and a super sexy British accent. I can't describe just how shocking Bayonetta is in terms of design. She is scantily clad in leather with proportionate breasts, has beautifully styled hair, glasses that look good. She just makes your heart throb when you see her, and no other female game character has done that for me. The cinematics in the game are very outlandish, outrageous, and just \"I can't believe they did that\".The game is developed by the lead designers of Devil May Cry and Resident Evil so if you are  Devil May Cry fan you know what to expect.My last note on the design of Bayonetta's sexiness is just how they incorporate it all into the game play from items to moves to summoning demons. One cut scene I can recall has Bayonetta sweating on a plane, and Luka watches the bead of sweat drip down her breast and drop down right off her nipple. All while the camera is zoomed in on this at a side angle. Necessary? Yes. Why? Because that is just what Bayonetta is all about. Non stop action with sex thrown in.Getting down to game play you fight the good-bad angels from summoning the Creator to merge all three realms: Purgatorio, Paradiso, and the human realm. All these creatures are amazingly designed and there are good 30 or so of them. Bayonetta fights with both her feet and hands. You can equip a normal weapon on her hands and either the shotgun or handguns to  her feet. Using the Y button uses her hands and B is her feet. The combos are deep and almost endless since you can hold buttons down to charge weapons or use X to just use the hand gun. Using Witch Time is a unique element that you must use at all times since time slows down for a few seconds if you evade at the right time and this is key on defeating certain enemies and bosses since some can't be beaten without it. This is also incorporated into puzzles as well, but they usually aren't all that hard to figure out.Unlocking weapons requires you to find pieces of LPs of angel hymns and bringing them back to to Rolin in the Gates of Hell bar. Here you can also buy items, accessories, alternative weapon designs and more. All items (like in Devil May Cry) give you either health, Witch Power, extra life and you get the idea. Each comes in a small and large form and costs a good amount of halos (the game's currency). There are only four different weapons: A whip, sword, guns, and Beowulf type claws. Thankfully you can have two different load outs and switch to them on the fly.Anyways, when you finish a batch of angels you will be scored based on your combo style, time, and damage taken and this affects your overall level score. If anyone is a Devil May Cry fan you will know this scoring system is brutal and impossible to score perfectly on every level. This is also Bayonetta's biggest flaw since a lot of the game is hair tearing, controller throwing, frustration inducing ulcers, especially when it comes to boss fights. There are five different medals you can get. Pure platinum, platinum, gold, silver, and bronze. Pure platinum consists of you getting the biggest combo style and killing all enemies in the shortest amount of time with taking no damage at all. Platinum consists of the same except you can take a little damage and so on and so forth. You are then ranked at the end of the level by these medals plus how many items you used and overall damage taken plus time and combo style. If you do poorly (like I managed) you can get a stone award. Even on normal I did my best and thought I was smokin' but I still managed to get stone awards at the end of every level.On another note the bosses are fun ad out of this world: They are ugly, big, and you just want to kill them. Each one is unique and one even has you riding around on a piece of debris in the ocean fighting a 200 foot sea creature. Epic? Sure it is and every second of the game is. Each boss and each fight consists of a little damage inducing, button mashing mini-game using Bayonetta's demons or torture attacks. For the larger enemies Bayonetta's hair turns into demons, and if you didn't know her clothes are also part of her hair. She goes into a sexy pose and her clothes are striped except hair swirling around her sweet spots and you can pulverize the enemy. Smaller enemies have torture attacks that are gruesome, some times sexy, and satisfying. This can be done by getting your Witch Power meter all the way up, but take a hit and it goes down. There is no magic in the game and you won't even remember since all the elements work well.On a lost note the game play is changed up in almost every level which leads to epic motorcycle riding levels, jumping across cars in traffic, shooting down enemies on a rocket flying through the air, and a whole lot more. There is even an arcade shooter in between levels that earns you points you can use to get items or exchange for halos. The game is chalk full of neat elements that has never been used in any game before (if so it is perfected here). If you want stylish over the top sexy action then look no further than Bayonetta.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

K \"Esco\"","summary":"If There's A Remake, Get It, Otherwise Skip This Title!","reviewText":"Let me start off by stating that I got this game with the strategy guide, and I have yet to see what any of the pages look like.  This game is painfully easy and un-advanced.In Japan, the gamers were able to play this much more like &quot;House of the Dead&quot; games, rather than in the US where it seems that Capcom wants to cash in on the American lust for first-person shooters.  The light gun is just something you CAN get for the PSX, but it isn't what you might call &quot;Standard Issue&quot; for the conventional hard-core gamer.  A light gun additive being required or at least allowed (I'm not sure if it is, a gun costs sometimes ..., and I have a few freinds who had problems playing this with it) would have made this SO MUCH BETTER!  Also, give us rapid fire for the guns!Also, while I have seen much worse, the graphics can use a serious polishing.  Also, the animation is distorted by the fully 3-D world, and the first person view destroys all fear techniques used so well before.The sound is terrible.  To start off, there is really no decent music like in RE's 2&amp;3, the music in here is really both bland and pathetic.  Also, the voice acting is pretty bad, but I'm sure that it would sound a whole lot better if it didn't sound like you were listening to them underwater. However, while the sound it awful, it's nowhere near as completely worthless as much as the sound in the first RE title(mainly the beyond dismal music and voice acting).Now, the story, well, actually, it's not so bad.  It does have a really good setup and a few good plot twists, and also the main character was told to investigate by his freind Leon S Kennedy (the hero of RE2 who could with one finger kick Chris Redfeild's ...!)!  Also, the area's that are only accessible through replay have some excellent files that rival the best of RE's 2&amp;3.  However, the decent (although terribly short) storyline is destroyed by all lack of realism in the gameplay.  I mean face it; you fight a Tyrant only 20 minutes into the game, the puzzles solve themselves, enemies can't hit you when they are directly behind you, and even if they could, you have SO MUCH health, and you generally start off in the same basic location when you start with your next &quot;life&quot;.All in all, this game is far from worthless, but even further from being able to hold onto the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; title it holds.  I liked the first one, I was blown away by the second, the third one rocked my world, and now...this.  I'm now just waiting for Code Veronica for the PS2, while playing something else.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2001"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

However, that being said, this game isn't exactly like GTA either...and I honestly loved it!First of all, it had a great story...I like that instead of the fact that you're actually a criminal like in GTA games, you're actually an undercover cop named Wei tyring to infiltrate the Triads.  I don't want to say too much about the story for those out there who haven't played it yet, but there are some surprising twists & turns along the way as you infiltrate deaper and deaper into the Triads.  It's a distant sequel to the Ps2/X-Box game True Crime...the company that previously had the franchise dropped it a while back, but eventually Square Enix was there to pick it up and they created this enjoyable working.The gameplay is tight and, while similar to GTA in many ways, it's also different and has it's own unique gameplay elements.  Such as the hand to hand martial arts combat, which was one of my favorite elements of the game.  I loved running around scrapping with 18K thugs & stuff...whooping @$$ using both sometimes brutal environmental attacks and with the variety of different martial arts moves you have at your disposal, (you can learn new ones as you go along from Wei's kung fu master as you retrieve various statues for him that have been stolen from him).  Shooting was fun too...much of it was similar to other shooting games I've played, but it brilliantly blended together elements from several different types of games, such as the slow motion shooting elements found in games like Max Payne to the cover system that can be found in games like GTA IV and Uncharted.  Driving was pretty cool too, and you can actually leap from your vehicle onto another and hijack them...an element which was seen in a couple of missions in GTA IV, but I don't recall having seen it much in many other games I've played.  There is also plenty of fun side stuff for Wei to do too...side quests, street races, courting women, purchasing clothes & vehicles, fights, drug busts, etc.To boil it all down, this is really a great game and is worth picking up for the great story and exciting gameplay.  I was hooked into this...I played one day I think for close to 10-12 hours, with little breaks in between a few times that day.  It's pretty engrossing.  I never finished all of the side quests, (I rarely ever do in these games as the main stories are usually my primary interest), but I did do a good chunk of them as I went along and most of it's pretty fun stuff.  GTA 5 is still a little ways off, and I was looking for something of that kind of caliber to play for now to kind of sate my appetite for now, and this game did that beautifully!

{"product_name":"B00005Y4Q1","description":"Unreal II: The Awakeningreturns to the fascinating futuristic setting ofUnreal, first visited in 1998. Since then we've had to content ourselves with the excellentUnreal Tournamentmultiplayer combat series. For this first true sequel Epic Games hired Legend Entertainment, who made a name for themselves with theUnreal: Return to Na Paliexpansion pack and the woefully underratedWheel of Timegame (based on the books by Robert Jordan). The result is fun and frantic, if a bit too short-lived.Unreal II's best feature is its lush graphics engine. It's state of the art. All the locations, which range from bizarre alien worlds to those based on the filmAlien, exude dynamic realism. Human and alien characters are well-animated and rendered, but have a cartoonish exaggeration that clashes with the realism of the architecture. The designers were undoubtedly shooting for a comic-book look, which explains why the women look like blow-up dolls with bare midriffs and the men have hulking muscles. The monsters, too, ripple with strength and menace. This style will please some, but is less effective than the more realistic styles employed by similar titles--although at least the art direction is consistent throughout the game.Unrealcast you as a prisoner who--through both good and bad luck--was freed from confinement, but marooned on an alien world. He goes on to become a sort of messiah figure to the four-armed natives, while other, scarier, natives want to kill him. It ends with a cliffhanger that this game does nothing to resolve. Now, you play as a new character who works for the Terran Colonial Authority. You're a space marshal on the ship Atlantis. You and your buxom partner, who looks more like an exotic dancer than a police woman, have to solve problems in a game only tenuously connected with the originalUnreal.Core gameplay and mission design are good, but uninspired. Legend has taken a conservative, almost minimalist approach.

At the moment this is how I feel:I'm a witch doctor that does 35k damage with stacks, 44k health, 700-800all resist, took out inferno butcher in 7 seconds.I know this game is suppose to have numerous patches to even up the odds and make things more reasonable, but it is so absurdly unbalance it almost feels like they didn't even really test it out. Honestly, when I heard Jay Wilson say he let the best players at blizzard try the game out and double the difficulty, I thought that was a really [not so smart] comment. We waited how long and they still couldn't at least test it out better?1. Monsters: Blizzard's attempt in being creative has made this game a joke, a very bad, unbalanced joke. Vortex and mortar has made it so that if you're a range champion that can't get close cause you'll get slaughtered, now if you're far you'll get slaughtered too. They've developed ridiculous OP abilities for these monsters. Laser, vortex, ice bomb, mortar, teleport, waller, invincibility, shield, etc (not getting technical with the actual names).2. Easy mode is too easy and inferno mode is too hard. Easy mode bores me to death while inferno mode I can't find a random team that can even survive act 2....WE UNDERSTAND THAT INFERNO NEEDS TO BE CHALLENGING! But this is not fun kind of challenging. It's just mindless death due to the game being absurdly, ridiculously, hilariously unbalanced. This is the consensus of many many players that I've played with in random games. Running for your life all day gets old. They said you're suppose to farm hell difficulty in order to get geared for inferno, I saw what hell mobs drop, you have to farm months before you get anything worthwhile, again to the auction house. Gameplay for melee characters are especially rough.3. Items are too randomized. Remember back in Diablo 2 where when you want an item like an SOJ, you just go ask for one? Now you have to deal with 1000++ different kinds of sojs. This also sucks for magic finding (which leads me to number 4 btw) because there's so much randomness that finding a good item is even harder because of having so many variables.4. Again I know they will patch it ONE DAY, but atm, in order to do inferno act 1 and especially 2, you need items from inferno act 4, which makes no sense. You need to kill elites in order to get the items that you really need to kill THOSE elites..... Even so, I've done countless MF runs and pretty much 99% of the items I find, I can't really use. 190 DPS sword in inferno? Really?!? The game obviously has set it so that you're forced to visit the auction house to even try to stay relevant, which just puts money into blizzard's pockets and I think that whole marketing concept is just low. Which leads me to number 5.5. So only way to stay relevant is to stay in the auction house all day long in hopes of finding an item for a reasonable price cause there's ridiculous pricing going around like 90 mil for a ring or a good item. Even when you get the item you worked so long to get, sometimes it barely changes the game cause mobs in inferno is so hard that they take you out anyhow. Saving your tushie off has now helped you to survive a mob for 0.3 seconds longer!6. Because you can't survive even though you have so much health and resist, which was recommended to you for survivability, you now have to revert to building a glass cannon build and kite your **** off all day in order to get horrible items. So the game consists of running for your life, stop, shoot, die, revive, run for your life some more and repeat. For melee characters that were suppose to be able to take hits, they now find themselves unable to do so even when they have tons of life and resist and the only option is to hit and run as well. Act 2 inferno is beyond belief.The advancement from Diablo 1 to Diablo 2 were easily seen and done, but from Diablo 2's amazingly deep and addictive gameplay, Diablo 3 just couldn't advance far enough to live up to the name.Diablo 3 lacks many other things as well such as randomized levels. Now the levels are not as randomized. Like if an entrance is usually at the top of the map, if you start a new game, the level will look slightly different but the entrance will still be around the general area or areas.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-03-2012"}

So I stayed away from this one due to the awful rep. of comic book and movie adaptions. But after reading nothing but good stuff about it and how the critics raved it to be a must have, I went and got it. I was very excited to wear the cape and be the most iconic superhero to ever grace our imaginations. And at first all seemed well, then I got to see the first cut-scene, bats and jokes look okay but the rest are all SURPRISED or something, I mean I know these are only filler characters but it is really annoying to me, I mean how could you put out a serious game with all your characters looking like they just put their finger in a light socket?  So I was gonna let that slide, then the boredom set in, I made it about halfway through until I just couldnt stay awake anymore. The game tries to throw some interesting things your way, but you can see it coming a mile away, and for a prison there sure isnt much in \"finding\" a route to some unreachable place, there is always a heating duct to get in, and all of these are the same.  The boss battles even worse, they look nice but are easy and uneventful. This feels to me like a straight run through beat `em up and move on. I really feel it deserved more attention to almost every level, and there should have been more to do then just run around looking for the next heating duct. The fighting system is okay but that gets boring pretty quick too, you can only press the same button so many times before you say, well is there something more?

It was a break through game much like DOOM, but didn't take itself seriously at all. And that was the fun of the game, using the urinals, cursing(though not as much as in this one), putting money in strippers crotches, looking in the mirror at yourself, taking speed, etc etc. The game is meant to be offensive and fun, which it is, plain and simple. The gameplay is just like it was, even more stupid than before. The graphics look great, just like the usual 2K games, Bioshock, Prey, Borderlands etc. So critics and fans need to quit wining about how stupid the game is, when the original was the exact same thing, download it from Xbox Live and you'll see what i mean. Sure there isn't much new, or a great story but thats the whole point. I loved started the game by pissing, something that's missing though is when you would shoot the monsters in the original, they would take dumps. There was a mod disc where you could tweak everything, and make it so overboard it was beyond annoying, but it was a blast! I wish they had that on this one, and maybe they will. It actually said set the number of turds when aliens are killed, you could put up to 200 or so, number or ribs, heads, arms, torsos, etc! So yeah this is a REAL serious game for REAL serious gamers. Give me a break, it's for the people who know and loved the other games. As i did, and i love this one as well. It's a nice break from the mundane COD, BF 1 and 2 type games everyone plays, including myself. So lighten up, have some fun, and quit worrying about stories, plots and have some offensive fun. Actually i found the girls pretty damn hot, for AI Programs!! ha. LaterBtw-The plot to the game is \"Damn, Those Alien B#%tards Are Gonna Pay For Shooten Up My Ride\", and \"It's Time To Kick Ass And Chew Bubble Gum, And I'm All Outta Gum\".

A gorgeous game with amazing (and sometimes questionable) character designs, a deep fighting system and horrible dialogue.I'll tackle the negatives first:The game could almost be considered too deep.  This game is just ok if you rarely play fighting games.  Compared to a fighter like Smash Brothers, this is more about actual focus and knowing button combos that will truly punish your opponents.  But it seems that the fighting genre really caters to a hardcore demographic who is going to sit and play for hours, rather than the casual gamer.The \"plot\" is incredibly cheesy and full of holes and nonsequiters.  Of course, you'd have to forgive a game that shoehorns Vader and Yoda into a mystical realm where two super-weapons (Soul Edge and Soul Calibur) are being fought over.And speaking of those extra characters: Vader has been made a \"buyable\" character in the Xbox marketplace, so technically this game now has both characters.  In addition is the Dark Apprentice, who is probably the cheapest character in this game, and one of the cheapest I've ever played against.  He blocks and dodges and then opens up ridiculous combos and is an incredibly frustrating opponent.  Ironically, it seems like Vader and Yoda have the most trouble against the Apprentice.Now for the good:  While the Apprentice is a cheap mother, the variety of characters is an overall asset in the game.  On top of that you have the character creation in which you can create a character from the ground up, choosing a fighting style, area of emphasis (defense, offense, etc).  And you can build and develop your character as they improve by winning fights and completing objectives (like blocking or attacking in certain ways, or breaking an opponents soul gauge).  There are many buyable (within the game, and also with MS points) items that can also adjust your character.  The only complaint I have is, though you may have a custom character, you'll probably wind up having a hodgepodge of armor and clothing in order to get the best fighting configuration, so you'll wind up looking like a dork but winning lots of fights.This game plays great!  While the load times are a little annoying (especially in \"tower mode\" where you fight in a very long sequence of ever more challenging battles), the actual fighting is precise, fast and fun.  The fighting animations are as great as they've ever been, the graphics quality is some of the highest on the system.  Only games like Gears of War get better, but GOW is all greys and blacks, not the vibrant and diverse world of Soul Calibur.Four stars for a great installment, I take away one star because they still haven't changed the annoying parts of the gaming franchise.  As a game, this is a great one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Bioshock 2 Review","reviewText":"I literally played BioShock and BioShock back to back so my experience in Rapture was both fresh in my mind and confusing. In BioShock 2 you are one of the first Big Daddys named Delta. You have awoken from your slumber on a mission to find the little sister that you were paired with. You'll have to go all through Rapture to find her, but you'll have to try to stop the minions of Sophia Lamb, a person who was apparently still running things in Rapture after Atlas and Andrew Ryan met their bitter end. You'll get to utilize the drill as well as a wide variety of weapons, and some very familiar plasmid. You'll also get a chance to interact even more with the little sisters who still hunger for the Adam found in the corpses found throughout the game.Graphically I have to say I thought BioShock looked good, but the second one looked even better. There was a sort of I've seen this before kind of feel, but at the same time it looked great. The parts where you actually get to go outside and walk the ocean floor also gave us a taste of how much this game could do graphically. The enemy designs really didn't change all that much, but there were a couple of new enemies that you had to get through to survive.The music was still that 40's-esque music that was haunting and eerie, and yet fit the game perfectly. There was also the ambient noises of the splicers whispering and threatening to keep you on your toes. I do have to say that the voice acting was still top notch for this title.So the control layout changed ever so slightly. Gone is the ability to accidentally consume eve over and over again as you're trying to hack a security bot. You'll have to open up one of the radial menus with the left or right bumper to refill your eve, unless you want to wait till it runs out and then you'll automatically do it. There was also a change to how you replenished your health, no longer were you using the X button but the right direction on the d-pad.So you've been re-born, in a sense, in rapture, and find out that there is only one person who can make you feel whole, and ironically its the daughter of the one person that you wish you could avoid at all cost, Sophia Lamb. Sophia Lamb is apparently someone with high ambitions who wanted to make the perfect utopian to create an example for all, but with all the power hungry struggling within all the different groups she was cast out, and then came back after the fall of Atlas and Andrew Ryan. She's the reason why you had to be \"re-born\". You'll have to fight your way through different sections of Rapture, most of them are areas not seen in the first game. Also apparently everything is connected by an underwater trolley, a piece that wasn't in the first game. You'll once again have the chance to add different plasmids ranging from fire, ice, electricity, swarm, and more. You will also have upgradeable weapons at your disposal (shotguns, speargun, rivet gun, launcher, etc). One thing I do have to say is that once again you'll have a camera to capture your enemies so that you can slowly get upgrades, but this time around its a video camera, and I personally felt that it was a much better fit for what it needed to accomplish. There's so much that I wish I could talk about for this game, but to do so would be giving away key parts to the story. What I can say is that there's going to be at least a couple of twists, you'll be faced with some moral choices (most revolving around little sisters), and you're going to be drawn into this underwater city. This of course will keep you playing for hours.BioShock 2 continues with a strong story, beautiful graphics, and the depth to draw you in start to finish. Sure there are some small little quirks in the game, especially when it comes to the audio recordings you find throughout the game repeating at weird times, but that's no where enough to keep you from enjoying this game. If you like first person shooters with a little bit of a 1940 twist, and lots of enemies coming out you, you'll like this game. This game gets a 9.3 out of 10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Stoffer","summary":"Fable 2: Short & Sweet","reviewText":"First of all, the game has excellent graphics, very crisp, beautiful, and detailed. Maybe not quite on the level of Assassin's Creed 2 or Gears of War 2, but definitly better than average.The gameplay is pretty simple, to be quite honest it's a bit of a button masher, it reminded me a bit of Kingdom Hearts or even Baldur's Gate.You can carry only one short-range, and one long-range weapon at a time, but there is a variety of upgrades you can purchase through out the game. For short-range you'll have options like the bow, pistol, and crossbow. For long-range you'll have options like the sword, scimitar, and cutlass.The story is, without a doubt, the failure of the game. Very predictable, way too short, and extremly stupid to be frank.The best part of this RPG is that you definitly have control over everything. You can buy tattoos, haircuts, wardrobes, weapons, foods, all of the above. You can have several girlfriends and homes and can even change your sex in the game if you complete a certain quest.All in all, this game is great for any true RPG gamer, but the main problem I've been hearing, and can agree with, is that the story and length of the actual game is just too darn short, but besides that Fable 2 is sweet.Games to compare to: Oblivion IV, Fallout 3, & Dragon Age Origins.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2009"}

Legendary mode can be a challenge. You will want to use the roll move over and over on legendary. The story is almost a complete copy of the movie Gladiator though other than that it is fun. The problem I have is the enemies. All of the enemies look the same. They use the same skin for each different type of enemy. This is quite lazy for a big AAA title such as this one for Xbox. The combat can get very repetitive too. Using the same executions over and over can become exhausting to be honest. You almost want to just kill them regularly after a certain point. You do get additional points for using the executions however. It is even more evident of repetitiveness in the multiplayer. I became bored quickly with the multiplayer.

{"product_name":"B0065NP6NC","description":"","reviewerName":"Annihilatrix1138","summary":"All Roads Lead Home","reviewText":"There's one crucial element that's somehow gone missing from most modern RPGs: the actual ability to role-play. You can play as Commander Shepard, but you can't do anything a Spectre wouldn't do. You can play as Geralt of Rivia, but you can't do anything a Witcher wouldn't do. Developers have *developed* a nasty habit of creating games that force players into a role and then tell them that they're role-playing. Maybe you are, but in that case I think our definitions might differ.The opening moments of FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS see you shot in the head and left buried in a shallow grave somewhere in the Mojave Desert. Somehow still clinging to life, you're rescued and brought to the town of Goodsprings, where the local doctor fixes you up and sends you on your way. This is where the magic of the game reveals itself, because you have a few options here: Investigate the reasons why you were shot; Set out to get revenge on the people who left you for dead; Stick around and help out the denizens of Goodsprings; Strike out into the Mojave Wasteland blindly and forget that this whole ordeal ever went down. What happened to you was unavoidable, but everything that happens now is completely up to you.The fantastic thing about NEW VEGAS is that it allows for so much. You really can do almost anything that you feel like. Gamble in a casino/Rob a casino. Explore abandoned homes/Break into occupied homes. Retrieve a rare item for an NPC/Shoot him in the back, take the reward, and the rare item. Pick out a nice house or apartment somewhere in the Mojave Wasteland and decorate it with all of the neat items you've accumulated. Help out several different warring factions, and then betray them all. Or you can just explore at random, discovering powerful or rare items along the way, or a series of quests that you never would've found otherwise.Obsidian Entertainment went into this project knowing full well what players want out of a game like this. A heavily branched main storyline with several different outcomes; warring factions that can be played against each other; emphasis on choice, immersion, and exploration. If you go out of your way to explore some lone compound, an abandoned apartment complex, or a cave system, there's always something to be found, whether it's a new questline or a rare item. The game does an excellent job of rewarding you for being a little adventurous.That's the base game: a well-written, dialogue heavy, well-executed post-apocalyptic RPG that might never be truly appreciated for the freedom and immersion that it extravagantly imparts to its players. As is, it's still one of the best games I've ever played, and one that you can believe the creators of PLANESCAPE: TORMENT and the original FALLOUT games had a hand in. And like I said, that's the base game.-DEAD MONEY (4/5 Stars): This was the first expansion to be released for NEW VEGAS, and although it's by far my favorite out of the bunch, there are a few elements that might put off a few players. For one, this is a survival game, through and through. You wake up in the shadow of a mythical casino, stripped of all your items, forced under penalty of death to break into a vault. It's a very stressful experience, compounded by the extreme rarity of life-saving items, weapons of any kind, and how your primary enemies have to be dismembered before they stay dead. That, and after you're finished, you can't go back and explore, so it all has to be done in one shot.But that all kinda folds into the story of DEAD MONEY, which I'd go out on a limb and say has some of the best writing of any game of this generation. It's a story of greed; that you're essentially being punished for doing things that you always do in an RPG. It has a lot to say, which surprised the heck out of me. The characters you come into contact with are memorable, complex, and just plain fantastic to talk to. And the payoff to the entire thing is just brilliant. The path to the Sierra Madre is an uneven one, but wholly memorable. The words \"Begin Again\" will likely stick with you for some time.-HONEST HEARTS (3/5 Stars): Out of the bunch, HONEST HEARTS is probably the weakest. It starts out with a bang, after a caravan you're tasked with protecting ends up biting the dust, leaving you stranded in the Zion National Park. Afterwards, you're quickly caught in the crossfire between several warring tribes, with you becoming the decider in the matter. The whole ordeal is painfully short - only two hours compared to the others which provide eight or more - and the characters that guide you along aren't the most interesting, which the exception of Joshua Graham. There's no shortage of places to explore, and you can come and go as you please when the story is completed, but I'd say Zion itself is the most valuable contribution this expansion makes.-OLD WORLD BLUES (5/5 Stars): If I hadn't been so taken by the story of DEAD MONEY, this one would take top honors from me. Channeling the zany, nonsensical, nuclear-obsessed sci-fi of the '50s, OLD WORLD BLUES is definitely the most entertaining of the bunch and definitely provides the most distractions. After waking up in the Big Empty, you discover that you've lost your mind. Literally. Your brain is gone, and your mad scientist-cum-cyborg keepers have no idea where it is, or even how you're still alive. \"Tesla coils!\" is the typical answer here, and they don't get any less hilarious as the story progresses. While the tone is generally humorous, there are some genuinely sentimental (if not full blown sad) moments throughout, making this an A+ effort all around.-LONESOME ROAD (4/5 Stars): If you pay close attention through the base game and the expansions, you'll know that *all of it* has been building to this ending, but even if you miss all of the little visual/story cues, this is still a worthy conclusion. You'll learn about a man named Ulysses, and how he's the reason you were shot in the head in the first place. The man wants you dead, and he's wanted it for a very long time. But Ulysses is not content with telling you; he wants to show you, and the only way to do that is by following him through the dust-swept ruins of the Divide. The level design is a tad linear (intentional, I know), and since Ulysses is one of two NPCs available to talk to, the expansion might feel like one big running-and-gunning sequence. But this is an add-on that really wanted to drive home the RPG mantra that your decisions matter, and it does so in a powerful way.-COURIER'S STASH/GUN RUNNERS' ARSENAL: These aren't really story expansions or anything. When the game was released, there was dealer specific DLC that's pretty much been bundled up and placed into these add-ons. In addition to providing a ton of new and unique weapons, it also adds new achievements and challenges (and crafting recipes, I believe). Not amazing or anything, but very nice to have in the package.In closing, I think your enjoyment of this game will be depend on what you want out of an RPG. This Ultimate Edition of FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS provides hundreds of hours of content, a plethora of very compelling storylines, memorable characters, tons of weapons, and maintains the illusion of choice so well it'll be hard to imagine other players could possibly play the same game you have.FALLOUT 3might have brought the series/formula to the new generation, but FALLOUT: NEW VEGAS takes that formula, perfects it and somehow manages to create one of the best RPGs in a very long time.If Obsidian Entertainment hasn't taken a bow already, they're about due for one now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2012"}

While all have their specific qualities that stand out from the rest, I would have to rank this one last.  Despite an astonishingly large array of characters, with 10 of them being unlockable, I only found 2 to be fluent enough in style to match with the characters or Virtua Fighter 4 or Soul Caliber 2.  Those characters were Yoshimitsu and Christie.  While the others are clunky, the AI gives you back the advantage by being sub-par, although sometimes they like to throw in several cheap shots if you are one hit away from victory.  The graphics are average, but the music is very cheesy, and instantly goes to a specific chord when someone is defeated, no matter how awkward it may sound.  One the plus side, Tekken 4 has a bevy of modes, including an arcade mode, a mode that is essentially the Tekken Tournament, a survival mode, and a mode where you fight hordes of minions with your fighting skills.  The difficulty curve is not too intense as to blow you away, and you can unlock most of the character's endings with relative ease, some seriousm, and some surprisingly comedic.  I managed to unlock the majority of the endings within a five day rental, and I suggest that you rent it as well.  Despite it being worth playing, purchasing it unless you are a true Tekken fan or you truly enjoy the game, is a waste of money.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2004"}

That holds true to Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter.  This is not a game that allows players to simply charge in, guns blazing.  That approach will most certainly get you killed.  Rather, you are tasked with strategically staging attacks on the enemy.  This includes utilization of UAVs (drones), air support, etc. as well as your squadmates.  You are the team commander.  You can give your team commands such as \"go to\", \"follow\", \"recon mode\" and \"weapons free\".  Your AI controlled mates, however, are not so smart for being in such an elite squad.  I mean, they tend to get a fair amount of kills, which is good.  They tend to obey your commands as they should, which is good.  However, they seem to lack the brainpower to stay in cover when it's necessary and, as a result, usually end up lying on the ground waiting for you to heal them.  The enemy is not forgiving, either.  You can only absorb a couple of shots at best until you are dead.  There is no \"easy\" level on this game.  Only \"normal\" and \"hard\".  Thus, if you're not the type that enjoys a bit of a challenge, look elsewhere.  The story is forgettable, but the voice acting is strong.  The controls are tight and work well.  And this game is very pretty.  The visuals are very good for a game released early into the next gen consoles lives.  The sequel to this game, GRAW2 out does the first installment in almost every way, so if you enjoy this one, you'll love it's sequel.  Don't let that detract you from starting with GRAW, however...you won't be sorry for picking this game up.

Why?Because even non-gamers can enjoy this game. I played this in my living room with my family sit and watch. My parents thought it was an animated movie at first.Now back to the game. I'll only talk about the single-player mode here. I haven't touched the multi-player yet due to my lousy internet connection lately.Pros:- As I said, non-gamers can enjoy. That means the story, graphics, and sounds are top-notch.- Full of actions and adrenaline-rush moments.- The length of the campaign (8-10 hours) and the difficulty of the puzzle solving are just right.- The shooting is more challenging. Enemies will duck, dodge, flank, and flush you out of the cover. You can't just stick to one cover and carefully place the head-shots. Running-and-gunning or Mexican-stand-off won't do you much good either. But that adds the fun.Cons:- Besides harder mode, there's no unlockable after beating the single-player. Special guns or infinite ammo would be nice.- Animations and cover/jump snapping could feel a bit clumsy. You'll ended up reacting to or jumping on the object next to the one you want from time to time.- Aiming feels kinda stiff, especially when moving the reticle diagonally. Adjusting the aiming sensitivity doesn't help.In conclusion:The single-player alone is worth the full price. Buy it, PS3 owners. If you're a new-comer, buying all 3 games in the series and playing them in order is highly recommended.

Think, as others have pointed out, a combination of Borderlands and Left For Dead.  There are a lot of  similarities with Borderlands in the way weapons, quests, and skills are organized.  This is one big open sand box to play in, where the main storyline and lots of sub-stories combine to form quite a plot of treasure hunting, leveling up, and \"helping others\".I currently am playing as Xian Mei, who has serious knife and sharp object skills.  The fight sequences are super fun, with visceral and gory killing. Early on, you find out that kicking and punching can be effective methods for moving people away from you or even giving enough damage to kill them.  Later, and as your weapons get a bit more powerful and durable, you can find ways to inflict critical damage in as little as one blow.  Xian Mei's \"rage\" skill is \"go psycho\" with a sharp object.  It works pretty well most of the time.The zombies are just about right in speed, attention level, and swarming.  You can be pleasantly surprised when things seem out of control.There is crafting in Dead Island.  Collect EVERYTHING.  You may need it to make something really fun later on.  There does not seem to be a limit to the stuff you can collect, but there are only a limited number of (expandable) weapon slots.  As for equipping slots, there are some minor annoyances in changing weapons, notably when you pick up something new.  Pick up some booze and all of a sudden you are drinking and getting woozy from it going into a slot.  I would prefer a simple selection and a way to rotate certain weapons on the fly.  Additionally, weapons have different durability settings and repairs are required.The reward system is very good, with relatively easy cash to be found and gained, along with leveling up on a regular basis.  Leveling provides multiple skill trees and while I have not made it much past the second or third level on a couple, the skills are useful and do work as they indicate.  Skill trees are generally categorized under \"Rage\", Combat or Weapons Skills, and Survival.If I had a wish it would be that the vehicles drove like they did on Borderlands. The WASD keyboard functions are not as simple as pointing with a mouse and driving forward and backwards with the W and S keys.  The Borderlands mouse driven vehicle control was superior to anything done in the past and made for some real fun in running things down.  I have not tried driving with an Xbox controller yet, maybe that will improve the feel.The graphics are rich on the computers I have tried this game on. An Asus G53JW equipped with a Nvidia GTX-460M and an Alienware M11X with a Nvidia GT540M.  The Asus runs a bit higher FPS, but both systems can keep up just fine.  Initial release problems seem to have been resolved pretty quickly by the developer.Dead Island is a highly addictive visceral game with some real fun at times.  Highly recommended if you liked Borderlands!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001NX4DUQ","reviewerName":"Chris","summary":"One helluva good time","reviewText":"Let me start off by saying I am a GOW fan.  Like, diehard.  So I'm pretty critical when I hear the term \"GOW clone\" because, a, I compare all hack-n-slash titles to the series and, b, I'm a diehard fan when I find a game I j'adore.  That said, after seeing the truly E P I C trailers for Dante's Inferno, and knowing the story somewhat, and for the surprisingly decent price I decided what the hell (pun intended), I'll buy it and try it out.  Boy, am I glad I did...First off, Dante's Inferno does possess elements that are attributed to GOW.  That's not saying it's a true knock-off because there are elements to this title that are truly its own thing, but that's not denying its similarities to the aforementioned acclaimed series either.  Still, that being said, at least the developers decided to copy the formula that is THE definitive hack-n-slash formula because Dante's Inferno, even for a hardened GOW fan like myself, is still one helluva good time.  I'd have to go so far as to say that Dante's Inferno pretty much almost equals the epic awesomeness of GOW if it weren't for the obvious knock-offs here and there.Graphics-Literally, some of the best I've seen and I'd stake my name on them being equally as good as anything else out there.  They're smooth, polished and extremely detailed.  I love how the cartoon-esque traditionally animated cutscenes play into the story because they offer a completely immersing and unique backstory narrative.  The occasional CGI movie cutscene also are truly beautiful, and it's apparent the developers invested a lot of money into the game.  I'd conclude graphics are as perfect as one can expect from this generation, rivaling -and at times surpassing- the equally amazing Uncharted 2.Story-It's a story we all know, even if we don't think that we do.  Dante's Inferno is rank with gore and blood.  This is presented EVERYWHERE, and the game achieves its M rating for a reason.  By far the most entertainingly, outrageously M game I've played...  It's kind of surprising developers didn't jump on the story before this because it's one that was just made for video games (or TV).  While it doesn't follow Dante's Inferno the book (naturally...) exactly, the developers really went the extra mile to create an immersing experience nonetheless, which -in my opinion- made Dante's Inferno the game better than the story we all know of from the book.Gameplay-Ah yes, this is where Dante's Inferno slides alongside GOW and where the haters hate the most about.  Third person fixed camera?  Check.  Gore?  Check.  One angry, extremely kick ass guy?  Check.  Sound like GOW?  Ok, ok, the gameplay is extremely similar to GOW and I won't deny it, however, it's still enjoyable as ever.  While some people would complain about how similar gameplay is, I don't get why they can't just enjoy the smooth controls and takedown sequences we've all come to know and love from GOW.  They're practically the same, so what's there to hate?  Just because Dante's Inferno developers partook most in this area doesn't mean the game isn't enjoyable.  Good thing they stole from the best because the best is the best for a reason.In the end, whether you're a fan or not of the title, don't let biased, erroneous judgement based solely on the fact Dante's Inferno plays almost exactly like GOW affect your judgement whether or not to pick up the game.  The only part I felt could've been left out (to DLC territory) was the malebolge section (honestly, 10 of those are just uncalled for).  Overall, thought, Dante's Inferno is truly an epic experience with great gameplay (snatched right from the equally amazing GOW series), amazing graphics, great storytelling and epic cutscenes, and one all fans of hack-n-slash games can enjoy.  Trust me, you'll have one helluva good time!Oh, and the \"Bad Nanny\" trophy is completely shocking, but oh so fun!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-31-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2DTA","reviewerName":"S P","summary":"A Partial Step Forward","reviewText":"Final Fantasy XIII is a strange contradiction: a step backward in game structure, but an advancement in graphical polish and cinematic quality. The game simply doesn't have the depth of previous installments. The battles are simpler and can even be automated, while the plot progression and navigation follow along a strictly linear path. There is no exploration to be had or curiosity to be satisfied. This design approach leaves me at a loss, because the potential was clearly there to build massive, immersive 3D worlds. If the company can demonstrate Final Fantasy VII in HD, surely they can bring the fascinating concepts of that game to their modern productions.Much has been made of the series becoming more marketable, or mainstream. First off, I think many conclusions about the progression of the series are based on faulty data. Most of the installments have sold very, very well. Final Fantasy is one of the best-selling franchises outside of the profligate Wii titles. Final Fantasy VII was one of the best-selling games on the PlayStation. There was, and is, a market for legitimate titles in this series. I don't expect that to change any time soon. More to the point of XIII specifically, many of the changes can simply improve the series, so long as gameplay remains strong.The graphics in this title are stunning. They set a new standard for what I expect from blockbuster titles. The graphical style seemed to have been planned meticulously, and the cutscenes are truly of cinematic quality. You have to credit Square Enix for bringing these kind of graphics to aging consoles. These presentational advances do give me hope for the future of the series. Square Enix surely realizes the mixed reception this game received, especially for one as hyped and long-coming as this. I trust them to bring back the power and enjoyability of the job and turn systems from older entries, while continuing to push ahead with beautiful worlds. I can't wait to see the middle ages in HD.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2012"}

It's quite clear that the Vita is not exactly an inexpensive purchase after you figure in the cost of the system, memory card, games and accessories, but I honestly think it's well worth it if you have the money to spend. The Vita is a classy handheld device, thanks to a beautiful high quality OLED screen, impressive technical specs that allow stunning graphics to be displayed, and it just feels like a pretty well put together product. The OS is generally very responsive and quick, which is because of the intuitive touch controls that allow everything to be very snappy. From the hardware to the software, the Vita is a slick package.Onto the game library thus far, I must admit I'm impressed.Uncharted: Golden Abyss - Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful. Crisp and detailed visuals, fun and interesting story, and much, much more. This is the game to own right now.Wipeout 2048 - Like Uncharted, this is another beautiful game. It doesn't run at 60 frames-per-second, only 30 frames-per-second, and the loading times, even post-patch, can be a tad bit lengthy, but it's worth it because this is a very slick and fun racing game.Rayman Origins - A stellar platforming game regardless of which platform you buy it for. The Vita version is especially gorgeous on the OLED screen.Lumines: Electronic Symphony - It's more Lumines, which is a good thing. Excellent music and visuals make this one puzzle game that you shouldn't miss out on.Shinobido II: Revenge of Zen - Excellent stealth adventure game for Tenchu fans. It has some quirks, like a dodgy camera and silly artificial intelligence, but it's a great game regardless.Touch My Katamari - Definitely the craziest Katamari game to date. The cutscenes provide some good entertainment. The controls work very well. Though it's not a very lengthy game.Those are the games I own so far and I'm very impressed with the lineup to date. In addition, more Vita games are in the pipeline for the coming months, which include Unit 13, Resistance: Burning Skies, Gravity Rush, Disgaea 3: Absence of Detention, Mortal Kombat, Ridge Racer, Warrior's Lair, just to name a few.As you can see, the Vita definitely has what it takes to be an excellent handheld device for many years to come.

The gameplay of the main game is very similar in style, and I was thrilled to see that they stayed so true to what I was hoping to find.Even better, the old style of short levels works wonderfully with a Nintendo DS, since it lets you play in short bursts while you're out and just have a couple of minutes, without worrying about whether you can remember where you are in some kind of complex plotline.  You can open it up, be having fun immediately, and put it on hold at any time by just closing the DS.It also has a selection of cute mini-games that are fun and sometimes make creative use of the special qualities of the DS.  There's a \"whack-a-mole\" style game, for example, that focuses on quickly tapping the moles with a stylus as they appear (and avoiding tapping Luigi when he does).It's also an easy game to follow even if you can't read or execute complex reasoning.

It's what introduced me to fighting games, as well as many others, and still defines what 2-D fighting is today. All these years later, Capcom unleashes Street Fighter IV, which combines all the old school elements you know and love with a glossy, next-gen look and feel; and the end result is one of the absolute best fighting games on the market right now. Very accessible yet deep and complex, Street Fighter IV brings back all twelve warriors from Street Fighter II, and throws in six new ones as well, including a powerful end boss. The first thing you'll notice when powering up the game is that there is some seriously stylish animation and absolutely gorgeous, flowing graphics. In fact, for a 2-D game, the overall presentation is a pure work of art in itself that looks and plays better than most current 3-D fighters. The single-player mode is fun, but the real meat and potatoes of Street Fighter IV lie in the online multiplayer modes, even if it is occasionally laggy. There's also unlockable fan favorite fighters like Akuma, Sakura, Cammy, and even Dan; all of which combines to offer a ton of replay value. All in all, Street Fighter IV is a pure blast that you will enjoy for a good, long time; and is right now the best current fighting game on the market, and it wholeheartedly deserves your attention whether you're a longtime fan of the long running series or a newcomer.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-25-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVS4","description":"NES","reviewerName":"BX Lounger","summary":"The same ol' game","reviewText":"After the excellent Mega Man 3, Capcom kept with the gamers' demand for more of the Blue Bomber. In 1992, they released Mega Man 4 for the NES. While it was more of the same, they kept the game fresh with more variety in the stages and a difficulty level that was tougher than what gamers saw in the previous game. It was worth it and everyone was happy that Mega Man kept on going.The story is short and sweet: A new scientist, Dr. Cossack challenged Mega Man to defeat his batch of Robot Masters and then to see him in his castle. Of course, Mega Man does what he has to do. No one was surprised to see that Dr. Wily put him up to up since he kidnapped his daughter. In the end, you face Dr. Wily in his own castle for the final showdown. The setup was the same like the other Mega Man games: choose one stage out of 8 stages, defeat the Robot Master and use the weapon to defeat the next robot and so on and so on. You'd reach Dr. Cossack's castle comprised of 4 stages, then you had to fight in Dr. Wily's castle for the final 4 stages, beating the eight Robot Masters again and finally defeating Dr. Wily. A password system was available to use so you can continue your game later.The PROS: The only way that gamers would have kept playing Mega Man was if there was enough variety in the stages and new game play mechanics were introduced. Fortunately, Capcom delivered in these areas. The graphics and music were good. The controls were the same as it always been so no problems there. It was this game where Capcom first gave Mega Man the ability to power up a shot before you release it to make it stronger and do more damage. His trademark slide returned and so did Rush, his faithful robot dog. A new ally, Eddie, made his first appearance here; he brought a random power up to help Mega Man whenever he was summoned. Gamers also welcomed back the tougher difficult level that was absent in Mega Man 2 and 3.The CONS: At this point, if you have played any of the previous three games, then Mega Man 4 is no different. It won't change your mind if you weren't a fan of the classic NES series.Mega Man 4 was more of the same but fans of the series weren't tired yet.

Whichever side of the fence you're on, it's undeniable that they offer something different from the status quo, and variety's never a bad thing, especially when it's this good.Beyond, much like Quantic Dream's past games Indigo Prophecy and Heavy Rain, is a very cinematic game that marries both cinematics and gameplay so that the two aren't disjointed but interwoven. While you often have free control of the character, this isn't merely a quick-time event game like some claim, however they are an important aspect to the game. But I'm fine that this isn't a game like most games where you see an amazing cutscene that builds up the characters and shows the more mundane, perhaps emotional, moments in a character's life, while the actual gameplay sections interspersed between the cutscenes have you shooting guns and whatnot. Quantic Dream games have the player doing exciting things but also more mundane things that build the characters and makes you care for them since you're an active participant.As for the graphics, they're the best this generation. There are a few texture oddities and whatnot, but it's overall the most impressive game I've seen this generation. The character models and animations are absolutely best in class. Some of the subtle animations of the characters make them feel like real human beings and not merely video game characters. Ellen Page and everyone else involved gave great performances.Beyond: Two Souls is an emotional journey where you get to truly experience the roller coaster ride and not just watch it play out. If there's one game you play to finish out this console generation, please make it this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2013"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K6DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Charles \"Altered Confusion\"","summary":"Killzone 3 Review","reviewText":"You will once again find yourself facing off against the Helghast. This game literally starts where the second game left off. You have killed the man in power, but now you have to see your men safely back. The problem is that nothing is easy, and you'll have to fight your way across a portion of the planet to try to escape. The strange thing is that there is something behind the scenes going on that could possibly destroy everyone.Graphically this game shows off what the PlayStation 3 can do. The character models and the levels all look amazing in high definition. The cut scenes are also very well do, graphically. This game definitely has a limited palette of colors for the areas you're going to have to traverse, but it definitely doesn't cause the game to go stale. In fact the lack of a wide variety of colors just adds to the \"It's War\" effect.The sounds of the game for the most part basically fit what they are used for, the majority of which is for weaponry and explosions. The voice acting was very well done, and I have to say that there were a couple of characters who I had to look up afterwards because I knew the voice but I just couldn't place it.The controls for the game will take almost the entire single player play-through to understand. They don't feel completely natural. There's also the arbitrary stick to cover mechanic. When I'm sneaking down a road in the crouch position if I hit a wall I'm not looking to stick to it, but I do. Then there are times were I want to stick to a wall or cover and when I move around I find I've just exposed my entire character instead of leaning out.The single player version of the game isn't incredible long, but there's enough action to make it exciting as you try to get through the game. You'll get to mess around with several different weapons, sniper rifle, bolt gun, rocket launcher, machine gun, etc. There is plenty variety to keep you happy. Now for the part where I tell you what is wrong with the game. Sadly there were quite a few things that got to me in the game. The biggest one is if you play the game for a good amount of time, say 2+ hours straight, you'll start to see that the cut scenes and the audio track slowly go out of sync worse and worse. It was a bit unnerving to have an important scene and not have what is suppose to be a very well polished game not act correctly during a portion where all the attention is on that scene, seeing that you do not have to push any buttons during them. Another issue I have with the game is the reckless abandonment of the laws of physics. If I shoot someone in the torso or the head, while they stand near a railing or edge, their bodies can't possibly fall forward over the railing or edge, its not physically possible. There's also the accuracy factor. This might just be a randomly generated percentage behind the scenes but when someone is aiming at an enemy's chest there's very little chance that the bullets aren't going to hit somewhere, and magically the game decided that sometimes it was a complete miss. This could also be a collision box issue. Finally the checkpoint system. It's nice to have something like this so that if you mess up you can go almost right back to where you were. The problem is that sometimes it puts you immediately in an areas where you're fighting, which if you're not paying close attention you'll be restarting again. Finally the buddy system. There are several parts of the game where you'll have other characters near you that can heal you, and you can do the same for them. The problem is that the pathfinding in this game is broken. I can't tell you how many times I've died and heard, \"I can't get to you\", at the same time I can see that the character speaking is standing 6 feet away from me.Anyways if you're looking to continue the story, then of course by all means pick up this game and continue the war. If you're looking for a well polished First Person Shooter, you might not want this one to be your first choice. There's potential here, but there's enough problems that you'd probably be better off playing something else. This game gets a 6.5 out of 10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

Sprague \"Broken Hierophant\"","summary":"A beautiful master piece, when rpgs fuse with action side scrollers.","reviewText":"I did not know what to think of Odin Sphere. There were some good reviews and some bad reviews. Regardless if you think this is just a hack n slash disguised as an rpg you are both very right but also very wrong. I think what endeared me to the game was having the little girl pick up her black cat Socrates while plopping down in the chair with him. In a strange twist Odin Sphere starts you out as a child with a story book. All the heroes of the game are actually the characters she is reading about. See it as a similar situation as being Bastion with the never-ending story.In a realm of fairy tales the God Odin has declared war on the fairy kingdom. He wants a cauldron to make powerful weapons but if he succeeds the world will end. Ironically enough you start out not as the hero against Odin but as Gwendolyn, one of his Valkyrie daughters who is a hapless pawn.Actually there are 5 characters in all. There is Gwendolyn's half sister who is a red hooded witch, the dark knight Oswald that can become a shadow beast, a noble prince who has been turned into a rabbit-thing, and a cute fairy archer. All of them have their own motives as well as varied ways of attacking.As you jump, glide, and attack you can absorb \"phozons\". These fuel your magic and power up the damage of your weapons for each character. While you cannot hold many items you can be clever in the way you use them. Plants for example normally require phozons to grow and you can actually bury a seed right before battle so any creatures you slay mature the plant with their dispersed life energy thus making it grow life nourishing berries. My favorite weed was one that dropped living sheep that you could bop to turn into lamb chops!\"Alchemy\" is another important skill. By mixing potions you can create healing beverages or even warm elixirs that keep your core temperature up in cold environments.Odin Sphere's story is very intricate and you get to walk in the shoes of characters that are on every side of the conflict. Each time you complete a hero's scenario another book appears for the little girl to read. Each person has a whole tome dedicated to them alone. By that point it is your choice who you want to play as.Even if a huge boss is too hard fret not. You can always return to your base with all the experience and items you have earned and simply do the level over again. Eventually you will be strong enough to deal with a pesky dragon or traitorous general on your own terms!Increasing stats is pretty easy. For example just by eating a lot it raises your overall health and absorbing enough phozons will make your weapon stronger.The character sprites and graphics have a lot of personality and detail. Remember how crono trigger and secret of mana looked on the SNES at the zenith of its' perfection? Well multiply that glory by 2 and you get the picture.The music and voice acting also deserve praise and set the mood perfectly for each emotional scenario.Your found maps are easy to read so going from one place to another without getting lost is easy.The only bone to pick with Odin sphere is when there are many enemies on screen at once it lags to a crawl. In the end however that is not enough to bring it down at all.In the end you would be hard pressed not to find something to like about Odin Sphere unless you detest all things cute and anime. It has that nostalgic spark found only in the fairy tales of our youth and there is enough item farming mini games and monster bashing to keep rpg lovers and action lovers equally happy!Pros+Gorgeous 2D graphics+ Glorious hack n slash action+ Addictive game play+Great music and voice acting+Well told story from the perspective of 5 unique charactersCons-Lags when too much is going on at once.- In trying to please both Rpg fans and action fans it may fall short in both aspects thus failing to make either group entirely happy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2008"}

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

This game opens in the fictional Empire City as it suffers from an enormous explosion that almost completely levels one of the city's three islands. After the explosion, bike messenger Cole MacGrath awakens in the center of the explosion's blast crater and soon finds that he has been endowed with the ability to channel electricity and use it to fry his enemies. As he grows accustomed to his powers, life in Empire City starts going down the tubes: the government has quarantined the city due to some kind of plague that seems to be driving people mad, gangs have divided up and taken control over all three of the city's islands, most of the police have either been killed or are hiding out in fear, and everyone else is struggling to survive in this modern day wild west. Cole has the power to change things for the better, bringing hope and peace back to the city... or he could simply make things better for himself and ignore the needs of others. Regardless of what road he chooses, Cole will undergo many missions in order to find a mysterious device called the Ray Sphere, which is what caused the explosion and gave Cole his electric powers. These missions will involve Cole restoring power to the different sections of the city, taking out the gangs/police patrolling the streets, and a couple missions where you protect a friendly target from enemies. There are also many side missions where you destroy reinforced buses armed with machine guns that attack the city, track down hidden enemies, follow enemy messengers without being spotted to a drop off, put a stop to gang wars, and much more. Similarly to Spider-Man 2, Cole can access these missions by approaching citizens who call out to him. Cole has a karma meter that will go up after good acts or down after evil acts.He soon gains three electric abilities that he can perform on wounded enemies and civilians; he can restrain, heal, or drain them of their bioelectric energy (bioleech). Healing civilians grants him positive karma points, while restraining civilians and using bioleach on civilians or even enemies gives him negative karma points. Killing civilians and police also of course gives Cole negative karma. This can be a pain for those who want to be good guys since the civilians tend to sometimes run straight into the middle of a shootout between Cole and his enemies and get themselves killed. At least those who want to be bad don't have to worry about collateral damage, they can go nuts. There are also some good and evil side missions which grant further positive and negative karma points respectively. Cole can work for justice and do things like herd prisoners to a police station, join the police on raids against gangs, and capture enemies without killing them; or he can be a bad boy and herd captured gang members to a group of rival gang members for execution, join gang members on attacks against the police, and assassinate people. There are also many set-pieces and random encounters where Cole will be faced with a moral dilemma and must choose to either make the right or selfish decision, and these choices give you the largest amounts of karma points. The game kind of goes into freeze frame mode while Cole weighs the pros and cons of his two possible choices. Most of these \"moral dilemmas\" are pretty black and white, making it obvious which decision you should make if you know whether you want to be good or bad. For example, when faced by a guy who's barring your progress through a door because he's worried about his wife, you have to decide whether to tell him that his wife was killed or you can simply zap your way through the door and the guy himself. There is one moral dilemma during the last quarter of the game that will give you pause and make you actually think about which decision you should make, so more of the other moral choices should have been like that.Now for the good stuff, Cole's powers and abilities. He starts out with a regular electric zapping attack called the Lightning Bolt that allows him to shoot at enemies from an over-the-shoulder perspective at a distance, as well as an Electromagnetic Shockwave where Cole shoots out a short-range wave of electrical energy that could blow enemies or even cars back. During the missions where he goes through the sewers to restore power to sections of the city, Cole will acquire new electric abilities such as Shock Grenades, Megawatt Hammers (balls of electricity fired like missiles), Precision (a more powerful, long-range lightning bolt), and Lightning Storm (I'll let you see that one for yourselves). Most of these powers and other abilities can be upgraded through the EXP Cole earns by completing missions and defeating enemies. There are a couple of other electric powers Cole acquires that depend on whether he's good or evil, although more wide-range area-of-affect electric attacks would have been nice. He can even beat up enemies with electrically charged melee attacks, mostly punches and flip kicks, but you'll be using his ranged attacks a lot more than his melee ones. All of Cole's ranged attacks, as well as one specialized melee attack, use up power nodes from Cole's energy meter, except the Lightning Bolt which has infinite \"ammo\". Cole can increase his energy meter after collecting a certain number of Blast Shards which are scattered all over the city.There's no visible health meter, but as Cole receives damage the sides of the screen get splattered with blood and everything goes black and white with lowered sound as Cole is near death. His health will regenerate if he keeps himself from suffering further damage, but absorbing electricity from power sources like light poles and generators will not only regenerate his health, but also refill his energy meter. Plus, make sure to keep Cole out of the water, for obvious reasons. Small puddles won't hurt him, but waist deep water is less than healthy for the guy. Cole also specializes in parkour/urban exploring, so he can jump across light poles, powerlines, and rooftops. He's also very adept at climbing up and down buildings by grabbing onto window sills, pipes, railings, and other available handholds; in fact, he's a little too good at grabbing these things and sometimes has trouble simply letting go of these handholds and standing flat on a rooftop. Despite his gifted climbing skills, Cole can't climb up chain link fences, which simply doesn't make sense. Later on, he'll be able to travel through the city more fluidly by gaining the ability to use his electricity to grind along train tracks and powerlines, as well as use Static Thrusters to glide over slightly longer distances. Somehow, Cole's electric powers allow him to survive drops from very high buildings; it's convenient, but confusing.The game's combat is a bit repetitive, but still fun and challenging. The three islands of Empire City have been taken over by three gangs: former drug dealers in red hoodies who have been mutated into Reapers, homeless people who encased themselves in trash armor to become the Dust Men, and the secret organization with ties to the Ray Sphere called the First Sons. Most of the guys in these groups shoot at you with assault rifles (and incredible aim), but they also have their own guys who were affected by the Ray Sphere and have their own powers like telekinesis, invisibility, and smaller scaled electric powers. Aside from the Blast Shards, Cole can also track down and collect Dead Drops left behind by an undercover agent who infiltrated the First Sons, which are all audio recordings that reveal interesting background information. The story is also told through many in-game cutscenes and several comic book themed cutscenes between chapters that look like they were pulled right out of a comic book. These scenes give the game a nice look, as well as a cool storytelling element when Cole narrates them.The cutscenes change somewhat depending on whether you're good or evil, but not too greatly; the more noticeable differences between being good or bad are reflected through the way the city changes along with Cole. If Cole is good, the city begins to appear more well put together, posters are put up depicting Cole as a hero, citizens cheer for and praise the hero, and Cole himself looks just like the way he does on the game's cover. If Cole is evil, the city remains a dump, posters are put up showing how \"infamous\" Cole is, citizens will cower in fear or attack the villain, and Cole appears more grimy and pale... and uses cool looking red lightning. The game's graphics are pretty nice. While Empire City doesn't vary too greatly in design, it's still modeled well with its many buildings and tree-filled parks. The characters also have good designs, especially Cole and the main villains, of which there are three and they serve as the game's entertaining boss fights. Aside from the somewhat repetitive combat and a couple of movement glitches here and there, this game has a lot going for it: a good story, interesting characters and enemies, cool powers, nice graphics, and tight controls. If you want to take part in the origin story of the latest superhero/supervillain, then I suggest buying or at the very least renting this game. Totally worth it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-07-2011"}

Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

The one annoyance I do have have is the characters jump ability depth,  what I mean is there are times where you're jumping from building to building or pipe to pipe or something and while at first it looks like your jumping the same distance you did from the earlier platform but to your surprise(And sometimes annoyance) you fall to your death or get hurt and you're wondering why you didn't make the jump when it was the same distance you did with two previous platforms before.  That aside the rest of the game is fantastic as are the characters of the game Cole the main hero/villain of the game with fantastic lightning abilities that you can upgrade throughout the game as you complete the main game storyline as well as miniquests that are all throughout the city,  Zeke Coles's best friends and seems like a wannabe Elvis lookalike and finally Trish Cole's girlfriend who loves him deeply but is conflicted with her emotions as well as she feels he is the one responsible for the death of someone close to her.  The game also has a Star wars force unleashed part as well meaning you make moral choices throughout the game,  you can either be a good guy helping the citizens of the city and the like or be more self serving and vindictive killing people who get in your way if they cause you to much trouble or if it's fortuitous to use them maliciously.  So if you played games like Prototype or Prince of Persia or just like a good action game here's a very entertaining one to add to the collection...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}

But instead of starting out with Sky rim I decided to try Dragon Age first, since I have always been a Beware zombie and I had not played a decent party based RPG since probably KOTOR II...so I installed and fired up the game.I was completely blow away; this game had refined the great battle system and companion interaction of the KOTORs, the great high fantasy of Baldur's Gate epic feel and Never winter's twisting storylines; this was truly the finest RPG experience I had been waiting for.The battle system is the natural progression of the older Baldur's Gate games, with all the delicious instant second pausing and planning, but with all the bells and whistles of modern games, with spells and attack animations finally fullfulling up the expectations we always had to fill out with our imagination for lesser games. The companions are truly great, and add so much charm to the game that they rival the beloved BG character likes Viconia & Minsc. The bad guys are a bit generic (No John Irenicus here) but it is truly such a profound adventure that you have to experience the game at least 2 times to truly get a feel for the differences your character professions and races make on the storyline. Truly this is a game to be played and replayed with gusto. New mods and tweaks add some nice updated visuals and animations, plus the fan made mods and adventures add even more options to an already epic 100+ hours of gameplay.Sadly the sequel did away with much of the strategy elements of the battle system and by speeding things up it reminded me of those action RPGs I loathe like Diablo and Dungeon Siege, plus it did away with the multiple storylines...so I guess I will be playing and replaying this game for some time to come...while Skyrim lies right next to my monitor gathering dust for a little while yet...just one more run though the game to go....gee I have never been a dwarf...BTW this is a review for the Ultimate Edition which includes all the DLC and the Awakenings expansion,,,which is not that great compared to the original game but is still a super sweet deal this price...this is simply the ultimate RPGs experience","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003BE6OZ2","description":"Begin Game LogoEnd Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"Tristan A. Hayes","summary":"The Best Naruto Fighter of Them All","reviewText":"Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 2 is the continuation of the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm series on the PS3.  This game continues in the likeness of the first game bringing CyberConnect2's outstanding graphical engine for the series to the Shippuden storyline.  Apart from the visuals, the game prides itself on going through the Naruto storyline up to and through the Pain Arc (that is through episodes 1-175 or through Naruto manga chapters 245-450 of the manga).  This is a wise stopping point as the next game would be able to introduce the myriad of new ninjas that were shown at the next arc.  I will not spoil the exact details of the storymode fights for that is to be discovered and enjoyed by the player spoilerfree.The games story mode follows in similar fashion to the first game in which there are a mix of selected fights from the manga/anime that are on transforming battlefields with large scale attacks as well as a mixture of regular fights. Although not every scene from the manga and anime is covered in terms of fighting, those that are pretty good.  The game does a good job of splitting it up between not just fighting fights with Naruto and what not.  The village in the game has been completely redone from the first and looks gorgeous. You can also travel on foot through locations other than the Hidden Leaf Village.  It actually looks like a recreation of how it appears in the anime.The game has a cast of over 40 characters with the main team ninjas available in the beginning, along with Sasuke, and the ninjas from the Village Hidden in the Sand.  You can unlock characters through the story or the use of satisfying conditions and gaining storm points (in game credit earned from everything, can be used to unlock titles and more).  Characters can also have their attacks (ninjutsus) customized.  The game has an online mode that is available right from the start.  It is a great inclusion for one can show off their skills to friends through private matches or playing through public matches (ranked and unranked) with anyone.The game has titles that can be unlocked (which seems to be over 150) as well as cards to deck out the players online profile, there are trophies included, voice chat is allowed online as well.  Finally the game has Japanese Voice Acting as well as English Voice Acting so one can change it.  The English voice acting is pretty interesting for several of the characters have yet to be dubbed so players will have a surprise (if they didnt look in advance) to hear their select characters talking.  The music in the game is very fitting just like the first and I found carries emotion in like regard to the anime. Lastly there are close to 20 battlefields that can be unlocked and selected for online play.  There is also offline multiplayer for two players.All in all this is the Ultimate Naruto game that fans have been waiting for, and for people who may or may not have an interest in Naruto there is a demo available on the Playstation Network to download the game, and the game does the story mode well enough that people who had never seen or read Naruto before could get interested in it.  This is one Naruto game that one would not want to miss.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0001X5YN4","reviewerName":"AeroEngineer","summary":"Amazing Game!","reviewText":"Wow, this game is great! The shear size of it is amazing, it's gigantic in terms of land area and it is not empty land either, plenty of abandoned buildings and typical countryside with realistic weather and day/night cycles as well. Just when I was almost out of videogames another landmark one comes along and pulls me back in! This is what a sandbox is at it's best outside of the online massive multiplayers, although this is online as well but I stick to the single player to not get too hooked on playing.There are so many great things about this game I can't hope to list all of them here, the game is so immense and overwhelming when you first start. It's a little weird at first, like it feels genuinely spooky like HL2 did and has many different types of enemies as well as friends/neutrals. One bad thing is that the directions/instructions are very minimal and not well done, without the online FAQs and walkthroughs it would be easy to get frustrated and just give up playing altogether. It almost feels like this came directly from it's Russian makers through a bad translation, the booklet and in-game help is what I am referring to here.I personally also use the trainers available as I don't have unlimited time to sit and work my way up to get everything and believe me one could spend hundreds of hours trying to do all the side missions and trying to get all the items and weapons not to mention the main storyline. This game is truly a great achievement, it has elements of almost every type of game and has some of the best graphics I've ever seen, on par and maybe better than HL2. It takes a lot of space understandably, 10 GB, and can tax my mid-range system at times with it's environments with some lag. Another thing is that you spend a lot of time just getting around, vehicles would have been really nice, maybe they are in there I estimate I'm about 25% done with the main storyline.In short for the price it is definitely worth it and should not be missed, this one feels like the next generation every one has been talking about for a while now, ironically it's not one of those silly overpriced consoles!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001CMIUYS","reviewerName":"S. Bearden","summary":"I was on the fence about buying this...UPDATED","reviewText":"I debated purchasing this game altogether due to my disappointment with FF12.  I kept reading reviews that the game was very linear and different.  Well, it is but it's not bad.  God of War is linear but people still adore the games for their story and just being plain fun.  I wouldn't call FF13 a straight up RPG.  In my opinion, it is an action, light RPG, and strategy game all rolled into one, so far.  My rational for this is that the story itself is RPG-ish.  The game play itself is more like an \"action\" game rather than an open RPG setting.  The battle system is very strategic as you are offered many different options during battle.  The battle system has been the most fun aspect of the game for me thus far.My thoughts related to the game so far are that the story is a bit confusing at first but slowly becomes clear as time goes on.  The voice acting is annoying to me.  I just don't understand how a giant title such as Final Fantasy could have such mediocre voice acting.  GoW, Half-Life 2, Uncharted, and countless other games have great voice acting.  It's not a game destroying flaw, just obnoxious at times.There is a LOT of cut scenes so far.  I'm roughly 9 hours into the game and agree with others that the amount of cut scenes makes it feel less like a game at times and more like a movie, at times, not always.Graphics: Great on the PS3 and great on the Xbox.  Fan boys will be fan boys but the level of detail on both systems is pure eye candy regardless of which is technically better.  I have both a PS3 and an XBOX and purely bought it for the XBOX for the gamer score and XBOX Live.Music: Acceptable.  It is clear that Nobuo Uematsu didn't bless this game with his talents.  The music to me is forgettable but not intrusive or obnoxious.  Gamers who enjoyed Nobuo's past work will almost definitely notice the difference.  Purely opinion though.Characters: Cool for the most part.  Vanille and Hope get on my nerves but that is mostly due to their voice acting and some cheesy dialogue.As I said, the game so far is very linear but still fun.  The environments are detailed and straight forward.  No secret islands with Knights of the Round, etc. (So far).My favorite aspect of the game is the battle system.  It is extremely flexible and unlike any other FF.  There is no mana to worry about, which is actually a nice change, in my opinion.  The paradigm shift idea is fun and effective.  I like that you have the option to execute a command as soon as you have the ATB to do so.  You are not bound to wait until the entire ATB meter fills up; this rules for fights where you just need one more shot.The Crystarium system is also pretty cool.  It is considerably better than the FF10 sphere grid of doom.  It is very straight forward and so far hasn't required tons of fighting to max out.Is FF13 the best game ever?  Not in my opinion.Is FF13 like FF12?  No.Is FF13 fun?  So far, very.Is FF13 worth the money?  Yes.Should Square remake FF7?  Yes :0) (yes, i've been a fanboy since 7th grade)After only nine hours, a lot of apprehension, and an open mind I can say I am truly enjoying this game and do not regret getting it.  I hope this helps with other people who are debating and just cannot decide.  My advice, if you have the cash to spare, go for it!******* UPDATE 3/31/10 ************OK, I got half way into Chapter 7 and couldn't take anymore.  I respect that some people like/love this game, I do not.The linearity got to me.  At first it was fun, upbeat, and different.  After many hours it became mundane, boring, and essentially a colorful world of nothing to do.  I understand that many people say the game opens up around Chapter 10 but that is too little, too late, for me.For me it has been many hours of battles, button mashing, running on one path, pointless cut scenes, annoying voice acting, and slightly annoying camera controls.I miss exploring the world, even if it was slow at first and built up to greater mobility and access to optional challenges.  This may sound contradictory to what I've said about FF13 but there is NOTHING to explore until WAY later in the game (and that is just based upon what I've read/heard).Overall, after what I feel is a reasonable time investment into the game has proven fruitless.  I enjoyed the beginning and high hopes with what I saw but ended up quickly fizzling into boredom.For those of you who enjoy the game and disagree with me, I am happy you enjoyed it!For those of you who have enjoyed the older FF's, you should know (as I'm sure you already do), it should not be compared.  In my humble opinion, the FF franchise has morphed into something completely different than it started out as.Best Regards.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004Q8L46G","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"Dirt 3:  Making its claim as one of the best rally racers ever","reviewText":"NOTE:  I will not be able to cover online multiplayer/functionality as the PSN Store is down as of today.  Once that is up and running I'll post an update.So as others have mentioned, I've played racing games from old school (Spy Hunter, Pole Position) all the way to the current generation like Blur, Split/Second and Gran Turismo 5.I will echo what others have said:  This is one of the best racers ever, and probably IS the best rally racer ever.The graphics are simply incredible, some games just throw effects in there, in Dirt 3, you REALLY feel like you're in the rain or snow.  Sound effects are great, and the actual soundtrack isn't bad.  I wouldn't call it memorable or anything, however.Handling is really up to you.  Casual turns the game into a 2 button one (gas and steering, as it breaks for you).  This allows accessibility for those that are not racers (like say, your wife or younger kids).  Intermediate takes off some of the assists, but still is controllable.  Only when you get to Advanced, with ALL assists off, does the game hit the \"I want to put my fist through the TV screen\" frustration level.  In short, unlike the NFS:Shift games, this one you can actually control and handle, as well as have success with.Replay value seems awful high (I'm about 8-10 hours in).  Getting the Platinum badges is going to be insanely difficult, but if you're one of those people that can't leave until you get it, you will feel a VERY big sense of achievement when you do.  For those that just want to keep moving on, the Bronze level is easily achieved in all cases.It does seem a little odd that the game gives you cars as you earn reputation (ala Blur) but you don't actually earn any currency to buy your own.  Some are locked into the VIP Pass, which I'm sure was thought up long before the PSN got hacked, there's no way Codemasters could have seen that coming, and it's hardwired into the game, so for those giving this game 1 star because you can't go online, there's nothing Codemasters can do about it.One other minor gripe:  Dude, you don't have to tell me after every race \"Wow, what a race!  Upload to YouTube for your friends to see!\"  (And I mean, we're talking after 9 out of 10 races).  It only gives you 30 seconds, so it's not like they can see your entire run, though I will say it's a pretty cool idea.Outside of the Rally, racing, etc. one thing Dirt 3 adds is Gymkhana.  What is Gymkhana?  A huge playground where you drift, jump and basically become a trick god behind the wheel.  This is where I feel the vast majority of competition is going to take place, in terms of leaderboards and records.Overall, this instantly becomes one of the best racers on the PS3 because of its accessibility and polish, and if you are Rally fan at all this is a must purchase.Is it better than...Blur?  Sadly, even though I love this game, I've got to concede it is.  Graphically speaking, it's far superior, and there's more variety.Split/Second?  Absolutely.  After all, what racing game in this decade DOESN'T show you a map of the track you are on and the relative positions of the other racers?  Oh, that's right...Gran Turismo 5?  This all depends on your style.  If you're a hardcore sim who has to tweak all your gear ratios, etc. then stick with Gran Turismo 5 as all the altering on Dirt 3 happens via moving boxes in the screen before you race.  Dirt 3 is more accessible and doesn't make you earn tons of $$$ to progress a fraction in the game.Just do yourself a favor, if you're a racing fan or know one, get this game.  You will not be sorry.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-28-2011"}

{"product_name":"B001ATHKVC","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Excellent Expansion of the Crysis World","reviewText":"All DRM issues aside... Crysis Warhead is a great game.  For $25, it's a steal.I thought the original Crysis was fantastic, but I actually enjoyed fighting the N.Koreans more than the Alien Exo Suits.  The last 3rd of the first game is completely fighting against the aliens, and there were some less fun, more tedious levels like keeping Prophet alive.  It took away from the game, and it seemed like they could have done a lot more with the battle against the N.Koreans.  Well, Crysis Warhead does just that.While there are still a substantial amount of levels where you have to fight against the Aliens, the last level is the exact kind of battle against the N.Koreans I was looking for.  I was very pleased after beating this game.The story is also very much improved (but still somewhat lacking).  Pyscho has a nice rivalry going with the N.Korean general throughout the whole game.  And there is also some back story with the pilot, O'Neill, but that may have been an afterthought.The overall gameplay is somewhat improved as well.  They switched up the controls slightly, but I think it's for the better.  There are a few more weapons too.  In the end, this game was a lot more fun than the first, and the performance has improved slightly.  I found that I was able to up the graphics to \"Mainstream\" where as I had to play the first on mostly low settings.Crysis in general suffers from some bad controls using the gamepad.  I have the MS Wireless gaming adapter for my xbox 360 controller, and the game detects that a 360 controller is plugged in.  So you know that Crytek put some effort into the controls.  Unfortunately, they fall short of what they could have and should have been.  Ultimately, you still need to use the keyboard.  Let me explain...Crytek certainly takes advantage of the keyboard.  You can duck, go prone, run, jump, peek left/right, melee attack, shoot, throw grenades, switch fire mode, change grenade type, activate night vision, activate binoculars, zoom in, zoom out, open the map... etc.  Unfortunately, they did very little to incorporate all of those controls into the controller, which I believe they could have done with a little effort.  I'd rather not get into it as it would be quite a lengthy explanation.  My biggest complaint is that switching on the controller is very frustrating.  You can only cycle through your weapons in one direction.  And also, coming out of Zoom should be a lot more intuitive.  When you run, it should leave zoom.  When you zoom out all the way, it should leave zoom.  Instead, it only exits zoom when you keep Zooming In.  It ends up being clunky in fast combat situations.Anyway, I'm hoping that Crytek continues with this franchise.  It has a lot more potential.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-25-2008"}

The game has impeccable gameplay, and gives the player the resources to explore its massive island nation. On the other hand, the game's writing is abysmal, its main character a generic grunty dummy with zero charisma, and the sheer largeness of the game gets in the way of its focus. Is it fun to play? It's crazy fun. But more importantly, it's crazy; Just Cause 2 is over-designed to a fault, and I think I liked it even though I couldn't convince myself to keep playing it.Just Cause 2 drops you into the shoes of Rico Rodriguez, a man with the super power to summon a parachute at any time and cancel the momentum of anything with a hookshot. He's sent to an island nation to destabilize it in order to... well, that's about the time I stopped paying attention to the plot. You want a plot? Blow things up, there's your plot. Really, in this case- causing damage to military properties raises your Chaos meter, which in turn unlocks new story missions. This is really the only point of the gameplay at which I can level a real complaint; I'd like to be able to simply play through the game, and, I dunno, unlock side missions by causing Chaos. What kept me from completing Just Cause 2, in fact, was the fact that I needed to grind blowing up military bases in order to get the game flowing again.On the plot of the game, I didn't follow it too well, mainly because I plain don't like Rico. He's another generic action hero badass without any motivation, and I frankly am getting tired of them. I'd really like to see games attempt to get out of this mold; Nathan Drake and Cole McGrath (though he does have the gravelly voice) are the only modern heroes I can think of that are allowed feelings and a normal speaking voice. I'd love to see an Errol Flynn-style hero in a modern video game, if nothing else than to break up the endless waves of Marcus Fenix wannebes. But I'm getting off topic.Just Cause 2's game world has been touted as the largest ever created, and boy howdy, is it. You could spend hours admiring the scenery, in fact, some of my best moments involved climbing the highest mountain I could see, jumping off the top, and drifting for miles with my parachute from miles high; seeing the trees unfold beneath me and watching the cars and people go from atom-sized to life-size. There's something new and great about just that experience, and the game may be worth playing just to do that.The gunplay of Just Cause 2 is pretty standard stuff, fitting as it does in the Grand Theft Auto mold. What surprised me is that getting ammo is a little difficult; enemies don't carry a lot, and purchasing guns from the dealer is extremely expensive. Maybe there was some way I wasn't seeing, I dunno. The driving in the game is fun, especially since the game offers you the option to open your parachute from INSIDE any car, jetting the car into building or person in front of you in spectacular fashion while you watch from above. I recommend using motorcycles in this way too.So Just Cause 2 is a massive game with lots to do, and fun ways in which to do it. I prefer more focus in my games, personally, but I can't really say much to disparage it. If you like open world games, pick this up; it takes the premise about as far as it can possibly go, for better or for worse.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2011"}

As the bodyguard of the empress who is wrongfully accused of her murder, you play through several different missions with many side options included.  Your choices throughout these missions determine what the outcome of the game will be.  You can choose to use all stealth tactics and not kill guards or overseers or you can kill everything in your path.  Killing causes more chaos which leads to a different game outcome.  Along with mission objectives, you also collect runes and bone charms which increase your power and extend your health.  I played through on the normal level and it is quite difficult to get through entirely in stealth without being spotted.  Once you're spotted by a guard, getting away without having to kill someone is not an easy task either.  My first playthrough didn't have a happy ending because I was too ruthless.  This is my type of game, though.  If you liked Deus Ex or Max Payne, you should definitely check this out.  The graphics are quite good and I can see a lot of replay value in this game.

I finally got around to it!  I'm hoping that it's just as good as the original!  So does it live up to my expectations?  Let's find out!Graphics (score 8/10): The same cartoon-style graphics from the original make a return, and they are just as whimsical and enjoyable as they were before.  The only problem I've seen is that the animation seems to jerk a bit during some cutscenes.  Lastly, and I know this is going to sound strange, but Professor Layton's weird black shark eyes in the first game freaked me out (although his personality won me over in the end).  This was mainly due to the fact that he seemed to be the only character who posessed them.  I'm very pleased to say that that isn't the case anymore since I've spotted other characters in this game who have similar eyes.  Suddenly it doesn't feel so weird anymore.  Yep, that hangup of mine is strange, but at least it's solved in this game.Music (score 8/10): The music is some of the better music I've ever heard in an adventure game.  It's got an indescribable charm to it that makes it stand out when compared to more standard fare.  Where this game really shines though is the voice acting.  The second you hear Professor Layton's melodious British accent, you can't help but love him despite his creepy soulless shark eyes!  Everyone else's voice acting is quite good too, of course, which makes the whole experience quite lovely.Characters (score 8/10): Professor Hershel Layton is awesome (he's actually a professor of archeology, but you'd never remember because he rarely does anything archaeological).  He's this really posh well-mannered genteel English dude and you can't help but find him charming and lovable.  Luke (his apprentice? sidekick? random unexplained young boy companion?!) is also an enjoyable character with his boundless enthusiasm.  Luke is a bit more excitable and temperamental than the Professor, but it's really refreshing to see a child characters who isn't annoying.  Flora (who makes a return from the first game) is alright.  She's not irritating but doesn't really stand out much either...  The side characters are also pretty amusing, and if you've played the first game, you'll recognize a few returning faces.  The only thing that baffles me is the villain (Don Paolo) who appeared in the first game with a totally unexplained backstory.  He makes an appearance here but still remains just as unexplained...  Oh, and lest you think that me mentioning his name is a spoiler, it would be if it actually meant something.  As it is though, there's zero explanation behind him and thus it means nothing...Story (score 8/10): This is a brand new story from the first game's, but there are plenty of references to the events of the first game (Inspector Chelmey, for example).  This time, the Professor is out to solve the mystery of the Elysian Box, a mysterious item that's said to kill anyone who opens it.  The mystery becomes personal when the Professor's old friend and mentor Dr. Schrader gets killed while researching it.  They decide to go on a train journey after finding a ticket in Dr. Schrader's hand to find some clues to his death.  I don't know what it is about trains and solving detective-style mysteries!  There was a mystery-solving sequence that took place on a train in both \"Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door\" and \"Touch Detective 2 \".  What an odd coincidence!  Well anyway, as for the whole story, it's quite good - just like the original game!Gameplay (score 8/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  The first few puzzles are more story-related (ex. finding the right key for Dr. Schrader's apartment).  I like this much better than the first game because I have a preference in adventure games for my \"puzzles\" to actually make sense in context of the story (something I call \"environmental puzzles\").  For example, rather than being thrown a random puzzle about a bunch of wolves and a chicken crossing the river, I prefer to solve a practical story-based problem - such as discovering a secret passageway or combining items to make a creative lock-pick.  So, in other words, I like my puzzles to be relevant to a practical need in the environment.  The original game didn't really have much of this, as it just threw random brain teasers at the player and that was it.  Now, to be fair, the original game was always a hybrid among puzzlers and adventure games, but I lean more towards the adventure game aspect, so seeing (sort of) meaningful environmental puzzles make an appearance in the sequel pleases me greatly.  Other than the standard brain teaser puzzles, there are a few extra little sidequests/minigames, including one where you help an overweight hamster get into shape.  My favorite one (and possibly the greatest mini-game/side quest in all of gaming) is the tea brewing mini-game.  You find tea ingredients over the course of the game and you can blend them together to make different tea recipes.  It really tickled my fancy because I've done the exact same thing in real life with my own tea herbs!Overall (score 8/10): NOTE this score is not an average; it's my subjective overall score.  I can't say I'm the biggest fan of brainteaser-type puzzles but I still enjoyed myself with this game.  If nothing else, the Professor's lovable personality and the intriguing storyline kept me playing.  In fact, due to the improved nature of the puzzles, I think I enjoyed this sequel even more than the original!  So, if you played the original and liked it, then you definitely want to pick up Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2012"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense.

However, I had also heard the story of the game is fantastic, and I picked it up at my local retailer.What I got was an immersive and exciting story mixed with dark adult content. The game jumps between four protagonists, ranging from a father who can't seem to have anything go right to an FBI agent sent to discover the truth behind the main villain of the game, the &#34;Origami Killer&#34;. The story is long, detailed, and really makes you start to question what makes us human (corruption, guilt, revenge, and hatred are the big motifs here), all accompanied by a great soundtrack and plenty of twists and turns to keep the action going, once it DOES start going.While the writing and voice acting are superb, the rest of the game feels somewhat outdated; some of the animation is spot on, but basic tasks such as walking or picking things up look and feel choppy. Normally I wouldn't mention this, but in a game that relies entirely on its presentation and animation, it makes me feel a little less forgiving. The quick reaction events are usually fine, but the parts of the game that use the six axis feature of the PS3 controller got on my nerves because they force you to sit up straight when I'd rather get in a much more comfortable position. The continuous mashing of buttons does take a toll on your wrist and thumbs.  So make sure to play this one in bursts. I can't speak for the motion controls included as I do not own a PS Move, but they are there if you chose to use them.So, what you get is a great story mixed with some &#34;meh&#34; animation and controls. However, everything Heavy Rain gets right outweighs the things it doesn't, and the story definitely makes it worth your time and money.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2014"}

The MapMaker has also been enhanced, opening up even more potential to the advanced gamer looking for customizable game scenarios.","reviewerName":"AntVector","summary":"Minigun + Monkey = Awesome","reviewText":"In a crowded genre it takes a special kind of game to stand up and be counted. Timesplitters 2, though over a year old, nevertheless remains one of the finest console FP shooters ever devised, marrying a sturdy, smooth and frantic single player mode with a literal ton of multiplayer options. You should own this game. Especially if you are a monkey.Fans of the original game will recall the basic format. The eponymous Timesplitters, a bunch of drooling alien villains, are attempting to subvert human history by invading various historically iconic eras and buggering them up. In an effort to prevent the downfall of mankind, two plucky space marines have infiltrated the Timesplitter's space-station HQ, hopped into a time portal, and set off to set history to rights, via (of course) the medium of massive shooty weapons.This sequel essentially ups the single-player ante with a much needed injection of plot, and even more guns, babes, mission objectives and the like, and wraps it all up in gloriously smooth cartoon graphics. The character models and level textures aren't really much to write home about these days, but throw in a near ceaseless barrage of explosions, glowing tracer fire, whooping aliens and ricocheting blaster fire, and you've got one very polished visual stunner to play with.Aurally, TS2 is just as punchy, with plenty of excellent weapon effects, and some wonderfully cartoonish vocals, such as the individual grunts or screams of the 150+ playable characters. Perhaps 'characters' is a touch strong for describing all of these misfit personas - they don't have their own backstory as such, but they are for the most part colorful and shapely (sometimes in a pervy 'lady-sprite' kinda way...) and make for great variety in the multiplayer mode, which is for the most part, where this game is at.There are several multiplayer modes to unlock in TS2, inlcluding the usual deathmatch and bag-tag options, but also such variables as Vampire (suck you opponents health with each hit) or Monkey Assistant, which provides the lowest scoring player with a monkey bodyguard, until they catch up. Its terrific fun to pit such eclectic characters together with such imaginative game modes, and with a good supply of willing friends, stimulants and time you have at your command the ultimate console party game.TS2 also includes a robust level editor for all the budding designers out there. New in this edition is the ability to add event triggers and enemy spawns, allowing to some extent the creation of simple single player levels. The editor is simple to use which is the main thing, and you can have a great deal of satisfying fun in conjuring your own deathmatch catacombs.Also worth mentioning is the ability to play the single play story mode cooperatively with a friend, opening up a new world of possibilities. Indeed, rather than just porting the basic game to a split screen mode, the designers have actually added new enemies and objectives in this mode, meaning that it really is a totally original experience from the single player. Oh, and then there's all the mini challenges and sub games to tackle in order to open up new playable characters and levels for the arcade mode. Talk about value for money!So, in deciding whether or not to add this game to your collection, you really just need to ask yourself one thing - can I afford it? If the answer is yes, then there's no good reason to waste time in not buying it. This is an instantly classic action game with literally hundreds of hours of top quality fun. Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2004"}

It has a nice look,an excellent controller, and the OS is beautiful to the eye and easy to use.The games that have been released for the system have been fantastic, and are some of the best games I have ever played.  Elder Scroll 4, Gears of War, Ghost Recon, are just a couple of the fantastic games this system has to offer.  The graphics are amazing and with the 1080p abilities offered since Nov. 06 I feel the graphical abilities surpase that of PS3.The Xbox Live service is fantastic especially compared to the freshman like Playstation 3 online service.  Only one word compares PS3 online.  FRUSTRATION.I purchased the HD-DVD add on which is awesome and I love how it upscales regular DVD's to 1080i pretty well.  I think its also smart of MS to make the HD abilities optional for those that don't have the money in their budget to purchase those options.Overall, the Xbox 360 is the center of my entertainment center.  If that is what MS wanted to accomplish then they have done it really well.All that is needed to complete the ultimate Gaming Experience?  Halo 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2006"}

That would be a good warning that Lucasarts could have slapped on the back of KOTOR2. This half-baked yet full priced game is a complete catastophe! So here is a joke. What do you get when you add broken gameplay, imcomplete storyline, confusing controls, and horrible graphics? KOTOR2 of course! Now you may think I am just being mean, but I don't particularly enjoy bashing games. I much rather enjoy praising them, but in cases like this, there is just no praise to be found.

True to its name and following the lead of its predecessor,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, it places players in modern combat settings, as opposed to the WWII environments of the earlierCall of Dutygames. This modern approach brings with it new weapons, action and options. Coupled with a variety of gameplay modes including single player, multiplayer and the co-op Special Ops Mode, it is destined to be one of the most popular games of 2009 and a worthy addition to theCall of Dutyseries..caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(http://images.amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"Despite the hate Modern Warfare 2 is a superb game","reviewText":"The Good: Amazing audio/visual experience, cinematic single player experience, out of this world multiplayer that is deep and challengingThe Bad: Single player is short and not as good as the first, not enough good maps in multiplayer, covert ops are something to be desired and feel tacked onFirst person shooters have always been one of my most favorite genres because of the amazing stories that most tell accompanied with the beautiful cinematic experiences that most provide these days. Modern Warfare 2 is among those, but the multiplayer is what will keep you coming back for more. Modern Warfare 2 starts after the first game so I highly suggest picking up the Game of the Year Edition if you really want to get into Modern Warfare. You play as new recruits and follow the characters you played as in the original (Captain Price and Soap MacTavish). You are still trying to stop the Russian psychopath Makarov who has now brought the war to the east coast of our own country.The game is more cinematic than the original, but not as intuitive in terms of level design and length. There are things in Modern Warfare 2 that have never been done in an FPS before like ice climbing, but you also have a snowmobile scene as well as using AC-130 attack planes, but the game just doesn't compare to the original in terms of single player. One of the most memorable moments is during the beginning when you actually play as a terrorist in one level and massacre people in an airport. I am very surprised this passed the ESRB censorship without housewives complaining because they can't control their kids' actions. Anyways, there are a lot of things in the single player experience for fans of the original and that is flashbacks of the last game and even another sniper level with Captain Price, but nothing tops the level in Pripyat form the original, nothing. The biggest thing you will notice are the mass amount of weapons you can use. There were so many weapons I couldn't use them all in one play through. Once thing that just strikes me as amazing is seeing our own country, as if this happened tomorrow, being a war torn battlefield. It's very awe inspiring and makes you stop and admire the scenery. While the single player experience only has about 4-6 hours of game play it's enough to get your started and familiar with the game enough to jump right into multiplayer and it comes out bats swinging and all.Modern Warfare is renowned for its award winning multiplayer and it is probably the best FPS multiplayer I have ever played on any system ever. The game is about reaching rank 70 using real life military ranking system, and earning experience points from kills. You start out using the default load outs, but after reaching rank 4 you can make up to five custom classes. You can pick a primary and secondary weapon, equipment, special equipment, 3 perks, and a deathstreak. For each weapon you can choose an attachment ranging from scopes, grips, silencers, and heartbeat monitors. Perks add advantages to your skills such as steady aim, faster reloading, being invisible to UAVs, air support etc, master melee speed, and you get the idea. There is even a new perk called Bling which allows you to have two attachments to your primary weapon.Once you have your classes created you can start earning experience points with them. The multiplayer in Modern Warfare 2 is so deep that you earn points from completing challenges by using and doing everything you possibly can hundreds of times. Challenges range from getting so many kills for every weapon, attachment, perk, deathstreak, killstreak etc. Just about everything you do earn you points to move on up, and this can get your hundreds of hours of online fun.If that isn't enticing enough 12 players may not seem like much, but on these maps they are. My only real complaint is there aren't many maps and most of them aren't that good. A select few are well designed and very fun to play on, but some are just boring, but a map pack is due soon to fix this.Some of the new features you have heard me talk about are new deathstreaks which are a fourth perk that is enabled if you die 3 times, and these range from dropping a live grenade upon death to 10 seconds of extra health upon resqawning. Killstreaks are now customizable and unlockable by earning ranks. There are over a dozen now ranging from controllable AC-130 airstrikes, helicopter strikes, Hind attacks, and carpet bombing. Getting 25 kills in a row can even land you a tactical nuke that lets your team automatically win. My favorite is the care package drops (upon earning 4 kills in a row) that deliver random killstreaks or even the placable turret.You also now have a customizable call sign which is a placard which displays an emblem, a mockery banner, your rank, and gamertag. There are dozens of emblems and titles to unlock and mixing and matching is fun while the titles can match your personality such as ones that say \"Bow Down\", \"Omnipotent\", \"Joint Ops\", or \"Voyeur\". There is just an endless heap of options in this game and it truly makes it the best FPS multiplayer game ever made because there isn't one thing I would want to change about the game. I really want to give this game a 9.5, but the slightly disappointing single payer and covert ops bring it down a tad.Covert Ops seems more like an experiment than anything else because no one plays it online. Think of these as special missions that have you killing a certain amount of enemies, or racing down a hill in a snowmobile to get a certain time. 90% of these are impossible to do without someone else so you will most definitely need a buddy to beat these.On one last note the game looks amazing. With super high res textures and looking like close to real life on an HDTV in all its 1080p 50\" glory you will be drooling all the time. Everything is highly detailed and the sound is just amazing for that \"in the war\"experience. Modern Warfare 2 is just an amazing game and really shows how sequels should be: Improvements upon the original in which the developer listens to its fellow community and makes changes accordingly.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Twins Daddy","summary":"An INCREDIBLE Game...When Played WITH CHEAT CODES!!","reviewText":"I started playing GTA4 after playing Burnout Paradise.  For this reason, I quickly tossed it aside because of the horrible vehicle physics early in the game (like Roman's Taxi).  It was so frustrating just to drive a vehicle from point A to B without hitting everything in sight...Fortunately, the driving gets better as you progress through the game.  Then after completing a couple of other games I'm glad I came back to GTA4 because the programmers really did put a huge amount of thought and effort into creating one of the BEST OPEN SANDBOX type games I've ever played!I like to try things in games that are, say \"unconventional\".  Most of the time the hard code prevents you from doing these type things unless they are actually part of the storyline.  In GTA4, the interactive environment is so completely OPEN, you can do just about anything you please and get results...And sometimes it's not what you expected!  This kind of gameplay not only improves the gaming experience, but it also extends the life of the purchase -- A DOUBLE SHOT of getting the best Bang for your video game Buck!The first thing you notice after Niko starts doing \"jobs\" is how quickly the LCPD cops are all over you and they either take you in or do you in, depending on your level of cooperation.  Unfortunately, the only way to lose your \"Wanted Level\" is to outrun the cops...Like I said before, the vehicle physics make this a pretty frustrating exercise, especially after about the 20th time.  MY SOLUTION:  USE CHEAT CODES.This is one game where I believe gameplay is actually enhanced by liberal use of basic cheat codes.  That way you can focus on following the storyline and completing chapters or just creating general mayhem wherever Liberty City takes you without being outgunned or driving a beaten up vehicle or spending half your time outrunning the LCPD.  Cheat codes RULE in GTA4 and once you start using them, you'll never go back...The storyline is well integrated with excellent voice talent and very good cut scenes...You'll always feel like you're right in the middle of the action in this game and will never be left clueless about what's going on around you.  Just key in the cheat codes and learn your way around the cellphone and Liberty City will be your oyster.  Weapons are GREAT...Sound effects and explosions are GREAT...Reactions of pedestrians, other drivers and \"victims\" are frequently priceless.  Niko has more one-liners than James Bond.  This is a relatively long game which I imagine is dozens of hours longer without taking advantage of the cheat codes.FAVORITE CHEAT CODES:  482-555-0100 Restore health, armor & ammo; 486-555-0100 Get a selection of weapons; 486-555-0150 Different selection of weapons; 267-555-0100 Remove wanted level; 468-555-0100 Change weather; 359-555-0100 Spawn an Annihilator; 938-555-0100 Spawn a Jetmax; 625-555-0100 Spawn an NRG-900; 227-555-0100 Spawn an FIB Buffalo; 227-555-0147 Spawn a Turismo.  Enter these into your cellphone then use them when needed and you'll absolutely OWN Liberty City and everyone in it!Now near the end of the game, there are 2 different paths you can take...You'll know you're there when confronted with the \"Revenge\" or \"The Deal\" decision.  I recommend going to a safehouse and saving the game at this point so you can play it through to the end one way, then come back, reload and play it the other way.  (I turned off autosave at this point to prevent an unwanted overwrite.)  You can always go to a safehouse and save progress in an open save slot.  The 2 endings are similar, but still vary enough to warrant playing both ways.My favorite \"off the beaten path\" things to do in GTA4:1) Drive up to Jimmy Pegorino's house and go past the pool in the back to the covered deck area with the wooden benches.  Use your cheats to load up on health and ammo for the RPG/Rocket Launcher.  Then look over the wall to the street below and unload an RPG on an unsuspecting vehicle.  The cops/FIB/SWAT start arriving and you just blow their vehicles up with RPGs.  Then the LCPD choppers move in and you crouch down and do a little target practice on them.  If you get tired of RPGing the choppers, take out the M16 and shoot the gunners out instead.  Reload on health & ammo as needed and keep an eye out for FIB and SWAT as they try to flank you by the swimming pool.  Stay alive long enough and you'll actually shoot down ALL of the LCPD choppers...They won't have any more to send after you!  A pretty cool diversion...2) Pick a park or some other spot with lots of pedestrians and walk around spawning Jetmax after Jetmax right on top of people, then collect their cash...Listen to their reactions when the boats just appear out of nowhere and start dropping on their friends!  I did this one night outside of Bernie's apt on both sides of the street.  Then I just ran up one side of the street, crossed over to the other side and some of their money respawned.  Then I crossed the street and ran to the other victims and some of their money respawned.  I did this repeatedly and money randomly respawned each time!  But simply spawning a Jetmax on a helpless pedestrian, a cop car or some guy on a chopper is just good times...3) Go inside a Cluckin Bell and blow away the order-taker (it's a BONUS if the employee wearing the chicken head is there...Torch the chicken with a Molitov Cocktail.)  Then put your back to the wall facing the front doors.  As the cops come in, mow them down with the M16.  Refill on health and ammo as needed.  Soon, the SWAT team arrives.  Once they start coming in, take them down with the M16.  When it gets quiet for a moment, use your cheat to Remove Wanted Level...Then stroll outside, go to the SWAT truck and get in.  Drive off and Remove Wanted Level.  Congratulations!  You're now the proud owner of a SWAT truck!  Park it in the YELLOW parking area outside of one of your safehouses and it will stay there unless a cop arrests someone and uses it to take them in, which I actually caught one doing one time!4) Go to a pedestrian overpass at one of the highways.  Climb the fence and jump into the speeding cars below.  This will create a HUGE traffic jam (sometimes on both sides of the highway).  Reload your health and go back up to the overpass.  Shoot RPGs into the vehicles below for some gigantic explosions!5) Steal a chopper from the heli tours pad.  Fly to Liberty Island and just when you're hovering near her feet, jump out.  If done right, you'll land on a square area just below the statue's feet.  Run around until you find the door that says, \"NO HIDDEN CONTENT HERE\".  Walk THROUGH the door and climb the ladder.  You'll see a huge beating heart inside that's held in place by chains...Snap a couple of souvenir photos with the cellphone to show your friends back home!6) Go to the airport and drive into the cargo loading area.  Steal one of the large \"push-back\" trams (not the smaller luggage train tram) and start cruising around the runway, maybe even driving under a jumbo jet as it taxis on the runway.  This is a surprisingly durable vehicle and you can restore it to new condition every time you restore your health with the cheat.  The cops, FIB and SWAT will swarm you and they are extremely persistent in the airport's restricted area.  Will they get you or not?7) Drive up to the Penitentiary.  Either steal a vehicle right in front of the guards or just start driving around on the grass where the guards are watching the inmates.  Then keep your eyes open...You may see a couple of inmates escaping while the guards start jerking people out of their vehicles and stealing parked vehicles just to PURSUE YOU!  This is a laugh riot the first time you experience it...Those guards really, really want you BAD!8) While cruising the streets of LC, keep an eye out for Money Trucks. They seem to appear in bunches mostly at night. Either run one down and block its path or just block it from leaving a red light. Back off and hit it with an RPG. Immediately Remove Wanted Level then run around the truck picking up all of the $$$ until you get it all or it begins to disappear. Be careful about catching fire or adjacent vehicles catching fire and exploding on you. Also try stealing the Money Truck and driving to an obscure location to RPG it and collect your booty. I've blown up as many as 7 consecutive Money Trucks when they appear in large numbers. Good fun!These are just some of the examples of what I meant by the open sandbox design of this game...Feel like boxing?  Walk up to someone on the street and box their ears.  Feel like racing?  Brucie will hook you up with plenty of racing opps.  Feel like flying around Liberty City?  Spawn an Annihilator and see the view from above, maybe dropping in behind the walls of the Penitentiary to visit the inmates.  And things like this are IN ADDITION TO the primary storyline of the game, which is quite satisfying all by itself!That's PRECISELY the edge that sets GTA4 apart from the rest of the pack.  It's also why it DESERVES a 5-star rating.  Rockstar Games should be congratulated on the depth and magnitude of this game!  It really does stand alone at the top of the heap...WELL DONE!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-28-2009"}

Bravo Team is about to discover the evil nightmare that is growing all around them.","reviewerName":"nafysmiley","summary":"Hurray for Zombies!","reviewText":"In survival horror games, you generally have to fight your way through hordes zombies and monsters, while trying to conserve ammo and healing items, and solving the occasional puzzle.  Resident Evil 0 is no exception.  It does do some things differently from the rest of the Resident Evil series, but it still follows the same basic formula.The first, and possibly most important thing about RE 0, is that it has absolutely magnificent graphics, which are better than every video game made before it (including RE 1).  That is no exaggeration.  This is important because graphics go a long way towards providing the creepy atmosphere of Resident Evil, and without excellent graphics the game just wouldn't be as scary.  The lighting effects in particular are amazing.  The atmosphere is also helped along by excellent sound, especially the moaning of zombies, and the haunting echo of your own footsteps.RE 0 follows the story of what happens to Rebecca and the Bravo team just days before the mansion incident which is RE 1.  Rebecca is helped along in her attempts to escape the zombie hordes by a new character, Billy, an escaped prisoner accused of the murders of 23 people.  The story itself is actually kind of shallow, and there was a lot less insight into the background of the RE series than expected.  I still enjoyed it, mainly as a RE fan, but it could have used a little work.  Also, the voice acting was kind of cheesy, but it manages to be better than other RE games.Resident Evil 0, like all RE games, does have bad controls, but they shouldn't stop you from being able to play the game.  There is auto-aim, so shooting zombies really isn't all that hard.  Against tougher enemies, you usually get hurt. That is why the game is filled with healing items.  Anyways, the two person team concept was pretty cool, and it added some freshness to the gameplay (although it does make the game less scary, as you aren't alone).  I wouldn't want to have two people in every RE game, but it worked fine for this one.  The new monsters they added were pretty cool, especially the bosses.  It is worth mentioning that RE 0 lets you drop items, which is great due to the general lack of inventory space.Comparatively, RE 0 is probably the easiest game in the series, but that does not make it easy by any stretch.  For one thing, ammo management was tricky if you moved as a team, and there are just barely enough healing items for both people through most of the game (I was able to stock up by the very end).  Also, one of the new monster types (stretchy-gooey zombies) were incredibly tough, unless you use Molotovs or the grenade launcher.  Just to mention, except for a couple difficult puzzles, the puzzles were rather simple.Everything considered, RE 0 seems a lot better than the sum of it's parts, so I highly recommend it, although it isn't the best in the series (RE 1 for the gamecube is a better place to start).  However, if you have played other Resident Evil games, and not liked them, then RE 0 will definitely not change your mind. Resident Evil 0 takes about 8 or 9 hours to beat on the first try, and there isn't very much replay value (there is only one ending, and the stuff you unlock for beating it isn't that great), so it would be good for a rental.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-22-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00008QOL6","description":"When it comes to first-person shooters, there are two schools of thought. One harkens back to the originalDoom--frantic action, scary monsters, big weapons, and story is given short shrift. The second school is best exemplified byHalf-Life: strong narrative, consistent real-world weapons, consistent monsters, and settings.Doom'sheirs up until now have beenQuakeandSerious Sam, but nowPainkillercomes onto the scene leaving bloody footprints, and &#x85; let the carnage begin!You play a man who dies in a pathetic car crash (he's distracted because he's holding his girl's hand) and has spent a long time in purgatory. He thinks this is unfair because, despite being well-schooled in the art of killing, he maintains that he's done nothing wrong. Heaven makes a deal with him. Take care of a little invasion problem concerning Hell, and our hero can enter those pearly gates.Weak storyline aside,Painkillerbasically amounts to a brilliant series of arcade-style levels and challenges. The settings include darkened monasteries, graveyards, a horrifying asylum, a medieval town under siege, and even H-E-Double Hockey Sticks itself. The level design is brilliant, varied, and jam-packed with enemies. There seems to be no end to the amount and variety of cool monsters to fight, and they each explode into chunks of blood and gore in a most disturbingly satisfying manner. At the end of each level is a challenge, such as collecting a certain amount of gold or killing a Boss within a time limit. Winning the challenge gives you tarot cards you can use to make the game easier. The different cards bring haste, double-damage, invulnerability, and so on. This simple mechanic makes the game far more replayable than your average shooter.The graphics are first rate, which means you need a powerful PC to run the game with all the detail settings maxed out. The only other problem is a CD-copy protection bug that makes the game unplayable for some (a patch is available).Painkillermay seem a bit silly at first glance. But the gameplay mechanics, replayability (full multiplayer is also available), variety, and brilliant level design make it one of the finest and most satisfying shooters ever made. -Andrew S. BubPros:Superb gameplay and game balanceExcellent level designStrong replayabilityCons:Poor, unnecessary storylineHigh system requirementsProblematic copy protection","reviewerName":"Vappour","summary":"Operator error","reviewText":"This is more of a reply to &quot;vsokko&quot; who gave Painkiller only one star because it wouldn't run on his system.  More and more new games (like Painkiller and FarCry) will not run if you have CD/DVD emulation software (i.e. Nero, Norton Ghost, etc.) installed on the same disk partition as the game.  Simply disabling this software is not enough; it has to be completely uninstalled.  This is not a bug in the game; rather it's the publishers trying to prevent unauthorized copying.  Painkiller is a good game of the Serious Sam type with incredible graphics and a lot of imagination.  But, if you have the subject software and don't want to uninstall it (or put it on another partition), don't waste your money and blame the game.  Finally, keep in mind that Painkiller seems to be optimized for nVidia cards.  ATI cards (like my 9800 XT) work fine for some people but have serious &quot;issues&quot; for other players -- especially in the game's &quot;catacombs&quot; level.  I've checked a couple of video card/driver forums to confirm this.  Hopefully, Dreamcatcher will issue a patch or ATI will fix their drivers, but, for now, beware.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2004"}

The horizon of graphic is pretty far, there are many interesting things to explore.But... other than being gorgeous, the game simply lacks gameplay.The missions are all very easy. The enemies are all very easy and the gameplay must have been geared to a younger group of players than me (I'm on my early 20s). The only true enemy of Spiderman in this game is water.  All the fights are easy, Rhino, and all of them... just fall very easily (and there aren't even that many of the more special enemies that try to make it challenging).  The only truly difficult parts of the game are the ones that involve water, the duel over the statue of liberty and the final battle against Dr Ock both involve the constant risk of falling on water and since that kills you at once it is the only true challenge in the game.  I find that annoying and frankly a bit old.The side quests such as finding sckyscraper special locations and stuff are a good idea (reminds me of Grand Theft Auto), but frankly there is no payoff. You find all of them and all you get is a medal on your status screen saying you did it.  Who cares? There are so many things that could have been added such as different costumes for Spidey, changes to Peter's apt, and etc. (Again, similar things have been done before for example in GTA).The random missions are very repetitive (by the 8-9 time a armored car was being robbed it got to be pretty boring).The game still is pretty funny though, the voices are made by the actors from the movie so they are great.I just wish they had spent some of the time they used making the amazing NY in the game creating some more story and gameplay instead.The 9/11 memorial in the game was a pretty neat and sensitive inclusion though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2005"}

So the gameplay gets broken up enough so that Heavenly Sword never gets too monotonous.

{"product_name":"B00004U5VK","description":"PlayStation2 owners with a passion forResident Evil's  genre-launching gameplay are in luck: Capcom delivers the same  world-famous gameplay style (sans zombies) in a beautiful action-adventure  set in a mystical medieval Japanese kingdom.Onimusha: Warlordsprobably won't win any awards for groundbreaking gameplay, but the  fast-paced action promises to overload the senses with more than enough  stimuli to notice.The experience is set in 16th-century Japan, a fantastical era in which  warlords clash for control of the country. As the samurai Samanosuke,  players volunteer to rescue the kidnapped princess Yuki. No surprise  that the ultimate goal (and the entire story line, for that matter)  falls by the wayside as hordes of demons converge on the player hour  after hour. The weapons system benefits from the flashy graphics--as  players discover and add gems to a gauntlet, weapon upgrades increase  firepower with increasingly dramatic effects.Graphically, the game is stunning. Carving through the levels--forests,  tunnels, and the requisite dark, dank castle environment--isn't  anything less than a spectacular experience, thanks much in part to the  game's unusually high production values. Character models are built  from up to 10,000 polygons each--high detail, even for a PS2 game.  Subtle environmental effects--the wind flowing through the trees, for  instance, ripples the fabric in characters' clothes--furthers the  game's realism. The game's backgrounds are painstakingly detailed and  nicely enhanced by dynamic lighting effects.The talent behind the aural effects is just as impressive. Japanese  actor Takeshi Kaneshiro lent his voice to the main character, and a  200-piece orchestra delivers a dramatic score.Call over any PS2 skeptics in your neighborhood, then load upOnimusha: Warlords.

The premise alone is enough to draw in any lover of anime or beat-em up game fans. The game's story is straightforward, but keeps you interested with its endearing main characters and hideous villains (some of the dialogue can be cheesy at times, but one normally expects such a thing from a Capcom game). The warlord Nobunaga Oda has returned after seemingly being killed during a battle by a stray arrow that pierced his throat. He allies himself with demons and wishes to gain their power by offering Samanosuke's cousin, Princess Yuki, to the demons as a sacrifice. Samanosuke ofcourse, embarks on a quest to save her. The controls in this game were a little dated for its time, but they worked. You could only move the characters around with the D-Pad like the original Resident Evil games, but considering the game has fixed camera positions that look at you from all directions, using the analog stick would have made navigating the characters more confusing. Unlike the Resident Evil games, the combat is more fast-paced and actually lets you go toe to toe with the many demonic enemies you face by blocking or dodging their attacks and then slicing them up with one of several awesomely crafted mortal or magical blades. The main character Samanosuke Akechi is a mighty samurai who is given a powerful gauntlet that lets him absorb the souls of defeated demons, which in turn allow him to upgrade his magic weapons with more powerful elemental attacks (namely lightning, fire, and wind). He could also upgrade the magic orbs that provide him with his weapons to open sealed doors leading to new areas. He can even use a bow and arrow and a rifle, but both weapons have limited ammunition. The other controllable character, Kaede the ninja, isn't as strong or resilient as Samanosuke, but she's much quicker and more agile. She acquires one magical blade, but still possesses no elemental attacks. She also has only one ranged weapon, throwing knives/kunai. Playing as Kaede will make you feel more vulnerable when you face some of the tougher enemies, making you miss being Samanosuke, while at the same time giving the ninja's scenarios a slightly more tense feeling to them.Regardless of which character you're playing as, this game offers plenty of challenging yet fair battles, especially the boss battles (except the first one, which was quite easy). Another similarity this game has to the Resident Evil ones is the use of puzzles, which you'll spend at least half the game working on. None of them are too challenging, except for one intense puzzle sequence where you constantly switch between Samanosuke and Kaede to make it through a room with spike-filled trap doors; this is immediately followed up by a heart pounding race against time to free Samanosuke from a sealed hallway filling up with water by moving a collection of metal plates around in the right order until you put two specific pieces together to form a symbol which unlocks the seal. The game's music matches the current situations and locations nicely, whether you're in a dark and gloomy basement with creepy horror music in the background, or outside rescuing other (rather cowardly) samurai from demons with orchestral scores empowering you with a \"saving the day\" feel. The in-game graphics are quite good and give the characters (human or otherwise) a believable sense of weight and style. The CGI cutscenes are simply beautiful and combine with the awesome music to give you an enjoyable and memorable cinematic experience. The scene that plays after Samanosuke defeats the final boss is a personal favorite of mine and will most certainly give you goosebumps. This game is a perfect blend of survival horror and beat-em up action and while it is very linear and quite short (even first time players should beat it in no more than six hours), it's fun and memorable.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2010"}

But I didn't, and recently I gave it another go, and was glad I did so. This game can be mastered with only a moderate amount of effort, and is incredibly fun if you do so. The action is fast paced, unrelenting, unforgiving, and you have to get it down to a science. The graphics are beautiful, and makes me long terribly for more 2D action just like this(ahem...Symphony of the Night 2, please?).

{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"Turning the Tables of the Musical Game Genre","reviewText":"In video game history 2009 will most certainly be known for the year of way too many musical games.  Between Guitar Hero: Metallica, Guitar Hero 5, Rock Band: Beatles, and the upcoming titles Band Hero and Guitar Hero: Van Halen, the gaming industry has just bombarded us gamers will a diverse selection to choose from.  However, it all seems to be just more of the same but with a massive price tag that ranges into the several hundred dollar range (IE: Rock Band Beatles Special Edition).  As if to try and stir things up and appeal to a different audience, namely the rap and hip-hop music fans, Activision invented DJ Hero, the turntable version.DJ Hero functions on the same principles as Guitar Hero, you weld a giant plastic imitation of a real instrument and hit timed buttons that correspond to a musical board on the screen.  Unlike Guitar Hero, however, DJ Hero utilizes an entirely different controller interface (namely, a turntable) and sports several new ways to hit the timed buttons.  Unlike the \"GH\" guitars that have a strummer and fret buttons, the DJ Hero turntable has three buttons on a turntable board as well as a track switch toggle that bounces the speakers between three tracks.  The turntable controller also allows the player to \"scratch\" the turntable by rapidly moving the turntable back and forth.  Combine all three controller features and you've got a gaming controller that requires you to reeducate yourself entirely on how to play.  Fortunately, it only took me an hour to properly get a good handle on the turntable controller and was up to the \"normal\" difficulty shortly thereafter.My only two criticisms of the turntable controller pertains to how the controller must be placed and button placement.  I've noticed that it cannot sit in my lap otherwise, over time, my wrist and fingers get severely stiff.  In order to prevent this, I had to put the turntable controller on a flat surface and keep my hands hovered above to prevent stiffness.  This necessitates you either have a TV tray or a table to play on, which most of us do not have within ample space of the console.My other criticism to the controller is the star power/euphoria button that acts as a score multiplier.  The tutorial tells you to hit the button when it flashes red or the outside of the on-screen table turns blue.  Problem with this is that my eyes are on the screen and not looking down at the controller.  Not to mention the on-screen indication that Euphoria is ready is barely noticeable.  This means you can do an entire mix without knowing you had Euphoria mode ready to go.  Activision should have taken a lesson from Guitar Hero and placed a message on the screen saying, \"Euphoria Mode Ready.\"Once you've figured out how to utilize the turntable controller, you go through several songs or \"mixes\" that basically mix two songs into one continuous track.  Every mix mixes two different songs so just because you see a song you like does NOT mean you will get that whole song.  Quite the contrary, I was excited for DJ Hero because I love the song Feel Good, Inc. by the Gorillaz but it was mixed with \"Heard it Through the Grapevine\" by Marvin Gaye.  I was disappointed by this since I wanted to play one song per mix but my ignorance made me fail to realize that that is what DJs do, they mix songs (1,000 lashes with a wet noodle to me!).  Keep this in mind if you are unaware of how DJs actually mix mixes.Fortunately, when you get past that element you can appreciate just how well the songs are mixed.  The aforementioned Gorillaz vs. Marvin Gaye mix was absolutely fantastic as it flowed almost flawlessly.  The other mixes I tried were pretty good as well, so while I could not experience my favorite songs on their own I could experience them in an all new light.  Whoever composed the mixes should get real recognition for this.My biggest criticism pertaining to the mixes themselves is that they are edited and the player does not get the option of selecting or even buying a version that has parental advisory music.  I know this may sound horrible to parents reading this, but the primary demographic interested in DJ Hero are rap and hip-hop fans that want the music in it's unadulterated form.  A \"DJ Villain\" version with an \"M\" rating would have been a better marketing move so it could be palatable to the primary demographic.  This way, you can include songs from Lil' Jon, Tupac, Ice Cube, Pucifer, Blood Hound Gang, etc. that were not super short or highly edited.  This game is, without a doubt, family friendly and I believe that alienates the target audience but opens the market up to another.All in all, is DJ Hero worth the price?  Personally, I do not think so (I got a demo version from Amazon) as it lacks a general appeal beyond party novelty.  Without a real party mix (especially without anything from Night at the Roxbury), DJ Hero may be revolutionary in it's controller interface and sound mixing, which is amazing, but it just doesn't quite cut it enough to justify spending money on it.A solid B-.Peace out!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-27-2009"}

(Yes, Konami pioneered this space with \"Beatmania\", but it never really caught on with home console owners, and Activision's marketing muscle means \"DJ Hero\" will be the first title to gain mass-market awareness.)Activision has finally answered that call with -- surprise! -- \"DJ Hero\", an apparently a well-polished product that should boast the right combination of great music, addicting gameplay, and gorgeous presentation to earn it a spot in the ranks of great music games.Now for some disclosures: I obtained a demo of the product through the Amazon Vine program. The bundle consisted of a wired turntable controller and a demo disc featuring five songs: one tutorial track, one multi-player track and three for the main game. While grateful for the chance to get my hands on the product early, the demo disc was far too limited to be able to truly write a well-informed review. Hence, the weasel words in this review, such as \"apparently\", \"should\", etc.Another disclosure: I am not generally a fan of rap, hip-hop or dance music. Rock, be it of the classic, blues, southern, punk, alternative, or even country variety, is where my soul lies. So it's a testament to \"DJ Hero\" that it managed to draw me in despite a near-total unfamiliarity with the genre. The game should grab many die-hard rockers right from the tutorial, which is based arond a mix of Queen's \"Another One Bites the Dust\". While I'm hard-pressed to name the other tracks from memory, I found them fun and enjoyable.Other reviews have expounded on the gameplay in great detail, so I'll just say here that if you enjoyed having your dexterity and sense of rhythm challenged by any of the \"Guitar Hero\" or \"Rock Band\" games, you'll probably get a kick out of trying to master the tricks of the turntable. The three finger buttons on the turntable look like the fret buttons on a guitar controller, but the similarity ends there. In the course of a song, you'll be asked not only to hit those buttons, but to \"scratch\" the turntable, quickly crossfade from one part of a mix to another, and add your own effects in a way similar to the whammy bar in the \"Guitar Hero\" games. It's an intriguing mix of actions that add up to a good challenge.In a stroke of genius by developer FreeStyleGames, a second person can join using a guitar controller to play the guitar sections of the mixes. This is a great way to get other people to jump in since there's a good chance you or someone you know already has a guitar controller. It not only opens up the game to rock-oriented folks who may be reluctant to try their hand at the turntable, but it also allows people to play together without requiring another pricey turntable accessory.A word about the turntable. Rarely does a new controller boast this level of sturdiness and attractiveness. It's a handsome little unit that turns heads and feels solid and well-built. The on-screen visuals are also top-notch, featuring different house-party and club settings from around the globe. Again, since this review was limited to a demo disc, I was unable to check out the bulk of locales and playable characters. In another nice touch, the game also features an autoplay mode that will just play the music for a party or whatnot. That's a great feature and one that needs to come to \"Guitar Hero\". Hopefully it will also support tracks you add via download.So in the end, does \"DJ Hero\" work? It does, and it will be interesting to see if the title can succeed in expanding music games to other genres, attracting new audiences and fans as people tire of the rock-based games. If you are a fan of hip-hop who couldn't get into \"Guitar Hero\", this is could be your game. If you're a huge fan of music games in general and want a fresh challenge, this could be your game. And if you're simply looking for something to liven up your next party, this could be your game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2009"}

The story is great, and the characters are somewhat interesting. I love the balance of combat, exploring, and upgrading. People will compare this to Uncharted, but its nothing like it....its BETTER. I cared very little about Drakes exploration and betrayals by his friends. His journeys were meaningless. Lara is ship wrecked, stranded, and fighting for her life and her friends...and along the way, just so happens to be exploring a massive and uncharted island.Lara takes some real punishment in this adventure. From being beaten, falling from cliffs, being burned, stabbed, shot.....this girl is a freaking hero.Now the multiplayer.....total trash in my opinion. I think they added it just to say it has a multiplayer. Uncharted's multiplayer does however beat Tomb Raider 10 to 1.I still havent beaten Tomb Raider yet. Im still just going through collecting everything. Also, I never played the older tomb raiders either. They never gained my interest until now.If you like a great meaningful story and purpose, exploration, combat, looting and upgrading...TOMB RAIDER IS A GREAT CHOICE TO BUY.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0001NBNGG","description":"The creepy tale of a possessed Japanese village (Hanuda) told through the eyes of ten playable characters in combination with some impressively innovative gameplay&nbsp;features should totally make my day&nbsp;&#8211; but playing Siren turns out to be sadly different than I was expecting.The game's two big features: sightjacking (where you see through the eyes of other characters) and the Link Navigator (which manages the plot's order of events) sadly don't add to the player's experience enough to justify their problematic existence.Sightjacking is more fun to mess around with than it is helpful to the player. Watching the paths of roaming enemies can offer useful information, but the stealth mechanic is so simplistic that the data is rarely necessary. In many situations, being seen by enemies is something that you can't avoid or recover from &#8211; they will find you, and they will kill you. This is fine by me, but when the only stealth-orientated skill that is offered is a painfully slow crawl (and a distracting yell, which had little to no effect that I could perceive), it doesn't make me want to be all that sneaky. There isn't a sound meter, no real way to know if enemies can see you or not (like a vision cone or shadow meter), and very little chance of distracting them with diversions. It is more fun and more efficient to just run through levels and see what happens than to use the sightjacking feature to suss out a plan of attack.Which leads to discussion of the game's other big feature, the Link Navigator. Siren's storytelling plan sounds like a survival horror Real World season: Pick 10 characters to escape the apocalypse and find out what happens over 3 days through 78 missions &#8211; you could call it Siren: Hanuda. The complication is that the order of events is jumbled and the Link Navigator is supposed to help you keep track. What this means, from a player's point of view, is that the game's story doesn't really get its hook into you &#8211; not even in the first few hours. The tales are too disjointed, the characters too many, and the plot too slow in getting going.The more conventional aspects of this game like sound design and graphics are also something that people will have mixed feelings about. The creatures' insane, maniacal laughs are honestly unnerving, and therefore good for this game. The graphics look to be actual pictures of the characters' faces and lend a realistic, but still skewed version of each person &#8211; they're detailed, but strangely flat. I think that this is a nice subtle touch, but others may disagree.I really, really wanted to like Siren, but in the end, I just didn't have much fun or feel like the innovative parts of the game were used to their advantage. It has good ideas, and I'm glad to see experimentation in survival horror, but this should be chalked up as a failed test in the genre.Concept:Navigate a horrific village as ten different charactersGraphics:Muddy and jerky&#xC2;&#xA0;&#8211; but it fits with the disjointed feel of the gameplaySound:The best part of this game, the sound effects are creepy and (for lack of a better word) ickyPlayability:The context-sensitive menu system is&#xC2;&#xA0;counter-intuitive and the stealth mechanics are pretty archaic and basicEntertainment:I really need a reason to care in a game this cerebral and slow-paced, and Siren doesn't give it to meReplay:ModerateRated:6.25 out of 10Editor:Lisa MasonIssue:May 20042nd Opinion:From a conceptual standpoint, Siren is chock-full of ingenuity, and is a soaring success when it comes to the delivery of unusual ideas. Forming a mental bond with your attackers so that you see the surroundings from their perspective is a great idea that leads to some unnerving situations. This gimmick only goes so far, however. I found its functionality, and the entire gameplay package for that matter, to be clunky, and above all, frustrating. I grew so disenchanted with trying to pick up enemy sight that I avoided using this technique whenever I could. I love the episodic approach to storytelling &#8211; but the execution of gameplay bothered me to no end.Rated:5.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"CARLOS MONTERO \"A true gamer\"","summary":"There is a difference between survival horror games","reviewText":"At first i thought that every horror game was the same, i thought after playing the resident evil saga that they'll go in the same direction, well, that changed when i played haunting grounds, well, that game made me see that i could be scared a lot with a game and that not every survival horror has to be the same. I then got this game, well, it's scary, not as much as haunting grounds, but the gameplay, game style is very different from anything that i have played before and this game is really good and scary enough to make you wait 'till the night to play it.The good thing is that you can play events in time, you play a piece of the game from the day before, then in the present, and then in the future, it's a pulp fiction like horror movie.It's a very good game, even if don't like the horror genre, the game stills makes you play it.I give this game five stars 'cause the game has great graphics, great sound and the game simply surprised me. When i paid nine bucks with free shipping, i thought, well, let's check it out, well, the game is a bargain, cheaper as any old game but good as any new game.I recommend this game 'cause i know it'll surprise you also.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2007"}
{"product_name":"B001C58T46","reviewerName":"D","summary":"not the greatest game ever but its ok","reviewText":"Wario Land shake it is a 2d platformer released back on the original wii in 2008 and is the 5th (or 6 if you count the ds one) in the Wario land series. I'm a huge fan of the original Wario land games expecilly the 1st on back on the original gameboy. I would say behind the Mario and sonic games there some of the best platformers ever made.Shake it however just feels a little off for some reason. Theirs only a few enemy types, half of them can't even hurt you besides just getting in the way a little bit. The levels are designed well for exploration but theirs not many obstacles/pitfalls to stop you.  I believe its more or less aimed more towards younger gamers compared to the other Wario land games because it is really easy to beat the game. Now getting all the collectibles in this game is a different story as in all the Wario games its very challenging to get some of them and it will take moderate skill to 100% the game. Theres also a few wii remote functions you have to do like shaking treasure bags and throwing stuff to hit a object. It feels kinda gimicky but it could have been a lot worse so its not enough to hurt the game.I will give this game some credit for the graphics. Its almost like playing a Saturday morning cartoon and I wish the would bring this style to make a 2d Mario or to bring it back on the next Wario land game whatever platform it may be. The only problem with the graphics is that during most of the game there's a large useless bar on both sides of the screen that pretty much restricts widescreen play with this game. The music isn't bad not the best I've heard from a Nintendo game but its not the worst either. There is a few good tracks here and there though. That's really all to say about the sound other than the occasional WARRRIOOOOOO soundsIn general I would say compared to other 2d or 3d platformers on the system (new mario bros, dk country returns) this one is a little bit of a step down but it is more relaxing so if you have played a lot of new Mario bros and dk country on the Wii and want something a little less stressful, if you want a game for your kids or a younger gamer  then I would recommend it if you can get it cheap. However if you have a gameboy I would recommend playing the 1st 4 Wario land games as I found them to be a lot more fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2014"}

So it shouldn't be a surprise for me to say that I just don't see what's so astounding about this game and why it gets the over the top reviews, I suppose if I played all of the other mega-games like Warcraft and Oblivion I'd have something to compare this to but I don't.The first thing I noticed was the not so good human modeling and the movement, very weak looking and awkward especially in third person. The next was the contrast, I turned the brightness up but the faces in some situations are just too dark and hard to see. The story seems pretty standard post-apocalypse stuff and the more involved and complicated interface also turned me off according to my taste in games. So the story is just not that interesting to me and the gameplay doesn't seem to be all that satisfying, HL2 had both. All the people who's salary depends on the selling of videogames  and their reviews were overdone I think. Sorry to rain on the parade but this just isn't all that good to me.A last note was a question about the securom stuff, if it limits me to a number of installs on my machine is this going to be a problem with the reselling? I had that problem with HL2 because even after 6 CD's I still had to connect to Steam to download most of the game and setup an account, I sold it and of course Steam tells the new buyer that it's a fake which is not true, so that's a big turnoff and a reason to never buy games that require online stuff and activation as you can't resell them, is this true for this title?","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00007KQE9","reviewerName":"Bilbo Baggins \"mighty hobbit\"","summary":"Kung Fu Fighting!!","reviewText":"I got into this game because I am a Romance of the three kingdoms fan so I was familiar with the characters.  This game is nothing like that one however.  This is almost constant action from the first moment which is pretty cool.  It was pretty awesome being able to deliver a beat down with Lu Bu for the first time.  A lot of people have written about how this game is similar to previous Dynasty warrior games but as this is the first one I bought I can't complain about the originality, or lack thereof.  I suppose if you have any of the others you may want to rent it first to see if it is truly worthy of your fifty bucks.  The best thing about this game is the two player option.  It makes defeating the harder stages more feasible.  The next best thing is all the cool items you can unlock, including the mysterious level 10 weapons which can be quite difficult if not impossible to unlock without the aid of a second player.  It took me forever to unlock Cao Ren's weapon, among others.Anyway, be sure to but his game if you like the romance series or you just like action games.  Romance of the three kingdoms is still probably my favorite game but sometimes you want to defeat Dong Zhuo with a well planned strategic attack and some times you just want to backstab him with Lu Bu and chop him in the neck with a huge halberd.  And if that last sentence made any sense to you then you definitely need to buy this game.  Of course you probably have it already.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-04-2003"}

The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

{"product_name":"B000FRS9II","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"A few bullets short of perfect","reviewText":"Let's face it: hype can really bring down a game, especially post-launch when after all the buzz and expectations have been quieted down and you look at it not in terms of \"will this game rock?\" but rather \"does it deserve to be called that awesome?\" In the case of Gears of War, one of the big premier blockbusters for the Xbox 360, it's one of those cases where, indeed there is some entertainment to be had and it's the perfect game when you want to just kill stuff without having to go online to deal with annoying brats. But then again, this game does have its flaws and they're pretty easy to spot but since it's Gears, people go \"meh, no big deal\" whereas most games get called out and criticized heavily. All this being said, Gears of War is still a fun game but one that can get maddeningly frustrating while it delivers balls-to-the-wall entertainment.Story: On the planet Sera, the inhabitants have been terrorized by an alien race known as the Locust Horde who suddenly popped out of the ground on Emergence Day (\"E-Day\") and are gradually reducing the number of the survivors. While fighting through a prison, Dom Santiago rescues his friend and your main guy, Marcus Fenix, and it's up to you to make it through dangerous cities and areas to hopefully nail a crippling blow to the Locust Horde.Yep, that's it. That's the story and I'm not trying to be mean here since there's not much plot here and what plot there is tends to be skipped over or not given as much depth. Fans who have played 2 will note 2 references to Maria and yet even that plot wasn't given as much attention despite Epic saying it's more \"epic and personal\". There's one line about the \"sham\" of a trial that Marcus had, well what kind of sham? Still don't know. As far as the game's story is concerned, I wasn't a big fan of the pacing. While indeed it's fairly short at 8-10 hours give or take the difficulty and skill, the pieces never really felt connected and there was some really slow parts. Not an in-depth story by any stretch but likable enough to push through.Graphics: This is really a cosmetic nitpick than anything but I never liked the blood in games that uses the Unreal Engine like Uncharted since it was seemed more mass-like and gooey than a liquid but in a game like this, it seems to go hand-in-hand. But one can't deny the graphical power of the engine and from the extremely detailed character animation, scale of the firefights and architecture make this a showcase for what the 360 can bring to the table. Really small nags are the famous Unreal Engine texture problems, occasional pauses, slight framerate things but they're usually never an issue or distracting enough to cause frustration. One thing though is despite how stunning it looks, it's very drab looking with a lot of mild colors and desaturated colors but that's sort of a Gears look I guess.Sound/Music: The movie 300 was something that I tried several times to get into but I never could and one theory was that it was basically a movie for the frat boys who'll cheer at the violent parts and revel in the weird use of heavy metal music yet it has quote-unquote \"depth\" that made it different than most action movies. Not. Gears of War on the other hand knows it's basically a dumb summer blockbuster movie and just rolls with it from the line readings and one-liner dialogue. It's not meant to elicit tears but it's not eye-rolling either. The music however is fantastic from the creeping sound design to the big bombastic moments during firefights, this is one to have a stereo on.Gameplay: Whereas shooters like Call of Duty or Halo are all about strafing a little bit from a wall or cover just enough to nail the enemy, Gears of War is all about taking cover. From columns to big blocks of stone, doorways, ruined cars etc, just press A and your character slams his side and is able to avoid enemy fire. Pressing the LT lets you take aim and RT to fire or pressing RT is just covering fire, inaccurate but helpful for nailing charging Locusts without wanting to pop up. Carrying up to 4 weapons at a time, we have the Hammer of Dawn, a laser-targeting system where a satellite will beam huge rays onto the area and all but vaporizing the enemy to standard pistols and shotgun. The highlight of course is the Lancer, which is basically a normal assault rifle only it has a chainsaw for a bayonet. Just hold the B, get closer to an enemy and zzzzzz!, you saw them in half. Only problem is that getting shot stops the revving and it's really frustrating to try to chainsaw someone only to get shot and have it stop.The big problem with the game is the AI and not the enemies who'll flank, throw grenades and do whatever it takes till you're lifeless on the ground. The AI problems come from your teammates since they are, to borrow a Yahtzee phrase, \"pants-on-head retarded\". They'll openly go out of cover for seemingly no apparent reason other than wanting to get closer and they'll end up crying for help to be revived which you do by pressing X near the body. It happens with such frequency that I even saved one guy only to literally need help 4 seconds later when he got out of cover instead of just staying put. While co-op in most games is more fun, here it's more beneficial you go through it co-op since the players will be smarter than the game itself. You can issue squad commands like attack, cease fire and regroup but more often that not it's like \"I can't do that right now\". Hope you like to babysit.Another issue is that the A button becomes a multi-use button from slipping in and out of cover, doing a \"roadie run\", swat turns and rolling out of the way and many times I'd try to get away only to take cover and it's like \"no, I want you to roll\".  Oh and there is some incredibly trying moments in the difficulty where Hardcore is fairly hard at times thanks to the AI of your squad but also it's very frustrating to all of a sudden be shot by a rocket launching bugger or the Torque Bow users when you're trying to do something else. One time I was in a battle and enemies literally spawned right behind me and I had no idea they were even there. Strangely they fixed this in the sequel where it was more easier yet more funner so least that's an improvement.As far as the multiplayer is concerned, you gotta admire Epic releasing so many maps, especially for 2 (they're up to 29 now) but it's slightly disappointing. During \"join a quick match\", after 3 refreshes it literally cycled between the same 2 matches almost as if out of the, I'm sure thousands, that still play this online, there's only 2 matches that even pop up. Plus the match itself is a race, who can find the sniper first, who got the boomshot first and for the most part it's not like Killzone or Call of Duty where at least you have balancing between shotguns, RPG's etc but here it's like \"I have a grenade launcher and you don't\" which usually means an easier win for them. Despite the matchmaking and lag of the sequel, I found it a way funner multiplayer and this one is probably one of the few I'd consider boosting then leaving it alone.Is it game of the year? No, well at least not to me but considering the huge release and fanfare the game got, it sure seems like it. But it's like a lot of movies out there that get exceedingly popular for no reason other than it's fun yet it's got a couple of issues.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2008"}

With the cel shaded graphics now Link has emotions which can sometimes really help understand what he's really thinking opposed to that stupid grin from the older games.In this game you can choose how long you want to play it.  For example if you really don't like to play forever you can skip through and go through the dungeons and do all the required missions, or you can make it longer by filling out your entire sea chart, collecting all the heart pieces, playing mini-games, and using the new GBA link cable and finding \"extras\" in the dungeons.Another great thing about this is the fact that it has a little something from each of the older games.

If you've been waiting to see what Shadow of the Colossus would look like on a current-gen system, this is as close as you'll get until the repackaged version for the PS3.  The puzzles, while not extremely challenging, are still relatively fun along the lines of God of War or even Uncharted.Controls and gameplay are responsive and natural.  An inventive magic system keeps this from being a complete button masher when faced with the standard enemies.  For me, the game's greatest asset is the story.  I've never really cared about the plot one way or the other in previous Castlevania games.  It's usually the same old \"Dracula is up to no good\" sort anyway.  This goes a lot deeper, like a dark fantasy novel or film.  The voice acting is rivaled only by Uncharted, with numerous well-known celebrities lending their talents.  Graphics are fantastic, and the sound is flawless.If 4 1/2 stars was selectable, that's what I would award this game.  Repetitive enemies are the only drawback that causes the game to get a little tedious at times.

Bakehorn","summary":"This old dog's tricks are still cool.","reviewText":"Sam Fisher is in quite a jiffy. The mole deep inside the territory of a domestic terrorist organization, he's the double agent holding a gun in the face of an innocent man, an innocent man the bad guys want dead and the good guys don't. Lambert's screeching in one ear and the enemy impatiently barks in the other, waiting as Sam decides to hit or miss. You, the player, grip the right trigger and it's up to you and only you to let the bullet hit its mark or ricochet harmlessly off of the grimy wall.Ubisoft's fourth Splinter Cell adventure, Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Double Agent has an ongoing double agent theme, hence its title. Sam Fisher's ready for retirement and his last mission before that big break is a massive undercover operation that takes him into the belly of John Brown's Army, or the JBA. The JBA is an organization bent on terrorizing all over the globe. The NSA wants Sam to work for the enemy at all the right times while keeping his head on straight and his mind on the greater good. The story and the missions that take place in Splinter Cell: Double Agent constantly put you, the player, into these two-sided situations. Do you risk losing JBA trust in order to secure some files for the NSA, or alternatively, lose Lambert's respect for hitting a target the JBA wants out of the gene pool?In some ways, this trust system works well with the otherwise traditional Splinter Cell gameplay. Since most of your missions have you being dispatched by the JBA, your primary goals will more or less be to please them. I found at many points through the game that it was difficult to maintain a good side with the NSA, and oftentimes their objectives required a lot more work than the JBA's kill-and-blow-stuff-up mentality. It's not so much like Star Wars: Knights Of The Old Republic, where your decisions make you a light-aligned or dark-aligned character, but it's a mutual system where a balance of sorts must be maintained. The interesting twist is that at no point in the game can either the JBA's or the NSA's trust completely deplete; and even in mid-mission if you agitate either side too much it's game over. It is entirely possible to find yourself in a lose-lose situation where you've saved your file in a spot where you didn't know you were about to lose that last shred of trust, and because of that, the trust system can be a little frustrating.Still, the Splinter Cell gameplay is better than ever and you're able to keep Sam in line in several great missions. You'll put all of his abilities to the test, and even early on you'll find yourself being as acrobatic as a gymnast, only you're also as capable to kill as a precise sniper shot to the head. Sam's got all sorts of tools, including the return of favorites like the Sticky Shocker. Those never get old. Sam can also crack safes and hack computers and all of that cool stealth stuff, but most of that is old hat. Really the only big difference is the lack of on-screen meters. It's all the rage these days to show status information in a dynamic form, and Splinter Cell: Double Agent jumps that bandwagon pretty well. Sam's shadow meter has been replaced with a bright light mechanism. As he's cloaked in darkness, the light turns green, but should an enemy notice him or his presence, the light will turn yellow. In combat, or when discovered, the light is red, letting the player know of the imminent danger. The light thing is a little perplexing; similar to Sam's trusty googles, wouldn't the enemy see lights emitting from the darkness? Oh well. In short, Splinter Cell: Double Agent is more of the same stuff you've enjoyed for four years, but it's as much fun as it's always been and feels just like it always has.Splinter Cell set a visual bar in 2002 when it came out on the Xbox, a bar that even some of today's new, lesser-developed Xbox releases can't reach. Needless to say the four years since then have worked magic on the visuals and the series' Xbox 360 debut is every bit as impressive as the series' debut back on the Xbox. Sam's grizzly, aging appearance is as detailed as ever and the environments that are snuck through are detailed perfectly down to the very last shadow. Oh, and yes, the curtain effect still looks better here than in any other game out there. If it weren't for the series' notoriously stiff animation, this would be a perfect graphical package. The voice acting is as flawless as ever, and with the emotional weight in some of the game's choices you'll hear a reciprocated effect from the supporting characters, like Lambert and the JBA's raspy leader, Emile. The gun sound effects still don't sound as explosive as other games but the ambient music and great voice overs do the trick aurally.Online multiplayer has been a Splinter Cell highlight since it revolutionized online gaming in Splinter Cell: Pandora tomorrow. Like the single-player game, it wasn't broke, so Ubisoft didn't do a lot to fix it. Avid online gamers might cry fowl about a few things; some gameplay adjustments have been made that make the game a little less \"in the dark,\" so to speak. Spies have really been dumbed down, and not in terms of their maneuverability, but now mercenaries can see a white outline around them after spotting them. Not only that, but force feedback in the controller of a player-controlled mercenary will alert him or her when a spy is nearby. This takes out all of the element of surprise, making it even harder for spies to sneak up on and silently kill mercenaries. Still, online multiplayer is intense and a lot of fun. Splinter Cell: Double Agent is easily one of the best Xbox Live games so far.In conclusion, there is so little wrong with Splinter Cell: Double Agent that it takes some searching to point out flaws. As I pointed out earlier, the game isn't all that fresh, and the core gameplay is largely the same with Sam having a very limited amount of new abilities. It's really up to you to decide if you want to play through a bunch of missions with similar mechanics as three other past video games. If you make the decision to purchase Splinter Cell: Double Agent, you're most likely an action fan or someone who's already delved into the Splinter Cell franchise. Either way, you're going to enjoy this one. It's one of the better action games of the year and quite possibly the best Splinter Cell yet.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2006"}

They have hit it big over 25 years since they came around making the original NES system, and they are hitting it out of the ballpark again. WIth the success around the Nintendo DS since the system came around in 2004, it has really changed the way we play video games on the go, and has shown with a simple touch, we can score big against Bowser in New Super Mario Brothers, we can sharpen our minds in Brain Age, and even more joy with it. Yet when Nintendo came around with the DSi a couple of years ago, it also borrowed some great pages from the Wii, and how we can get original fun all in just a simple video game download. Yet, that incarnation of the DS was actually fun, yet somehow deeply overshadowed. Now, they are about to take on the next dimension, and honestly it is worth the money.The all-new Nintendo 3DS, brings in more fierceness and excitement that we all have loved from the Nintendo DS, into the next dimension. It looks absolutely great, and improves greatly in so many ways from the feel of the Nintendo DSi top to bottom by not just the touch, but the gameplay as well. The system has so many features on it, whether it is playing 3DS games on a AR card, like thehands on game targets, which absolutely looked bold and vivid, as you try to shoot and score against bulls-eyes and a eye-popping dragon. All of that through the vivid eyes on a AR card, or great games like the simple Pilotwings Resort, where you can fly your way to the highest of ranks all in a simple hang glider or rocket pack. It is also really strong in backwards gameplay with the original Nintendo DS era.It also improves greatly in compatability from the DSi, so you can easily transfer those titles you've downloaded from the Nintendo DSi and also store new ones in the system through the e-shop. Whether it is downloading DSi favorites like Art Style: Base 10, or getting the feel of experiencing classic from the original Game Boy era, where you can download classics like Super Mario Land. It handles well in that, and also in music playback. Now, you can include and playback your favorite MP3 music downloads whether it is from Rhapsody or Amazon in a simple SD Card. A really great improvement from the DSi, where you were limited to having music playback only in the AAC format (mostly found in Itunes.) What I also like about it is also the enhanced gameplay with others, even on-the-spot when you duking it out in games like Super Street Fighter IV via streetpass. It really is very exciting.Yet, with all the enhancements that Nintendo has brought into the 3DS, there are a few faults, but minor ones for the system. The main one is really the battery life. It has a bit lower battery life in the system, for every time you need to recharge it. Unlike the Nintendo DS Lite or DSi, you only have a battery life that does last around 8 hours, for every charge you make into it, and a longer charging time too. Which can lead to some gamers wanting to just get a bit frustrated, waiting for it to fully charge for nearly 4 hours, and then take it on the go. But those are very small complaints about the system.Through it all, The Nintendo 3DS is a great buy top to bottom for any die hard Nintendo fan. I had a lot of fun trying it out, and I was absolutely impressed with the gameplay. It really takes on a whole new life, and everything we all love about the Nintendo DS into the next dimension of fun. I really recommend it a whole lot in gameplay & fun. Whether it is in blue or vivid black for your choice, you really do get what your buying in the Nintendo 3DS. If you've loved the original DS over the years, it is time to step into that next level of fun with the Nintendo 3DS and be blown away.Graphics: ASound: AGameplay: A-Control: A-Fun & Enjoyment: ACompatability with DS & DSi: A-Price: B+Overall: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}

The only downside is how chaotic and unfair the attacks can be at times.  If you try Master Ninja, be prepared for the incendiary shuriken throwing ninjas.  They are incredibly difficult (stupid difficult actually).  And for an even harder challenge, try the survival missions (if you decide to purchase the mission pack).  They are brutal beyond belief and will truly put your skills (or lack thereof) to the test.The best fighting game yet!  Enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2009"}

Utilize everything you can find to fight off the flesh-hungry mob and search for the truth behind the horrendous epidemic.","reviewerName":"Terrence A. \"cinemaparker@twitter\"","summary":"I'm a zombie baby, so why don't you kill me","reviewText":"This game is really something else. I mean, technically speaking we've come a long way. Up until now, I didn't think I'd ever see so many zombies on screen at once. I'm talking hundreds. So many in fact that you literally have to walk on their heads and shoulders when they're filling up a service tunnel wall to wall.I love the fact that you can use pretty much anything you can find in the game's shopping mall setting to end these miserable creatures lives. Believe me, you haven't lived until you beat the living crap out of a zombie with a giant salmon. You can dispose of these rotten carcasses in dozens of different ways and at the very least, it never gets old even after you've killed over fifty thousand zombies. The control scheme is well mapped, even though it could get a little haphazard when you have to do something in a hurry. Fatal Frame fans will love shooting pics with the camera, which adds a pretty fun element to the game.Graphics and sound are top notch. The cinemas use the in-game engine and thankfully, the game has top-notch voice acting that won't make you crings like Resident Evil. When you're standing in a zombie infested area, you can hear them growling all around you thanks to some superb surround sound. All the weapons make great sound effects that sound pretty accurate to what they should or would sound like.Now, while this game is a lot of fun, it's not without its problems. It may get frustrating to some because of its ill planned save system and game clock. It's hard to explain but sometimes you can make a lot of progress, only to literally ruin your entire game because you weren't at a certain place at a certain time. And the save system should've enabled some sort of autosave function, which it sort of has but not the way it should. Also, the AI of the survivors can be pretty clunky sometimes and will do questionable things when you're trying to get them to safety.There's one problem that this game has which I'm not sure if it affects everyone the same way. The in-game text is really small. Now, I don't have an HDTV at the time of this writing so I don't know if that's where the problem lies but the text is so small that it's really hard to read. Couple this with the fact that a lot of the time, important information is conveyed to you through these text messages and it's entirely possible to miss vital points of info because you just can't read it. Regardless, it's still an inexcusable goof on the part of the developers.In the end, this game is a lot of fun but I think that people won't fully grasp how to play the game correctly until the first run through. After ending the game, I was able to enjoy it even more the second time around, not to mention that I've saved nearly everyone.This game is a definite purchase and has great replay value. I didn't even mention the unlockable infinity mode, where you try to stay alive for as long as possible.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9YZK","description":"","reviewerName":"Elias B. \"The Atlanta Fried Critic\"","summary":"Apathy Fall","reviewText":"About halfway through &#34;Killzone: Shadow Fall&#34;, one of the major antagonists goes on a rant to the main character over a loudspeaker. In the middle of his tirade, he points out the fact that the futuristic society he's trying to destabilize has a false sense of democracy, making the populace think they have the freedom of choice, when really they are just pawns in the grand scheme of things. How ironic it is, then, that the first PlayStation 4 exclusive does just that. Despite giving players the illusion of innovation with shiny graphics and some nifty bells and whistles, Guerrilla Games' next-gen debut is essentially the same type of shooter we've been playing since the launch of the PS3, albeit a lot more soulless.Players are put in the shoes of a man who watched his father get gunned down by the villainous Helghast right in front of him as a child, in a botched attempt to cross over a wall segregating them from the outside world. Saved by a member of the Vektan Military, he grows up and becomes a Shadow Marshall, an elite operative assigned some of the most trying tasks in the force. In the midst of the heated conflicts between the Helghast and the Vektans, a paramilitary terrorist group known as The Black Hand has begun attacking the civilian populace of Vekta City, and it's up to the player to ensure that the city isn't completely ravaged by violence.What really struck me about this narrative is how little it struck me. To be quite honest, it's one of the most boring and by-the-numbers narratives in recent memory, filled with stock characters, terrible dialogue, and an overarching narrative that simply doesn't come together. Worn cliches, such as an Occupy Movement-esque villain railing against the evils of capitalism, or the adoptive father figure whom the player's loyalty to is tested, are rattled off without any abandon. Nothing about this story is really all that compelling in the least, and as the story worn on and my patience wore thin, I kept getting more and more tempted to simply skip the cutscenes altogether. Make no mistake: if you're buying this game for a compelling tale of futuristic espionage, save your sixty bucks, because you'll be getting nothing that comes close to intriguing or surprising.That aforementioned temptation to skip the cutscenes reminded me that there wasn't much waiting for me on the gameplay front, either. This is some of the most standard shooter fare this side of &#34;Call of Duty&#34;, and it's simply amazing at how ordinary the whole affair is. Sure, the game allows you to tackle most objectives in any order, but when they're so bland and pedestrian, who really cares? Certainly not me, as the gunplay itself is dull at best, ramshackle at worst. Sure, nothing is particularly bad about it, but it's so inoffensive that it almost made think that this game was halfway through development before the developer was instructed to upscale the graphics, and leave everything else as is. There is no sense of urgency, there are no really fun weapons to use, and there's a terrible stealth mechanic that doesn't even work properly.The situation is worsened by some of the absolute worse enemy AI I've ever encountered in all my years of gaming. Throughout your playthrough, don't be surprised to watch enemies hurl themselves off of ledges, do somersaults while atop narrow surfaces, and walk around idly even as you open fire on them. At least there's some evidence that innovative things were attempted, as the destructible environments are very impressive. Being able to simply blast through a wall into the next section, as opposed to going from point A to point B, is a nice luxury, and one that isn't utilized nearly enough. Same goes for the OWL, a little drone that follows the player around constantly. It acts as an attack partner, shield and zipline, but for the most part, you'll find it simply using adrenaline packs to revive you when you fall, as the game eventually limits the usefulness of this little toy.It feels terrible to be saying all of these negative things about &#34;Shadow Fall,&#34; because there are some legitimately good ideas at work here. However, for every good part, there are a few parts. One example would be an early mission that involves the player trying to steer a spacecraft into the sun in order to destroy evidence of unsavory research. Getting to float around in zero gravity between each checkpoint is a fun experience, as is the eventual threat of being burned alive by the sun's rays. But this mission is offset by dull shooting in dark corridors, and dreadful sections of &#34;put object A into slot B&#34; that are overused far, far too much. Other fun parts, like jetting through Vekta City while clutching onto a rope suspended from a flying vessel as things explode around you, are dampened by dull QTE and followed up with more shooting that lacks any challenge or fun. The game is, essentially, a giant tease. It constantly tempts you with what could have been, before dragging you back into a worse version of games you were already playing on your PS3 or 360.At least everything is, more or less, pretty to look at. Levels with lots of topiary shine, as they offer the widest variety in terms of what players can do with the slightly open system. Also impressive are set pieces which involve the futuristic city and the wild structures and vehicles within them. Character models of the main characters are also very nice, and deeply expressive. On the negative side, though, we have more gray-and-black-and-brown corridors than I would have liked, in which the game dips into middle-of-the-road PS3 territory in terms of variety and texture quality, and the character models of the citizens are often repeated, to the point where it's not uncommon to see three or four of the same model standing in an empty room together. Not only that, but as the game continues, it begins to look like a very wet, low-rent &#34;Blade Runner,&#34; losing most of its creativity and liveliness. So while it is, indeed, a very beautiful game, most of what players will be seeing is simply not that interesting.While everything else is fairly lukewarm, the same cannot be said for the voice acting and soundtrack. To put it bluntly, they're pretty horrendous. The soundtrack is an awful cacophony of dubstep, inappropriate strings, and is so low-key that it almost feels like it could have been the score to a bad David Lynch movie. And the voice acting is even worse, with flat acting delivering some of the most uninteresting lines imaginable, and without matching up to a lot of the lip-flaps, to boot. Guns have wimpy noises that never give any real semblance of power, too, which really hurts when the entire game revolves around shooting hordes of enemies.To be fair, &#34;Killzone: Shadow Fall&#34; is not a truly awful game. But unfortunately, it's also not one that is easily recommended, especially for those not steeped in the mythos of the series. A shadow has fallen on Vekta City, for sure, and the ending of the game leaves possibilities for a sequel to be quite open, but after the dull experience I've had with this game, I'm not quite sure I even care. If you've got a PS4 and want a shooter that isn't made by Activision or EA, give this a rental for an inoffensive campaign and to tool around in multiplayer. However, this is not the system seller Sony was banking on.Grade: 6.5 (Okay)","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2013"}

I only write reviews if i've beaten games, and this is the first review i'll write without beating a game, because i'm pretty sure i'll never care to beat it. I'm just tired of instant kills, that just feel cheap, and completely rob me of any enjoyment I was having.  I should also note I don't play multiplayer, so this review is only for the single player campaign.Pros:* Stupid pretty* Voice actioning is mostly good.* controls while shooting people feel awesome.  (Love that there isn't any auto-aim.)* The illusion of choiceCons:* Campaign is kind really boring. Large levels with little to no-one in them* A protection mission for a homicidal maniac that is terribly programed. Expect cheap deaths all around, and to make it worse I didn't have any interest in protecting her! It's not Ellie from Last Of Us* Free Fall sections are basically cheap deaths, and i feel ike i'm playing a pretty version of COT.  That is bad!* The missions change locations from forest, to space, to slums, to city, back to space, to falling and it all makes no sense.* The story is boring, and again makes no sense.* Your character is a tool and for a guy thats all about choosing his own way is pretty useless.If your buying this game to show off your PS4 and to play muti-player you'll probably be fine, if your a solo gamer like me.  Don't buy it!!!! you'll hate yourself for it.  I gave the game two stars one for being pretty, and one for the more open level design for the illusion of choice.EDIT: I forced myself the beat the game. And the free fall section do end, but the game didn't get any better.  The game falls apart into a corridor shooter.  And i experienced some major glitches that robbed me of my satisfying boss battle.Basically in the second to last area you fight a boss that uses a shockwave that disrupts the drone.  So i started running away from him to try and get some space between us.  some how I lost him, and was looking around hoping i could get some shots into his back, and suddenly he appeared in front of me dead. It was so anti-climatic it was just another thing that robbed me of any fun i was having.The game feels rushed, like they wanted to make launch and sacrificed a ton of game play mechanics they set up in the beginning to get the game out in time.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000G7PMX2","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Neat idea but bad execution","reviewText":"When Nintendo first announced their new machine which featured different controls than previous systems, many thought that it would become a novelty machine: fun for awhile but what else can you do with it? It was inevitable that we'd get a FPS with the S also doubling for a \"slasher\" and it is certainly vastly different than previous FPS's I've played but it's just marred by gameplay problems that I wish were fixed. Ultimately to me, Red Steel is an example of a game that was too fast, too soon.Story: You play Scott-san, who gets caught up in a gang battle among the Yakuza when his fiance is kidnapped and her father is killed. You then have to unleash the proverbial can of worms on everyone. In a way, it's one of those kind of stories that I don't really get caught up and pay atttention to it but rather just learn enough to get by. Unlike some storylines where you get riveted, this is one where you'll probably be somewhere and go \"who was I supposed to meet here anyway?\"Graphics: It's one of those kind of games where you can tell that it's next-gen but stack it up against others and it clearly shows its relatively new age. The levels are well-done, enemies don't have that ugliness look where they're really pixel-y but yet it almost looks...bland as if there's nothing that's like \"holy [...], this is a next-gen title.\" But the minor stuff such as small details from fountains to small explosions are handled well.Sound/Music: I wasn't even paying attention to the music that much but when I did it sounded fine. Big and fast paced when you meet enemies and low-key everywhere else. It's like other games I've played where you get so caught up in it that the music kind of disappears. The voice acting was decent and never felt hammy or considerably overdone.Gameplay: Here's where it falls apart. Essentially your nunchuk controller is for movement using the analog stick, Z is crouching and C is for jump while waving it makes you reload When you're in a sword battle, moving it makes you parry/block an enemy sword slash. Your \"Wii-mote\" controls your gun. Hold B to aim and A to fire. You also get to have grenades and if you move your whole remote forward, you create a zooming motion for better accuracy. The problem is that turning tends to be either too slow or too quick and when you're aiming and turning it gets worse. Then they are times where I try to zoom but it doesn't and sometimes your aiming reticule gets \"stuck\" on the top of the screen and it doesn't reset it for later, you have to actually drag it down.How's the rest of the game? It's quite alright and the controls are easy to understand without being overtly complicated but it's just executing them right is where it gets tricky. For some the game will completely fall apart here, for others it's just a minor nuisance. The enemies though have good AI at times, ducking and using things for cover while other times it seems they go on suicide runs going right into your line of fire begging for you to kill them. It's not a difficult game but when you're being shot from all over the place, it's pretty easy to lose health, which you generate Master Chief style by staying in one spot for a few seconds.Should you buy it? It's up to you really since like other games it's either a game only a few GET or you just think it's horrid.

I would expect this if this were online play, but this was offline playing the single player campaign. The sound effects also bugged on me once, and it required returning to the menu to restart the level to get the sound effects back. And that was when I discovered that the game doesn't save mid level like its console counterparts.Beyond that this game delivers a console quality Killzone experience that one would expect on the PS3. Blending elements of Killzone 3 and Killzone: Shadow Fall, the player can either sneak around and stealthily remove enemy or they can go in guns blazing. Equipment that can either enhance your stealth or guns-blazing strategy are also available: enhanced armors, silenced weapons, or drones that you can fly around the battlefield.The enemy AI feels like Killzone 3, but has some added flair. The game plays like Killzone 3 as well, don't expect this to feel as smooth as Shadow Fall did.The single player campaign is a complete campaign with a short but intriguing story of a mercenary accepting contracts by the ISA and others as a war is waged against the Helghast. Each campaign mission features alternate objectives that can be completed adding replay to the title. Experience points are earned (or lost) based on performance and allows for purchasing of weapons and equipment, which can be customized like in Battlefield 4.Controls were my biggest concern: lack of the L2, R2, L3, and R3 buttons made me nervous, but I can gladly say that touch controls are well integrated to this. Weapon swapping and equipment operation is delegated to touch features on the display. In particular, I loved a weapon that would let you fire rockets at enemies - all you had to do was tap the enemy on the screen and it fired.I recommend this title for anyone who owns a PS Vita.

{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Bee","summary":"The Next Step in Gaming Evolution","reviewText":"In the mid 90's we were introduced to a spectacular horror game known as Resident Evil.  For those of us who were old enough to play that game when it first came out, we were treated with one of the first games that could actually scare you.  Resident Evil is often credited with starting the whole survival horror genre of video games.  And although it was Alone in the Dark that should be given credit there, Resident Evil put survival horror games on the map.Never had I played a game that so pulled you in.  It actually felt like you were inside the mansion, and you could feel the tension.  This was done wonderfully with music, groans in the distance and spooky environments.(Skip to present)To say that the new Resident Evil for the GameCube is a graphical wonder is an understatement.  The sheer detail is almost overwhelming.  From dust rising from old boards as you run across them, to a gentle breeze moving the leaves of plants.  The attention to detail is to a point seldom seen in a console game.  I can honestly say that I own no games on either my PS2 or GameCube that look as good as Resident Evil.  Even after seeing the screen shots and hearing how great the game looked, I still was not prepared for how wonderful the game actually looked.  I did not know that there were going to be games that looked this good.  I have never seen anything like it.But graphics don't make a game right?  Right!  It takes gameplay and engrossing story or just plan fun to go along with those graphics to make a game great.  I am sure a lot of folks would take the original Zelda over a lot of the \"next-gen\" games that looks so much better, because of how fun the game was/is.  Resident Evil does not disappoint.  While it's not the pure \"fun\" that a Mario or Zelda game is, it's got it's own pluses.  Resident Evil is meant to scare you and keep you on edge with the feeling of impending dread.  This is done (as with the original) through haunting music, creepy atmosphere, and some down right \"jump out and scare you\" tactics.  For some, like myself, this is very appealing.  But if you are searching for a game that is just an enjoyable family game, look somewhere else.  Resident Evil is not a family game, and should be kept far away from children.  This is the kind of game nightmares are made of.But if you are a fan of the Resident Evil series and have a GameCube then I would strongly recommend this game to you.  It stays very true to the Resident Evil formula of solving puzzles to get further and scare you a lot.The controls are also true to the series.  This has been an issue since early on in the series and I don't understand it.  Once you get used to the controls it's easy to control your character, but I will admit that it does take some getting used to.  Luckily I got used to the controls way back in the 90's by playing Resident Evil 2 for the Playstation.  So if you hated the controls in the other Resident Evil's, then you will probably hate them now as well.  But please don't let controller issues deter you from such an incredible game.  It is in my opinion, one of the best games available for the GameCube at this time.  And it is probably the greatest video game (graphically) I have ever seen to date.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2002"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYDEQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Mikey","summary":"Not a big review but to the point.","reviewText":"I'm not going to write a huge review right now, just started playing this and will add more as I go. So far dont NOT go by what the demo shows you. In game is WAY better than the demo just in the first 5 minutes. It gives you the feeling of really being there in world and in events as the story makes you feel this way. This is NOT Forza 4 remake so don't expect that but it shines in what it is. It is a sim to a point. You can go around cruising and sample all the cars. Be in cockpit just like Forza 4. I think the cars have a more real feeling with them turned on NORMAL VS Simulation in the difficulty settings. TURN ALL OTHER ASSISTS OFF! The car just feels more planted and not like you are on ice all the time. You will have more fun this way, less frustration. I am glad I got this and didn't let the demo turn me off of it.I'd like to add, driving at night is AWESOME! The headlights, dash lights.. just the whole feeling gives you a 100% accurate simulation. Win the Boss Stang, head the the freeway at night all out topend in car view. Just run it like you stole it!!The more I play it the better it gets. Night time does last what seems to be in real-time almost, not just every 5 minutes like some games with the sun up and down. Also, get in the suburbs, theres quietness. Dogs barking, sprinklers going. Off the the distance you see the moonlight with fireworks going off from the fair. Very cool scenery!!!Roads have to be traveled and explored 100% just like Test Drive Unlimited to see the whole map. So this game IS basicly TDU + with Forza cars. The details of the car are just as good as Forza 4. DO NOT GO BY THE DEMO! In game the cars look way better! The roads are all smoothed out rolling hills, you wont see rough or choppy roads like there was in TDU. Get behind the wheel of a muscle car, in-car view and you swear you are really driving it. At high speeds, you can almost feel the wind and the car vibrates from the high speeds. They totally mastered the feel of driving. Add the perfect tire sounds, engine sounds.. it's all there. I really can't say enough good things about this new game. As far as cars, they keep giving me so many free cars I have yet had to buy any. Plus will all the car packs coming AND an add-on pack ( more map ) this will be a fully loaded game soon enough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2012"}

I really got into the awesome story. The voice acting was some of the best I've seen. I don't think this game was very difficult, and I played with auto aim on, so that definitely helped. The missions were decent in length and were typically 10-20 minutes long. Checkpoints helped me out on some missions, and there wasn't any backtracking. I only played the main missions and did not deal with any side missions. The game took me 20+ hours to complete. There is plenty of ammo so fire away! I only purchased two things during my playthrough and that was the campsite and an item that increases my ammo for my firearms. That's it. All the weapons I had I received during my play and I never purchased any. Again, not a difficult game by any means, but a very cool game indeed. I really cannot think of any negative things to say, and I would certainly recommend playing. I ranked this right up there with Assassin's Creed II, Skyrim, Mass Effect 2 & 3, BioShock, and Far Cry 3. I don't think you will be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-21-2014"}

On the fringes of known space, something is silently abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus, a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy&rsquo;s most elite team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong.GameplayAn space-based action RPG like its predecessor, gameplay inMass Effect 2revolves around the player's particular version of Commander Shepard and continuing development of this character as the game proceeds. As the game opens a variety of character classes are made available to the player, with talents, both exclusive and general, associated with each. With experience these talents are leveled up, resulting in the unlocking of related abilities and/or entirely new talents. The player has the ability to customize their Commander Shepard in a number of ways including physical appearance, gender, and certain aspects of their personal history, with the rub being that these choices can influence things like available missions, dialogue choices with non-player characters (NPCs), and character background.Accompanying this main character are a number of preset supporting characters that the player can direct and develop relationships with, which again, will alter the outcome of the story. All the characters from the original game make an appearance inMass Effect 2, but the immediate characters surrounding Commander Shepard are new.

Ok.In short: Mass effect, an RPG with action elements, Mass effect 2 an action game with RPG elements. I completed just about all of the side quests and the story in just under 28 hours. Overall the theme with this sequel was more detail less ..... quantity. Quality over quantity here (ex, no planet exploration). Some people might disagree but I would like to see more of both, and I don't mind juggling two discs in my xbox to handle that. I like the detail put into the environments in this one but the galaxy just didn't seem as big this time around. Not a knock to the game though I still loved it. Also I somewhat preferred the elevator load scenes as opposed to the loading screen, but again, that is another one of the differences between the RPG and action game elements here.PROS-more action, lots more-Miranda Lawson-way more detail in the environments-graphics are amazing-new powers are awesome-no pointless planet exploration-Miranda Lawson-you get to team up with a geth-heavy weapons-less quests that involve only talkingCONS-less credits in my pocket-guns don't pack as much umph-no pointless planet exploration (a pro and a con for me)-no loot (don't give me a ton, but give me some)-environments are more detailed, but smaller-the new leveling point system leaves me with points left over (i'm not wasting resources....)-theres only going to be three of theseThe cons are really just things I would like to see improved on in mass effect three. I loved this sequel and I think it would be great if 3 fell somewhere in the middle. Overall though I love this game and if the third one turns out like this I wouldn't be disappointed.

In the game you start off as a captive of the Imperials, this is going to be your execution day, but something happens. A Dragon attacks and all hell breaks loose. Somehow you're going to have to manage to fight your way out, and once on the other side, you're going to have the entire land of Skyrim at your disposal. Explore the lands, take on quests, join guilds, join a faction, and ultimately save the realm.Graphically this game looked amazing, the amount of scenary/buildings/mountains/etc was more than a little impressive. Sure there's some texture and structure loading issues when traveling out in Skyrim, but for the most part you're going to find that there's a lot to explore, and a wide variety of stuff to look at. You're going to have glaciers, snow, mountains, fields, forests, caves, and more. This is the type of adventure game you can easily get lost in. The NPC faces do get a bit generic if you do a good amount of exploring, especially when it comes to enemies that you come across. There's so much to see though, that you're probably not going to wonder why a huge chunk of city dwelling people look like they came from the same mother at the exact same birth.The music in Skyrim is also top notch. You have orchestra pieces to listen to, and you also have changes in music to denote different events. If you're being attacked, if you've entered into a cave, if you're just exploring Skyrim, there's a good variety of music to listen to. I will recommend one thing, if you enter an inn or a place where there is someone singing, just ask them to take a break, you'll thank me later.The controls in the game will have you utilizing every button the the controller. You'll have a trigger for one hand (be it for a shield, a spell, or another weapon), and of course the other trigger for the other weapon. You'll have a button to jump, a button to select/pick up/talk with, and of course a cancel button. You'll be using both shoulder buttons once you're a bit into the game, and the analog sticks are going to be your friends when you're trying to track dragons flying in the sky.One thing that this game promised was a ton of a dragons, and man did they deliver. You're going to have to face quite a few just to get from the beginning of the game to the end, but there's also the chance of just going out into the world and hunting dragons. There's dragon nests scattered across the land that you can go to a take down some of the meaner dragons. There's just so much to this game I don't even know where to start. You're going to get to craft your character and level them up with the actions that you take. Unlike Oblivion where you can cheat the system with your skill selections, this time around you're going to level up skills by utilizing that action (lockpicking, one-hand fighting, blocking, smithing, etc), and as you level skills up you're going to level up your character which in turn will allow you to boost a stat (magic, health, stamina) and then also give you a perk point to give you a little something extra in one of the skill fields. Now to stop you from just choosing the best perks of different skills there are skill level requirements (separate from your character's level) that have to be met in order to unlock that perk. Personally I made sure that most of my perks went into lockpicking, as that seemed to be a game inside the game for me, and allowed me to gain the riches that my character finished the game with. There are a couple of groups that you can join throughout the game, you have the Companions (basically the Fighter's Guild, but with a dark twist), the College of Magic, the Thieves Guild (this too has a twist), the Bard's college, the Stormcloaks (basically the renegade faction), the Imperials (the ruling and conquering faction), and/or the Dark Brotherhood (Assassin's Guild). With so much to do, plus a ton of other quests this game will eat up hours of your life, but in a good way.There are, however, a few issues I have with the game. First off there were some bad bugs that could become your undoing, and cause you to restart a good ways back in your game, so don't be afraid to use multiple saves and save often. My personal issue with the game was that there was a quest that once turned on you could no longer fast travel (which once you've started to play Skyrim, you'll see makes the game almost unplayable), there has as been texture issues, weird geometry stuff going on, dragons flying backwards, and characters that you have to converse with that either don't ever appear or disappear when you need to talk to them to continue a quest. Then there's the other issue in the game, the main storyline. Maybe it was just me, but I wanted to do anything but work on the main storyline, it just didn't feel up to par with some of the side quests. Sure it had its interesting parts, but there wasn't enough substance to it, I didn't feel as invested in it as say the later Thieves Guild quests. There's also the Misc. quests that you'll get, those can screw you over royally simply because there are way too many times when you can't remember who the hell you have to turn the quest into, there's never an indicator, and sometimes it will make items stay in your inventory forever, as they are seen as quest items, and you can't drop quest items. That being said, completing the main quest doesn't mean that the game will end, thankfully you'll be able to continue on exploring to your heart's desire. Hell if you play long enough I'm sure you can just start killing everyone in Skyrim and just have the place to yourself, if that's something that interests you.In the end, with its flaws, and it's not quite epicly awesome main storyline, this is a game that I couldn't get enough of. Sure there were some game freezes, and sure there were some glitches, but it says something about the game when I simply said a string of curse words, then restarted the 360 and started playing again. I became invested in the world, I wanted to explore every nook and cranny, I wanted to become that hero that could make all who oppose me feel my wrath. So I think it's safe to say that if you like open world RPGs where you get to fight dragons, save the world, and have a good sense of adventure, you're going to have already bought this game, or if you haven't you need to get this game pronto, like right now, as soon as you're done reading this, go get the game and get lost in it like so many others have before you. This game gets a 9.4 out of 10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000WCE9XK","description":"Uncover all the mysteries of Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword as you fight enemy ninjas and battle various fiends while taking on the role of Master Ninja, Ryu Hayabusa, in an all new storyline for the Nintendo DS.","reviewerName":"S. Morales","summary":"A DS MUST!","reviewText":"Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword is basically the DS version of Ninja Gaiden on both the Xbox 360 and PS3, and given the absolute sheer quality of controls, graphics, sound, pacing and unique touch-screen scheme, this is one of those DS action fan must buys, and an absolute sin if not purchased by fans of the console games.NG basically starts off where NG and NG Sigma (ps3 version) left off, with peace in the quaint village, but it is soon discovered that the fiends are once again trying to get their hands on the Dragon Sword to take over the world, and it's up to Ryu Hayabusa to once again take them on.The game is 13 levels which takes you to all the similar and even same locales as the console games Ninja Gaiden and Sigma, and it's really cool to see them rendered on the DS.Starting off, the main difference gamers will see is the control scheme. Instead of using the DS buttons to attack, jump, etc, you use slashes on the touch screen to command Ryu's moves. You slash across an enemy to attack, you slide up to jump, you tap an enemy to use your secondary weapons (ninja starts and arrows). You touch an area to move Ryu and you do combinations, such as up to jump then slash for a flying attack or hit and enemy, down slash and up slash to do a flying swallow attack. You block (any button) and tap to do a dodging barrel roll, a move that comes in very handy throughout the entire game. The only drawback to such a scheme is that sometimes the DS reads certain touch movements as jump when you're trying to slash, or ninja star throw when you're trying to dodge, etc. You become accustomed to this at about the 2nd or 3rd level, and even though this makes it a little disappointing because you don't always pull off what you want, the overall scheme for about 95% of the rest of the gameplay you'll hardly notice it, if at all. It also takes advantage in some cute ways of using the DS mic.If you're a NG fan you also will expect some level of more advanced difficulty, but given the fact that it's on the DS and with the newer control scheme and lack of DS AI ability, SOME may want the game to be harder (as overall it doesn't match wits with the challenge of the console NG games). There are times when the game gets pretty difficult and intense, and this usually comes in trying to defeat a certain amount of enemies in an area before losing all your health. The game pretty much walks a perfect line of not being too overly and cheaply difficult considering the control scheme, but not letting it get too easy that it can be easily beaten by your average 10 year old. The good thing is that there are plenty of save points and no arduous or tedious backtracking. So don't be worried about ever getting lost or pinned up against a big boss with only limited energy. No, things are kept fair and accessible.Graphically and sound-wise the game is top notch. These are some of the best animations you'll see on the DS, and the sound quality is simply outstanding, most especially with the japanese flairs tossed in to keep things real (yea, no real spoken dialogue, you'll have to read words).Great controls, addicting gameplay, intense challenge, great graphics, awesome sound, worthwhile campaign length; this all makes Ninja Gaiden Dragon Sword a game no action fan should be without. Considering the cheaper price, this game is a steal, plus a good practice break in between console NG games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2009"}

Yet Different - And More Action Packed!","reviewText":"I was a huge fan of Dragon Age: Origins and played through it several times so I have been excited for Dragon Age 2. As soon as the first battle started I could feel that the game was a lot different than its predecessor. The fighting was a lot more hack n' slash, making battles a lot faster and a bit more forgiving (well, not the boss battles).The characters models as well as Kirkwall are rendered beautifully, and you can see that upgrades that have gone into the game. The story itself is fairly involved and fun to follow and uncover; it's nice to have a main character that speaks! It really does that extra bit towards making the story feel more involving, and that you have a bit more control over how conversations play out.I'm playing through the game a second time and it is just as fun. I always play through once as the nice guy and once as the jerk, so, it's fun seeing how certain events play out differently, and I appreciate the replay value.I haven't experienced any of the bugs or glitches that others are mentioning, so I'll keep my fingers crossed that I don't. My only personal gripe is that there is a lot less wandering around and personal initiative in terms of direction. In DA:O I was able to choose which order I did major events in, now, it's very linear.Overall, great game and highly recommended.Pros:Crisp graphicsBetter menu systemTight controlsFaster battlesSignature has free DLC!

{"product_name":"B0044SA70M","description":"","reviewerName":"Derek Morris","summary":"It Rivals Skyrim!!!!!","reviewText":"I read many reviews about this game and all of them try to compare it to Skyrim.  Well after playing Amular for about 30 hours now and i have about 100 hours in Skyrim let me say this:The gameplay/combat in Amalur is MUCH better than it is in Skyrim.  You can find yourself missing the target in skyrim.  I also find in skyrim the mechanics are a little off.  IMO, when you are running it seems that the camera is off angle and i find myself always having to re-pivot my character to run in a straight line.  Skyrim has the advantage of switching from 1st person to 3rd person which is cool. The combat in Amalur IMO is spectacular.  You can change weapons on the FLY but you can pause in the middle of battle if you want to change your Primary/Secondary weapons.  However, it is somewhat of a BUTTON MASHER but not as repetitive as in God of War and the animations when in RECKONING mode will thrill even the JADED gamer.  The details and graphics are not as great as in skyrim but its still good.  The world is not as open as in skyrim but you can still do a lot of things such as swim in a river or just veer off path.  Blacksmithing and alchemy are good but skyrim has them beat on this one.  But in skyrim after you complete the main quest there really isn't much else to do except kill dragons so it becomes VERY repetitive IMO.Overall i think i will keep Amular.  Its a fresh breath of air.  there are a lot of unique enemies and Mini Bosses to fight as you travel thru the world unlike in skyrim all you fight other than dragons are Druagar skeletons and random bandits.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003C1I06U","reviewerName":"Christopher M. Shatto","summary":"A true \"Batman simulator\"","reviewText":"Arkham Asylum borrows elements and ideas from a number of different Batman periods, storywriters, and graphic novels to create what is, to date, the best simulation of what it is actually like to be Batman.The story draws heavily from the graphic novel Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, a story in which the inmates literally wind up running the asylum and draw Batman into a cat and mouse game that brings out the truth behind why Arkham was created and its horrible history.While the game doesn't delve into the deepest and darkest parts of the novel, it is gritty, violent, and a true throwback to the 1980s Batman comics and an homage to the grittier, less stable Batman of the new Christopher Nolan era. Truly, what makes this game great is the overall atmosphere. Batman is confident and powerful, but he's surrounded by a decaying Arkham full of truly insane people. It starts out bad enough when the Joker and his freed henchman, mostly transfers from Blackgate, run through the Asylum killing guards and taking hostages, but the game really comes into its own when you invest your time in solving the hidden Riddler puzzles. Backstories of the inmates are filled in via interview tapes, but the real \"treat\" is the increasingly twisted and chilling history of the Asylum and its founder Amadeus Arkham that you can unlock as you progress.The gameplay is also interesting, but the story and atmosphere are the real fun here because, aside from a few particularly tricky encounters, the story mode portion of the game is pretty easy. On normal difficulty I rolled through the game in a three-day weekend and in less than a week without playing every day I had 100% of the Riddler puzzles solved to boot, as well as 2/3 of the achievements unlocked. Hard mode is substantially more difficult, but even that's not terribly tough in most spots.You spend your time variously solving puzzles, sneaking around disabling bad guys, and simply getting into fist fights and pummeling them into submission. You can use your grapple to gain a vantage point, sneak through ducts in the floor and walls, or leverage your vast array of gizmos, including explosive gel, a code breaker and, of course, your trusty batarang (and it's variations) to take down the baddies. On the way you'll encounter a few bosses that are pathetically easy (virtually all require little more than dodging big attacks and then retaliating against a stunned opponent) and you'll even encounter a few sideshows thanks to the Scarecrow and his fear gas. The scarecrow portions look nice and create even more excellent atmosphere, but, ultimately, they're nothing but annoying jumping puzzles and feel a little out of place, although I think I'm in the minority on that opinion as most players seem to enjoy them.Once you beat the story mode and find the various solutions to Riddler puzzles you unlock awards, most importantly the Challenges. The Challenges are just what they say they are, a series of challenges in which you are given a room of bad guys and several goals you must meet to beat the challenge. There are two types of challenges, combat and predator. In the latter you sneak through a room silently dispatching the baddies in three different, specific ways. For example, some challenges require you to blow up a wall to knock out one or more bad guys. Others require you to use moves such as silent takedowns, pull enemies over a ledge, or pop out of hiding and take them down. Do all three and you win the challenge (with a secondary goal of doing them as fast as possible).The combat challenges are a little more annoying and a definite weak point for the game. In the combat challenges, you're just given a room full of bad guys and told to pummel them into submission. You rack up points by building bigger and bigger combos. More varied combos earn more points and if you perform \"takedowns\" - moves that instantly knock an inmate out - when you have a very high combo count you earn very large numbers of points.Unfortunately, the combat challenges are about 20% skill and 80% dumb luck. If you have good rhythm you can do well by leaping from one inmate to another without missing a hit, but sometimes the inmates do stupid things that don't make sense and leave you unable to continue a combo. I've lost huge combos because inmates stood facing a brick wall behind a pillar for no apparently reason, because Batman just didn't feel like jumping across the room this time (no matter how often he's done it before) or because an inmate five feet away somehow managed to punch me in the back of the head as I was going toward another inmate. Ultimately, I completed nearly all of the game before having enough of the more absurd combat challenges and quitting with two of them completely unfinished and one medal (out of three) short on two others.Still, overall the game is fun and worthwhile. It's short, the story mode is too easy, the combat challenges are too frustrating, but the atmosphere and story just make you feel what it's really like to BE Batman, and that's worth the money to any fan out there.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}

The reason was for a long time I thought this was a game where a bunch of couch potato commandos got online and did nothing but shoot at each other. Not long ago I saw the campaign being played and decided this might be worth giving a shot. The campaign is really fun to play with a intriguing story that plays out really well. The online features include zombies is all well and good especially for the zombie lovers out there. The problem with zombies it takes a short time before it becomes dull and just boring and you ask whats the point? Now the online multiplayer. All the maps all the modes,weapon customizing you can have an arsenal of high tech weapons and gadgets. A lot to play in but the problem is if you are new or just starting there is a very good chance you are going to be playing with people that have much higher levels and experience than you and all you are is an easy target to help their xp points. Or they are playing with friends in a clan and they work together unlike your team of players that you don't know and they don't help you and you don't help them so basically you have a target on your head. There is no level matching in this game so you are thrown to the wolves on multiplayer modes until you learn how to survive a bunch running around firing high tech weapons at you or anything that moves. The problems in my opinion is the game does not allow you much way to protect yourself in a fire fight unless you are behind an object which some ammo will go thru anyway. So its who fires first and more accurate. Overall a really good and fun game just needs a couple things that will make it more better.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-03-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"Full Metal Solid","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid 4 (MGS4) may well be one of the best games ever made. This isn't a gross overstatement, this is just a fact, a reality of the situation and the consequences are staggering. MGS4 has delivered on a gaming benchmark that really makes all other games fade in comparison. When I first got my PS3, I got it boxed with a very popular action game (no points for guessing). MGS4 was on the shelf and I remembered how well I enjoyed MGS3: Snake Eater but the hype was about the game I had in the box. In reality, the boxed PS3 should have been sold with MGS4 and the real hype should have been about this `final entry' (debatable) in the Solid Snake series. So if you are thinking about a PS3 box then I say look not further than the new MGS4 one.MGS4 is an evolution in gaming. This is not just a development in tactical espionage games or a better story. This is an entirely new way to game. MGS4 makes abundant use of the PS3's networking capabilities. Lots of content such as music for snake's iPod (yeah it works like a real iPod also) and his camouflage gear are released at intervals online by the MGS4 developers. There are even exclusive MGS4 podcasts. So MGS4 is not just limited to the extensive BD content, there is probably going to be years of content updates ahead.MGS4 is absolutely massive. You get approximately 30 hours of a game from start to finish. There are days of game play involved. There are several Acts where you can play with snake. You are advised to play MGS4 sneaking. This means less shooting, more hiding and you will enjoy the game more. The less you shoot or CQC the more fun you will have but you need the patients to maybe hang around a wall or bush for several minutes. In fact this game requires a lot of patients. It is the way it has been designed. It is full metal emersion in a stealth world.Act 1 - Liquid SunThis is urban war in a Middle Eastern city. Snake fights with or against local militia. You are introduced to new tech like a remote control robot, Metal Gear Mk. II, gun purchasing and gun unlocking. You also get to fight in a hotel. This map is gigantic and the stealth play is impeccable.Act 2 - Solid SunHere you are on South American terrain. This is close to the sort of setting found in the Russian forests of MGS3, however there is no snake eating or growling stomachs. There are more open areas and buildings to climb. You will enjoy the stealth play here a lot.Act 3 - Third SunPrague, Czech Republic. Snake sneaks around this European city at night. This really challenges your ability to tiptoe and avoid detection. Snake in the city is a great idea and the execution is a lot of fun.Act 4 - Twin SunsShadow Moses Island. This is from the first MGS. It is a huge industrial complex that Snake must penetrate. There is also lots of snow covered terrain and blizzards for snake to get through.Act 5 - Old SunA submarine/battleship. Snake moves around inside this warship for the final showdown. He takes on more than one end boss here. It is very hard to play this as a sneaking mission and depends a lot on shooting.There are also dozens of boss fights and at least a few hours of cut scenes to get through. There are too many guns with adaptors to count as well as accessories galore. By the end of the game you have only experienced a fraction of what you could have used and will probably go back and play the game more than once and play it in a different way. For this reason MGS4 has a very nice long lifespan.Snake's moves have been made easier. The CQC is a little different than snake eater but offers some things new. There are multiple holds available as well as new ways to engage the enemy, but more importantly, these controls have been made easier than the steep learning curve that came with MGS3.The graphics are impeccable. At times it is like playing a modern anime or Manga movie which is to say it is like playing the cut scenes in MGS3. However some of the cut scenes in MGS4 are 3D animations that you can move around. The music and sound effects are top notch. To put it in perspective the closing credits run like the ending to the movie Titanic. That is how much work has gone into MGS4.The story is very complex and often hard to follow so you will have to be on your toes. MGS developers released a back-story add-on you can download over the PS3 Sony Store. This will familiarize you with MGS1 to 3. With that said, the story is a good one and has to do with the war economy and has a lot to do with Snake's family but be prepared to sit through it. Once you know the story you can skip them on your second or more play.MGS4 comes with multiplayer. That is a whole other game involving players in maps shooting it out with each other. There is not much stealth involved though as it is pretty much straight forward gun battling within complexes. And of course being on the PS3 multiplayer is free.Installing MGS4 can take some time. There are a few minutes of installation between each Act. However when done loading times are not bad and save times are instantaneous. Anyway the bottom line is that anyone with a PS3 is going to get this. You could say this was made for the PS3 or the PS3 made for this and you wouldn't be far wrong. It makes full use of the PS3 and quite frankly the only thing that can try to compete is a high end PC (but with what game?). So right now, as it stands, the PS3 offers quite possibly the best gaming experience with MGS4. It simply blows away any and all games on other consoles and the PC. That is a blue moon event in the world of computer gaming.ProsThe best stealth game everMaybe the best game everMakes full use of the PS3Revolutionary graphicsHuge levels and designiPod and podcastsConsIt endsMakes other PS3 games pale in comparisonNo snake eating","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-21-2008"}

You are constantly unlocking and upgrading new force powers that never get old or boring.  If you're a star wars fan, you'll be in Jedi/Sith heaven.  If you're not, you'll still be in action video game heaven.  I too beat this game in one sitting but I'm not complaining. It was about a ten hour game but with action games, I think that is perfect.  I'm so busy with work and school, both full time, on top of a family, that my only real time to game is on the weekends.  So a game that I can complete in a day or two is perfect.  There has never been a more fun and bad a** star wars game than this one.  You feel more powerful in this game than you ever did in the Jedi Knight games. (Which I also Loved)The voice acting and facial expressions in the animation felt a lot more cinematic than the usual bla performances in other video games. Though not the deepest story I've ever seen, you don't really need it for action games like this. This game is extremely fun and I recommend it for anyone who likes action games. My only slight problem with it is that there is no multiplayer. If you could take everything about this game and throw it into the multiplayer modes of Jedi Knight for some online battles, it'd be the perfect Star Wars game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2008"}

When I heard it was coming out for the PS2, I grabbed a copy to see how they compared.I have to honestly say that in the past I'd always thought the graphics on the PS2 and XBox were pretty much the same - that they both could achieve the same level of crispness. But if what Splinter Cell on the PS2 looks like is REALLY the best the PS2 can do, compared to the exact same game on the XBox, I'm afraid the PS2 needs a facelift.I was really disappointed with the lower quality and jaggedness. Splinter Cell on the XBox was amazingly smooth, and we played the game many, many times because it was so enjoyable. While playing the PS2 version might have been better graphic-wise than say a Bond game, it wasn't up to the XBox version's high quality.The PS2 version promoted its &quot;great new levels&quot; and adjusted gameplay. So we started comparing. We found actually that many levels were missing many, many pieces. In the XBox a bad guy might have been standing against a balcony looking out over the city. In the PS2, he was standing against a flat wall! There were bad guys missing. There were puzzles missing. It felt &quot;dumbed down&quot; in many ways. Again, having enjoyed it so much on the XBox with its complexity, intricate graphics and challenging puzzles, it was extremely disappointing to keep hitting, again and again, a spot where a scene had been 'kiddiefied'.They were stupid little changes, too. For example, in the XBox version, you're walking through a house and find a bathroom, with lots of detail. Up on the wall is a medicine chest, just like you'd expect. In the PS2 version, the bathroom is missing and you just find a health kit lying in the middle of the hallway. It took away a lot of the realism.If you don't have an XBox, Splinter Cell is still a fun game and can give you enjoyment for many hours. I suppose if they tried to port Halo to the PS2 you might have the exact same problem - that a game that people LOVE on the XBox because of its giant levels, intricate graphics and complex gameplay would be reduced to tiny levels, jagged graphics and simple puzzles. Yes, it could still be fun. But it's sort of like listening to your favorite Rock Anthem through tinny speakers at a quiet volume, instead of blasting the sound through your high quality stereo.For that same &quot;quality level&quot; experience on the PS2, I'd really stick to games where the PS2's abilities shine - which seem to be the Kingdom Hearts and Final Fantasy genre of games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2003"}

It's hard to single out a favorite as they all play really good and all have fun styles. Even with that said, there is a pretty large cast. Now this game can be addicting to play and it looks damn good with its 3D style laced in 2D gameplay. The gameplay like other Vs. titles is just as fast and chaotic. You will and can pull of some major flashy moves.The one downside I don't like is the menus. They are pretty dull looking. There is a currency system to unlock art, new costumes, and such that you gain by beating the game. There is a few characters that are unlockable such as Dead Rising star Frank West who is fun to play as.I been getting annoyed with very cheap bosses from games like Tekken 6 and SFIV and the end boss in this game can be pretty painful, it is not that hard to beat. I find it a balanced change compared to overally aggressive bosses with complete cheap moves that are nearly unavoidable. Each character has a ending that is done with still images. They are ok but nothing fancy. Its a fighting game anyway so its not expected and the game is a bit short.Now as the game is short, the online gameplay does have a great value. I haven't found much lag during my playthrough which is impressive and hard to come by with many Wii games. I recommend this game. It is pretty easily for anyone to play.

This year, I got Sega's offering, that was dirt cheap and it was OK. I'm not into the \"crib\" scene, but gameplay was great like in previous years. I saw a promo for getting a discount on a wireless remote when you bought Madden 2005 when it came out and went for it. After getting used to the differences, I have become addicted. I have started in Franchise mode and also done the fantasy draft. After playing several \"seasons\", I now look forward to the owner off-season mode as much as playing games. It gives you insight into the game, the combine, free agency, etc. ESPN's football game goes overboard in owner mode. I don't want to go through a massive menu and decide what kind of workout my defensive backs have this week. I would much rather shop around my baggage for what my team needs (in Madden). I think that Madden's graphics look better. I actually tried playing my Sega game last week and am so used to Madden that I stopped after a couple minutes.There are things I wish Madden stole from ESPN/SEGA...a half time show, a weekly wrapup show, more realistic penalties. I have been playing this game a ton and have NEVER seen a pass interference call. Hopefully, some of this will be addressed in the 2006 offering. They may start to slack though since the NFL Players Assoc has signed an exclusive agreement with Madden, therefore squashing all competition.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-12-2005"}

With the introduction of Playmaker control and the ability to adjust receiver hot routes on the fly, it was easy to rack up 30, 40, 50 points in a game, especially with a stud quarterback.  Let's face it.  Coverboy Vick was nearly unstoppable and it wasn't uncommon to see the Atlanta Falcons win Super Bowl after Super Bowl on franchise mode.  This year, the tables have turned.  The emphasis is now on defense.  The sheer amount of flexibility allowed is mind-boggling.  Other than controlling your defensive backs, linebackers, and defensive linemen as a group, you can now control each player individually.  For instance, you can have one cornerback play man coverage while the other plays zone.  Maybe you don't feel too hot about your cornerback's ability to cover a particular wide receiver.  No problem.  You can direct one of your safeties to help out in double coverage.  On short passing plays, you can have your weakside linebacker play zone coverage while your middle linebacker blitzes the quarterback.  You can also have one of your defensive ends rush to the outside while the other rushes to the inside.  The scenarios are endless.  Strategists will have a field day with this new feature.  Also new this year is the Hit Stick.  I know...  It sounds gimmicky, but it's actually quite effective and most importantly, fun.  While simply tapping the right analog stick in any direction, your defensive player will unleash a vicious, bone-rattling tackle on your opponent (the tackle animations are great).  Time it just right and the ball carrier might develop a sudden case of fumble-itis or be knocked out till the middle of next week.  Thankfully, you can't overly abuse the Hit Stick.  For it to be truly effective, your player needs to have a nice momentum going (about five yards).  Tap it too late and your defensive player will be grasping at air while your opponent cruises for a touchdown.  Simply put, it's all about timing and positioning, as it is in a real game.The franchise mode has been given a nice facelift.  New this year is sports radio host Tony Bruno who adds little snippets of commentary and information between games in the form of a radio show.  He'll go off on some spiel about who's playing well or not, rumors, transactions, and bits of trivia.  A nice touch is the actual use of coach and player voices during interviews and having angry fans call in to trash their team when they're not playing well.  Another addition is the Storyline mode.  Players now have individual personalities which are based on a morale meter.  Bench a starter, and his morale will plummet.  Promote him to team captain and his morale will sky-rocket.  Annoy a player like perennial whiner, Terrell Owens, and he'll demand a trade.  Who thought running a franchise would be so rewarding and yet, such a headache?  I also enjoyed the ability to now make trades during the draft.  For instance, you can package several role players and a third round draft pick to another team in exchange for their first round pick.  Similarly, teams will also offer trades to you in return.  Other than these new features, the franchise mode is basically the same.  As owner, you can still set concession, parking and advertising prices or move the team to a city with a bigger market.The graphics have been given a nice boost.  The players are more detailed, with nice musculature and better shadowing, though they look a little too much like steroid freaks.  Replays are nice as they provide various angles of the action.  A nice touch is that they look scratchy and grainy like those old NFL films from yesteryear.  Weather is now a factor as you'll often see clouds dot the playing field or rain storms appear without warning during a game.  Regardless, Madden still doesn't hold a candle to ESPN 2k5 which set the bar for detail and realism this year.I like Madden 2005 a lot.  The series is a great investment year after year and they always add a nice wrinkle or two to make it stand out.  I love the defensive flexibility, Hit Stick, and nice franchise features, but doggone it, I still find myself gravitating towards ESPN 2k5.  The look, the presentation, and overall feel of that game is just too hard to ignore.  Face it.  Madden is beginning to show it's age.  The graphics are nice, but dated and the overall gameplay is about the same, especially on the offensive side of the ball.  Granted, Madden 2005 is a nice alternative, but I don't really see myself playing the game as much until I'm sick and tired of playing ESPN 2k5.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2004"}

There are a few things that I would like to add. First off, there is one slight problem with the game. Personally, with action games of the 3rd-person variety, I like to be able to control the camera. This game does not have that. Instead, you are taken where the gamemakers want you to go and only what they want you to see. This is a very slight complaint, and one I'm hoping will be improved with GOD OF WAR II. The second thing that I would like to add is that the Mythological aspect of this game is GREAT! It really gives the game a very epic scale that is not found in a great many games. It's the thing that drives this game farther than it usually would. It's a tremendously entertaining, and oft-times thought-provoking, game that has a sense of gravitas that most action slice'em-dice'em games of this type get to.

{"product_name":"B003O6G47U","description":"","reviewerName":"Tstops","summary":"So much wasted potential","reviewText":"There's only a few silent hill games I felt were generic and stood out of place with the rest of the franchise; silent hill 4 the room and the latest installment silent hill downpour.Downpour seemed rushed, generic and in my opinion the normal difficulty settings(which I played on) was so painlessly easy. Which if you ask me, is a sin in the survival horror genre. It just didn't feel like a well made silent hill game.Now this game isn't an unplayable game. Its just not a good game. The controls are responsive and and combat(while incredibly simple and generic unlike silent hill homecoming) flows well. There are scares in the game but you'll never get that depressing, sad and terrified feeling you get from previous titles(including silent hill 4 the room). The graphics are perfectly fine. The actual town of silent hill looks creepy and depressing but that's about it. The town of silent hill was the only thing in the game that impressed me. It was big and creepy it is.As far as story goes; it was good. Vague like most silent hills but dark and sad. The cutscenes are so few and far in between that you forgot what your doing and why. If you had to take a long break from the game, it would be confusing to get back into.I'm going to talk more about these things in detail.Combat and controls. Combat in this game is so boring and lackluster. Children can beat this game. It's simple block and hit tactics. Unlike my favorite silent hill compact system in silent hill homecoming which had a dodge system, weapon tactics, counter strikes and kill camera shot. Encounters with enemies became so uneventful.Speaking of events and enemies ; silent hill downpour added \"side quests\". That's right side quests in your journal. Silent hill and earlier resident evil games did have side quests but these were called \"secrets\". These secrets were cryptic areas or puzzles peppered into the games. Silent hill downpour destroyed this by adding these boring collection \"side quest\" with useless rewards. Such as a golden gun (which you'll probably get rid of because of the dumb halo weapon system or the tomahawk. sometimes your rewards for these \"side quests\" are.....achievements I.....f***ing...that. Most of these side quests are stupid collection quest. Collection quests are the laziest kind of objectives ever. I pray one day the collection of Radom coins, rubies, pictures etc etc will one day be a thing if the past. Collection objectives are for Mario fans not silent hill. Find five birds, find 6 pictures....it drive me nuts and killed the atmosphere and story of the game. Every now then you would come across strange puzzle areas and those were fine i just wish they would've stuck with it, or at least make the rewards worth it. I'd rather say\"hey, I can walk into this gas station. I wonder whats in there\", and find a med kit and a tough monster encounter. There's not a lot of that in this title.You don't need silly collection quests in survival horror games. Exploration is paramount in survival horror. You need to explore to find items and ammo;not pictures and birds. It baffles me when games throw the items your character needs right in your face and say \"here's a a shotgun and health kits. Feel free to explore for achievements and useless rewards at this point.\" Because that's how this game functions I literally didn't die in this game until the final boss. The games enemies are so weak and stupid it was easy to take on 2 or 3 at time.Speaking of enemies; downpour has the most generic of any silent hill game I've played(which is all). Every enemy just looks like a crazy person or at least they're human in shape. It might be my biggest disappointment in the game. I'm not sure how this could've happened in a silent hill title. Silent hill is renown for creating creatures of pure terror and abominations that you wonder how messed up is the person who created this \"thing\" is. The enemies look like a 13 year old thought these things up. Sure sometimes they'd spook you but most times I found myself saying \"god, really? Another one?! I'm bored to tears\". There's only 5 enemies in the game and 3 of those enemies are just different variants of each other.If you're familiar with silent hill you'll know it's infamous for its \"other world encounters\". As if the purgatorial world of silent hill wasn't bad enough sometimes hell creeps its way into it. The \"other world\" deforms and mutants silent hill into a much more dangerous place, not to mention a more terrifying place. I dreaded the \"other world \" encounters in previous titles. When I hear the siren go off and paint melt off the walls and the infamous pyramid head shows up I knew i was in for a freak show of terror. Silent hill downpours version of the other world is a cake walk compared to every other silent hill title. The other world encounters in downpour are generic and brief. Consisting of a fiery aberration that chases you. This was scary at first but quickly loses its flavor; very disappointing. Not even a siren goes off.The music?! What the hell happened to the music in this game?!!! Wheres the creepy Italian ukalalle and distorted depressing surf music in every,single, other, game. This music set the sad tone of these games. Who did they get to do the intro song for downpour? Korn ! They got friggin Korn!! This, in my opinion is just shameful. I don't really know what the hell they were thinking. My best guess is they wanted a changed music pace and they chose korn. My god what a dumb decision. When I heard the song in the intro my jaw dropped and my poor wife had to hear me rant for 5minutes. I know some people might not see it as a big deal but this truely pisses me off. Just f***ing, stupid grrrrrr!!!!Silent downpour is a playable game with not alot to it. It's easy and unrewarding. If you're a fan of silent hill, play it(just so you can say you did) if you're not a fan of silent hill or are new to the series, skip it. I truley hope they at least try harder on the next silent hill. Silent hill downpour was a disaster and is one of those games that someone or a whole team got fired for.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

To help you maximize the potential of this setup, two-player online and offline co-op modes ensure that you have options when picking a partner.Steel yourself Against the Harsh Reality of KijujuAn advanced version of Capcom's proprietary MT Framework game engine brings groundbreaking graphics and effects to Kijuju, the highly-developed environment where this game's action takes place. New, lifelike lighting schemes highlight the differences between harsh sunlight and extreme darkness, and when you move from one to the other, you'll have to wait for your character's eyes to adjust before you can see clearly, adding to the suspense and challenge of navigating this game's environs.Face the Next Generation of EvilYou'll face new enemies with faster reflexes and improved AI, designed to be as dangerous alone as they are in groups and to keep evenResident Evilmasters on their toes. Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"olainez","summary":"Nice, if you have played and enjoyed previous R.E. games...","reviewText":"I didn't enjoyed it as much as I thought when I bought it. This is a good game, with good graphics, very easy to understand what you're suppose to do in order to accomplish each chapter. There is an exception when you kill some of the bosses, but in general there are no difficulties on it. However, I didn't like certain things when I was playing this title. First of all, you cannot pause the game while you're choosing guns. The enemies attacks you while you're doing this. There are not many guns you can use, which is another thing I didn't like either. It's a bit hard because there are many enemies, some of them take a lot of time to kill. That's nice. What is not so nice is having no guns to do it. Guns are 'expensive,' so you'll need to take every piece of treasure you find while you're hanging out. Your partner helps you sometimes, but there are a few fails with her. In general, that's not the biggest problem. I didn't like how this story ends, I mean, what happens when you finish the whole game. You get a few rewards for ending the game, but the story is weak. For me, this is a 6.0/10 game. It will entertain you, but it not the best game. It has a lot of things that are really nice, but some glitches spoil them.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-10-2011"}

The Super Nintendo Entertainment System dies out in the United States. Diablo comes out for the PC. However, the biggest news is the launch of Nintendo's amazing new system: the Nintendo 64, which was lauded for its beautiful graphics and a brilliant new controller.Two games were released along with the system. There was Pilotwings 64, which was not exactly what was expected, but the other game was called the greatest game of all time (as of 1996, that is, at least in the eyes of critics) by several source. And it really was.The first thing that strikes your eyes is its delicious eye candy. The first thing that pops out at you after the title is Giles Goddard's Mario face. And boy does it look good! But enough with the intro. It's time to see whether the game itself passes the graphics test.Answer? Yes it does. Even after five years, Super Mario 64 is still one of the most beautiful games for Nintendo's crowning glory (speaking from a fanboy's POV.) The character and tree designs are very outdated by today's standards, but the water is still lovely (though surpassed) and some of the brick and stone backgrounds still are the most realistic that I have ever seen. Today the graphics would get a C by reviewers, but back in 1996, this game would get an A+.But who cares how it looks. Let's see how it sounds.The answer? Great! Before 1996, Nintendo fans never had a chance to hear Mario talk, but the first thing that greets you when you turn on the system is a jingle and the words \"It's-a me, Mario!\" and \"Hello!\" while a remixed version of the classic Mario theme plays in the back. But again, this is only the intro. The question is whether games sounds that good.The answer, naturally, would be even better. Mario comes packed with a large batch of sayings including \"Mama mia!\", \"Here we go!\" and \"Press start to play!\" Unfortunately, everything else (other than Peach and Bowser) don't talk in anything else other than words. But remember the fact that this is a first generation cartridge game, and if people complain for Zelda, then they shouldn't complain here.The music and sound effects are just divine. Outside the castle, you are greeted with the happy chirping of birds and the roaring of a nearby waterfall. Enter and the cozy castle theme starts playing. Each of the levels come equipped with music that ranges from peaceful to energetic to somber. The Bowser fight music ranges from rock to organ music, and it's all wonderful.Now that the graphics and the sound are out of the way, let's get into the meat of the game: the gameplay.The first thing most people would notice is how different this is from traditional Mario games. There are only 1-Up mushrooms, and the only pipe that appears is in the very beginning. However, Super Mario 64 is 3D, and most of those elements just wouldn't work in a 3D game.The story, according to the manual, is that Peach invites Mario over to the castle for a cake. When Mario reaches the castle, he is greeted with a gruff voice. Wondering what went on, Mario explores the rooms and finds a giant painting where he can jump in. There, he finds himself in a new world, with a giant Bob-Omb on the top. He fights and defeats it (you'll have to do that part yourself) and gets a star. Later, he learns that Bowser has attacked the castle, captured the Princess, stolen the Power Stars, and has sent his army to take over the worlds inside the paintings, then the world itself.Yeah, so it isn't much different from other Mario games, but that's not the point. The point is, there are 120 stars out there (although 70 is need to beat the game, but where's the fun in that?) for you to collect. Your misson to explore 15 worlds to find those 120 stars.Well, instead of having a Super Mario and a Mario like in past Mario games, Mario has 8 life bars. Hitting certain enemies would make him lose 2 life bars, as well falling from semi-high heights. Burning Mario's butt will make him lose 3. Certain other enemies and falling from really high heights will make him lose 4. But don't worry. Coins and water will replenish your health. If you lose all 8 or fall down a pit, you lose a life. But for every 50 coins you get with a star and every 1-Up Mushrooms, you get a life.Your moves include the standard running, punching, butt-stomping, as well as the kick, the long-jump, the wall-kick, the side-somersault, and the backflip. You can also swim! There are three special caps that gives you special abilities. The Flying Cap gives you the ability to fly. The Metal Cap gives you the ability to walk underwater and be immune to enemy. The Vanish Cap gives you the ability to walk through enemies and certain walls. Mario most employ all of those ablities to save the Princess and the world.The Nintendo 64 controller, with its analog stick, makes it possible for Mario to perform the tasks successfully. (Just imagine travelling in a 3D world with a D-pad.) Some people complain about the camera angles and how you have to control them with the C-button. It may be annoying at first, but eventually you'll get used to it, and it'll come naturally, and you'll learn to play with the bad angles.Super Mario 64 not only has good graphics, good sound, and good gameplay, but the fact that it is revolutionary (in that it brings gaming into the 3D world) makes it not only the best game of 1996, but possibly also the best game ever. That's right, even better than Castlevania and Super Metroid.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2002"}

But it is *great*, and will remind you what a great game is like, when you're stuck thinking about why everything's a half-hearted clone of Metal Gear, or GTA. It'll remind you that behind all the mindless violence, sexism, and controversy-for-controversy's sake that seems to be at the heart of so much of the industry, there are people who love games so much that that love just pours out of the screen.

The game really looks great, and the graphics are good quality (although not great). As many have mentioned, the voice acting s pretty bad. My primary issue with this game however is the \"spin\". What i mean is this: when you try to turn your character, the whole game starts spinning out of control. It is very dizzying and disorienting. There is no way that i can find to slow down the controller action, and so anytime you want to look around, you have to deal with this. Although i will give playing this game another chance, it basically rendered it unplayable when i first tried. That aside, when you can actually have a moment to enjoy the game, it seems pretty col. Just one horribly impactful glitch. I give this two stars, but i suspect if i could get past that deficiency, it would end up as a four star game for me, or at least 3 1/2.ed: I left everything up from my initial review, but I wanted to update this as they seemed to have fixed the issue with the uncontrollable spin when you look around. Now, I've actually been able to play a bit and am enjoying i so far. I cant say it wows me, but I did upgrade my ranking on this to three stars to reflect the changes.

It is not a bad thing to see this combination, but does it bring someone flesh to us?Visual:Indeed impressive. The color design is top notch (even though sometimes it may see a little to bright that hurt your eyes). The environment presentation is one of the best games I've seen. The model of monkey the Trip is really well done, you see great lip sync and facial expressions that as good as \"Heavy Rain\".However, there are some tearing or rate drop here and there, and the AA is not high enough in most of the time. But over all, the development team really brought the world alive and nice. Check out the screenshot stuff then you see what I mean.Storyline:Actually quite good. Comparing to the novel you got different motivation for the travel, full developed characters and some funny dialogues to enjoy. The story unfolds in a constant rate that you don't have a particular section that is really boring so you want to skip. Every 10 minutes you have a twist or a metal crap dog chases you to keep you engaged.I'm 3.5 hours into the game,I hope it has a strong ending.Sound/Voice:The sound effects are satisfying especially for explosions, which you have a lot. The voice acting is professional, you feel you are watching a movie sometimes because they really do a good job on the voice. Music~~~ I don't really think there are some catchy tones.Game play:Only average. The animation of combat is fluid in most of the time, but rate drop issues are there. Luckily not too often. The combat of monkey is limited. In fact, you don't really need lots combos because the enemies are so weak to kill even in hard difficulty. And the types of enemies are not that many but in my opinion it is OK. Boss designs are good though, they have cool and unique appearance, but again, you don't really need to die twice before you figure out how to kill them. Engage, and kill, straight forward. Platforming does bring some intensive moments which I truly enjoy, just like \"Uncharted 2\". However, the same problem persists which is -- you can't really die~~~ the system helps you aim for direction, hints show you where to jump, so again you just smash your A button and that's fine. It is not something like Ninja Gaiden brings you challenge.All in all, if you enjoy a game for its story, nice visual and you don't really care about the action/combat, you should pick this up now. It is very good stuff while you waiting for Fallout or Fable III, hehe. If you are not buying it right away, I still suggest you picking it up later on when the price dropped.A little follow up on 10/13: I'm pretty sure there will be an \"Enslaved 2\"~~~hehe.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-06-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUZ","reviewerName":"John. N","summary":"Messing with a proven formula, Capcom ends up in hot water","reviewText":"After dropping the pathetic bombshell that was X6 back in 2001, Capcom finally decided it was time to take the X series to the next level. Unforunately, as if things weren't already bad enough for the series, we all know that Capcom failed to make this conversion as painless as possible, and fans had another half-baked game to add to their Mega Man X gaming collection.At first glance, Mega Man X7 has eveything one would expect from a Mega Man title. The the cel-shaded graphics are pretty nice to look at, considering X fans are used to looking at 2D sprite graphics. Beyond it's graphical engine, however, X7 does almost everything humanly possible to ruin the rest of the experience for the gamer.To start off, the load times are way too abundant. Considering  this isn't a first generation PSX2 title, and the fact that games like the PSX2 Final Fantasy's have better graphics and faster load times, this is just unexcusable (even if the load screens do act as continue points). Next is the horrendous english voice acting. Considering the fact Capcom conmpletely disrespected US gamers but not even bothering to add english voices to X6, this is a little more tollerable in my book (at least they tried - I guess).Another gripe is we're still treated to the same still shots and text story scenes as in X5 and X6. I though the jump to a 32-bit system to a 128-bit system would actually mean something here, but no. You'll have to beat the game to see ending - the only VMF in the entire game, excluding the opening.Gameplay is where Mega Man X7 commits the most serious of its crimes. The 2D sections of the game play well enough, even if the auto-aim is a bit glitchy at times. 3D sections don't even play half as well, as camera problems creep up continously, forcing players to make some jumps completely blind (don't get me started on having to rotate the camera in conjunction to shooting in some boss fights just to see your attacker...). Even worse is the mass of slowdown one will experence, espcially during the boss fights, were the game slows down to a crawl. Level designs are decent, but it is pretty sad considering one can find all the hidden power-ups without much exploration (I didn't even have to consult a guide - I found everything on the first playthough).Most Mega Man fans will probably buy Mega Man X7 reguardless of what I written above (I still bought it, and I knew what I was getting into). Still, I remember a time when you could say you had beaten all the Mega Man X games and you could say it with pride. Unfortunately, now all it means you have played four good games and four so-so games.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-24-2004"}

Along with this new motion sensor, the cartridge has a rumble pack for force feedback. Tons of crazy, spin-controlled games are waiting for you!","reviewerName":"Ryan H.","summary":"Most Innovative Title in the series","reviewText":"When I opened the box of this game, I was surprised to see that the gamepack was huge.  It kind of looks like the Kirby Tilt & Tumble cartridge that came out for the GBC and works a little of the same way.  This game comes with a built in gyro sensor and rumble pack.  The gyro sensor tracks movement in the gba.  This adds an interesting twist to the game (sorry for the pun).  First off, you no longer need to use the d-pad, which takes some time getting used to.  Instead you select everything by turning the gba to the left and right.  You can hold it down by holding the R button.This game plays exactly like the original game with the added gyro sensor games.  There are some A button games, but they are beaten out by the gyro games.  Some A button games are also gyro based like for instance 9-Volt's game where you must hit the bombs before the eggplant man gets to you.  As ridiculus as this game sounds, its actually quite fun.  The game advises at start up that you move the GBA and not yourself but occasionally I found my self moving with the GBA kind of like that effect of racing games where players will lean to the left or right while turning a corner in the game.If you are the kind of person who can't handle fast movements such as spinning left or right or even upside down, then this game is definately not for you.  Those of you who liked the other games should pick this one up especially those who bought 'Touched' because if you play it with this cartridge in, you can unlock something for the toy room.  The game takes a while to get the hang of but after a while you'll be able to take on most of the challenges.  The 'Story' mode, though not deep, can be completed within a couple of hours but is still fun to go back to.Pros- Innovative games- Built in rumble feature- Humorous gamesCons- Takes time to get used to wacky controls- Not for those who get dizzy or have nausea","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-16-2005"}

I opened up a sound test mode on my first playthrough.My only complaint is that the multiplayer isn't supported online. It was a terrible decision that was said to be because of timing. It only supports local play. It supports four people and as you shoot each other, you can see each other's face above the spacecraft through the camera. It is pretty funny and was a creative idea.

First off the combat takes center stages, there is plenty of combo's and techniques to use and your constantly switching from your sword to your guns Ebony and Ivory to other weapons and it's just so fun constantly changing things up. The combat is very fast paced and it feels fluid, depending on the difficulty it can definitely give you a challenge.There are a few platforming stages to where you must jump from one section to get to another and that can also be quite entertaining. Graphically the game looks good, nothing special. Level design is also very good, there is quite a variety of stages throughout the game. The story is lacking and while it's not spectacular it's not bad either.Overall if you have enjoyed games such as God of War, Metal Gear Rising, Dante's Inferno, Darksiders and others DmC Devil May Cry will not disappoint especially for the price it's at now. For the most part your buying into the gameplay of this game, and for the cost of around 20$ dollars 1/3 of it's original price I'd definitely say it's worth it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2014"}

Taegel","summary":"AWESOME Gameplay, Okay Story","reviewText":"If you like games where you've got to strategically make your way through an environment, hiding bodies and taking people out without raising the alarm, this is for you.The mechanics work flawlessly, and the gameplay is where this game shines. At some moments, the experience was not dissimilar to the predator rooms in the Batman games, but the similarities end there. There are lethal and nonlethal takedowns, but your options are the standard fare: guns, dart guns (crossbow), and a variety of grenades. From there, you have many many options for how you want to go about dispatching your victims. There's some refinement of the gameplay from Conviction, but nothing groundbreaking. To that I say, \"Does it need to be?\" In this case, I'd say no. I could certainly cull elements from other stealth games (disguises, a nanosuit, a more open environment, upgradeable takedowns), but all in all, the decision to refine the core Splinter Cell mechanics proved for a very satisfying stealth experience. Speaking to that, it was also fun to be able to go loud every once in a while. There are some missions where it is essential not to be discovered, and some where it's easier just to open fire. One of the characters in the game tells you what kind of encounters to expect, so you can modify your loadout accordingly beforehand.Side missions. Are very very fun in this game, and help you to get cash for gear. You're either, killing waves of enemies for a number of rounds until you can be extracted. Or you're sneaking into a compound and may not be detected.Difficulty. This game is not extraordinarily difficult, if you've played a stealth game or two. In fact, compared to the unforgiving detection mechanics of some earlier splinter cell and MGS games, it's not hard at all. On normal, soldiers generally take a moment to register your presence if you get spotted. This is ample time to either hide or take a quick head-shot.The plot is serviceable. Bad guys are attacking and Sam Fisher and his team must stop them. There are no real surprises or twists or moments that make you sit up and blink, but it's not ridiculous either. A highlight of the game is the performance by Carlo Rota, whom I recognized from 24. He plays the main villain, Sadiq, and infuses a bit of humor into an otherwise sterile story. Even the iconic Sam Fisher is quite dull. Had the story offered something in the way of drama, I would call Blacklist a solid 5 star game. Just a couple of traitors or satisfying plot-twists would have made this game epic.Sam's new voice didn't bother me, though considering Sam looks to be about 30 in this game, the reference to his teenage daughter made me chuckle. Speaking of 24, Kiefer Sutherland would have been a good choice. The real problem with Sam here is that the story has no emotional content. There are moments in the game where you decide whether or not to spare of execute people, but these decisions don't factor into the story or how the other characters relate to Sam at all.So, in conclusion, the core gameplay and stealth mechanics make this game very fun to play, even if the story is somewhat lackluster. I would categorically recommend it to anyone who enjoyed games like Deus Ex or Hitman: Absolution.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2013"}

(Donkey Kong, the first game with mario in it was released the year I was born so I didn't get to really enjoy it the way veteran players did.)I've played every Mario game since. I really like \"Super Mario Bros. vs\" for the arcade as well as the recently released Japanese \"Super Mario Bros. 2\" for the virtual console. I have beaten all of them. But something about \"New\" Super Mario bros. is unappealing to me. I bought it for ds and felt \"meh\" about it. Felt more like an ungraded rehash, yet it sold something like 20 million plus copies.Now with New Super Mario Bros. Wii., its more of the same just that now you can have 4 players on screen at once. That i feel is the biggest draw for the game. Other than that, the levels don't really feel like they have a defined theme. For example, Super Mario Bros. 3 had a level with \"large\" characters, or an ocean level where much of it dealt with the frog suit. This game does have the penguin suit and such but it just feels soo uninspired to a veteran player that i consider myself to be. I was basically forcing myself to play through it, granted i played much of it alone and i think its meant to be played more with a group.Long story short,  I recently sold the game and used the money to get Zelda Skyward Sword, and my feelings on that game are for another story... I'm glad Nintendo games in general keep there resale value high years after release so i basically did a one for one swap, sold it for $25 and skyward sword at my local video game store was $25. Good riddens New Super Mario Bros. Wii. But heres the kicker, I'm soo brainwashed into buying Nintendo stuff, I may pick up the New Super Mario Bros.

I love director Mikami's games, I love Platinum's games (like Bayonetta), and the trailer was INSANE. Sure, the story elements seemed to lift from Metal Gear Solid, but in a wink-wink kind of way.My disposable income has become low, but still I pick this sucker up ASAP. I play it, and it's okay. I keep trying to like it. It's cool to upgrade weapons, though a little weird that you need a full clip in them. I try not to over-use cover, though the slow-mo power is both cliche and runs out quickly. I try to shut off my brain on cutscenes to admire the wow factor instead of the nonsensical \"plot.\"About 6 hours of play later, I've beaten Vanquish. And I realize something: It's not a very good game.Those gushing about it seem to love the gameplay. Maybe I'm missing something. I'm not in love with cover-based shooters like Gears of War, but I definitely utilized it here. But I'm not supposed to, many say? As for the suit's powers? Sliding around is goofy, and doing a melee will usually overheat your suit -- causing it to malfunction. Getting hit too much will trigger the suit powers automatically. So you're basically getting into all this forced slow-mo, or having the suit's alarm blare at you while you're powerless.Enemies are boring robots, and level design just takes you from linear setpiece to linear setpiece. The world itself isn't very exciting -- a space station with a few rotating-environment gimmicks. I never felt like I was doing more than just moseying along and shooting stuff.I also never felt a real connection to the player-character like you do in top-tier games like God of War or Devil May Cry. Maybe I'm just not into third-person shooters, I don't know. Maybe I'd like it more if I replayed, as some reviewers here suggest. But honestly, I liked it LESS the more I played it the first time. Would that really change? I doubt it.I honestly don't care that it's a single-player game that takes 6 hours to beat. So wasBayonettaand I LOVED that game. I just want to enjoy those 6 hours -- make them worth the $10/hour I'm paying.Vanquish is not a terrible game, though elements are terrible (especially the story). It's serviceable most of the time, looks pretty, and will keep you on your toes. But all these 5-star people and 9.0-scoring critics must be playing a different game than I did. And I've had literally hundreds of video-game reviews published in my day, so I'm no ignoramus. I suggest that you be a little careful before diving into Vanquish yourself.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2010"}

I only just got this a few months ago as an early birthday present.  My parents bought me a PS2 and I got myself all the accessories and some games.I really love it.  I liked it so much I bought two additional ones.  There are no more cheesy IR scanners that you have to keep lined up like in the old days.  The distance is great and it can point any direction.  The response time is indistinguishable from a wired controller, no lag.  There's no off button to deal with.  The controller has great power management software that turns it off automatically so you don't drain your batteries.  Speaking of batteries, this thing is supposed to get like 100-300 hours on a single set of AA batteries if the rumble feature is turned off.  That's just bloody incredible engineering!  I can't speak to button/stick longevity, but my friend said his controller lasted him a year or two at least.My only complaint about this controller is that it's slightly heavier than I would have liked.  This is a very minor thing and quite understandable given the amount of electronics in it.  I'm just saying in a perfect world I'd like a little lighter.

{"product_name":"B003O6C9LK","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Schmidt \"TotalHavoc\"","summary":"Close but lacking the flare SSX Tricky and SSX 3 possessed","reviewText":"This is a fun game as far as a pure snowboarding, single-player experience is concerned, but unfortunately there are a number of things that are lacking in this title that leave the game falling short of my expectations.  If you have an affinity for the previous SSX releases you may be disapppointed as a lot of what made the previous releases great is absent here.  Also, if you are looking for a solid multiplayer experience you may want to look elsewhere.EA has taken a more serious approach to this game.  Originally the game was going to be called SSX Deadly Decents, and after negative consumer feedback with regards to the new serious direction taken in the revamped IP they decided to remove Deadly Decents from the title and just call it SSX.  However, it doesn't appear that they made any attempt to alter the original game they programmed based on this consumer feedback.  It is a shame because I feel like EA completely ignored the feedback from their fan base and said we are giving you the game we made whether you like it or not.  So the game ends up feeling less like an SSX game and more like a survival snowboarding game.  That aside, if you are new to the franchise you may not have the nostalgia associated with previous iterations of the game and find the snowboarding gameplay fun in its own right.  They have tried to add a little bit of a story to the game through some comic book pages in between mountains, but it is superficial at best.The basic premise of the game is that you are traveling around the globe to recruit members to your SSX team.  Each member is specialized to handle one of the unique challenges each of the 9 mountain ranges presents.  Each mountain range starts with you competing in a few race and tricky events and finishes with you taking on a deadly descent.  You can think of each mountain range having one peak that is a boss battle - the deadly descent survival final stage.  So for one mountain range the deadly descent may be darkness, another avalanches, etc., with specialized gear being required to handle each unique challenge presented.  These mountain boss battles or survival runs include whiteouts (use special goggles for terrain mapping), darkness (headlamp), drop offs (requires a wingsuit to glide over crevices), ice (ice picks to improve turning ability), extreme cold (solar panel for heat), thin air (oxygen tank), rocks (armor), avalanches, and trees.Some of the game highlights and drawbacks are outlined below:PROS:-The controls are tight making it easy to carve up the mountain and perform stunts.-Athough pretty limited, the soundtrack is decent.  I do wish there was a little more variety provided in the music included.-The landscapes are large and beautiful with some pretty long runs down the mountain.-There are a number of game modes (racing, trick events, survival events) and a larger number of locations/trails to decend than I expected.-The ability to purchase a number of upgrades to each snowboarder is a plus.-Several welcome nuances have been added to the gameplay on the various mountains that require specialized gear to survive descents like headlamps, wing suits, armor, ice picks, and solar panels.  These subtle changes to gameplay help keep the game interesting.-A GEOTAG system has been added that basically allows you and other players to hide markers on the various slopes.  The player who dropped the GEOTAG collects money at a certain rate until the marker is discovered and other players that find the marker get money for locating the marker.  It can be fun trying to find the perfect spot to hide a marker and trying to figure out how to reach those hard to reach GEOTAGS you see glimmering in the distance.-I do think the survival aspects added to the game are a welcome addition, but I wish more emphasis was placed on the SSX brand and less on the deadly descent aspects.CONS:-The over the top personalities of the characters developed in earlier iterations of this game are non-existent so you really don't develop an attachment to any of the characters.  Also, even though you can change the color of of your character's snowsuit, there doesn't appear to be any unique alternative character models like in previous SSX games.  The base character models have changed for some of the characters making them not really feel like the same character you use to know.-The lack of real live head to head competition really hurts the game.  Beating the ghost of a friend just isn't the same as racing or tricking right next to them.  Although the GEOTAG system is a fun little add-on, multiplayer feels very underdeveloped and tacked on.-Although there are unique aspects to the mountains in terms of terrain (ice versus rock versus forrest), the differences are subtle.  There was a real distinction in various locations in the previous SSX games that is lacking here.In the past few days a problem has risen in my ability to connect to Ridernet ( the online aspect of the game).  This is an issue other gamers are also having.  While it isn't affecting every user, it is affecting both 360 and PS3 versions of the game.  I have contacted EA about the problem, but they have yet to get back to me.  Given this latest turn of events I cannot recommend that anyone buy this game until the issue is resolved.  Also, given the lackluster multiplayer I would also wait until the price drops before picking this title up.  I was enjoying the game for what it was worth up to the point where my technical issue developed but I admit that I am left partially disappointed by the neutering of the personality associated with SSX tricky.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-09-2012"}

However, I am not going to make this review comparing the two games. Forza has a lot of things better than GT (and vise versa).The thing I didn't like too much is that after racing a certain number of times, you can earn manufacturer affinity up to 100%, which basically means you can get all performance parts for free. While this does seem good, it does take away from the concept of racing, earning credits, and making smart purchases considering the amount of money you have.Also, at a current price of $51.99 it does seem a little too high for my liking. I am sure that in 6 months from now the price will be around $30 or less.

A few little tweaks, and you've got a four star game.  Too bad.This game is tough, but more importantly, it's annoying.  I realized that they were some serious issues with this game when I had to do the first stunt ten times.  First off, there is no walkthrough of the stunt.  You have to emulate a series of stunts, and they won't tell you what's next in the series until just when you're about to execute it.  This meant that you'd probably not have the right speed or angle going into the next part stunt.  That's not too bad.  What's worse is that the timing and accuracy have to be perfect for many stunts.  If you mess up a little bit, you run out of time and have got to start the mission again.There are six movies to complete, each with about three to six series of stunts to accomplish.  About half way through the second movie, when I went through a stunt 30 times, I realized that this was a waste of my time and energy.

The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Review Lover \"ReviewLover\"","summary":"Not the best by a long shot.","reviewText":"With a hugely absorbing plot and some beautifully-executed, long-overdue in-game enhancements, 'Final Fantasy X' ought to have been the standard-bearing Mega-Game that we all expected it to be.Sadly, thanks in no small part to a VERY limiting control system and very little room for gameplay freedom, FF X instead descends into the Bargain Bin of Pretty Games Sans Substance.Players control a young man named Tidus, a blond-haired juvenile-voiced Blitzball player, who, after his city is attacked by an evil force called Sin, his guardian Auran takes him to another world to uncover his heritage and save the universe from Sin. From there you get to recruit bigger and better players and there is, as always, a multitude of nice extras and side-quests that. in theory, add colour and excitement to the game.First, the good points. The graphics are astounding, with large, beautifully-detailed characters and bad guys maintaining a very impressive frame-rate on-screen. Music is fairly standard FF fare, stirring battle tunes and o-so-sweet ballady tracks adding much atmosphere to the proceedings. The voice acting has been unfairly criticised, it's good, and a hugely welcome change from endless reams of text to wade through. It's also easier to remember plot points when you hear them, and there's no danger of skipping over them with a Cancel button. However, this is customisable, and you can have the audio with or without subtitles.The plot, on paper, is one of the best FF plots around - detailed and complex, without being confusing, it's the stuff of solid games legends.Unfortunately, though, none of these points can save FF X from the in-game mechanics, and this is where FF X fails badly. The shrines and cityscapes of FF X are beautifuly detailed and bear exploring, and the fact that one can learn the language of Al Bhed are excellent points, both worthy of exploring at one's leisure. However, thanks to the hugely restrictive game-on-rails nature of FF X, it's oftentimes impossible to go where you want to go, or to prepare for the bigger battles. This affects the storyline, too, as major events for the first part of the game are few and far between, and so fighting beasties to build up your levels becomes such a chore.Plodding along, you very quickly get a sense of not having much to do with the game itself, that you're just there to watch events unfold and press the X button intermittently. And for some gamers, that's fine, but aftermagnificent titles like FF VII and FF IX, it's not really good enough for a FF sequel. Also, Blitzball is possibly one of the most over-complicated side quests ever, really worthy of being a game in itself.A disappointment that could so very easily have been an unequivocal classic, FF X is really a rent-before-you-buy title.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-06-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00000DMAT","description":"GoldenEye 007has been a huge success for Rareware, and it's easy to see why. More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"Media Lover","summary":"Bond, James Bond","reviewText":"This is one of my favorite FPS's of all time.

After playing more than 10 games for each title I have to say ESPN NFL 2K5 is better.ESPN has better presentation. Madden's presentation is lame. The play menu takes up more than half of the bottom TV screen, so you all see is players' top half, their legs looks chopped off. To make things worse, whenever you scroll thru the playbook the action gets paused a bit which makes all action choppy. ESPN has better looking cheerleaders and they do different things. Madden's cheerleaders have only one look type and she is ugly and has Bugs Bunny teeth and its the same sorry ass scene everytime. Madden's game intro always show players with their helmets on during pre-game exercise, ESPN players have face and hair!! ESPN's replay engine is better too, it shows the entire play, unlike Madden's which shows pieces of play.Graphically ESPN is better. You can see vent holes on players' jersey. Madden's stadium/background graphic is a bit more clean, for example the banners and jumbotrons look sharper but this is because Madden's camera engine has NO side and iso views. ESPN has side and iso views, so its understandable that the stadium/background graphic is lesser, but just a bit if any. ESPN's animation is smooth. In Madden 2005 the animation is often choppy. Especially in demo mode.Both games are not perfect. NO regular season mode for both....Gameplaywise Madden is very arcadey, it kinda plays like Madden on Genesis. On offense you can zip your pass for completion almost everytime in any situation, even into the mass pile of players at the line of scrimmage. You can basically complete your pass to anyone anytime. ESPN's gameplay is more simulation and realistic(could be a bit more arcadey though....), you can't zip your pass like Madden else it will be incomplete or intercepted. You have to read the player's route and wait for the right time to pass. In Madden, quarterbacks pass to the receiver; In ESPN, quarterbacks pass to \"the spot\" of the route. Running game in Madden is horrible, you get tackled when you get near opposing players. Madden's running game feels like flag football. The running game in Madden just simply don't work that well. ESPN's running game is much better and realistic, you can bump off, spin, and power your way thru other players. Overall ESPN's passing and running game has good balance and both can and will be used in games. In Madden the passing game dwarfs the glitched running game.Another thing I noticed is that ESPN has more player pictures! Roethlisberger and Eli Manning got pics in ESPN but none in Madden.I purchased Madden 2005 because of the price drop. I was not impressed with Madden so I purchased NFL 2K5 for $20 the same night(even after so many months since its release). Im glad that I tried ESPN 2k5, it is better than Madden 2005. I will be returning my Madden 2005 tommorrow.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2005"}

(Nunchuk not included.)","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Review Based on Value","reviewText":"A lot of the reviews for Wii Play are pretty spot on when compared to a regular Wii game, but I don't think it's fair to compare it to a regular game.  When you buy Wii Play, you basically get a remote (worth $40) along with the game, so the dispositive question is whether Wii Play is a worthy $10 game.I would answer that with a resounding YES.  It clearly looks and feels like a technical demo for the Nintendo Wii, but again, it's a $10 game.  If you're into minigames of the type you'd play in Mario Party or Wario Ware, Wii Play is your cup of tea.  You get 9 mini games:Shooting Range - basically duck hunt.  Everybody loves duck hunt, right?  It works surprisingly well with the Wii remote.  Both single-player and multi-player are pretty fun.Find Mii - basically Where's Waldo.  There's a clutter of Mii's (people) on screen and you have to find a pair that match, or a particular Mii, etc.  2-player mode basically awards points to the first person who finds the Mii.  Also fun in single-player and multi-player modes.Ping Pong - control the paddle with the on-screen wii-mote pointer.  Not really that fun, you don't actually use any motions like in tennis, you just direct the paddle on-screen to where the ball is.  It's actually quite similar to the pong/air hockey game.Pong/Air hockey - similar to Ping Pong in concept, you control your paddle on screen with the wii-mote and try to score the puck into your opponent's goal.  Not that great single player, but pretty fun multiplayer since it's a little more frantic than ping pong.Bubbles - guide shapes into bubbles to pop them.  IMO, the worst game of the bunch.  It's basically a reflex game, where you take three shapes and try to fit them into slots by directing and rotating with the wii-mote.Billiards - Pretty fun single player or multiplayer.  A standard pool game.Fishing - Similar to the mechanical board game where you try to stick you fishing pole magnet into the fish's mouth.  Kinda fun for awhile.Cow Racing - Pretty fun, shows off how the wii-mote can be used to drive and steer.Tank - Steer a tank around and lay mines or shoot shells.  It probably has the least amount of wii-mote interactivity (you point on screen to aim your shots, that's about it, everything else is standard console controls).  Lots of people seem to like this one, I didn't so much.Anyways, bottom line is that it's $10.  And it's totally worth the $10.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-01-2007"}

Three years down the road, we now have a third entry in the series that's a great game by all means... there are just so few differences between it and its predecessors that it feels like a quick cash-in by Nintendo.City Folk starts the same as the other games, but this time you're coming in by bus rather than train or cab. You name your town, answer a few questions, are introduced to a bit of the game's shining, brilliant sense of personality and humor, and then you're off. You start by working for Tom Nook, the raccoon owner of Nook's Cranny, to pay off a bit of your mortgage on your new house, but once you finish a few jobs you're on your own to do whatever you want.Animal Crossing's towns have always been big, but this game somehow feels bigger than before. As far as activities you have fruit growing that you can sell to Nook for money, go fishing or catch bugs, participate in the fun little activities that go on around town, and more. The gameplay mechanics involved are incredibly simple but it still manage to be pretty enjoyable.One of the things that gives Animal Crossing such a huge appeal is its unique, charming personality and sense of humor. Talking to neighbors, which could be an extremely boring pastime, is spiced up with bits of quirky humor. Blathers (the museum owner) always makes a reference to how he's the only worker there and how there's nothing in the museum's collection. Lyle, while annoying to talk to as he takes up a lot of your time, is actually pretty witty and funny. Every turn of a corner in City Folk will reveal yet another aspect of its fun personality and sense of humor.City Folk also has some nice music tracks. Whether you're just walking around town or cruising through the city, the tunes are nice, relaxing, and very fitting to the environment. The sound effects are also pretty decent, retaining the game's feel and not getting in the way. The only problem with the area of sound is that everything, including the music, is recycled from Wild World (except the music that plays in the city of course). This is kind of disappointing but I don't know how much I wanted it to be all new in the first place.If you've ever played an Animal Crossing game before, you'll probably have noticed by now that all this great stuff is exactly the same as it was back on the DS. Well, if you had that thought you are unfortunately quite correct. Despite being a great, solid game, City Folk features hardly anything new to the franchise. It's still fun, it's still packed with charm, but it's all exactly the same as we've seen before. So now I'll move on to the few things that are different about this game.Being a game on the Wii, new controls were a must. Thankfully Nintendo fully delivered here with some excellent, smooth, and convenient control schemes. You can use either the remote alone or with a nunchuk, but both control modes work very well. The nunchuk is basically for those who want to move with a control stick rather than by pointing your way on the screen, but even that feels surprisingly smooth and works very naturally. Pointing at an icon on the bottom of the screen, which is quick and convenient, can access any section of the game's menu. The best part about the new controls, though, is using the remote's control pad to equip items, which saves those precious few seconds every so often that previous games in the series wasted. There is also the option to swing the remote for fishing and catching bugs, which is pretty neat.The main difference in the game overall is probably the option to go to the city. Once you're finished working for Nook you can hitch a ride on the bus any time to head off to the city. When you arrive, the first thing you will probably notice is just how small it is. There is simply one main courtyard with about five buildings to go into, none of which feature anything incredibly interesting. Almost all the shops and attractions feature characters from Wild World that only came around occasionally, but now you can see them any time you want. There is also an auction house, which is really the only worthwhile diversion in the city. Unfortunately bidding is only open here every once in a while.City Folk also features some decent, simple, and smooth graphics. The character models, while revealing little detail, are very smooth and lively. The colors used on the environments are pretty vibrant and make it look nice. The great graphics are complemented by an ever-consistent frame rate that never falters and almost makes the DS game feel choppy in comparison.Those three differences aside, you basically have a Wii version of Wild World. But despite the fact that there is so little change, it's still a great game in itself. If you've already played an Animal Crossing game you're better off leaving this one alone, but if you've never played a game in the series before then this is the perfect place to start because it's truly the best Animal Crossing yet; the lack of change just earns it a lower score than its predecessors.Gamplay: 8.0Graphics: 8.5Sound: 9.0Value: 9.0FINAL SCORE: 8.0/10","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2008"}

This game is alright but overrated. I will review the multiplayer mode only.This is one of those games where it's one shot and you're dead. I don't like it because it's inaccurate. It doesn't seem like it lags but maybe it does. Because when I watch the kill-cam, it shows someone shooting me before I shoot them, even though I thought the opposite. With better games like Halo you know where you're at on the map and trust the objects on the map. But with this inaccurate game, you can be taking cover behind a truck but still die. When I watch the kill cam it shows me acting stupid, sticking my head out or something, or like I'm not even next to the truck. It's like sometimes I'm facing someone but can only see their arm yet they can see my whole body. Like other COD games you can shoot through walls too.I think the reason I play this game is because it lets me unlock weapons and stuff. Every time I want to switch to a new game, it lets me buy another weapon, making the game a bit more interesting.The reason why this game is funner than games like GOW3 is that it has many multiplayer options. It has about the same modes as before, but much more than any other game besides Halo. There is capture the flag and territory games, but more than that too. I like that you get to use special equipment like cameras and radar sensors. So it's fun because you get all these options, many weapons, equipment, and kill strike attacks. And there are many maps and multiplayer options too. You can decorate your gun and your face. So there is alot of stuff to do.I really don't like the game-play very much, it's too fast and inaccurate. It's not just me, watching the kill-cam, I notice that the average person shoots at other player's feet or something lame. The graphics aren't very good either. The story mode is fun but unrealistic.I don't know about Modern Warfare, but this game is almost exactly like WAW, including the graphics. So whether you like this game or not don't pretend like it's too different than any other COD game out there.The best part of this game and the reason why I kept the game is the mini zombie game. Unlike the WAW game, there aren't any major hackers. I now see that some players, playing black ops, shoot their guns without ammunition, even though it's says 0/0 bullets, no ammo in red in the middle of the screen, and the characters constantly says their out of bullets. And there might be some map glitches here and there too, where you can escape some zombie dangers. But despite this, the zombie game is awesome and is one of my favorite games. So not to be confusing, the regular black ops isn't too fun for me, but the zombie mini-game is one of my favorite games of this decade.COD games are always overpriced and take longer to drop in price. You might as well get the newest version of COD you can instead. Keep in mind that it cost about $60 to get all the DLC for this game. But if you like zombies then you should get this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-06-2012"}
