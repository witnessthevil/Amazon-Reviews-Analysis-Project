This...","reviewText":"Many gamers (and reviewers on this site) have said that the GTA series couldn't be matched for its innovative style and free-roaming play.  So what happens when you take a GTA-style scenario and virtually cross it with the real-world situation of Operation Enduring Freedom?  You get the new game Mercenaries: Playground of Destruction.In this game, you play as one of 3 mercenaries who have been chosen for a special mission: A United Nations-like group has to stop a madman in North Korea named Song who has control of a very powerful nuclear arsenal targeting the world. An unprecedented $100 million dollar bounty has been placed on Song's head and the heads of 51 other compatriots known as the \"Deck of 52\" (see how this relates to real world situations?)  You are dropped into the country and your search for Song begins.Your job is to make contact with the factions in the area and try to gather the intelligence information needed to take down the Deck.  The first 12 \"cards\" in each suit are pretty much open season, meaning as you travel around the map to complete your missions if you see anyone of them in the area, you can take them down to collect their bounties and use the money for supplies, but keeping in mind that killing them gives you only half the bounty.But for the 4 \"Aces\" you need to collect enough intel to gain special clearance to go after them, and trust me it won't be as easy as you would think.Graphics are not really all that bad for this game but be honest, would you really care about the graphics when this game gives you virtually free reign to shoot any weapon, take any vehicle that is near you and destroy anything and EVERYTHING that is in your path?  COME ON!All in all, this is one Playground that you definitely will want to play in...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2005"}

Soatthiamroong","summary":"Unique and Over-The-Top. BUT Button-masher Beware !!!","reviewText":"First of all, to put this review up as a critical review, I cheated a little by giving this game 3 stars. (Please, don't burn me alive!!! I'll explain now) So, sorry fans, I'm dragging the score down a little.Actually, this is a solid 4-star game for me. I just want to draw attentions of gamers who are on the fence and still considering about buying this game with an analytical point of view.Let's start,GAMEPLAYLight: The game is everything you'd expected from the creator of Devil May Cry. Fast paced, over-the-top, cool heroine with attitude, cool guns and melee weapons, crazy combos and evasive moves. Combats are satisfying as hell.The 2-button-attack system makes it simple to do combos. You can either get away with a couple of combos or go crazy and be the martial arts master.  A lot of unlockables give the game a good replay value.Dark: Yeah, it's everything you'd expected from the creator of DMC all right, including the difficulty. Remember that DMC3's difficulty had to be dropped down when they released the special edition, according to complaints from fans. This game is not exactly Ninja Gaiden or Demon's Souls, but it can be punishing at times.- You can't button-mash your way through the game. Your attacks don't really have a powerful impact or knock-back effect, so enemies counter you all the time. That makes remembering the sets of moves and plan how to execute them in the right moment important.- Dodging is crucial to your survival, maybe a little too much since you don't have any blocking move. Screw up your dodge once, and the consequence is severe. Health bar can be drained half by one set of 3-hit combo from an enemy.If you don't hunt down the item that extends your health bar, you'd better excel at dodging.  And health recovery items are scarce too.- Boss battles may need quite specific tactics. You will die and die and die again, get frustrated, curse, cry for your mommy, until you figure out how to fight. If you can endure the gaming-induced anger and frustration, you'll be okay.- They don't let you customize the button config. I don't understand why. How hard is that? It's an action game. Players should be able to set up the control scheme according to their preferences.- Check points don't really have very good consistency. Sometimes they are too far apart and it forced you to suffer hordes of enemies and die easily at the boss.- Loading time of a PS3 version is a little too much. Normally I don't really care, but this one is getting on my nerve quite a bit. The game takes some considerable loading time even when you open up the pause menu or pick up an item. It's not very long each time, but they add up to an annoying amount. I heard that a 360 version doesn't have this issue, so if you also have a 360, I recommend that one.STORY & CINEMATICLight: Story doesn't make much sense at first. But as the game progresses, it will unfold and you'll understand more and more. There are some cool cinematic cut-scenes. Actors' performances are over-the-top, but since the story doesn't take itself too seriously, that turn out to be quite hilarious and fit for the game atmosphere.Dark: Story doesn't give you any 'wow' moment, just a typical Light VS Dark stuff. And it looks like the developer didn't finish all the cut-scenes in time. They put in a lot of film-strip animatics with just character poses and voice-overs where there should be fully animated cut-scenes. Doing so gave a weird result, consistency wise.- The overly-sexualized characteristic of this game might pluck some feminists' nerves. With the amount of butt, crotch, and boobs shots in this game, it's too much to be sexy. While I myself found it hilarious and I'm willing to bet that those animators must have done their serious research from porno and strip club, feminists with no sense of humor would find this game greatly offensive (since, to them, everything that guys think sexy is objectifying women)VISUALS & SOUNDSLight: Character designs are good, very unique. They cleverly made angels look threatening and ugly while they still look like angels. Environments and props are intricate. Effects are lush and abundance. I'm not gonna go deep about models and textures since I'm playing this game on a very old TV. Soundtrack is a little bit on the weird side. They pick 'Fly Me to The Moon' and pop-jazz mix songs for battle BGMs. They go well with the atmosphere of the game though.Dark: Yes, effects are lush and abundance. But that turns into the downside as well. With all the razzle-dazzle going on the screen at the same time, dodging the attacks of 3 or 4 enemies becomes deadly. Effects can be very distracting and lead you to cheap death. Many times my mind just went blank and helplessly keep mashing the buttons just because I was overwhelmed by the visuals. Oftentimes after the fight ended, I had no idea what the hell I just did.- You'll also fight with camera quite a bit. Mostly it does a decent job, but it twists into weird and undesirable angles at times and big enemies can completely block the view of your character.  In those epic boss fights, they were so epic that your character sometimes shrunk down to about no bigger than half an inch. Playing this game for a long time can make your eyes filled with tears, but not of joy.IN CONCLUSIONDespite some rough edges, it's good-looking, fun to play, and has a good replay value. Critics giving it 5-star or 40 out of 40 maybe a bit of a stretch. Nevertheless, the game is worth its full price, especially for Devil May Cry fans.Button-masher and casual gamer beware, by the way. Under the sexy guise, Bayonetta is a younger sister of Ninja Gaiden, and she's a real feisty one. You're not gonna pass this game with one hand on something else. If you can't satisfy her, she'll punish you hard.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2010"}

The main reason Sudeki has been underrated by so many people is that the developer is not Japanese. Lovers of traditional Japanese rpgs are ready to poo all over Sudeki simply because it is the work of a western developer.  What they fail to see is that Sudeki is anything other than a traditional rpg, and thus should not be compared to traditional rpgs.  Sukeki is a brilliant mix of traditional rpg and action/adventure.  It controls like action/adventure and yet features a deep combat system that allows you to switch between four different characters and direct their combat style.  While the combat is not turn-based, it is still reminiscent of traditional rpgs because the action slows to bullet time when you change weapons, use an item, or unleash a magical attack.  Some strategic planning is required every time you go into a battle because there are so many variables that influence how the battle plays out, as well as its outcome. You have to know your weapons, characters, enemies, spells, and items very well.  So you don't have to worry about Sudeki being shallow.The only blemish on this beautiful gem of a game is that the melee combat controls for Tal and Buki are sluggish and unresponsive.  Also, the camera does not work as well as it should for melee combat.  Given time and practice, it is possible to overcome these deficiencies, but they should have been ironed out in testing.  Most of the time you don't even have to play as your melee fighters.  You can play as Elco or Ailish, who do all of their fighting in first-person.  In this way you act as kind of a director, watching the action unfold, helping each fighter as they need it, and unleashing Skill Strikes when things get a bit too hairy.The graphics and animations in Sudeki are top notch.  It is clearly one of the best looking Xbox games ever made.  Visual effects for magical attacks are heart-breakingly beautiful.  The writing and voice acting is high caliber, and the story is quite unique.  Do yourself a favor and stop listening to all the voices in the media that tell you what you should and should not like.  Give Sudeki a chance and I think you will be rewarded.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-27-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001IK1BJ0","reviewerName":"Justin &#34;Violent&#34; Lee","summary":"BioWare Takes Us On Another Journey","reviewText":"I loved Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect -- enough that I'll buy any BioWare game. Dragon Age isn't up to the level of those two, but it'll definitely give you your money's worth. The six character-specific openings and multiple quest resolutions actually bring about replay, and side quests are everywhere. I'm about 25 hours in, and feel I've only scratched the surface of the main quest.A few things to note: Dragon Age has some serious difficulty spikes. I found myself going fine, then died six times in a row on the same battle. This is also part of another issue: Needing to do tons of backtracking. This is the only RPG I know of where health potions aren't readily available. Stores literally sell out of them, making you track down ingredients to make your own. The inventory system is less than ideal, and the graphics are very underwhelming when compared to other 360 games like Fallout 3 or Oblivion.It's also worth saying that you need to seriously micromanage everyone. Dragon Age's controls make it easy, but it takes time to get used to pausing action every battle to tell each of your four characters who to attack and what skills to use. You have a large variety of AI routines at your disposal, for better or worse. The sooner you'll come to terms with this, the more you'll enjoy Dragon Age.Despite those faults, I find myself soldiering on, glued to Dragon Age enough to not unwrap my copies of COD:MW2 or Assassin's Creed 2. The writing is good, the gameplay -- once you get accustomed -- is really addicting, and it's a long quest that rarely gets boring. If RPGs are your thing, I suggest you check it out. Buy it new, too, as there is plenty of exclusive, single use goodies in even the standard version of the game. Can't wait for Mass Effect 2!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2009"}

{"product_name":"B00005QEFD","description":"Though it looks like a toy, don't be fooled: the Nintendo GameCube is a powerful video game console that rightly deserves its place among the other next-generation game systems. In fact, its playful, appealing design and small size (the unit is a not-quite-cubed 6 inches) aren't the only features that set it apart from the others.For starters, Nintendo has quite clearly made this a game-only machine. It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

It is affordable, small and has a lot of games catering to families and younger kids. This is not to demean it! If we had to pick only one console, the GameCube would be the one to keep.For accessories, it does not have as many cables as previous consoles, but that is a good thing - it provided all the cables we did need and eliminating excess cables keeps the price lower.The controller that is included fits well into our hands. It has a built-in rumble unit, so no external attachments are needed.The game disks are smaller and come in DVD sized cases, which keep the instruction booklet as well. This is great because, now, even used games almost always have instruction booklets because they do not get lost. Also, the GameCube discs load quickly - much more quickly than some competing consoles.The unit size is small and can be pushed into a smaller area so that it does not interfere with other objects in the room. The cables are longer so that the controllers can be further from the TV.The offers change with time, but with ours we got to choose a new game or the Game Boy Player which is a 1\" block which attaches below the GameCube, hardly adding any size at all. We chose the Player and are happy with it. It will play Game Boy Advance games that we also use with our Game Boy Advance or Advance SP units.Definitely a winner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-12-2003"}

It doesn't try to play your CD collection, run your movies, read your e-mail, or store your MP3 files. The company has concentrated its efforts on games. All the prelaunch titles we've seen play smoothly, with bright, fast graphics and great sound. Nintendo says its engineers have removed traditional bottlenecks that have, in the past, slowed down processing. New components designed by IBM and MoSys, as well as a large-capacity secondary memory cache, keep instructions moving through the system's microprocessor (MPU) at peak levels. In English: the GameCube is optimized to push speed up while pushing costs down; hence its position at the lower end of the price spectrum.The GameCube is the first Nintendo video game system to use a disc-based medium rather than cartridges for its games. Moving the software to disc media generally means lower development costs for the publishers, which, in turn, trickles down to the consumer not only in price, but also in availability and quality, as it's then easier to try out untested game ideas (Pikmin, anyone?). While most other systems likewise have their games stored on discs, the GameCube's 3-inch format is smaller than everyone else's, and is so designed to fit in a shirt pocket as much as to deter would-be software pirates.Of course, the main advantage of the GameCube is that it's the home field of one of the world's premier game designers: Nintendo. While powerhouses Electronic Arts and Sega make games for all systems (including this one), you can play Nintendo games only on a Nintendo system. And Nintendo, you might recall, has been hitting them out of the park since it started withDonkey Kong. In fact, here's a roll call of characters and series you won't find on the other consoles: Mario,Legend of Zelda,Perfect Dark, Metroid, Kirby, and, of course, Pok&#xE9;mon. A few names that the GameCube will share with the other guys: Madden, Tony Hawk, Sonic, Batman, andStar Wars.The system also comes with four built-in controller ports, so you can easily plug in extra controllers and let friends join in for the multiplayer games--it's even got a built-in handle so you can easily move it to a friend's house. It comes with two memory card slots for saving your progress through games, and there's the capacity for future expansion into the world of online gaming.In short, the GameCube isn't an all-in-one entertainment system, and neither is it the most powerful of the modern video game consoles. But for video game enthusiasts who want to stick with their favorite characters, its value cannot be beat.--Porter B.

All the games which I bought are all fantastic, and provide endless fun. However, the system itself leaves ALOT to be desired. I always thought of the Gamecube as the worst of the current three consoles, but actually owning one made me realise its one of the worst consoles ever. The Xbox Controller S is one of the best controllers ever, and the PS2 controller isn't so bad...but the Gamecube controller is horrific. Never have I seen or held such a terrible controller. It feels totally wrong and looks even worse. The original controller's cord is also terribly short. The startup screen for the system and the menu screen are also disgusting, especially when you compare them to a system like the Xbox. The system can't play DVDs or audio cds, unlike the other two competitors. Every extra capability must be purchased as an addon. There are only two memory card slots compared to Xbox's two slots PER controller. Even the power cord sucks, with its large adapter. There are a few positive points however, such as the very compact size of the system, the nice, small size of the Gamecube discs and standard 4 controller ports. However, these small extras don't make up for the absolute nonsense the actual system is. The exclusive games, however, are fantastic and make the system worth it. After all, games are why you buy a gaming system. This review was only an assessment of the actual hardware.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-28-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000ZJVDA2","reviewerName":"UziHorowitz","summary":"Mistwalker's Masterpiece","reviewText":"Lost Odyssey is easily the best role-playing game since Chrono Trigger on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. I've enjoyed many role-playing games over the years, but none of them blew me away. However, that all changed when Lost Odyssey released. Lost Odyssey is a game by Mistwalker and Feel Plus. Mistwalker is full of industry veterans that started the Final Fantasy franchise, while Feel Plus is best known as the studio formed by people who worked on the Shadow Hearts franchise on the Playstation 2. Lost Odyssey's greatest strength is its narrative. This is a beautiful game with an absolute tear jerker of a story. The music is finely crafted into the narrative to make its emotional moments have a really strong and long lasting impact on the player. There isn't any other role-playing game out there with a story as emotionally involved as Lost Odyssey. You will grow to love these characters and you'll want to see them succeed in the end. Throw in some absolutely top notch gameplay that is similar to other really good turn-based role-playing games and it's not hard to see why Lost Odyssey is such a stunner in pretty much every department. This is a journey. This is an epic masterpiece in terms of emotional storytelling. This is Lost Odyssey. Buy it and love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B001AWIP68","reviewerName":"CJC","summary":"Good addition to the series...","reviewText":"As a long time fan of the CoD series I was looking forward to this games release.  I'm happy to say that it's a pretty fun game.  I haven't yet played the multiplayer mode as I haven't finished the entire solo campaign.  I always play the solo campaigns of games before I mess with multiplayer, it's just part of my personality I guess.Anyway, The graphics of the game look very good, some of the water effects and mass destruction explosions looks very good while giving the player a sense of real action.  The AI seems to be pretty decent as well, enemies will charge you when they close enough and will find cover when being shot at as they do in all CoD games.  They've also taken the shoot through walls aspect of 4 and added them to them in as well.The only real complaint I have about 5 is the restrictiveness of the guided path.  4 really opened up the path in many areas to allow the player a better free roam and choice of path...which is the complete opposite of what they did for 3 which was to force the player down a strict path and give zero options in that regard.  CoD 5 seems to be a cross between the 3 and 4 leaning a little to 3's restrictiveness.  I do not enjoy linear path games nearly as much as I do free roam games...but not many people do.Now the weapons, they're WWII guns.  Nothing too special of course.  They did however seem to try their best to find guns that would sort of match the equivalent of CoD4 guns.  They have a sniper rifle in the game that is a lot like the 50 cal in 4. I don't remember the name but it looks a lot like and sounds like the 50.  They've also kept the add-on features of guns, some guns have bayonets, some have the ability to launch grenades, etc.  They've also added the flamethrower...a very fun addition indeed.All in all, I don't really feel this game matches exactly up with CoD4's greatness and it has everything to do with the fact that they've redone a now tired plot over again.  But if it weren't for the storyline I think CoD5 would definitely be an upward step in the series greatness instead of just keeping it level.***UPDATE***After playing the multiplayer mode quite extensively while I was sick this weekend, I found it to be somewhat enjoyable.  Sniping is more fun in this than 4 in my opinion...but that's about all this has over 4.  The maps are bigger and the tanks they brought back from 3 are a pretty cool addition.But if I spawn one more time in the middle of the enemy line I'm going to start punching holes in my walls.  Nothing is more frustrating than holding your MG on someone hitting them 3 or 4 times, having them turn around, shoot you once with a pistol...killing you, then respawning right in front of 3 or 4 enemy players with their guns already aimed at you.  I know, I brought up some other issues during that rant but this game seems to have a lot of multiplayer hit zone issues, but I'm going to leave it at just that otherwise I'll start getting annoyed.  Anyway, multiplayer is fun if even though it can be very frustrating.  It has a few more levels than 4 with a few more perks...heaven help me but I love the cocktail bombs and the bayonets.******Oh and let me please mention that there are some people that play multiplayer and suck at it so bad that they have to take advantage of some glitches in a few of the levels in order to feel like they are better than other people at one thing in their sad lives.  Please keep an eye out for those people and always record their names when you see them trying to get into the glitches as they need to be reported to Microsoft for cheating.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2008"}

I guess it was a proving ground for 343 and eventually paid off. I don't know. It's a Halo game through the eyes of an ODST unit. The non-spartan physiology add a bit of a twist to the gameplay, but all the principles remain the same. The story adds background to the covenant and ironically segways into Reach.

{"product_name":"B002I0J5FG","description":"","reviewerName":"Shane Windham \"Shane Windham, author\"","summary":"Works of art, hindered by control mechanics","reviewText":"These games have received an HD update and trophy support, but almost nothing else about them has been changed. Many gamers will love this fact. Newcomers, however, may find it less than ideal; as controlling is not streamlined by modern standards do not occur as often as today's gamers have grown used to.One undeniable thing about both games are the allure of their presentation. The ideas and the stories are unique and endearing. You will find yourself sucked into the atmosphere of both, and each will be difficult to forget for its own reasons. Much like Okami, these games are risk-takers on top of being beyond exquisitely artful in their delivery. You can normally tell these are last gen releases, even with the HD update; but that doesn't take away from their power to make an impact on the player's appreciation for just how beautifully imagined they both are.My main complaint with the collection itself has to deal with controlling. The controls are not terrible by any stretch of the imagination. They just aren't splendid either. ICO's battles are fraught with dumb AI; so the wonky controls are almost forgivable. But Shadow is so heavily dependent on the success of controlling that it's hard to overlook. The best things to keep in mind about Shadow are that inverting camera controls will make things feel more natural, and to realize that you have a stamina meter of sorts which tells you how long you can continue holding on to an enemy. Fix your camera settings, remember to let go of your enemies whenever possible, and the game will progress much smoother.Regardless of how negative some of this may seem, I still think this is one of the best values to be had on the PS3; even when purchasing new for forty dollars. You get two epic and unforgettable games, which are probably unlike anything else you've played. Familiar control issues and sparse save points dropped the score for this reviewer, but you should still plan on owning this collection; look forward to it even. Because it carries a definite \"wow\" factor, despite its shortcomings. Buy now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2012"}
{"product_name":"B003ZCH7DI","description":"","reviewerName":"GarionOrb","summary":"One of the Wii's greatest titles!","reviewText":"I'll admit.  I saw the pre-release trailers and announcements for this game and I completely dismissed it as more Wii shovelware.  I never played any of the previous Kirby games, since for some reason they just seemed to pass me by.  I knew, however, that Kirby was a pretty popular franchise so when the great reviews for Epic Yarn started pouring in I decided to give the game a try.  Boy, I'm most definitely glad I did!This game is pure joy!  And it's puzzling that it's so good because it doesn't really push any boundaries.  Most of the platforming is fairly standard, and the game itself is pretty easy.  I can't imagine that anyone will have trouble beating the game.  Why is this?  Because Kirby can't die.  Ever.  Getting hit by enemies or projectiles will result in a small push backwards, and falling down a pit will result in Kirby getting carried to the last platform.  However, simply getting to the end is not the entire point of the game.  The challenge comes in when you try to 100% every level, and even more so when you're trying to 100% a boss fight.  You see, throughout each level you'll find various gems and jewels.  Collecting them will bring up your gem score so that by the end you'll be rated either wood, bronze, silver or gold.  If Kirby \"dies\", you lose some of your gems.  You have a brief moment to collect the ones you lost, but they'll disappear fairly quickly (similar to Sonic the Hedgehog's rings).  Also, each level has three treasures to find.  Believe me when I tell you that beating a level without getting 100% of everything feels really incomplete!  You'll WANT to go back and get everything.  Also, you collect gems during boss fights as well, except that after get to gold, collecting more gems will result in unlocking extra levels.  This gets really challenging to do.  Taking all this into account, this is one content-filled game that will provide hours of entertainment!The levels themselves are fairly straightforward.  Move Kirby from the beginning to the end, while finding gems and secrets scattered throughout.  Occasionally, Kirby will transform into a vehicle of some sort (trains, UFO's, tanks, etc) which adds a bit of fun and variety to the levels.  A second player can join in at any time for some simultaneous co-op action.  In two-player mode, both players share gems, so if either one gets hit you both lose gems.  It can provide for some fun teamwork!  There's also a little village to explore with an apartment that you can decorate with all the treasures you find throughout the game.Graphically, this is one impressive Wii game!  Everything has a yarn or cloth material look to it, but it looks incredibly detailed.  I had no idea a Wii game could look this detailed in standard definition!  The music is minimalistic, but very beautiful.Obviously, this game won't be for everyone.  The game overflows with over-the-top cutesy-ness.  It's definitely geared towards younger players, but older folks who don't mind the pastel colors, the storybook presentation or the kindergarten-ish narration will find a LOT to love.  The gameplay is top notch and those who love to play a game until they've gotten every last collectible will not want to miss this.  One of the best games the Wii has to offer for sure!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}

When you do though, play it for at least a couple of hours to get used to it though.The controls are goofy and frustrating at first, but once you get used to them, you wonder why you would want to do it any other way.So, coolness and fun, I give this game 4 or 5 stars.CONS:This game just ends right in the middle of the plot. You have to buy the next 2 games to find out what is going on.This game doesn't end on a sub-plot like the HALO franchise, or any other for that matter. With most games, you expect the ending is coming and at least something gets wrapped up. It's like playing HALO half way through and then just throwing the game away.So, to play 1 actual game, you are going to have to spend darn near $200 for all 3. Again, this doesn't end really on a sub-plot either. You find out a piece of information, and then the credits role and tell you to buy the second one.So, this game was fun, but do NOT buy it.

Working in the proximity of the palace, Leonard stumbles on a plot to kidnap the enigmatic Princess Cisna. As he helps her escape he also becomes aware of his connection to a transformative power which allows him to take on the ancient shape, and harness the devastating power of the White Knight. Yet there are other elements at work here as well, including the forces of an evil wizard with powers that stretch back to the same ancient times which produced the White Knight. With the help of his friends and the power of the White Knight, these are the forces that Leonard will have to face in his quests.GameplayWhite Knight Chroniclesis a Japanese RPG (JRPG) centered around a turn-based battle system in a local single player story-driven campaign that is supported by online multiplayer functionality. Gameplay questing occurs from a third-person perspective and follows Leonard and up to three other AI companions, which can include the customizable character that players assume in multiplayer mode. Once quest members are assembled, players utilize the strengths of the overall group as a whole, and are able to switch between characters at will. Combat being turn-based, players must be able to cue up and control the actions of each character in quick sequence for each combat scenario faced. The game facilitates this via the Function Palette, located in its Battle Preparation menu, allowing players to prepare in advance a series of commands for each character to carry out. These can involve magic or weapons use and can be merged into combos. Multiple palettes can be saved, making it possible to optimize actions for specific types of enemies, and making for quick changing of commands. As with any RPG, throughout quests players accumulate experience which allows their character to level up, purchase items and abilities and generally grow stronger with an eye towards besting the increasingly challenging creatures, bosses and situations faced.Online MultiplayerAlong with a compelling single player campaign,White Knight Chroniclesalso contains an exciting online multiplayer component. Within this, up to four players can engage in more than 50 multiplayer quests, with each player creating their own unique customizable character which can be leveled up in a combined group effort, and take advantage of created items and new skills. Although unique to the online game mode, which is designed for multiplayer action, these quests can also be played alone if players wish. In addition to this functionality available in the online multiplayer mode also includes a variety of ways to interact with the widerWhite Knight Chroniclescommunity on the PlayStation 3 platform. Included in this is town building through the Georama functionality, which allows players to construct a town to their own specifications that can be populated offline with characters from throughout the single player campaign and then taken online where it serves as a base for quests hosted by players, as well as a persistent online location that other players can visit and buy items your town's population has for sale.

That being said, I'm completely glad that I rented this game instead of something else, because then I wouldn't have gotten the chance to play this!When I first put this in, I was just craving some RPG game (after playing so many non-rpg's it left me dry inside.)I didn't know what to expect, all I was thinking was: \"Why did they send this instead of Borderlands?!!\"That thought quickly dispersed. The moment you put the disc in, it installs for \"Exactly 5 Minutes,\" though I didn't count.And after you install the game, every time you play it, it asks you what language you want: English, French, or Spanish.I, myself, love the title screen. It's just New Game, Continue and Options, but the background and sound are exhilarating.It's, what I think is, the White Knight's shield, spinning slowly...It's zoomed in, that's why I say 'I think,' but the music that plays and the background just makes me feel like I'm in a giant palace, with no worries!But enough about that.I will be honest, the game's story is cliche, the mouth-and-voice sync is terrible (but I think this is because the game was made for Japan, and the English voices with the Japanese mouth movement are just terrible, their mouths will stop moving yet they will still be talking.)And this game mixes a lot of games together, Final Fantasy XII (The battle system,) Kingdom Hearts (The NPC's/Characters mostly all look like they are kids, yet still adult at the same time,) and most noticeably and importantly, Dark Cloud (The overall theme/feel.)When you play for about an hour or two you'll obviously realize the mega-obvious-nostalgia of Dark Cloud, if you've played of course.But I can't complain that this game stole anything, or that it's horribly done at that.This game makes it work!Character Creation is probably the main reason people get this game, but like other reviewers have stated, your created character has absolutely nothing to do with the story...Except look retarded in every scene you're shown in.But I don't care, as long as I can control him/battle with him and change his clothes.The main reason you can create a character is for the Online play.I've never tried Online with someone, but your character is the main character in this mode.You can build your own town, completely like Dark Cloud, and you can invite NPCs from single-player story to live in your town.The NPCs all have abilities, as in Farming, Mining, etc.Say you have 2 farmers in a house, they'll boost each others abilities, therefor selling more high-quality items in your general store.You can put shops, IE: General Stores, Weapon Shops, the same stores in single-player story.I haven't dabbled in online or the town-creation that much, because it calls for attention to the point that I want to beat the game first. (Since I want to spend my money on better armor/weapons for my party instead of for the town at this moment,) but besides that it's really fun.You can switch to one of the characters (unless their a guest) and move around with them, so you won't only be running around with your main character.Some say the story is bad, some say good, to me it's just you like it or you don't.If you don't, well you probably won't want to play this...Story Mode is just what you have to do to get your character to at least Lv. 36+, or maybe even higher (the highest level is 50 I believe). So if you don't like the Story...too bad :P.But if you do, like me, then you'll enjoy this game completely.Overall I think this game is really good, I don't want to say anything else though, for some reason.I rented this, and now I really, really want to buy it!And all the negative things people are saying, I will just correct everything in one go:--The character you create has nothing to do with the story, except for being able to play with him/her, and is primarily used for Online play.--The game doesn't end after you play for about 3 hours and beat that certain mission, it's just showing the credits, and it resumes gameplay when it's done, so don't give up!--By the way, I don't talk about graphics because, well, they don't matter to me...They look like that of Kingdom Hearts for the most part, with terrible mouth movement and voice sync (For English translation at least.) And if buying a game is decided partly on graphics to you, then maybe you should save your money entirely and buy a movie, those graphics are top notch!PROS: -Character Customization (The armor you buy/find actually appears on any character you put them on)-Skills (Some say its plain and nothing simple, but you can choose what skills you want to learnDivine Magic, Elemental Magic, Staff Skill, Sword Skill, Long Sword Skill, Axe Skill, Bow Skill, Lance Skill)-Combo Creation (Once you learn how to create and execute the combos, it gets really fun)-Characters (Some say they are cheesy/boring, but I like them, and I like side-characters even better)CONS: -Collision: I don't like part of this, because you can't go through teammates...You might wonder why this matters, butonce a battle is over, they all just put their weapons up and stand there, and if you try to run forward, the now-fadingaway monster and all the standing teammates are impassable, therefor you'll find yourself running backwards and thenaround everything, and if you back up into a corner and your teammates follow you closely enough, the only way you canget out is to switch to one of the other characters blocking you and move out of the way.-That's about it.Go buy this! At least rent it!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-08-2010"}

Fraley","summary":"Wow, really thought it would be better","reviewText":"I had been watching this game for a while, viewing the videos and reading all the information i could.  I was really interested and hoped it would be good.  I pre-ordered here at Amazon because of release day delivery and a gift card.  When I received the game and started playing I noticed a few things right away that were bad:1.  Challenges are to easy.  Unlocked the achievements fairly quickly.2.  The graphics are nowhere near as good as I thought they would be.  Was really looking forward to the art style and even the cut scenes are average.  And textures do not load right sometimes.3.  The lag online is pretty bad at times.4.  The campaign and multiplayer are the same (this is a good and bad thing)The issue is I finished the campaign on hard without much challenge.  The choke points make it pretty easy.  For example I was playing a resistance campaign with a 15 minute time and all I had to do was stay on the turret to win.  Same place for 15 minutes and it was over.  The bot AI is pretty stupid.  I was hacking a point and they would not come over to the room.  I took all the enemies out twice and they still did not come in to help.  I died and by the time I had spawned and returned I had to reset and re-hack the whole thing.  This took a while so I spent a good 8-9 minutes doing this.  I have also noticed that the bots can have their back to you and do an instant 180 and kill with 1 shot.To be fair this is an online team game in most respects.  Sure they have a campaign if you can call it that.  That is were this game is at least somewhat fun.  But completing the same objectives over and over gets old fast.  And some maps are very unbalanced.  The defending team will have a major advantage in some of these places, sometimes to a fault.The customization is pretty good in terms of classes.  I do not care about the avatar dress-up part so I will not say anything about that.  As for the classes they seem pretty good.  With a few more good maps and a way to easily get a whole team into the same match this game could be a very fun game.  I really like how they let you change classes but not characters.  If you build your character as an engineer focused character then changing to a medic, operative, or soldier may cause you to lose some of those purchases abilities.  This means that a well balanced team would need to come in prepared with everyone playing their roll and sticking to a class for best effect.Overall this game would be better had it been polished more.  I may come back and edit my review after a patch and some of that free dlc they talked about.  That could make this a much better game.  As it is I would say wait on this game unless you just have to have it.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2011"}

Durs \"ddurs\"","summary":"Better than I expected","reviewText":"After reading the mixed reviews I was apprehensive to play this game, but when the price dipped to $10 I had nothing to lose. I thought it was much better than I expected it would be. I have played just about every shooter out there -- and sure its no Bioshock or Black Ops, but the bottom line is that its entertaining. There are plenty of levels, weapons, and enemies. I found there to be plenty of challenge to the levels and the bosses to be tough enough.One important feature to me is diversity (which is why I was disappointed with Doom: please not another long, dark hallway!!). Duke offers different environments -- including the ability to drive -- the best part of the game is driving over the baddies. Like in past games you are shrunk down in various levels which adds even more diversity.The graphics are a bit disappointing for a game made in 2011, but overall it gave me exactly what I wanted: many hours of entertaining gameplay. The game is fun -- I would recommend it if you are looking for an entertaining game with plenty of challenge and opportunity to blow stuff up and shoot baddies!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-01-2012"}

In Nightfire you escape from a Tokyo skyscraper, ally with beautiful women, and even go a New Year's Eve sniping rampage from a helicopter along the streets of Paris. It's exotic missions like these that make Nightfire so pleasing to play, and it IS the best Bond game for G-Cube, X-Box, or the PS2. The storyline is thrilling and easy enough to follow, unlike some classic 007 films. The multiplayer modes are fun and there are many of them, although some are stupid like the Goldeneye Strike mode. This isn't really a problem if you just stick to modes like D-Match or Assault modes. The locales in MP mode are cool as well, with everything you'd expect from a James Bond game. You can play in Fort Knox to even having a shootout onboard Atlantis. These make MP especially awesome on the Nightfire adventure! Single Player can carry its weight alone. You will travel around from Tokyo to Paris to exotic jungles, even to the moon of all places! Another plus to SP is the fact that the driving sequences are back, and they look MUCH better than the ones in Agent Under Fire and they are MUCH more fun to play. The graphics are awesome, and now EA has incorporated some Squaresoft-like cinematic portions that make this adventure even more exciting! The controls are very smooth, and the game is a blast to play. It is also one of the few games that has a Single Player mode that is better than the superb multiplayer mode. This is the best Bond since Goldeneye on the N64(we've all played that)and it is way better than the last 007 game, Agent Under Fire. For any 007 fans out there, rejoice for there is a new, better, and totally out of control Bond game to satisfy your needs! My Rating-8.7!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-06-2003"}

I decided to purchase the game when I saw a few previews of its muliplayer.  Unfortunately, I've been extremely disappointed.In single player mode I experienced the same problems as many others.  There is one level in the game where you are supposed to follow a squad member, but he does nothing.  You are required to do all of the work.  That is a consistent theme in this game, useless AI squad members, but in that level it is particularly frustrating.  Eventually I made it through, and overall I would have to say I had a good time with the single player despite its short length.  When the sequel is eventually released, I hope to rent this game.Multiplayer mode is a complete disaster.  I wanted huge 32 player contests where the action is nonstop, and focused on attaining objectives.  Instead, the only mode that I can play is skirmish mode, which switches between an objective based system and the utterly pointless team deathmatch.  When trying for the 32 player objective game, I can never get enough players to initiate a session.  If I leave the lobby up and wait, it times me out.  So essentially, only one of the six multiplayer modes work.  I didn't pay $60 to get 1/6 multiplayer functionality.  If I could, I would bring this game back and hold onto the money until Battlefield 3 comes out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2011"}
{"product_name":"B0016BVYA2","reviewerName":"Vynny \"Vynrod\"","summary":"A little balance would help","reviewText":"Bioshock 2 - ahh so much promise; you play as a big daddy, there's new weapons, plasmids, big sisters and you can go outside of rapture's realm into the murky floor of the ocean.Of course the reality here is it's the same game. Full stop. Sure it's tweaked a little and jigged somewhat but it's still Bioshock 1 and it feels little more than a user-mod instead of a full-priced game. In all fairness I just can't applaud the game makers' inability to step outside the box and advance the franchise's content by giving us more than a small upgrade. Frankly things have kind of taken a step back too - there's almost no shades of metaphorical color here, it's all black, Blam blam blam in-your-face action. No chance to take a breath and sit back and relax for a moment and enjoy the location. And with visuals like the ones found in Rapture it deserves to be savored momentarily, not run through quickly because another big sister or one of the randomly spawned brutes are after you (for the thousandth time). Audio is let down by the many pre-recorded messages which quickly become a royal pain. Main sound effects in-game are lowered in volume during these frequent and annoying playbacks and I lost count the times I got attacked because I could only hear some taped voice instead of the splicer coming up behind me. It added nothing to the game that a text-based log book wouldn't have achieved. I guess the makers had been playing System Shock 2 at some point, but they really didn't nail the point of such messages and placed far too many of them in the game.The mechanic of dying in BS2 is also faulty. You die because you're not capable of beating whatever hard part of the game you're at and so you return to the nearest Vita-chamber. The problem is you now have a lot less ammo, less fuel for your drill, less eve and 50% of a single vial of health... and you still have to go back and fight the guys that you just lost against! This becomes especially obvious when a little sister is harvesting Adam; if you die you have to start over despite having lots most of your equipment in the last go around. So you roam around looking to stock up on inventory only to be plagued by spawning splicers in places you thought you'd cleared out. I'd just rather have my character die and reload than the current broken system of regeneration. A final stab in the eye was just as my character was getting strong enough to take on major bad guys with relative ease and I could feel things turning my way... the game ended!Of course there's moments of brilliance - the water effects are incredible and wandering outside (brief and pointless as it is) is beautiful. The part where you play as a little sister is exactly what I wanted from this sequel, sadly it's far too short. But it's these great moments though that highlight the problems that I feel BS2 has - ultimately, the developers should have taken everything down a notch not up, let the tension build and surprise us at the critical moment......instead we get never ending zombies to blast away at.

His performance is so convincing. This disc includes the original Riddick episode, Escape From Butcher Bay as well. The two chronicles are very similar in gameplay design. In fact, there isn't much variation to speak of. The mechanics are the same, and both are essentially stealth/action. Butcher Bay features a more compelling plot in my opinion, but Athena is most certainly worth your time. These games really shine when is comes to setting a particular mood and atmosphere. They really suck you into the experience. The voice work is amazing. Each character is realistic and sympathtic in their own unique way. The in game map system is rather...well...terrible in Butcher Bay. And Dark Athena doesn't even have one. This is typical of developer starbreeze. I suppose they prefer that you figure it out on your own. There is a rather steep learning curve, and the difficulty can be rather punishing.

I will list all of the pros and cons. firstly there is a factory defect on some of the hard copy cd's that you buy, on disc one. what this means is it will instal to about 15% then stop saying there is a data loop and wont instal any further. a few people that ive talked to said they had the same bug. its not on every single copy of tera just a few here and there so be aware of this. i had to down load the game from the tera web site then use the key that came with the game i bought.with that aside here is my review.PRO'S1. the game is very very stable, i have seen virtually no bugs or errors so far with the game itself.2. the game is extreamly large, out of all the mmos i have played it has the most land mass i have seen, so much so that they have 280 speed mounts, and the flight paths use teleporters to get you to point B faster.3. its beutiful X 100000000000 i have never seen such beuty put into a game.4. the monsters have a great AI they respond well to the players actions.5. the best feature, the game requires skill, there is no tab targeting in this game and it playes like a 3rd person shoter.Cons.1. see the issue stated above, down loading the game using the stream down loader is the best way to get the game however.2. you cant use the mouse to click skills on the task bar you have to macro everything. this is a bonus to those who have key pads or like to hunt and peck on a keyboard but there is a learning curve to get by.All in all the game is really fun to play and if you buy the game from amazon / where ever and use the key that comes with it even if you are F2P you get the founder benifits. this game is a must for those that want to play a game with great graphix and skill needed. i highly recomend it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2013"}

There it was, at the start of Xbox Live, handing out coffee and biscuits to gamers, leading us round the online world that would consume our lives and sever relationships in the coming months. The second title was more glamorous, keeping in with the gritty tactical warfare that we've come to expect from Tom Clancy games, only with prettier graphics. Much like that good looking yet academic cousin we all hate and envy.And suddenly, there I was, standing at the top of a multi-storey car park with a rocket launcher slung over my shoulder and a smoke grenade in my hand. I'd already practised moving, strafing, taking cover, leaning and shooting before being shot at by an APC. Running behind a smoke screen, I was briefed by some guy in a helicopter to come up here and take out the armoured vehicle in order to move onto the next step of training. And with one stab of the trigger, all that was left was a burning lump of metal two storeys down.Command a group of 3 soldiers, take out a group of resistance, control an APC whilst under cover to blow up another vehicle, run and duck into trenches and assist the team in clearing the area before running full pelt for a hovering helicopter to get the hell out of there. Cue the whining guitar solo of an incredibly bad version of All Along the Watchtower by Everlast, and I'd just learned the basics of Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter. Welcome to the Xbox 360.It's the year 2013. Deployed to Mexico City on a joint operation to capture Mexican military officials involved in illegal technology sales with Columbian FARC rebels, things get hairy when Mexican soldiers hi-jack the public signing of the NAJSA (North American Joint Security Agreement) and capture the Canadian, American and Mexican Presidents. You're thrown into the action as the meeting falls apart, and it's up to you and your comrades to think on your feet to save the world. Again. We should be getting a little tired of all these Mexican and Columbian terrorists threatening to take over the planet in most of our videogames, especially with all the talk of wars and terrorists on TV, but when Tom Clancy gets involved things usually get interesting, and GRAW is perhaps the pinnacle achievement on his CV.There's little point in jumping around and avoiding the fact that the visuals here are just simply gorgeous. I'm a little scared to rave on about graphics in Xbox 360 games, what with all the power behind my wooden-patterned faceplate almost ensuring that all games will look kick-arse, but Ghost Recon: AW looks absolutely sensational. Mexico City has never looked so stunning, with streets detailed right down to curb stones, litterbins, postal boxes, public phones and foliage. Of course, the real purpose of these objects is to give much needed shelter, however temporary, during a gun fight. Parked cars are dotted around the streets, all with full-breakable windows and pop-able tires, so you're never safe when in hiding.The first level, for example, I'm on a highway exit ramp, slowly edging my way down behind cars. Zooming in on enemy soldiers patrolling the streets below, the graphics aren't strained, and I'm watching this guy slowly bore himself to tears wandering about, occasionally kicking stones before slamming to the ground with a bullet in his ear. Better still, a few moments after sending him to the spirit in the sky, I'm crouching next to the building where some of my stray bullets landed, and the bullet holes are still there. There's a cool puffing effect when bullets hit buildings and surfaces as debris is kicked up, much like when you see helicopters firing in films. Running across the street, a guy on higher ground empties a magazine in my direction, and all I see is lines of debris fly up in my face as I narrowly make it to cover. Did I mention that getting shot in the head is an instant kill? No? Well, you've got to watch yourself around the streets of Mexico, because Rambo certainly isn't welcome and wouldn't last past the first 5 seconds of the intro. It pays to plan ahead with the handy map allocated to the back button, shoot when the enemy is reloading and get team-mates to apply suppressive fire.Enemy AI is generally impressive, especially the way when you shoot into a platoon they all scramble for cover and fire back. Some fire blindly as others toss grenades, you can hear commanders yelling instructions and snipers will run for vantage points. Staying in one place just isn't an option, because you'll soon be out-gunned. The problem I found is there are still instances, although few and far between, when enemies will run at you from a blind side and pump lead into your body from point blank range. Surely the point of the game is to fire on sight, and not at touching distance?That's the single player mode though, and as fun and challenging as it is, a candle simply cannot be held to the multiplayer mode on Live. Up to 16 players can team up against or with each other with 8 a side, on search and rescue missions, capturing flags and territories or the bog-standard and much loved frag fest, in teams or every man for himself. The graphics still stand as strong as ever online, in particular one level at night on a tanker in the pouring rain is quite simply breathtaking. A few of us here at Thunderbolt Games met up and played for a few hours, this level one of them, and marvelled at its excellence. The sheer attention to detail is astounding, as when you enter a pipe for cover, bullets ring around in it and shake the screen uncontrollably.There are plenty of weapons to choose from to cater each profession, from riflemen to grenadiers, with various forms of sniper rifles, machine guns, rifles, and grenade launchers. This allows teams online to set up battle plans from the off instead of hunting down particular weapons on the map, and if you ever fancy a change then simply swap for any gun lying on the ground. Two firing rates, from one bullet at a time to fully automatic cater for pot shots from cover or burst fire for cramped locations, and thanks to Clancy's involvement, reloading and changing guns is realistic. No-more magazines lasting for hours, you can empty a clip on a platoon is mere seconds, then sit behind a wall yelling expletives as the enemy return fire and you're still scrambling to reload. It puts an emphasis on team play, with certain members firing when others are reloading to form an unstoppable force. It's all fun at the end of the day.There's not much more I can say without delving deep into the story and ruining things, or spend another 5 paragraphs telling how cool online play is. Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter is stunning, exciting, fun and exhilarating to play, a great example of the 360's power and online service and an essential title for all Xbox 360 owners. See you online.Over and out.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2006"}

Since LIVE has added Twitter and Facebook, entering text is becoming standard on Xbox 360. Unfortunately, the Xbox 360's on-screen keyboard is annoying to use with the controller.The device snaps onto a controller and uses the headphone interface to communicate with the console. I thought it required a little more pressure than I expected to get it to snap into place. I also can't imagine trying to remove it from a controller, which I would do only if necessary. I think you'd probably have to pry it apart with a screwdriver.The device is backlit, which of course means it drains the controller battery faster than usual, but the device is only backlit when in-use.

That word is loved and hated by many, but Halo did help define the FPS genre and FPS multiplayer for consoles. If it weren't for Halo we wouldn't have regenerating health, or solid FPS multiplayer, but Reach perfects the Halo multiplayer in many ways, but before we get there let's dive into the single player campaign.Reach has you playing as the generic Noble 6 who is part of other numbered Noble team members. You can create your character this time around, and swap out different armor parts, but you have to advance your rank and earn credits through multiplayer and playing the campaign. This is more of a gimmick and doesn't do anything than to add filler to the already bloated series. After the disappointing ODST we get another campaign with more nobodies instead of Master Chief. The game is set before the first one so you are experiencing the first contact with the Covenant. You are just hopping around Reach trying to save the planet only to realize you can't, and then you have to  use desperate measures to save the human race, but the story doesn't get interesting until the final cut scene (surprised?) and it's a shocker.The game is pretty much another recycling of the same Covenant aliens with better graphics. The same grunts, elites, brutes, and even vehicles; you name it. Is it ever exciting? Maybe in the very beginning because it's been awhile since the last Halo, but after the first couple chapters you just want the game to end already. The game just adds everything we've seen since 2001, and even takes away dual wielding which is good or bad depending on how you look at it. There are maybe one or two new weapons and vehicles, but everything's been recycled so much I can't tell! They couldn't even add an iron sight option since the left trigger is no longer used for a second weapon? C'mon!Other than that the mission structure is the same kill this wave, press this button, defend this place, backtrack and re-kill Covenant that suddenly appeared again. It goes on for ten chapters! There are a couple of space flight missions that are kind of fun, but it's not enough to keep you from yawning on the rehashed crap. Sure the campaign is solid and challenging, but it's not as spectacular as say Halo 2. At least the flood are absent which is a Godsend!But after slogging through the campaign you're going to come back for multiplayer right? Right. Which is the best the series has with tons of modes and playlists, and all the modes we've grown to love and a mix of favorite maps from past Halo campaigns. I'm not a Halo multiplayer vet so I can't tell you every tiny change, but I know enough that saving every match, sharing with friends, picking through their highlights, and so on is a lot of fun, and the Forge mode has been re-done to be a little more intuitive, but it's still no LittleBigPlanet, or say, TimeSplitters. The new daily challenges are the biggest incentive to come back since they advance your rank. They change daily and are a lot of fun to aim for, but the only thing you can do is unlock stuff in the armory with this, and that's not too exciting on its own, but it's better than nothing.Reach is also the best looking game, but it still doesn't look up to par, and this is sad being Microsoft's flagship series. The game looks good technically, but artistically it's kind of bland, but there a lot more open environments, and not too many indoor ones, so it's a lot more to look at this time around. All the same sounds are recycled as well, so you know what to expect in that department. With a so-so story, characters you can't get attached to, and a great multiplayer suite, maybe Reach should have been multiplayer only? Sure, no one would miss the campaign, but it's there. If you want to play through it again go online and play it co-op even if you have to, or try the hardest difficulty. Actually scratch that it's almost impossible.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

Ghosts was horrible in every way as I mention in my review of it.Black Ops 2 is almost the exact opposite, taking basically the exact same stupid scenario (future with America fighting Spanish-speaking enemies) and actually making it fun.  The missions are actually brimming with excitement and color instead of the same dull dismal gray and browns.  And tying it in to Black Ops, we get flashback missions set in the 80s, taking us to Vietnam, Angola, Afghanistan, and others I don't know yet because I haven't completed it.  It somehow manages to make elements of the dreadfully stupid story from the first game seem like an important piece of backstory here.Adding on to the fun is a Strike Force mode which runs alongside (and is a part of) the story mode, where you basically command small groups of soldiers and future-y mechs and drones.  Compared to Ghosts, which had half of one mission with you playing as a dog.The dialogue is all Hollywood and blazingly stupid much of the time, but at the very least the voice actors seem to be having fun with it, rather than grittily gritting out their gritty manly man lines like in Ghosts about how manly man they are to be the manliest baddest gritty fighting men of men-dom in MURRICA.  It's a great relief to see an Angolan general leading a charge with a machete and chomping scenery like a professional ham.The multiplayer is basically more of the same, but the maps are so much more colorful and fun to look at and run through than any of the dull dreary bland gray and brown maps from Ghosts.  It's also full of ridiculous new weapons and gadgets and killstreaks and stupid-looking personalized emblems for players to make.I haven't played much of the Zombie mode, but what I have experienced thus far is disappointing.

Please Buy this!","reviewText":"I was a fan of the original, but just barely bought the sequel because I had Metroid Prime... Metroid will always win out in priorities, but Sega fans and Xboxers should buy this game without hesitation.Shenmue 2 is the sequel to the sleeper Dreamcast hit that debuted at the end of the Dreamcast's life, in fact it was the last Dreamcast game I bought, and it is to this day my favorite DC title simply because this game is a very versatile title. There is no genre that this game series does not cover at some point. Ryo has to learn new skills, and master them, like RPGs, he has to gather clues and information collect items, etc, like RPGs, there's a deep and compelling story, like RPGs, there's mini games galore, exploration, adventure, fighter game type action (similar to the Virtual Fighter Engine.) There's so much going on in this game, its part sim, part RPG, part adventure, part fighter... How could someone not enjoy it? Especially since many of the flaws of the original game have been fixed? Lost? You can easily find someone to show you around. Broke? Part time jobs, though I don't recommend gambling... I lost over $1,000 that way, ironically right after I had won that much! All this in the midst of what is at its core one of the most comprehensive and beautiful epic stories of our day. I've been enthralled by the story of the game, but sadly sales of this remarkable game have been less that stellar. The game is selling so poorly that there may not be a Shenmue 3, and the story is far from over. It isn't fair that such an artistic and beautiful game like this be passed over without so much as a second glance. I implore all Xboxers out there, please save Shenmue and at least give this game a look. There's a movie included with the game that summarizes the plot of the first game, although the movie does not do justice to the original game itself, which has a great deal more to it, it will still let you know what you need to know to get by story wise in Shenmue 2, and in all honesty Shenmue 2 has far fewer flaws. Many people found some aspects of the original tedious, like having to wait around for hours on end for an event, but thankfully this one allows you to fast forward to the appropriate time, rather than seeking out stuff to do. Because Sega and AM2 addressed so many of the flaws of the first game it is well worth it to pick this title up, even if you haven't played through the original. Just watch the movie first and you'll be fine. PLEASE BUY THIS GAME! Don't let this masterpiece fade into oblivion... imagine if 24 were cancelled midseason and you'd know how I feel about there not being a Shenmue 3.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2003"}

The only game so far this year that is worth it's day one price tag. It is very challenging at first, but never cheap difficult and dying is a learning experince with penalty of course. It has very addicting gameplay, but isn't for everyone.The narration or storyline is weak and gameplay is the main attraction. Random button mashing won't work and some tactical approach is needed. The same tactic won't work for all encounters either. Some encounters will be easier for casters while some easier for melee.Online play isn't consistent for coop and summoning doesn't always work. Finding summon signs is difficult varying based on covenants. Early on it wasn't a problem finding help, but half way through my first playthrough trying to find summon signs became more difficult and PVP invasions were frequent. Patch 1.05 is supposed to have a lot of fixes in general.The CE packaging is nice and for the same price as release day it was a great pre-order bonus.

So, they definitely do not have problems with all new televisions since mine is well under 2 years old, a newer technology being an LED television, and they work very well.All I did was set the PS2 to component settings in the setup, then plugged the cables in and everything worked perfectly.  I was actually surprised how much better things looked.  I tested it out on Bully since that game is one of the worst looking on my television.  Now the graphics are crisp and clear, well as clear as they can be on a 10 year old console.Moral of the story, $5 is worth the risk.

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"Michael Corona \"Nemesis Legion\"","summary":"Combat re-evolved... you decide","reviewText":"Halo 2 - Circa 2004GOOD:- Play over Xbox-Live (and has downloadable content)- Really balanced gameplay- Graphics look great (Doom 3/Half Life 2 quality)- Use two handguns at once (action movie style)- Make or edited your own multiple player matches, and even play them online- Considered an instant Classic to many Video Gamers today- A.I. is challenging but not overpowering- Total upgrade over the original, which was considered a classic by manyBAD:- \"To be continued ending\" did not play well with the fans- Sometimes gameplay can get a little repetitive- Lack of real variety in enemies- Liner level design- Gameplay wise not too much has changed since the originalIF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- Sci-Fi military FPS where you fight off an alien race who wants you dead, similar to Starship Troopers, Aliens (Alien 2).- Play as an enemy trooper in some levels- Only get to carry 2 weapons at a time (but if using two handguns, three at a time)- Drive vehicles, such as tanks jeeps and alien spacecraft- Online play over Xbox-Live also system link and spilt screen available- Co-op play (only on system link or spilt screen)GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Halo- Doom 3- Area 51- Star Wars: Republic CommandosADDITIONAL NOTES:- There is also a Special edition of this game, which comes with some behind the scenes stuff- Note when you play online you never really get to pick and choose who you (or your team) versus in the matches, the Xbox dose almost all the setting up, some like this others hate it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2005"}

Just Cause 2 is what I'd call the latest incarnation of the sandbox game. It is based on a fictional island nation in Southeast Asia, where you are looking for a rogue agent. Your task is to get in with the local revolutionaries and understand the big picture in Panau.Main PointsPositive-Insanely large, multi-faceted open world-Many different vehicles; planes, tanks, helicoptors, bikes, cars etc-Graphics are generally good and very believable-Pretty large weapons cache-Grappling hook and parachute makes the game feel like a 007 movie-Black market feature allows you to purchase vehicles and weapons anywhere on the islandNegative-Game is difficult even on casual-Ammo goes quickly, leaving you on a constant hunt for bullets (and health)-Main storyline is really short, probably 7-8 hours-Many sidequests and challenges are cookie-cutter and can get repetitive-Vehicles are far from realistic i.e. cars don't handle well, planes are slowMap - 9 of 10The size of the playable area of Just Cause 2 is mind-bendingly large. It is claimed to be 400 square miles according to the scale. And I'm inclined to believe it. The map is so diverse, expansive and realistic. There are numerous airports, military bases, settlements, skyscrapers and cityscapes to name a few. In fact, there are 368 distinct locations to explore on Panau. Topography is impressive as well, including hundreds of miles of coastline, mountains, deserts, rivers, jungles and even a Zeppelin which has a night club underneath. My only real qualm with the map is that it is so big that even with planes it will take you a good 10 minutes to traverse the full map. This makes use of a car almost pointless.Gameplay 7 of 10As an agent for some secret US security team you are basically the best at what you do, which is apparently cause havoc. You're equipped with two very important items: a grappling hook and an infinite number of parachutes attached to your back. Any number of things can be achieved with the parachute/grappling hook combo. You can shoot far away from yourself and pull out the parachute launching yourself into the air. You can scale a mountain with only the hook. You can attach the hook to enemies pulling them towards you. It allows for a very creative gaming experience. This is what separates Just Cause 2 from other similar sandbox games. In fact it makes me think of a James Bond movie every time I jump out of a plane.It's clear, however that the developers fully intended for you to do A LOT of piddling around the country, because there are only seven main storyline missions. The number of sidequests with the local guerrillas is probably around 100. These take maybe 10-15 minutes each. The problem with the sidequests is there are so many that they start to run together and can get really repetitive. If you really want to explore in depth (and get the achivements), you'll go to each settlement and cause chaos. This includes destroying any number of government installations such as fuel tanks, SAM sites, statues, radars, generators - you get the picture. A bunch of achievements are associated with \"finishing\" a settlement. This means getting all the parts located in the settlement and destroying everything necessary.My biggest problem with the game is definitely the difficulty of the game, which is considerable in my opinion. There are four levels of difficulty and I'm on the lowest one - casual. On most shooter games, the lowest level of difficulty means that I'll never die. And I've been killed at least a dozen times by enemies. You'll be swarmed constantly. That's not the ridiculous part either. I've been killed that many times with the fifth level of armor equipped. It appears that even though I've leveled my armor, that it really doesn't provide any extra protection. The same thing seems to happen with the guns. Leveling them up is so marginal, that you'll have to take the weapon to the max level to notice the difference. What really bothers me is this: you have four levels of heat or your wanted level. The number of guys that attack you isn't based your heat level. You'll face basically the same amount of enemies on level 1 as on level 4. The only real difference on the higher levels is that they'll pursue you more.Vehicles 7 of 10This part of the game definitely needed more work. Though there are 104 different vehicles including planes (some armed), tanks, helicopters and cars. Many of them have control problems. Sports cars are touchy to the point of being almost impossible to drive at high speeds. And the weight of the vehicles is far from realistic as even hitting a small bump could send your vehicle hurling end over end. That being said, there is a great variance of the types of vehicles you can drive and what can be done to them. One of the more impressive parts of the game was the ability to upgrade vehicles and weapons via the Black Market. As you go through the game you'll find vehicle parts and weapon parts which can be used to increase speed, handling, acceleration etc. But only the vehicles on the Black Market list can be upgraded, which is less than 20 total.Along with that, the air vehicles are astonishingly slow. I figured out that the fastest plane on the game will only do about 250 mph. You might say it's fine for a game, but until you see the size of the map, you won't understand.Graphics 7 of 10Visuals on the people in Just Cause 2 are average, probably at best. But the rest of the map is gorgeous. Textures are very detailed and have the brilliance of a plethora of colors. Water in particular has a reflective quality I've only seen in a few other games. In fact, the ocean floor is littered with rocks, seaweed and reefs. The most amazing part about the graphics is that there are no loading times while you're just walking around the island. Animation is very smooth and for the most part realistic.ConclusionJust Cause 2 takes the size of a sandbox to levels never before reached. It is a fun mess around game where you could drop hours just exploring or just do a couple of missions and quit. The sheer size of the map is something that anyone who's into sandbox games should see. So here's the gist of it: very good weapons cache, ability to upgrade vehicles and weapons, grappling hook and parachute make the game quite unique, tons of stuff to do and beautiful scenery as well. Unfortunately, the sidequests can get repetitive and the difficulty will definitely turn more casual gamers away. Also, most of the non-flying vehicles seem almost superfluous because of the size of the map. So it's not a perfect game by any means, but has probably a good 50-70 hours of playtime which not a whole lot of games can say they have.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2010"}

The characters have their own unique personalities and make their own decisions throughout the course of the game, which is rare in a lot of RPGs. I can appreciate the monotony of the turn-based battles as a break from always having to have quick reflexes in their action-RPG counterparts. There are also a large variety of spells that your character can learn, especially if you change the character's class to cleric and other such classes. You can also have a more powerful warrior if he is under the \"warrior\" or \"fighter\" class. There is no other RPG that replicates the medieval beauty such as this one that I have found; I can only find those kinds of RPGs on the SNES or NES.

He went on various wars and missions throughout his entire life as he's a soldier nicknamed Wolverine and later on in his life, he becomes the subject of an experiment that makes his bones with claws metal from adamantium and becomes a cold blooded killing machine who hurts enemies, fights his big brother Sabretooth (Voiced by Leive Schereiber) and must fight with various mutant enemies to get to William Stryker who has some mutants hold up in an island.One of the best X-Men games ever as i believe it's the most satisfying of the bunch next to X-Men 2 for Genesis or Arcade X-Men, it's also a huge improvement over the attempts to bring Wolverine solo on game like the NES game for example. This is a hack-slash God-of-War style game that brings Wolverine into M-rated territory unlike in the comics as there's tons of gore and slicing galore much like how PS2's The Punisher game was.It's not too difficult but quite enjoyable and has terrific graphics, i should say that every gamer who loves X-Men should enjoy this adaptation of 2009's movie as i should say it's one of those rare movie-based games that don't blow. The combat is outstanding as it's true to the character's combat moves and the battles are just brain-blowing as you even get rage abilities when fighting bosses and regeneration like in the comics/movies of the character.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2011"}

I enjoy this game, and I am still working my way through the entire story.  It's a pretty long game, and probabaly won't be finished in one sitting.  You cannot just run through the game.

{"product_name":"B004XIQMS4","description":"","reviewerName":"dreamcastluvr \"Born-again Gamer\"","summary":"Very entertaining despite a few flaws","reviewText":"I don't play a lot of Kinect games. Not because I'm lazy, but I don't think the technology is quite to the level it needs to be at to have an above-average experience. We have the Dance Central games, the Kinect Adventures, and the Hip-Hop Experience; all of which have pretty good detection controls and are more accurate than not in reading movements. Yet despite all the lighting adjustments and re-calibrations, there are still times where movements are erroneously detected or not detected at all.This is where creatively ambitious games like &#34;Rise of Nightmares&#34; are short-changed. The movements are mostly accurately detected, but then there are times when you get stuck in a corner, trying to escape by furiously twisting your shoulders with your one foot behind you while the camera stubbornly continues to bump against the wall. Or when fighting the final boss, you get wedged up in a cliff crevice that prevents your electric fireballs from reaching the boss's hit box.But the occasional frustration brought by the Kinect controls thankfully did not overshadow what I found to be a fun little macabre adventure. The eerie environments and mutilated enemies are varied and very well done. There are classic horror elements mixed with science-fiction fantasy. I saw quite a few similarities in plot and design between this game and Sega's earlier zombie games such as House of the Dead and Zombie Revenge. The characters you encounter range from the creepy yet intriguing to walking clich&eacute;s. The story is ridiculous and, at times, outright silly (think man's head on Chihuahua&#8217;s body) and seems to just continue on unraveling with even more outrageous elements the farther you get. There are some clever moments where it makes you think the game is about to end with a climactic scene, but then throws you into yet another stage. The final boss battle is so removed from the original premise that it feels like they might've gone a bit too far into the absurd. I felt like I was in some weird dimension that was a hodgepodge of Alice in Wonderland, Dune, Tremors, and Street Fighter(!).But I would be lying if I said it wasn't fun. Apart from punching and kicking your undead foes, you also get lots of fun little weapons to slice and dice them. There are lots of 'jump' moments too that require you to jump back or side to side to avoid spikes, saws, and spears coming at you.My play-through lasted about 3.5 hours. That's not bad for only sixteen bucks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2014"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J4NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Ammy_Evaluator","summary":"Sony hits it out of the park ... well almost","reviewText":"In a nutshell - the Move brings the motion tracking of the Wii to the awe-inspiring graphics engine of the PS3. It's enough to make one salivate at the possibilities.Please note that I'm rating this primarily from a family/kid oriented perspective (given how we use it in our home), and not as a hard core individual gamer. This is just my opinion - for what it's worth - and I don't intend to offend anyone's sensibilities. My intent is not to stoke a PS3 vs. Wii war, and I'm just using the Wii as a comparison point, given my personal experience with both systems.While I was an early Wii adopter, most of my game investments have been for the PS3 (Bioshock 1 & 2, Infamous, Fallout 3, IL2 Sturmovik, Valkyria Chronicles, ...), primarily for the depth of gameplay and graphics that it makes possible - especially on large screen televisions.Well, the Move signals that the PS3 has finally caught up with the Wii and in many ways has actually surpassed it.Unfortunately, though the implementation of the Move is technologically a 5-star, the fun quotient for this particular game is closer to a 3-star - especially when a kid-oriented audience is concerned.What is awesome about the Move?########################1. The Playstation Eye Camera actually follows the bright light at the end of the controller, so is able to sense the minutest movements in all three dimensions. It is actually fairly uncanny how well it tracks your movements. This brings an air of realism to games that is sometimes unreal!2. The accompanying games are well executed and quite bug free - a huge feat in itself. In addition, the games seem to have an amazing amount of physics realism that really begins to get challenging at harder difficulty levels. For instance, with archery you need to consider the parabolic trajectory of your arrows which gets progressively more important as the targets move farther out from you.3. The motion controller acts as a navigation controller so you don't need your DualShock PS3 controller. Press the \"T\"rigger button, and then use horizontal/vertical gestures to navigate the PS3's XMB interface.What bothers me about the starter bundle?#############################1. There isn't a single game that can be played simultaneously by a family of 4. I remember very fondly the family tennis games with the Wii - but that's not going to happen here. The only games that support 4 players, require each player to take turns in sequence (i.e., Bocce Ball and Disc Golf).It's also a pity that the games are fairly limited in number - no tennis, bowling, or even golf.2. It comes with only one motion controller.This is a problem because some of the games in the pack really require 2 controllers for it to be fun. For example, without a second controller games like archery devolve into a point-the-controller exercise, which is rather fatiguing for small arms. For adults, Gladiator Duel feels a bit silly with just one controller.3. Gone are the friendliness of the Mii characters. The characters on the Move starter pack are mildly annoying - and even quite aggressive in jeering at you when they win - which was off putting for my youngest. Fortunately, you can shut them up with a click of the Next button.In addition, you can't customize your avatars - which used to be a source of endless amusement for kids (and parents) when using the Wii.4. Each time you play, you start with a predefined character (Kenji, Giselle, etc.), and these characters are shared across all family members. As a result, kids don't get to have a \"personal best\" score associated with their own character. This was a key draw for us on the Wii, as we kept trying to better each other's scores. Unfortunately, Sports Champion doesn't give us the same emotional attachment to a character - and there's no permanent digital scoreboard that let's the kids feel superior to us.Conclusion:##########If I were rating just the hardware, I'd give it 5 stars. My rating is for the overall enjoyment that my family and I derived from the starter bundle.In summary then, we liked the Move - but with some caveats.1) It isn't a game changer for family evenings - we'll still use our Wii for that.2) I'm awed by the technical brilliance of the Move, and I'm waiting for games that will take full advantage of it.In the meantime, it definitely is a fun curiosity that I'm sure I'll use occasionally.Happy Move-ing!","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-18-2010"}

If you didn't, well I guess I just told you.  That being said, this expansion does have some disappointments.If you haven't heard, there's no romance(that was sarcastic).  While romance does not make a game for me, there are other people I know who ONLY played this game BECAUSE you could treat it like a Harlequin Romance novel.  I realize there are different types of gamers out there and if romance was a huge draw for you, you'll probably want to skip or wait for a price drop.  Similarly though, I do not like the fact that you can't even initiate conversation in your party.  All dialogue takes place on the NPC's terms.  When it does happen, it's still great and well written, I just wish the same time and energy went in to the dialogue in Awakenings that it had in Origins.There ARE a LOT of additional items and tweaks.  Might almost be enough to justify a good chunk of the cost.  Everything from changing your shield's look to being able to enchant your armor to crafting your own runes are pretty fantastic.  The DLC problem has been addressed by other reviewers and that sucks, but I had a pretty solid group using minimal DLC items and had no issues.The writing is the same quality as the original.  While not long by any stretch, the story is enjoyable and I will probably get several playthroughs with my various characters.  The first time through, though, is by far the best as you start seeing the old characters cameo and there is some retention from your past.  Case in point(possible mild spoiler): My bad-boy mage desicrated the Urn and caused Wynne to leave his group.  Their reunion in here was NOT pleasant and the animosity was obvious.  It's the small touches that remind you how much this game's universe is well conceived and it is never made more clear than in characterizations.I don't know what happened, but I HAVE noticed some heftier frame rate drops in some battles in Awakenings.  Origins didn't have many frame rate drops for me, and what DID happen was few and far between.  Awakenings seems to drop quite a bit more.  Otherwise, graphics are still great and everything looks just as good as Origins.As a lover of the game, I loved this expansion.  However, the cost DOES seem to be a bit high for what essentially pans out \"Dragon Age Lite.\"  How ravenous are you for more Dragon Age?  I was foaming and loved every minute just enjoying new storylines and characters.  If you felt lukewarm toward DA......this expansion will not woo you over.  This is an expansion only real diehard fans of DA will love.  Everyone else will feel, justifiably so, ripped off.On one last note......02-01-11?  They better have an army working on it or I am scared.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-20-2010"}

Edit: Full of bugs","reviewText":"EDIT: The game is just too buggy, performs poorly and crashes constantly on the PS3. Until this is fixed I just have to give it 1 star... old review is still below.************************************************************************************I wasn't a fan of Morrowind. I didn't like Oblivion much either. So why did I buy Skyrim? It looked amazing and very promising,  and what I saw in previews is what I got. It fixed all the things I hated about previous Bethesda games.Pros:Graphics: Fantastic. The world is truly brilliant and the lighting is great. I love the 'Northern Lights' aurora shining across the nighttime sky. The character models are awesome as well,  I love my fuzzy Khajiit Mage, he looks great.Music: Incredible score by Jeremy Soule. Even more diverse score than previous Elder Scrolls games (which did have great music but I think Skyrim's is the best, and it even has music from the previous games).Combat: Fun. I can't believe I'm saying this as I could not stand the horrifyingly bad combat in Morrowind or Oblivion. This time Bethesda hit the nail on the head. Combat is riveting, suspenseful and well animated instead of feeling like you are whacking a stuffed doll with a foam sword.Plot: Great so far, and the many side quests have some exciting subplots of their own, rich in lore and full of excitement.Dungeons: Another improvement. Something I couldn't stand about previous Morrowind and Oblivion was how repetitive and bland the dungeons were. Not anymore!! They are large,  dangerous, and unique. They are truly fun to explore.Quests: Yet another improvement! Less grindy and even more fun and exciting than previous games!! (slight spoiler ----- haunted house part was a fun little side quest!! There are tons of fun little quests like this).Dialogue: Some may dislike its simplicity but I find that it feels more realistic and less tedious than say Morrowinds terrible encyclopedia-style dialogue. Also, NPCs behave more like real people (I really feel like this world is alive, people are always talking, approaching me, etc.)Leveling system: Refined. Very nice. Not too much to worry (as in Oblivion) about but also allows a lot of options and specialization. Being a Mage is a blast in this!Extras: Getting married and having a house with ANY gender; a lot of things to do such as level professions and explore (typical of most Elder Scrolls games).Cons: A few bugs. That is the only complaint I have so far!!!In conclusion, if you are a fan of ES games then you will love this one, but even if you weren't previously a fan of them (such as in my case) you should still give it a shot as it improves upon and polishes a lot that was wrong with its predecessors.UPDATE: The PS3 problem is annoying, though mine isn't unplayable. Hopefully Bethesda fixes it soon. On a side-note, the combat in this game as a magic user is insanely fun. There are some really intense and well-designed boss fights and it's a blast.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2011"}

This is a pro and con in itself. I've often found myself bored because I just don't know where to start...I completed 2 faction questlines, and a few misc/side quests, and after a while I finally decided to continue on with the main storyline. Sadly, I now wish I hadn't done that.. The gameplay is nice and responsive for the most part, and to shine a little light on the whole lag issue: it's no where near as bad as how others have stated at the beginning of launch, it's very stable. With that said, I did run into one GIANT lag blast at around the 30 hour mark. My frame rate dropped to 1/ps and it was hard to maneuver. Luckily, all I did was restart my Playstation and I didn't lag to that extreme any more. However, there were a few times where it got annoying. All in all, the lag isn't game breaking; at least the fix is as simple as restarting your game (for me anyway).Now to end the review, what I was saying at first about the main storyline, well... After dilly-dallying with so many misc quests, I kinda found myself wanting to hurry and get the main storyline out of the way so I could have more freedom to do the side quests. It was a mistake I made, and it ruined the game for me (I don't know about other people). The reason it ruined it is because, without spoilers, you spend time working your way up to the ending, and then it just gives you a cliche, anti-climatic, no-reward ending; and afterwards you find yourself struck by amazement in how the game just leads you on a lackluster, but acceptable storyline and then actually starts getting better, then throws you to the ground and pretty much expects you to continue on with your game experience like all of the events leading up to this moment were nothing but a useless sidequest. Honestly, the Dark Brotherhood had a better storyline than the main quest and the Civil War quests.Now I find myself already bored of the game after not even playing it less than a week. And trust me, I was still very excited to play each day before I decided to beat the game. Even though there is still plenty of things to do, the ending just ruined it all for me and I have no desire to play it anymore. This may come back; soon for that matter, but right now it's all gone. A bit of advice is to just continue to the side quests, as they offer more excitement, challenge, and reward than the main quest.Overall, a very good game, ruined by a worthless, useless, [Insert word]less ending. It's worth the price that it is at now, even though I wouldn't buy it at this price after seeing the ending (I'm currently borrowing).PROS:-A very giant chunk of things to do.-Good voice acting, story development for a few solid questlines.-The skill development is nice, lets you be who you want to be.-Character customization is very decent, even though your characters might come out looking slightly similar to everyone else of the race you chose.-There's a lot of pros, really.CONS:-Frame rate issues. Though not completely game-breaking, it still is highly annoying when you run into it. I seemed to solve it by restarting my console.-When you have followers that often say random lines, it conflicts with NPCs you're trying to listen to (during a cut scene for instance).-Main storyline is completely terrible, lackluster, and evil after beating it. It ruined the whole game for me. My advice is for the main storyline to be the completely last thing you do, as it might leave you lost and bored with the game after beating it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-06-2012"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXQ12","description":"","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"Not Just Dance nor Dance Central, but still a strong \"real dance\" game in its own right for Playstation Move.","reviewText":"Back in 2009, Ubisoft's \"Just Dance\" for the Wii introduced the concept of dance games using \"real dance moves\". It and its sequels were a huge success, selling over 10 million copies and counting. The game appealed to people on many levels. Individuals could play it to learn real dance moves and get a great workout. Families and friends could play it together and have fun with the choreographed routines. A year later in 2010, Microsoft introduced \"Dance Central\" for the Xbox. It brought to the table accurate full-body motion tracking of the Kinect and sold 2.5 million copies.In all this time the Playstation has been somewhat left out in the cold. Singstar Dance was an early attempt to cash in on the \"real dance move\" craze, but at the end of the day it was a karaoke title with dancing spliced in as an afterthought. \"Everybody Dance\" is Sony Computer Entertainment's long-overdue dive into the genre. And it's a pretty good one.As the game starts you need to set up the Move controller by pointing it at the screen. As with Just Dance, only one controller per player is used which you hold in your right hand. The system supports a maximum of two players.There are a couple menu options:Dance Now: Here, you can dive right into one of the 40 songs that the game comes with by selecting an album cover using your Move controller. Each song has an \"energy level\" indicator from 1 to 3. Since the Amazon listing doesn't have the song list as of the time of this writing, I'll list them here. They are:- Amerie - 1 Thing (2)- Barry White - You're the First, The Last, My Everything (1)- Basement Jaxx - Where's Your Head At (3)- Billy Idol with Generation - Dancing with Myself (3)- Bodyrockers - I Like The Way (2)- Carl Douglas - Kung Fu Fighting (1)- CeCe Peniston - Finally (1)- The Chemical Brothers - Hey Boy Hey Girl (2)- Chromeo - Night By Night (2)- Dam-Funk - Hood Pass Intact (1)- Deadmau5 - Ghosts 'N' Stuff feat. Bob Swire (2)- Diana Ross - Upside Down (2)- Duck Sauce - Barbara Streisand (2)- Elle Goulding - Starry Eyed (1)- Elton John - I'm Still Standing (3)- Fatboy Slim - Praise You (2)- Groove Armada - Superstylin' (2)- Ida Corr Vs Fedde Le Grand - Let Me Think About It (1)- Jay Sean featuring Lil Wayne - Down (1)- Kool and the Gang - Get Down On It (1)- Lady GaGa - Born This Way (3)- LMFAO - Party Rock Anthem (2)- M/A/R/R/S - Pump Up the Volume (3)- Miami Sound Machine - Dr Beat (3)- New Kids on the Block - You Got It (The Right Stuff  2)- Nicole Scherzinger - Don't Hold Your Breath (1)- Ok Go - Here It Goes Again (3)- OutKast - The Way You Move (1)- Puretone - Addicted to Bass (2)- Raphael Saadiq - Radio (2)- Republica - Ready to Go (3)- Rihanna - Rude Boy (1)- R. Kelly - Step In The Name Of Love (1)- SNAP! - The Power (3)- Sublime - Santeria (1)- Tiesto v Diplo feat Busta Rhymes - C'mon (Catch 'Em By Surprise  3)- Tinie Tempah - Pass Out (1)- Usher featuring Pitbull - DJ Got Us Fallin' In Love (2)- Usher featuring will.i.am - OMG (1)- Willow - Whip My Hair (2)Overall, I'd say the artist selection is \"hipper\" than Just Dance or Dance Central, the kind of set list you might see from a DJ in a club. This may be an advantage or a drawback depending on your musical tastes.Once you select a song, you can choose one of three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Professional. Beginner and Intermediate are about the difficulty of a typical song in Just Dance, with basic dance moves. Professional, on the other hand, adds things like complex movements, spins, jumps, and more expert-caliber choreography. Master any song at the Professional level, and you'll surely wow them at your next wedding or party.Finally, you can select a length of the song. \"Normal\" songs range around 3-5 minutes, while \"Short\" versions last about 1-2 minutes.Game play itself is fairly simple. As with all the other dance games, your goal is to match the on-screen dancer by mirroring his or her moves. While Just Dance has a silhouette to follow and Dance Central uses a hipster doofus cartoon character, Everybody Dance displays a real video image of a human dancer in a gray color. I personally prefer this, as it's easier to pinpoint the precise moves to follow. It's a nice touch that the video image looks like the artist, and the choreography does a great job of capturing the artist's style; in many cases, the moves mimic the same ones the artists perform in their video.The more accurate your moves are, the more points you'll rack up and you'll be awarded one to five stars at the end. You'll also be rewarded for \"streaks\" of contiguous successful moves. As with Just Dance, if you stand still and just wave your arms in the right way, you'll be able to rack up points. But of course, the fun in this game isn't in collecting points, it's in performing the real dance moves.As much as the game is derivative of previous dance games, there are a couple features in Everybody Dance that are truly innovative. While you're playing the game, you can watch the original artist's video playing in the background. Press the \"triangle\" button and it switches to a live video image of you. You'll even see a \"trail of light\" that shows your Move controller's motion. This feature is extremely useful when you're learning the dance moves, as you can precisely compare your body position and moves to the on-screen character's.Once the dance is over, you'll see your point total, number of stars, and longest streak. You'll also be able to view a 30 second video clip of your performance, as well as 10 snapshots that were taken during the performance of you in various poses. You have the option of saving them to the PS3 hard drive or posting them to Facebook or Twitter (and to the PS3 Community).By default, you dance in solo mode until a second player turns on their Move Controller. Once that's done, the menu changes to \"Battle Mode\", where you can compete against each other in any of the songs in Beginner, Intermediate, and Professional levels. Alternatively, you can also select \"Dance Partners\", where each player gets his or her own unique choreographed moves in a single dance routine. Bear in mind that for two players, you need at least 8-10 feet of space in front of the Playstation Eye so that both of you fit comfortably on the screen, and even then you may end up bumping into each other or hitting each other.\"Party\" mode is another pretty cool innovation. It starts off by asking you to take pictures of each person who's participating, from 2 up to 20 people. Then, it'll pair two competitors at a time to a dance-off. The two selected dancers can choose a song, difficulty level, and song length to compete to. The rounds keep going until you stop, at which time you'll be shown the overall winner (based on number of songs won, awards won, and longest streaks), rankings, and the biggest rival.The \"Dance Studio\" menu offers three options: Dance Creator, Dance Class, and Dance Workout. \"Dance Creator\" lets you record and play your own routines, either solo or with a partner. You're shown a full-screen image of yourself (with the music video playing in the corner) and you basically record yourself dancing. You can then play your (or others') saved routines from the Dance Now, Party, or Dance Creator menus (complete with very accurate scoring).\"Dance Class\" is a great way to learn the dance moves, highly recommended for the \"Professional\" difficulty level. The system will break down the song into short sections of about 30 seconds each, and you loop through each section 4 times. Surprisingly, it took me only one or two times going through each section to master it for most songs, even at professional level.With \"Dance Workout\", you start out by setting up a new profile. You take your picture and set your weight using the Move Controller. Then, you select a pre-defined workout which consists of similar songs bundled together at different difficulty levels. Each workout consists of 3 songs and lasts about 10 minutes (Professional+ workouts consist of 5 songs and last 15-20 minutes). There are 12 workouts in total across the different difficulty levels.As you work out, a calorie meter is displayed on top of the screen showing you the target calories for each song. As long as you match the hand movements, you'll get credit for the calories, but of course to get a true workout you need to be \"honest\" and really do all the motions you're asked to do with your whole body.Choosing \"Get More Songs\" will quit the game and take you to the Playstation Store to download additional DLC. As of this writing (October 21, 2011) there were no songs available yet, but expect that to change very soon.\"Galleries\" is where you can go to visit all your past saved performances, either ones you saved to your hard drive or uploaded. You can also visit the \"Community Gallery\" which shows the 30-second videos and photos that others around the world have uploaded. You can vote for videos you like which will help them rise in popularity. As of this writing the game has only been out for a few days, and yet there are already hundreds of videos out there, a few surprisingly good, most not so good. Some observations: men currently seem to outnumber women by a large margin, and grown men should *really* think twice before uploading a video of themselves dancing to Willow Smith's \"Whip My Hair\".You have the option of turning \"singing\" on and off. If you turn singing on, you can sing into the Playstation Eye microphone, or into a USB microphone or wireless headset. After each song you'll get a \"singing rating\", but that's about it--it doesn't even record your performance.Everybody Dance is an interesting game to rate, mainly because it naturally leads to comparisons with the games that came before it. I'd say from a \"pure fun\" perspective, Just Dance still holds the advantage. From a \"motion detection accuracy\" perspective, Dance Central's full body tracking is arguably superior than the Wii or the PS3's \"one-handed solution\" for these kinds of games. If you come with pre-set expectations from either of those games, you might be disappointed.Having said that, Everybody Dance does do both of those things pretty well, and is an excellent game on its own merits. The innovations that Sony brought to the table, including more advanced choreography in original artist's own style, the community features, the accuracy of the \"Dance Creator\" (which is definitely superior to the same feature on Just Dance for the Kinect), and the ability to dance side-by-side with the on-screen character all catapult Everybody Dance into the same echelon as those games. And of course it is easily the best dancing game available for the Playstation Move right now.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2011"}

For example, pushing up on your controller makes you sidestep your opponent&#x92;s attacks, yet also allows you to jump in the air by tapping up plus a direction. A revamped fighting system offers up three different styles for each fighter (one includes a weapon technique). The multiple styles provide countless varieties of attacks for any given fighter. Different combinations of punches and kicks can be combined for very lengthy and powerful chain attacks similar to those in theMortal Kombatof old. Fatalities are also back and rich in graphic representation.New fighters join the cast of old favorites such as Sonya, Kano, Sub-Zero, Raiden, Scorpion, Johnny Cage, Jax, Cyrax, Kung Lao, Kitana, Quan Chi, Reptile, and Shang Tsung. The lavish environments surround your fighters with animated backgrounds and rich skylines. On some levels there are even breakable objects and hazards that you can interact with, such as pools of acid--the perfect landing place for a thrown opponent.In addition to regular modes of gameplay (arcade, versus, etc.), there is an option called Konquest mode. This mode allows you to learn more about fighting styles, read up on each character&#x92;s personal history, and gain Koins. The koins can then be spent in the Krypt, allowing you to unlock a host of new characters, costumes, and early concept drawings. The plentiful additional content offered with this title includes special movies ofThe Making ofDeadly Alliance andThe History ofMortal Kombat.Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliancesuccessfully reinvents the series by offering up a unique mix of improved graphics and stylized gameplay without compromising any of the features that made theMKseries popular over the years.--Carlos RodelaProsComplex gameplayRealistic 3-D graphicsHundreds of unlockable featuresConsWeak storylineUnbalanced combo system","reviewerName":"CJ Foster \"Herbal\"","summary":"Ups and Downs.","reviewText":"I love the new 3D update.

{"product_name":"B003S2MXRA","description":"","reviewerName":"Call me KID","summary":"Kill the Orcs","reviewText":"I wanted this game so bad, as soon as it got here in the xbox it went and I used normal for difficulty being worried about that, cause on the demo I found game tough.  With the simple walk through instructions game is much better now and fairly easy, just a good slice and dice, rampage mode a few different guns including hand gun with unlimited amm, rifle, sniper, and blob to wall and control detonate gun which so far is useless but I think I'll need it today, just got last night.  There are boss Orcs, a good amount of easy combo's not like Mortal Combat where you need a sheet to show you ton's of moves.  You can kill Orcs a certain way Y then B key to gain health, very important.  The brightness control works well so it's not a dark screen game.  It leads you so it's hard to get lost and give up, great for younger players or people like me who hate being totally lost like in Assasins Creed Revelations or Lost Planet 2.  There are pods that give you stuff like a Rocket Pack with Stomp ability.  Plenty of Ammo crates have not run out yet and team members if sticking with them instead of storming ahead will carry their own weight for most part.  Violence and blood levels / gore are suitable for young ages no worse than Tom and Jerry when we were kids, things splat apart quickly in this game so not bad for young adults, it's just orcs, no bad language yet at all another plus and just a keep playing game, highly recommend for young or adult, get it got it gone, buy used totally overpriced new.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-10-2014"}

I played dead space 1 (it wasnt as good as it should have been). Played Dead SPace 2 (This game was legend, plain and simple). Next up, my friend purchased Dead Space 3 because I was broke at the time. So I took the game and played it until I couldnt stand it anymore. Not going to waste a lot of time with this review, here is the break down.Pros+New places, out in the snow and not just dark tunnels.+New Angry Statements when you stomp things.+Long gameplay (not sure just how long because I never finished it)+Looks like dead space and plays like it.Cons-Boring story-Boring Characters-Same death/kill animation over and over for bad guys-New weapon build system that just takes up time and isnt any fun.-Too many puzzles, way too many and very boring ones at that.-Where is the suits? Let me guess, DLC?-No replay valueLong story short, the game isnt fun. I actually stopped playing it because It was so bad. Now, all mentioned is my opinion and its not for everyone. My goal here is to warn people of trash. If you love the dead space series you will already have this game. If you only liked number 2 and didnt like the first then avoid at all costs. If you like puzzles, boring storyline, and building your weapons piece by piece than quick grab it! If you like saving money and not buying trash than look for another game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2013"}

I was waiting for Mojang to release it on a physical copy (for the PS3), and they finally did! The maps on the PS3 are not \"infinite\", but don't let that stop you from buying it, it's still really fun to play it with friends and or family! It's easy to get into multiplayer, and I love the split-screen feature. The controls were a little bit confusing for me, at first, but I already got used to them. It is missing some things (AS OF NOW), they 'might' add them later on, so it catches up with the PC version. Unfortunately, you can't add mods on this version, and the character skins aren't free.

{"product_name":"B0009UBR3A","reviewerName":"JRP","summary":"Zelda Twilight Princess review","reviewText":"Here I am with the last of my reviews for The Zelda games I own I finally played this game recently I even bought a Gamecube so I could play this game I have to say this is a sequel that Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask deserves & for whatever reason I prefer the darker Zelda games. It's not dark in the way Majora's Mask I would say this is more of a menacing dark than emotional like OOT or MM. How this game came about was Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask were big hits I have never got to play The Wind Waker I know a lot of people hate that game I have seen playthroughs of it looks like an entertaining & it does get a lot of love from what I read. Twilight Princess gets hated on a lot so it's just what you prefer. Zelda Twilight Princess released in November 2006 & was a launch game for The Wii & a month later was released for The Gamecube. Also at E 3 in 2004 they showed a trailer for this game it got a hugely positive response. You'll have to forgive me if this does come off as a walkthrough The story is set hundreds of years after Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask there is this man named Zant who has met Ganondorf & Zant wants to go after the people of Hyrule Ganondorf agrees since he wants revenge against the people of Hyrule cause The King found out about Ganondorf's coup & he was found guilty of treason & has been trapped in The Twilight Realm ever since. So he stores his power in Zant whatever Zant wants Ganondorf wants whatever Ganondorf wants Zant will desire so he takes over The Twilight Realm turns Queen Minda into an imp. Zant goes to Hyrule goes to Hyrule Castle where he & these Twili Creatures easily take down the guards he tells Princess Zelda that he will kill everybody in Hyrule if she doesn't surrender her throne. She does it only to protect her people Zant covers Hyrule in darkness & everybody is a shadow spirit. So you're introduced to Link who is a related to The Link from OOT & Majora's Mask. He lives in this village similar to Kokiri Forest called Ordon he lives there & works on a ranch there & you start off as an adult. I guess Link is a popular guy in Ordon some of the kids in the neighborhood want Link to buy them a Slingshot. You're introduced to a character Ilia who is Link's childhood friend when you get around to buying The Slingshot you get a Wooden Sword from Rusl which you just try out the different moves you can do with it Link is a friend of Rusl & his family that include's Rusl's Wife Uli who is pregnant & their son Colin who looks up to Link & Ilia. These group of kids Talo, Beth & Malo want Link's help to chase after this monkey so Link's Horse Epona can be used to follow them & Epona is 1 of the most have things in this game cause Hyrule Field is bigger than The Hyrule Field in Ocarina Of Time or Termina Field in Majora's Mask. Anyway you have to save Talo & the monkey you find out he isn't a bad guy. The next day Link is going to deliver a sword to Hyrule Castle but Ilia is mad cause Epona has a cut on her leg. So you have to talk to her she tells you how she overreacted but then a group of monsters led by King Bublin riding bores come in knock Link out take Ilia & all the kids in Ordon Village Link comes to & he goes up to this portal where he is dragged through & Hyrule is covered in darkness & Link is turned into a wolf & he's locked up in Hyrule Castle. Minda sees what's going on & she breaks Link free where you have to find Princess Zelda she tells you that Zant took over & tells you how you're the chosen 1 cause Link is related to The Hero Of Time. You go back to Ordon Village where you use your wolf skills & obtain The Ordon Shield which is a wooden shield but later on you'll be able to buy a Hylian Shield made of metal. & You get a real sword The Ordon Sword. In each area that is covered in darkness you need fill kill 16 bugs called Twilight Parisite's that leave behind Tears Of Light it clears the area of darkness & returns you to normal. Then you can go to The Forest Temple which it does remind me of being inside The Great Deku Tree not saying it's the remains of The Great Deku Tree it is a great way to learn who the temples work in this game. You have some good enemies, decent puzzles & the boss was ok. You'll go on to Kakariko Village that has been covered in Twilight other places like Lake Hylia, Zora's Domain & Castle Town have been covered in it too. You find out that Beth, Malo, Talo & Colin are being taken care of by a man named Renardo & this man naed Barnes. You have to find The Tears Of Light & return Kakariko Village to normal. There the kids are happy you saved them & then you have to go to Goron Village & find out why they're so hostile to the people of Kakariko Village now this 1 Goron won't let you through & will knock you off the cliff. Rendardo tells you that Mayor Bo from Link's hometown was Sumo Wrestler & beat The Goron's. You get Epona back which makes going through Hyrule Field faster. You go back to Ordon Mayor Bo teaches you the skills to beat The Goron's & he gives you a pair of Iron Boots & this time The Iron Boots are more useful than in Ocarina Of Time. When you get back to Kakariko Village King Bublin comes through it looks like he's going to trample Beth but Colin knocks her out of the way so he is taken by King Bublin & since you have Epona you can chase after him they finally got Horse Combat done right they really wanted to do it in Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask but in those games you could hardly use a bow while riding Epona so Horse Combat is pretty good for once. The part where you knock King Bublin off the bridge I get lucky with this battle but when you knock King Bublin off the bridge you can head on to Death Mountain & you get a good cut scene with Colin where he tells you that he understands what it means now to be strong. With The Goron Boots you can now just throw Goron's to the side & get to their area where they live you have to face Gor Coron in a Sumo Wrestling Match & he will allow you to go into The Goron Mines. The reason they have been hostile to humans is cause their leader Darbus has been turned into a monster named Fryus. The Goron's have different looks to them they just don't look alike.  Before you do that you need to go to The Malo Mart & buy a0 Hylian Shield. BTW Malo is like 2 or 3 years old & he's smart in economics. Goron Mines is a great dungeon the puzzles are pretty good there is a fun sub boss & you get The Bow & Arrow. I also though it was good how you had 3 pieces of a key to form The Big Key. Fryus made for a fun boss. The Iron Boots come into play with this boss.  I failed to mention that you're going around collecting these pieces of a mask to create The Fused Shadow. After Goron Mines you have to free Castle Town, Lake Hylia & Zora's Domain from Twilight. Also Barnes opens up his Bomb Shop you can finally purchase Bomb's & a cool thing about this is you can combine your bombs with arrows & when you fire an arrow at whatever you want it explodes on impact. When you head off & enter an area that is covered in darkness you'll turn into a wolf again but as a wolf you'll have a better sense of smell & you can find out where Ilia is at in Castle Town you find where Ilia is at she is being watched by a woman named Telma who runs a bar & they're tending to an injured Zora Boy. Then you go & collect The Tears Of Light to turn back to normal & clear the area of darkness. You help The Zora by dropping a molten stone in the middle of Zora's Domain to melt the ice. After you turn back into your human form you get to witness a disturbing cut scene. Then you help Telma get the injured Zora boy to Karariko Village you also find out that Ilia has amnesia Horseback Combat comes into play again it's easier to knock King Bublin off the bridge this time cause you just shoot him with a couple of arrows. Then you have guess what? A Water Temple but it's better than what was in Ocarina Of Time or Majora's Mask. Plus the puzzles were pretty good a decent mini boss The Zora Tunic & Iron Boots come into play as well you get a Clawshot which is a very useful item. The Boss Morpheel isn't as bad as Morpha which they both have similar names only Morpheel isn't as hard as Morpha. When you beat Morpheel you'll have all 3 pieces of The Fused Shadow. After that Zant blindsides you turns Link into a wolf permanently injure's Minda & Zant takes The Fused Shadow & this was probably the best cut scene of the entire game although most of the cut scenes were very good in this game. You have to get to Hyrule Castle to get Zelda's help & the music track in this part was very good. Telma's Cat helps you cause in wolf form you can talk to various animals. You can go through this secret passageway where you meet this man named Jovani & his cat they have been turned into gold you have to collect The Poe Souls where you kill a Poe in wolf form. Anyway Zelda helps the injured Minda & tells you have to get The Master Sword to break the curse & return to normal. You have to go deep into Faron Woods where The Master Sword is in The Sacred Grove. Your run into a character that was in Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask Skull Kid I don't know if it's the same 1 chances are it is cause on his flute he's playing Saria's Song. He's trying to kill but it's all a fun game to him. So yeah I didn't like Skull Kid in this game either he was tolerable in OOT though. Anyway you get to The Sacred Grove you have to move these 2 statues around which is a really good puzzle to get access to the remains of The Temple Of Time & obtain The Master Sword & their is no more use for The Ordon Sword. I would've liked it if they would included getting The Mirror Shield later on in the game. Now you can transform into a wolf or human anytime you want & you can warp to area's that have a portal. At Telma's Bar you are introduced to a group of fighters trying to stop Zant consisting of Ashei, Auru, Shad & Rusl. Here you can find out where each temple you needed to go at is located. You have to go to The Gerudo Desert & find The Mirror Chamber to go to The Twilight Realm. There are no more Gerudo's. Anyway you have to go to this fortress where you fight a lot of enemies & have a 1 on 1 showdown with King Bublin. Combat has been greatly improved & the best on The 3D Zelda games I have played also you learn hidden skills from The Hero's Shade like The Back Slice, Helm Splitter & The Ending Blow. The Desert Temple I thought was really good the boss is fun it has challenging pattern. The mini boss was good. Stallord is 1 of the best bosses in The 3D Zelda games. Plus I liked how you had to avoid being pulled in by The Quicksand Pits. The Big Poes add a little more fun too. The Spinner is unique. When you head to The Mirror Chamber there is 3 pieces of the mirror missing your also treated to a cut scene where you see how Ganondorf lived through his execution. You find out the other 3 mirror pieces are in Snowpeak Ruins, Faron Woods & The City In The Sky. You get a side quest that involves that Zora boy who we find out is Prince Ralis this has a decent amount of emotion when Zora's Domain was frozen Queen Rutela told Ralis to go to Hyrule Castle & inform Princess Zelda what's going on. He was inured & left for dead by Zant he has gotten better but he doesn't have any confidence in himself & feels worthless. It helps you find where your next area you have to go to & you are introduced to 2 Yeti's Yeta & Yeto. They have the 2nd piece of the mirror you have Yeta who is sick & Yeto who is making soup you have to look for the bedroom key & the 1st time you a pumpkin in a treasure chest the 2nd time you find Goat Cheese I don't know why those things would be in a treasure chest. The weapon you get in this temple is The Ball & Chain which is a big help in defeating the annoying ice enemies. It is also needed to beat the boss of Snowpeak Ruins who turns out to be Yeta when she looks into the mirro she turns into Blizzeta. This boss was pretty fun to fight. I have to say Yeto is sort of annoying anytime he has something he wants he doesn't ask for it he shoves you on your a  s  s for it. Also you can race against Yeta & Yeto after completing the temple. The Yeta race is hard but it is fun knocking her out of the way with The Master Sword. But the important thing is if you win you get a heart piece which I always recommend that you get as many heart pieces as you can to build up you life. I got 19 out of 20 hearts filled up. Of course a temple I love that they put in this game was The Temple Of Time. The Puzzles were neat. But before you get there you have to go through Faron Woods again & Skull Kid wants to play that game where he wants to kill you. In The Sacred Forest Meadow you can open the door to The Temple Of Time with The Master Sword & go back to The Temple Of Time's original state. I liked how you had to move this statue around & move it's original space you have to get The Dominion Rod to do that. You have to fight a Dark Nut to get The Dominion Rod which the fights with The Dark Nuts feel more like 1 on 1 battles than what they were in OOT & MM. I mean controlling the states is kind of cool plus you can use it to smash the baby Gohma & The Young Gohma. It was also fun taking them down with Bomb Arrows. The boss Armagohma is more like a spider than Queen Gohma but it's way too easy all you do is shoot it's eye with an arrow & smash it's stomach commanding a statue. I do feel the bosses were a little too easy in this game. There is a side quest to regain Ilia's memory & you have to go into this hidden village where you take down these Bublin's & this old lady named Impaz gives you this Horse Call & you play it in front of Ilia you get a great cut scene where she regains her memory. Also if you go back to the hidden village Impaz will give you a book with missing pages Shad tries to study it but nothing happens your Dominion Rod is powered up & find the missing pages which will help you remove the statue in the cellar under Rendardo's house. You find this canon that that will launch you into The City In The Sky now these strange bird creatures called Ooccoo live there & you run into these things in most of the dungeons they are helpful cause they can warp you out of the dungeon if you need to restock your weapons or regain health then you can warp back to the point you left at. Anyway this dragon named Argarok is attack The City In The Sky & you have to go after it. It has the final mirror piece. This dungeon is good but very long & The Clawshot proves more useful than any other Zelda game. You also get another Clawshot where when your attached to something you can then grapple to wherever you need to go. The Arealfols that serve as the mini boss the 1st time I fought them they were hard but learning what to do now there no real problem. The traps you have to deal with are good too. This dungeon is long but the boss felt too easy to me. When you beat you'll have all 3 mirror pieces then you can go to The Twilight Realm a brief mention is about this object called a Sol you have to get it outside & place it in this holder. But you have this Zant Hand after it. Before you get it you have to fight Phantom Zant The Zant Hand can be the worst thing cause if when you moving it holder t holder if the hand grabs it & you don't stop it from leaving the room then you go to go all the way back to where The Sol is at do it all over again. You have to get 2 Sols outside & place them in their holders where your Master Sword will be powered up & you can cut through The Twilight Smoke. I had trouble looking for The Big Key & how they hid was smart. The battle with Zant is great how you have to fight him in all these different stages & a lot of your items come into play for each area. The battle outside Hyrule Castle rocks you just battle to the finish. Zant tells Link & Minda how it was Ganondorf that placed the curse on Minda not him & Ganondorf is going to resurrected him. Minda who has The Fused Shadow kills Zant. She is also worried about how she might of assembled something horrible. You have the most frustrating part of the game The Cave Of Ordeals & it more than lives up to it's name this is optional if you're not worried about getting all 60 Poe Souls then skip it. Hyrule Castle is the easiest dungeon in the whole game all you have to worry about is The Dark Nuts in the castle. You have to get the key & you fight King Bublin the last time who has the key after you defeat him he tells you all his life he has only followed the strongest side. Not much to say you have to get The Big Key & you get a cool cut scene where The Freedom Fighters help you out. The fight with Ganondorf is great in fact it's the best battle with Ganon ever imo. Ganondorf is in The Throne Room just sitting their I know he looks fat in the game. He posses Zelda you have to fight her & play Dead Man's Volley & then you fight him in beast form & you fight him in your wolf form. After you beat him Minda transports Link & Zelda out of there Minda transforms into some kind of creature & try's to finish Ganondorf off. Outside Ganondorf is holding Minda's Helmet & on horseback Zelda requests Light Arrows from The Goddess & you chase after Ganondorf with Epona you have to get close & let Zelda hit Ganondorf with a Light Arrow then you have to start stabbing or slashing at Ganondorf. You have this really good 1 on 1 sword fight with Ganondorf. Plus Ganondorf is finished off for good in this timeline anyway. It's an amazing battle. Then you have a nice ending. Now my final thoughts the story was a little a too deep for it's own good. Zelda & Ganondorf are barely in the game Ganon only comes into play at the end. But the combat system is great. You had very good temples bosses were good. A great item & tool selection. Cut scenes were either destubing or just amazing. Side quests were decent. The guide or partner Minda was good. The wolf portions I like more the 2nd time around. Decent music by Koji Kondo. I don't really get why this game gets hated on wouldn't this be the game that Ocarina Of Time & Majora's Mask fans would want. A lot of people call this a OOT rehash Other than a dude being from the forest & saving Zelda at the end I don't see it. I recommend this game if you haven't played it. It's on both The Wii & Gamecube you like it if you prefer the darker Zelda games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-25-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Great entry in a great series","reviewText":"It was a given I'd pick this one up, seeing as how I've played and loved every entry in the series released in English. This is easily the best strategy game for 3DS, and I'd go so far as to put it up there with Advance Wars Dual Strike as a contender for best strategy game on either the DS or 3DS.To fans of the series, much of the gameplay is familiar- you have a set of characters, and occasionally receive or acquire new ones. The levels are very challenging, and on classic mode if you lose characters in combat, they're gone for good. Your units have classes, stats, and level up like characters in RPGs- and have varying strengths and weaknesses. They can be equipped with weapons and items that also have unique properties, and can be promoted to elite classes that make them pretty fearsome on the battlefield. The game's difficulty, though, means you'll likely have to sacrifice some along the way- and that can be pretty hard once you get attached to certain characters. There's a lot of side quests and optional battles that can net you extra loot and experience, and it pays to train up a solid core team. Awakening is true to the old style of the Fire Emblem series, even down to the standard red/green cavalier combo and the promoted overpowered unit you start with (note to newbies- only use that guy if you have to!). On the hardest game difficulty, Awakening is insanely challenging- I doubt even the most seasoned FE veterans will be able to make it through the game without losing a ton of units.However, to make the game more friendly to casual gamers there are quite a few changes. First and most obvious is 'casual mode' which as it sounds, makes the game a lot easier. Basically, it takes away unit perma-death, which means you can lose units left and right and get them back in the next level. Furthermore, you can SAVE at any point (not bookmark, which gets deleted when you load, but an actual save). I don't recommend using this mode on anything but the hardest difficulty, because it just makes the game too easy and obviates a lot of need to strategize. But if you need it, it's there. Casual mode aside, you can get some DLC content and items that are- quite frankly- overpowered. These include both weapons and units. The weapons are somewhat tempered by the fact it takes high skill to wield them, and the units are expensive or require battles to recruit, but it's still a bit too easy IMO and if exploited can give you a facerolling army in no time. You can also exploit some of the DLC/SpotPass spawns to rapidly train up weak units, making the game in general considerably easier. However, you don't HAVE to do this, so once again it's just there if you need it.There are also some general changes to the gameplay which are pretty balanced and welcome to any player. For example, units can 'pair up,' which allows one to move with the other, improves the leader's base stats, and sometimes allows them to attack/defend together. If you pair units with high support, they can form an insanely strong single unit. This also can be used to protect weaker units while giving them some exp, or to enable slow units to move with faster ones or across terrain they normally can't cross. Additionally, adjacent units support each other, adding bonuses during combat and occasionally stepping in to help. This makes it a good idea to keep your army in tight formation. The overland map is also well done, with easy inventory management and one button optimization. You also get to create and personalize an avatar, which is your 'tactician' and serves as both melee/magic (note- you should probably level this unit as a mage, read on for why). The avatar is a good unit but not overpowered by any means, and also mission-critical. It's a nice touch, though not as well explored as it could be. Lastly, both the sound and graphics are a lot better than the last DS entry in the series (Shadow Dragon). The combat scenes are 3D and actually quite fun to watch. There are also some FMV cutscenes and partially spoken dialogue, and additional unit interaction you can view in the barracks.A few minor gripes: You can't change the game difficulty once a campaign has started. To be honest, there were a few levels I was really tempted to play in casual, because they were just crazy hard. However, it wasn't even an option unless I wanted to start an entirely fresh game. I ended up bulling through and surviving with a few characters down :-( The old FE problem of some units being considerably weaker is still present. Some of them have very weak growth, meaning if you take the time to level them their stats just won't get much better. Since that's essentially all the improvement they get, that's a really bad thing. I've never understood why this remains a mechanic in the series- it may be realistic in the sense that some people just aren't as good as others, but it's really irritating from a game perspective. This isn't as big a problem in this game since you can use some of the exploits I mention above, but it's still a waste of time. On that note, all the mage characters in this game are terrible, which might be a surprise to veterans since historically they've been quite strong.No matter how you look at it, Awakening is a great entry in the series and fun for both newcomers and hardcore fans alike. I will grant that there's some tempting exploits, but you don't have to use them and the hardest difficulty will make the game blisteringly challenging even with those.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-13-2013"}

I think it froze somewhere around 47%, then stopped. I had to install the game on my laptop, then copy the directory over to my PC. THEN, I had to download the beta tools to install the service that needs to run in the background in order to authenticate the license for Dragon Age and sync with EA servers. After spending 5 hours doing this workaround, I was able to play the game.I made 4 characters, and I lasted the longest on one that was a tank warrior. The game's mechanics are rather lacking in terms of the tactic system (macros for your characters to run on autopilot). If I was not playing a tank warrior, my party would always get owned by mobs, and the tank running on autopilot would suck at holding mob aggro - my healer would die frequently. The only time I felt like my party was somewhat solid was when I was tanking. I tried different tactics based on forums online, and could not get my designated tank to hold aggro by himself.I have not played the rogue because I detest rogues since the days of WoW, and I have not been able to effectively play as a mage in DA due to aggro management. Something that seems so simple should not be so complex to work with, and that is the crippling factor that has ruined my desire to play the game. I played as a tank in WoW, so I know about aggro. But when it comes to DA, I felt like I missed something embedded in a help menu. I hope they redesigned this in DA2 because it killed DA horribly for me. I wanted an RPG where I didn't have to worry about managing a squad, and that is what this game revolves around. If your healer is slacking, if your tank is not holding aggro, or if a DPS is pulling some random mob in the corner, it was too cumbersome for my taste.I would like to see this game redesigned similar to the paradigm system that I had seen in FF XIII - simple, clean cut, straight forward party mechanics. I have not finished this game, in fact, I gave up playing because the mechanics for the party are too clunky for my style.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-08-2012"}

This review is from a non-fanboy perspective.Yes it is 5 games for the price of one, but if they're 5 crappy games is it really worth it?  These 5 games could not be sold separately at full price.  Half-Life 2 has dated graphics, Episode 1 is WAY too short, Episode 2 has the best graphics, but is still too short.  Portal is a mind-bending blast!  But it's too short to be sold separately, and Team Fortress 2 is a lot of fun, but is strictly online multiplayer.So now that we have all of the bad stuff out of the way let's get to the good.1) Half-Life 2:  This has the worst graphics of the group, but it is the longest and has the best weapon set.  The driving levels are a little long and tedious, but the rest of the game is a lot of fun.  The gravity gun is the trademark of the Half-Life series.  As long as there is something you can pick up w/ the gravity gun nearby you have ammo.  Whether it's saw blades, radiators, washing machines, etc, this gun is a blast to use!  Also the laser scoped rocket launcher and controlling the antlions are a lot of fun as well.  The graphics will probably be a huge turn off when you pop this one in, but the game is so fun you'll get sucked in and get used to the graphics in no time.2) HL2 Ep 1:  This game is the shortest of the group.  You get to know the characters a little better, but being the shortest it is also the least memorable.  Thanks to the achievements I know it's possible to play this game firing only one bullet.  That's how short it is!3) HL2 Ep 2:  Episode 2 has the best graphics.  Almost as good as Gears of War and Assassin's Creed.  In Episode 2 you'll REALLY become attached to the characters and the end will blow your mind!  It will leave you screaming for Episode 3!4) Portal:  It's the best thing since Tetris!  In Tetris it's the same blocks falling over and over, but it's different every time.  In Portal you have the same concept of shooting portals to get to hard to reach places, but it's different every time!  You can beat Portal in about 3 hours or less, but you'll come back to it over and over.  It is the new and innovative game of the group.  Add in a few more levels and it's worth the full price tag by itself!5) Team Fortress 2:  It's a squad based online multiplayer.  Every character has their strengths and weaknesses.  The spy can look like someone from the other team, but has weak weapons.  The Heavy has the most powerful gun, but he's slow.  The Engineer is great at setting up defensive turrets, but isn't very good at offense.The bottom line:  The Orange Box is worth a purchase.  I would avoid renting it because you'll spend many hours playing through the different games, and you'll want to come back over and over.  The early reviews say: \"5 games for[...] what a deal!!\"  Now that it's[..] how can you pass it up?","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2008"}

Wow was I wrong.  I played RE2 way back on the PS1 and found it entertaining.  I am not a huge 3rd person action/survival/horror gamer but I can get my way around most of them.  RE5 is the first game I have turned off after literally less than 30 minutes.  I got about 2 checkpoints into the game before I shut it down before losing my mind.  It's going right back to the store for credit.I found nothing fun about the control schemes.  Looking over the shoulder is an odd perspective I could get used to if the game was intuitive.  Your character is slow.  SLOW SLOW SLOW.  He walks slow, runs slow, aims slow, and apparently every little item on the floor prevents him from moving.  Imagine a small 13 gallon plastic garbage can stopping the Terminator in it's tracks.  The camera over the right shoulder also makes you completely blind in most instances.  It's a major blindspot.  This would have worked in the slow limited environments of RE1 and 2, it has no place in this type of game.Very early in the opening stages the game throws you into a massive battle with dozens of zombies and some mad boss from the new movie.  I gave this spot a try a few times before giving up.The zombies no longer lumber around.  They are fast and plentiful.  With no auto-target you have to manually aim at each one.  This is infuriating for so many reasons.  A.  You are completely blind on your left.  It's as if Chris has only one eye.  B.  The aiming mechanism is so incredibly slow to move around.  By the time you get your target selected its on you.  C.  Your partner is secretly trying to kill you.  She shoots your target causing you to waste ammo and she gets in your way at every step.  She also needs to be healed every 5 seconds.The RE series was notorious for limiting your inventory so much and this game was no different.  You have little ammo and clumsy controls, limited health, and an inept partner who leads you to wasting most of your ammo anyway.  The game was totally unclear as to what you were supposed to do.  I basically ran around and just shot as many zombies as I could before getting cut in half by an axe.  The purposely limited view and lousy controls made a difficult game even worse.  I had the game on easy and couldn't even play 10 minutes before wanting to smash the disk.  Not fun at all.For the serious gamers and RE vets this game will probably be manageable but I don't see the fun level in it.  Capcom may defend the controls and limited view as adding to the sense of uneasiness.  I say thats all a cover.  The controls suck and the average to novice gamer will hate them.  Bad bad game and I will not be playing another RE game anytime soon.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-05-2011"}

For one, the gameplay was entirely redesigned to have the camera fixed right behind the character to provide a third-first-person viewpoint that was later adapted in Dead Space, Gears of War, and the soon-to-be Ghostbusters film.  The largest detour from the Resident Evil franchise was the change in gameplay and story from just zombie horror survival to arcade action to not-so-zombiesque baddies anymore.  It was bold and, to a very large extent, sucessfull.  Resident Evil 5 continues this trend but to new heights.\"RE5\" continues in this year, 2009, where RE1 protagonist Chris Redfield returns as an agent for a generic agency combating bioweapon terrorism around the globe.  His newest adventure brings him to Africa, where he joins up with somewhat a sexy sidekick, whose chest seems to get bigger with every cut scene.  Along the way, you loose lots of friends, combat weirder and weirder enemies, emotional and not-so heartwretching monologues when someone all but gives up, and the voice acting with the signature Resident Evil cliches and catch phrases (\"Be careful\") along the way.  It may be cheesy, but it's Resident Evil cheesy so they can get away with it as they pull it off sucessfully.DifficultyNow, lemme just come out and say this is NOT a game for newbies and it is at the same time.  The thing with Resident Evil 5 (and 4 subsequently) is that the first time through is ALWAYS the hardest as you're stuck with basic level equipment that seem to have as much an effect on the enemies as harsh language, which doesn't even phase the 13-year old German kids that seem to loiter on Xbox Live.  The difficulty seems to be offset as in the very beginning as my co-op parter (who we will not name because he is my little brother Chris) and I subsequently had our backsides handed to us when a bunch of baddies stormed a structure we were held up in... at the beginning of the game.  What is really ironic is that once you discover that you're supposed to run away from the structure and take cover elsewhere, they then have tutorial pamphlets spread throughout, as if that last part was supposed to be easy.You are literally expected to be an expert almost right away, which is a bad assumption on Capcom's part as they are seemingly relying solely on the fanbase to support sales; a precarious notion in marketing.  However, once we got past figuring out the controls, the game got too easy as we discovered simple ways to stop even the largest of hordes and toughests of enemies.It probably doesn't help that the enemy AI is as dumb as... well, organized zombie mobs.  Hordes will just attack en masse regardless of obstacles and be perfect targets for grenades or proxemity mines, which I had WAAAY too much fun with.  Another strategy to save ammo was to stand in front of a window and continually slice the oncoming enemies with the knife; they will be too stupid to throw objects and keep trying to scale the window.  Bosses will fixiate on one person and continually chase that person until they hit them, allowing the other player to just stand in a corner and take pot shots with the magnum or sniper rifle.Fortunately, your partner's AI is not all that dumb although you can't exactly strategize with them.  Rainbow Six had great options for tactics that RE5 should've implemented including voice-commands through a headset.StoryThe Resident Evil franchise, or dynasty as it is now, is not without its cliches and signature catch phrases (and partially illustrated before).  Capcom still has to discover how to make twists less predictable.  The woman in the hood?!  I want to know what idiot did NOT see that coming.  Seriously.The voice acting, however, was an improvement.  It wasn't the typical \"no, don't go through that door\" monotone voice acting that plagues the video game industry (I'm looking at you House of the Dead 2).  The accents were well done and the actors/actresses seemed to actually study their lines before reading them.  Kudos.VisualsOK, this is not the Playstation 3 but not all of us gamers can justify spending a few hundred more on a glorified Blu-ray player.  Nonetheless, the textures and beautifully rendered as you can see the individual indentations on Chris' outfit as well as the blades of grass on the landscape.  The face animations almost go word for word with the dialogue but not quite yet.  The reloading animations are almost flawless as they are true-to-life.Sound and MusicWhoever did the music did a fine job unlike whoever did the weird music in RE4.  Electric sounds were still the dominate musical preference but the classical underscore blended well with each situation.  The sounds of the weapons, environment, and so forth were also well done.  They were so well done that I barely noticed them since my subconscious registered them as background noise.  It wasn't until my brother and I were sniping targets that we took notice of the ambiant noise.GameplayHere is where nearly all my complaints reside, but first some praise.  The interface is somewhat improved and a lot more face paced.  Switching between weapons is a LOT easier with the inventory system but that is also the source of some big problems.  The inventory system utilizes a 9-node slot system that runs in real time; which means when you're trying to acess an item, the game is still going.  Fortunately, if you organize the items in a d-pad like pattern you can access the items anytime by pressing the corresponding button on the d-pad.  However, this can only be organized between levels in the organization menu.  Capcom also improved the melee knife as it actually does damage this time and has a decent range.  Still, it should only be used when all else fails... or you're camping at a window *evil Bender laugh*.One of my largest beefs is the aiming and reloading.  You move at a very slow and cumbersome pace when aiming and the sensitivity CAN NOT be adjusted.  This makes taking cover and picking out targets a LOT harder.  Also, when you're reloading you cannot move NOR can you halt reloading to move.  This means when you're reloading and you see an enemy about to deal a fatal blow, you're screwed and can only watch the horror.  This caused me to die several times.My next beef are some of the obstacles; two to be precise.  The first are the crocodiles, which only appear when you're really close and will kill you in one hit.  Hate them... hate them so much, but not as much as the killer mirrors (you'll know when you seem them.  They hit almost without warning and are REALLY annoying since you can't shoot them out.  However, they are most annoying when you enter a room and need to adjust them.  This is one of the few puzzles and the one that irritates me the most since it was too easy to kill your partner, necessitating they take cover while another does all the work.My biggest beef is the split-screen... WTF?  I thought widescreen bars were annoying on a standard screen but THIS is ridiculous.  They actually make the split-screen size smaller, place the first player one in the top right corner and the 2nd player on in the bottom left corner and black in the non-used space.  If you do not have a big screen TV, this will be a huge pain and can NOT be adjusted.  This should've been optional.All in all, RE5 is an amazing game but lacks in several areas in gameplay and was designed with veteran gamers in mind.  Overall, an 88%.-2% for predictability-3% for lousy split-screen for co-op.-5% for poor inventory interface-2% for lousy aiming","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2009"}

There is some new radio stations and songs in this edition. You play as a Eastern European guy named Nikko Bellic, There are alotta fun characters to meet.

Even the water on this one looks more realistic. You can also earn trophys on here. and its also multiplayer online to for the firs time. I chose this one cause my pc couldn't take the pc one.

It's got beautiful graphics (okay they are scary, but hey they are supposed to be).  The ability to have two characters team up was an improvement I enjoyed.  I've said before in previous reviews I am less than stellar at playing video games and an edge like having a second charcter was great for me.The story did seem a little out there if you've played previous versions simply because it is supposed to be before Resident Evil and the story just doesn't seem like it is playing that way.However, I don't play these games for the story (don't shoot me but I don't).I like the new drop system they have included so you don't have to worry with finding a box to put things in, but I didn't like the fact that some of the weapons take up 2 spaces and you end up not able to carry much with you.  I'd have preferred being able to carry items such as first aid spray and herbs as multiple items like the bullets.  It may be unrealistic, but for convienence it would be great.  Especially considering the time limit on the game for bonus items.  You have to finish the game within a specified length of time to get certain special items.  For folks like me that don't sit down and play a game straight through you never qualify for those items.These things don't take away from the overall experience of the game.  For me this game was scary and I loved every minute of it.  I'm a grown woman and this game could still scare my blood pressure into the high figures.  I loved every minute of it:)I hope that the creator of these games will get a little smarter and decide to contract to all the consoles in future instead of signing on for just one.  I'd love to be able to play these games on the PS2 simply because I hate the Gamecube controller size.Overall, I LOVE THIS GAME!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-14-2003"}

Mine was the original 'fat' PS2 and it was a real workhorse; it survived a good couple of drops to the floor and travelled around with me quite a bit. After a little over 5 years of good use, it finally quit on me and stopped reading discs.Since I haven't owned the 'Slim' version I can't comment on it specifically, but I can only imagine that it is a far improved version. One of my main complaints about the original was the disc tray in that it was somewhat fragile and I can see how it could break easily. On the slim version there is no disc tray at all so I think that would be a huge imrpovement and might make this slimmer console last that much longer.Sony's Customer Service have also always been very helpful to me and really solidify the confidence I have in Sony.As much as I want a Playstation 3, it just makes a lot of sense to me to go out and buy this PS2 Slim. Considering the huge price difference, the lack of backwards compatibility on the PS3, that I never went online with my original PS2, that this console has been tested and true and that there are so many titles I never got to play my first time around (God of War, Shadow of the Colossus, Guitar Hero, etc...) I am all but sure that I am going to get a new PS2 and delay buying a 'next gen' Playstation at least another year or more.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-05-2009"}
{"product_name":"B002I0JAVK","description":"","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"The Inmates are Running the City!!!","reviewText":"Arkham City is a bigger, badder, and better version of Arkham Asylum.  It's a perfect interactive blend of the Chris Nolan movies and Batman the Animated Series (2004-2008).Concept:  10/10!!!Hugo Strange has taken over an isolated part of Gotham City and turned it into a giant free range prison.  Unfortunately, Bruce Wayne is trapped inside with the world's most notorious villains.  But once he gets to his gear, he's BATMAN!  And that's a good thing because it means YOU'RE BATMAN!  In Arkham City, you can go anywhere, fight thugs, perform side quests, search for Riddler Clues, or continue with the main story at your own pace.  It's a Strong Candidate for Game of the Year.Story:  10/10In Arkham City, the Joker injects Batman with his own blood.  Aside from being really disturbing, Joker's blood contains a deadly virus.  Batman must infiltrate the territories of Two Face, the Penguin, the Joker, and many others to find a cure.  I don't want to spoil anything here, but this game is loaded with many of the Best Batman Characters of all time.Gameplay:  8/10There are five basic types of gameplay:  Combat, Stealth, Riddler Clues, Boss Battles, and Detective WorkThe Combat functions as it did before, but now there are more gadgets to unlock and more enemy types to battle.  There's a counter attack button, an attack button, an evade button, and a stun button.  Typically, you point in the direction of the enemy and press the attack button and Batman will perform the best fighting animation based on angle and distance.  The same is true with counter attacks.  Attacking enemies will have an icon above their heads when you can counter them.  If you press the button at the right time, Batman negates their attack and attacks them.  In a typical encounter, Batman fights about 4-20 enemies and if you're good, you can stand right in the middle of them and take them out with ease, because that's what Batman would do.Advanced Combat deals with gadgets.  During combat you can activate Batarangs, a Grappling Hook, Ice Bombs, Detonation Mines, or an Electrical Charge.  If you start to lose the fight, you can usually grapple hook out of there and escape.  Basically, as you are fighting, you want to dish out as much damage to enemies as possible, while countering their attacks.  After a while, you'll get really good at this and you'll have some great looking fights while feeling like Batman.The only downside to combat is that there are special enemies who you have to attack by pressing Evade, Evade, Attack, or Stun, Evade, Evade...  And it gets hard to remember what you have to do.  The game would have been much better if the function of the buttons never changed and some enemies were resistant to one attack or significantly more dangerous than the others.  If a special enemy hits you a few times, text appears telling you how to hit him.  At this point, you feel less like Batman.The Stealth Gameplay is very user friendly and much less punishing than other games.  Remember Metal Gear and Splinter Cell?  If a guy saw you, you had to play the last 15 minutes over?  Not here.  When Batman encounters enemies with guns, stealth helps out quite a bit, but it is not necessary.  There are gadgets to distract enemies (Sonic batarang), gadgets to incapacitate enemies (explosive gel), gadgets to render their guns useless (disruptor), environmental props that help you and hurt them (breakable walls, floors, ceilings, generators, floor grates...) And even if they see you, you can still fight your way out of it with a smoke bomb or special attack moves (disarm).  Batman can also see enemies through walls and plan a strategy to take them out.  You are not punished for not using stealth, it just helps.  If you play the game right and use your environment, the guards don't stand a chance... because you're Batman!There are 440 Riddler Clues and Challenges in the game that unlock arena battles, arena stealth games, concept art, trophies, Riddler Side Quests, etc...  They are scattered throughout the city.  Some you just need to find, while others require a puzzle.  To be perfectly honest... there are WAAAY TOO MANY!  I've gotten about 120 of these so far, and I am starting to hate video games.  To get some Achievements, you have to:  Find the clues on the map, solve the puzzle to get the clue, unlock a mini-game, play the mini-game in ranked mode and do awesome on it...  It's too much.  Proportionally, 33% of the game is the main quest.  67% of the game are these damn clues.  The good news is that they are optional.  Because you want to be Batman, not the Riddler's B****.The Boss Battles are fun and require you to use combat skills, stealth, or both.  They're very cinematic and satisfying!  And they showcase the awesomeness of Batman!Because Batman is also a detective, there are parts of the game where you use your CSI skills to track down an enemy.  These are pretty simple, yet rewarding and lead you to other quests.  This is what Batman does.Navigation:  10/10Batman can use his grappling hook to quickly pull himself through Arkham City, or use his cape to quickly glide through areas.  It's really easy and fun to get from one end of the city to another.Graphics:  9/10Arkham City, the characters, the visual effects, all look great.  The game is also playable in 3D mode so you can feel even more like Batman!!!  The areas of Arkham City are very stylized and look like they came right out of a Chris Nolan movie.  The characters are a blend of psychotic and creepy, and Batman looks great.Sound:  9/10The music is suspenseful, epic, and exciting.  The voice acting well cast and well acted!  The dialogue is funny / creepy.  The FX punctuate the action!Maturity:  TIt's a violent graphic novel come to life... or an interactive Batman Movie.  There's violence, blood, and insane villains.  Mild Language because this is a city full of criminals, but it's not like a Quentin Tarantino film.Replay Value:  6/10After you finish the game, there are the Riddler Challenge Arenas, a Hard Mode, Downloadable Content, and a Super Hard Mode where the combat is tougher and there are no visual indicators over the bad guys' heads.  The only problem with the replay is that the combat lacks depth and starts to feel repetitive if you do all of the extras.  The main campaign is about 10 hours long, 14 with the side quests.  If you do the Riddler Challenges, that could be another 12 hours.  That's another 12 hours of fighting, without any new story elements, gear, enemies...  The gameplay starts to feel like a grind at that point.Overall:  9.5/10This is a GREAT Action Game!!!  The graphics, story, and sound create the perfect atmosphere for a Batman Game.  The gameplay is easy to learn, forgiving, and fun.  It does get a bit stale if you play all of the extras though.Buy it if you want to be Batman!Buy it if you love Batman!Buy it if you loved Arkham Asylum and wanted a bigger, better version of it!Buy it if you love sandbox games.Rent it if you have about 12-14 hours to blow through the campaign and side quests.Avoid it if you really need deep combo juggle combat like Ninja Gaiden or Bayonetta.Avoid it if you don't like dark stories.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2011"}

InFrontline, you go behind enemy lines as Lieutenant Jimmy Patterson. Your missions include the D-day assault on Omaha Beach, tracking your Nazi nemesis aboard a speeding armored train, the epic battle for control of the Nijmegen Bridge, a strategic choke point in the Allied drive into the heart of Nazi Germany, and a top-secret, high-risk mission to steal the Ho IX flying wing. The Ho IX is an experimental Nazi jetfighter so powerful it could turn the tide of World War II.There are 20 levels of gameplay spread across six major missions, all based on real World War II events and all adding up to one complete and uninterrupted story line. Fully realized and highly-detailed 3-D environments include six times the number of nonplayer character animations as in the originalMedal of Honor. The game includes detailed German, British, and American troops, as well as Dutch civilians, all with full facial expressions and lip synch. More than 20 authentic WWII weapons include the Colt .45, Springfield sniper rifle, Panzerschreck rocket launcher, MG42 mounted machine gun, and the Browning automatic rifle. Enemy vehicles include panzer and tiger tanks, trucks, motorcycles with sidecars, and armored railway scout cars. There are also player-driven motorized railcars, trains, and mine carts.An improved enemy AI requires you to consistently vary your attack strategy as the situation dictates. Go it alone to accomplish your mission with the utmost stealth or work as part of a highly trained military unit to wreak havoc on the enemy. The game offers intense noncombat scenarios as well, such as a disguised, weaponless infiltration of an officer's pub brimming with Gestapo to make contact with a Dutch Resistance operative.Medal of Honor: Frontlineincludes more than 70 minutes of original orchestral music from composer Michael Giacchino, and the game as a whole features eight times more audio than the originalMedal of Honor.","reviewerName":"Stewart J.

Just two minutes into the game when you storm the beaches of Normandy, I was totally hooked.  The realism of the effects of bullets zinging by your head along with sounds and the AI of the computer was amazing.  It took me a few times to get through the first mission, but it was worth the trouble.  The other missions didn't let me down.  I feel guilty about my other games; I don't spend time with anymore since I started playing MOH.  I think they're getting jealous.  Oh well!!!  The gameplay is outstanding, and the missions are unique.  I just hope I get to play with the shotgun more often.  I love the moans they make when I pelt them in the chest with buckshot.  I wish there was a gore feature to add blood.  That would be cool.  If you've seen my review on No One Lives Forever, you'll find out that I kicked it to the curb to play this treasure.  Although I'm about halfway through MOH, I just gotta play the Normandy beach seen again, this time with the lights out.  Til I finish this game, the others will have to take a backseat.

Every battle is unique, from commanding your party members to initiate different actions, from the main character running in circles around the battlefield, targeting different enemies, Tales has it all. You'll feast your eyes on this little wonder and smile. The story? None better, in my humble opinion. You'll latch onto the characters like they are your best friends. In conclusion, before I run out of space for this review, BUY IT, enjoy it, live it. You won't be disappointed with the purchase of this gem from Namco. The Gamecube gets major shock therapy from this wonder of wonders, and role players will have a story they can talk about for years to come. Ex Celsior!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2004"}

{"product_name":"B00149MEWI","reviewerName":"Poisoned Blade","summary":"A Good Survival Horror Game!","reviewText":"Silent Hill Homecoming is the 5th installment of the series on the Consoles.  Known for it's scares, good stories, and overall creepiness; this one delivers.  Fans of Silent Hill should pick this one up.  The story is good, the acting is good, the combat system is VERY MUCH IMPROVED, the AI is good, and the puzzles support the story / atmosphere.  The game has 5 different endings, depending on your actions.Adam Shepherd has returned to his home in Shepherd's Glen from a military hospital after being wounded in combat.  His brother and father are missing and his mother is catatonic.  To make matters worse, the city is overrun with nightmarish creatures!  As the story progresses, the town's past, Adam's past, and the horrors are explained.  The story is also consistent with the past games and the movie.  It's my second favorite Silent Hill story.  (Silent Hill 2 was the best!)Adam navigates through abandoned buildings and there are still plenty of doors to check.  At times you must walk down a hallway with 10 doors, and maybe 2 of them actually open.  Action gamers may get bored by this, Silent Hill fans expect it.  It didn't bother me because I was always curious to see what was behind the doors... sometimes clues, weapons, ammo, health, and horrors.  Once you try a door, it appears on your map as either functional or blocked.  The levels are also straightforward, so it's pretty hard to get lost.This is the best playing Silent Hill game so far!!!  You can block or dodge enemy attacks and exploit their weaknesses.  You can also dodge + counterattack for extra damage.  The combat is fun, where the combat of Silent Hill in the past was just tedious.The enemies in the game all have their own strengths and weaknesses.  It takes a while to figure them out, but the loading screens give you hints on how to defeat them.  It's actually fun to fight them.The puzzles in the game are pretty simple and there are plenty of clues.  They also tie into the story.  In the past, some of the Silent Hill puzzles were completely random.  For the most part, the puzzles in this game are good.The only knock against the game may be the graphics.  They look like a first generation 360 game.  But, you're in the dark most of the time and the game still manages to be creepy.The sound effects and music are some of the creepiest that you'll ever hear!Overall, the game is about 10-12 hours long and there are 5 different endings, so there's some replay value.If you're a fan of Silent Hill, you've gotta pick this one up (or at least rent it.)  If you're a fan of survival horror games, check it out.  You're in for a treat!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-09-2008"}
{"product_name":"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"D. Everts","summary":"Very much loving this mouse.","reviewText":"If you're in the market for a new mouse, I can highly recommend this product.This is a wireless mouse with the ability to plug it in and still use it while it charges.  This should really be a standard feature on all wireless mouse these days though it is not.This is billed as a gaming mouse and I think for most people it will be all they need.  It has many programmable buttons and the software to back it up well. It has the ability to adjust dpi on the fly and change the threshold of those adjustments.There is one feature on this mouse that I really enjoy and I don't think I could live without it into the future.  The scroll wheel actually has two differing mechanical settings.  It has your normal setting like most mouse where you feel the little clicks as you scroll and on screen it jumps with each click. The second setting is a very smooth non clicky spin which is very sensitive.  You can turn this second setting on and spin the wheel very fast and scroll through major documents with ease.  You can also use it slowly and not get the weird finger fatigue you can get with the click version.Now this is not a digital setting.  This is mechanical, there is a button beneath the scroll wheel that when pressed changes between the two.Again, I absolutely love this feature and hope that more companies take notice of this and incorporate the same into their mice.Battery life is decent.  There is a button on the bottom to turn it off when not in use but I never use it.  I can usually get a couple days relatively heavy use before needing to plug it in, but you can still use it while its plugged in so even that is no bother.  I usually get about 4 or 5 days on regular use though so its really decent with the battery life.Ergonomically it feels comfortable in my hand.  Its more of a palm mouse and I like that.I love this mouse.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Teco","summary":"The REAL truth about this game!!!! MUST READ!!!!","reviewText":"Mario has been a classic and famous character since the begining of Nintendo Corp. I have played all games of him since the launch of the NES and I simply love him (his games). Finally the Gamecube version will arrive, and its looking good. Check all of its features below:- It is the first Mario game in which you won't have to save the Princess.- It takes place on a tropical island, far from the mushroom kingdom.- Mario decides to take a well deserve vacation after being held as a painting in Luigi's Mansion. But unfortunately, his vacation will turn out to be a new adventure for him to kick some butt.- Mario uses an H2o machine on his back to spray water, throw bubbles, use water pression to float in the sky like a jet-pack, and much more.- For the first time, Mario will be able to do his famous tornado (seen in Super Smash Bros. Melee)- Also for the first time, Bowser won't bother you!... maybe (believe it or not, there is a possiblity for a Bowser appearance. Can it be true?)- Collect Sunshine coins- Triple jump, jump, swim, bounce of walls, butt-stomp enemies, and more.- NO KOOPAS ARE SHOWN IN THE GAME!!!!!! (I am just clearing something that another reviewer wrote)- Solve lots of puzzles.Overall the title seems worth it. If you put me to choose between this game and Star Fox Adventures, I would prefer Star Fox for just a bit, but come on, pre-order them both.

For the first time ever you can play the original Mega Man 1 through 8 series, along with two cool arcade games never before released in the U.S. That's 10 Mega Man games on 1 disc! Add to that, original footage from the Mega Man TV series, more than 30 original artwork selections and remixed music tracks that were inspired by the series.","reviewerName":"Dmg","summary":"Mega Man Anniversary Collection is mega-fun!","reviewText":"This collection is awesome. It contains all the original NES Mega Man games (I - VI) along with the SNES Mega Man VII and the PSX Mega Man VIII. Also, it contains the Japanese-only Mega Man: The Power Battles and Mega Man: The Power Fighters arcade games as unlockables. That's not all though! An entire episode of the original Mega Man cartoon TV series, remixed music, and concept art are all unlockable as well!There's so much entertainment value in this collection it's ridiculous. Each Mega Man game is incredibly entertaining (and frustrating!); let alone eight of them and two arcade games on ONE DISC. Ten complete games of this magnatude on a single disc is astounding and worth $50+ alone. The game is so cheap ($30 for brand new) because newer generation gamers expect Final Fantasy XII graphics, AI, music, etc so a collection of older games may not entice them. However, Mega Man Anniversary Collection will provide you with countless hours of gaming fun as you nostalgically play through some of the best NES games ever released, along with very fun SNES, PSX, and arcade games. The unlockable extras really add to the package and are actually worth unlocking.Each game is left intact and its entirety, except for two additions that are some nice little pluses thrown in to the games. First, the games feature some nice newly remixed music. Not all of the games do, however (the first NES games only contain a few remixed tracks). Second, there's difficulty settings and a &quot;Navi&quot; mode (which can be enabled in the Options menu) that provides updated life-meters, tips, and more.Load times are cut down to nothing, the menus for selecting which games to play along with options and such are simple and easy to use, and every game looks, acts, and feels exactly like they did as the originals. This is defintely an amazing package; it's 100% perfect all the way around.The X series and Gameboy series aren't in this collection, but Mega Man Anniversary Collection is full enough with everything it offers straight off the bat and as unlockables. However, there's even a Gameboy Advance version of Mega Man Anniversary Collection containing the five original Mega Man Gameboy games, with extras! Capcom will surely notice how well this collection will sell (it's already been sold out in a lot of places; act quickly!) and eventually release the X games as a collection, possibly with even more games and extras included.Mega Man Anniversary Collection is a must own for any Mega Man fan, platformer/action fan, or NES-nostalgia fan. Simply put, it's for any gamer who wants a good old-fashioned (albeit frustrating sometimes due to the difficulty...but that adds to the fun!) gaming time. These games stand up to the test of time like champions. If you want gorgeous graphics, go with Doom 3. If you want a strangely cheap, extremely entertaining and addictive, plain old FUN time, go with Mega Man Anniversary Collection.Pick this up now for the cheap price! HIGHLY recommended!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2004"}

Played Fallout, Fallout 2, and Fallout Tactics.  Played each through multiple times.  When word first came about this new direction for the Fallout world, I was on the fence but knew the studio doing the development was solid.Fallout 3 Delivers!  I found the game incredibly fun with much of the same style and gameplay of the original except from a new point of view.  Starting out I just in awe of the size and detail of the maps as they felt like they just went on and on forever.  It gave me a huge bug to just dig in and explore this world!Another big part of Fallout is the story of course.  This one was rather good but could have been better at least for my tastes.  I did enjoy most of the little side quests, at least for a while.However I am the type of player that loves to explore and be rewarded for it which brings me to the things I did not like.While the side quests were neat, they got repetitive fast.  After the initial fun of exploring, the whole world felt too similar.  Then it got to the point where there was just not enough new equipment to justify exploration anymore.The weapons were frustrating becomes only a few were actually worth using.  Some were just so cumbersome to carry and not very accurate that it was not worth messing with, especially when ammo is in short supply.  I always found myself hording the 'nice weapons' and their ammo but in the end always used what was the most efficent and with easy access to ammo... which means the hunting rifle.  So here we needed more variety and better ability to get ammo for the weapons.Transportation.  Other than some of the barriers and such, the teleport function while efficent really ruined the maps.  Walking sucks for some parts but they should have put in a car and/or motor bikes.  It would have been super kool to been able to salvage some of those cars around and turned it into your own vehicle to store stuff like some of your heavy weapons.  Huge missed opportunity here IMO.House.  They should have allowed you to take an empty building and make it your personal base.  Allowing you to stock it up and hire guards to defend against attacks... and then forcing the player to defend it every now and then.Story was good as I said earlier but could have been way better.  They should have explored more into the various factions and let you as a player develope with them.  Some factions you do not get to interact with until late in the game but you never really get to do much with them.  These parts felt too driven with not as much freedom to go your own path.  The whole water angle was a nice idea but should have been a smaller point of a larger struggle.Now while these are all things I believe the game should have done better, I still loved the game and have put crazy hours into it.  I highly recommend this game and am looking forward to a true sequel.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-30-2009"}

The most common criticisms that I heard about GTA IV were the lack of extras and the clunky controls. Well, in this sequel Rockstar definitly improved on the extras but fell very short when it came to controls.PROS:-New and useful weapons, but not that many, like the sawed-off shotgun, sticky bombs, and grenade launcher.-Gang wars and drug wars, pretty awesome, although there is sometimes a little too much driving or chasing down involved that becomes a pain and gets repetitive after a while.-More missions obviously, around 50 total, but not much new or different in variety from GTA IV's missions though.-In TL&D;, you can call your crew for backup and lead them, even on missions.-Can get a free bike or car driven to you, a gun van with discounted ammo & weapons driven to you, or free weapons/ammmo dropped off at your safehouse. ALL by just calling a friend, and you basically don't have to do anything to get these options.-A load of racing, mostly on bikes.-New achievemants, a total of 500 points worth. You should be able to get a fair amount of AP, at least 300/500, from one playthrough.-Lot of little activities you can still do and more: cage fighting, racing, base jumping, playing cards, video games, pool, golf, dancing at clubs, managing clubs, bowling, darts, booty calls, etc.CONS:-Clunky controls.-In TBoGT, you get rated on missions which makes it more challenging but less fun in my opinion. Some of the things you get rated on is time, firearm accuracy, car damage, headshots, etc. Also, in order to get a 45 point achievemant you have to score 80% or above in ALL missions, and 100% to get another 80 point achievemant. Possible, but not easily and not without replaying at least a couple missions.-In TL&D;, you can't run very fast or sprint for as long for some reason, and if you walk around with an assault rifle or shotgun you move even slower, which is more realistic but much more annoying.-Can't whistle for a taxi to stop, you have to cut if off or chase it down. This pissed me off greatly.-As far as driving goes:1.Driving cars and riding motorcycles feels like you're sliding on oil.2.Braking is garbage, often you won't be able to stop in time to make your turn or exit and you'll have to make a U-turn.3.And if you decide to use the handbrake you'll spin out of control half the time.4.It's easy to go flying off your motorcycle when your chasing someone down or racing.-There are barely any planes, boats, or tanks in Episodes. Also, the helicopters you do fly in TBoGT are terrible to control.-Stories and characters aren't really anything special, but new if anything.-You cannot play online with players that own only GTA IV and have bought the add-ons on Xbox Live. Therefore, you can only play online with others who have bought Episodes.BOTTOM LINE: If you didn't like GTA IV do not get this game, but if you're looking for a glorified expansion pack then this game was meant for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2009"}

Depending on how much you put into it, you can also get a cardio workout while playing.  You can select your own songs to dance to - everything from Mashed Potato to Eye of the Tiger to Hot and Cold or you can let the game suggest a song for you.  Each song is rated by the difficulty of the dance moves and the effort required with a 1-4 star rating.  After a few of the songs rated with a 3 star effort, I felt like I'd had a workout.  Up to four people can play at the same time so it's a great game for a party or family night.  There are some issues with the game not scoring moves equally.  Sometimes you get a great score for a move and when you repeat the exact same thing, you get a zero.  That wasn't really a big deal for us because I was having so much fun I didn't care what the score was.  Just Dance is not going to be challenging for the people who have mastered Dance Dance Revolution(DDR).

Ubisoft hadn't come up with that idea until Just Dance 2. I bought this game at the exact same time as I bought Just Dance 2 because I knew a few more songs on this game than the Just Dance 2 & I figured I should have them both.  I'm glad I bought this game as it's played with almost as much as Just Dance 2.  It's officially called \"Just Dance\" but I call it \"Just Dance 1\"  Ubisoft improved Just Dance & made the sequel even better.  I'm still glad to have them both as they're both fun to dance.  I like them both.  The girls like play & dance to this game after they finish dancing to \"Just Dance 2\".If you buy this game, you'll definitely want to buy the sequel.  It's good to have both of these games.  They're similar in some ways & different in other ways. I've noticed that girls & women play this game more than boys & men.  Men & boys only play it when they're competitive & want to prove they can score well too.  My personal observation with friends & family is that the interest level is mostly girls/women ages 3 - 54.  Older people don't seem keen on it at all for some reason.I like to dance along to a few of my favorite songs on here after I dance to Just Dance 2 favorites.  To give you an idea of how kids can quickly change their minds: 3 girls ages 8, 9, & 10, watched me dance to this game.  They weren't interested at all & were just waiting for me to stop so they could play Just Dance 2.  Then something odd happened: I bumped into the girls trying to find their remotes & dance along!  They didn't know any of these songs but liked the graphics & dance steps (I also think they wanted to see if they could get a higher score than \"old\" Grandma Beth! (if 41 is considered old!) After that visit, their Moms called me to ask where I got it & how much it was because that's all they heard about from their daughters: Grandma Beth's Just Dance 1.  No wonder they couldn't find it on amazon with an odd title like that!  Ha!  Anyway, the girls all have this game along with Just Dance 2 & play both often at their houses as well as at mine.Another time I attended a large party for some family friends (most of whom I didn't know) & to my delight, one of the ladies wanted to play her Just Dance 1 to show her friends.  A bunch of us joined in for this impromptu party game.  The men disappeared to the other TV to watch a football game (since we took over their tv) while the rest of us played.  The ages of us women ranged between 13 - 50. Good fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2011"}

Disney characters? You mean little Mickeys and Minnies in a game? Really, give it a chance. The game can be played by those under 10, but it's captivating for teenagers and adults too!First, the graphics are just AMAZING. The characters are all amazingly rendered. From Donald Duck to Goofy with their curves, to Tidus and Wakka from FFX and Selphie from FFVIII and more. There are different textures in each world, from the Jungle planet of Tarzan to the rooms and gardens of Alice in Wonderland, to the Coliseum of Olympus. They're all lovingly rendered in gameplay, and the cutscenes are gorgeous.Next, plot and gameplay. The 'heartless' have come to attack the various worlds, and you must investigate to figure out what is going on. There are many quests on each planet, all quite fun and logical. There are other cross-world quests, such as finding all 99 Dalmatian puppies or tracking down missing pages in a journal.Your main character, &quot;Sora&quot;, can be with Donald, Goofy, Tarzan, and other characters during these quests. In addition, he learns the ability to get help from other characters, such as Dumbo the Elephant. There is a lot of puzzle solving, but also a lot of combat as you fight off the shadow creatures.You get to choose your character type in the beginning - warrior, guardian or mystic. You also get to shape your personality by answering three questions about what you treasure in life, what you fear, and what you hope for. You level up as you go along, getting more strength and more skills.There are normal and hard settings, so you can set it to normal for the kids in the house and set it to hard for those looking for more of a challenge. There are a lot of witty references in the game that adults will be sure to love, and the younger ones will be happy seeing goofy and pluto protecting the land from the enemy.Final Fantasy players have always loved the romance that weaves through the FF series, and Kingdom Hearts provides that as well. Sora is in love with Kairi, and she is lost at the beginning of the game. So part of his quest is to find her and protect her. The scenes of him sitting on the dock by the ocean talking with her, as the sun sets slowly, are simply beautiful.Highly, highly recommended for any gamer of any age!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2002"}

So I bought it and the first time that I played it I was a little shocked. But, as they say, you get desensitized. First let me tell you about the gameplay. Since the game's main plot is killing for sport, there are plenty of weapons and techniques to help you along the way. Some weapons are: wire (can use to cut off head and make a lure), plastic bag (suffocate them to death, then break neck), machete (cut off head in three meaty hits), crowbar (break back then stab the brain), shotgun (blow off the head), baseball bat (break their neck then beat off their head, with chunks of brain matter splattering all over the place), and on and on and on.. you get the point. That was only a few of the weapons. And how you excecute someone is you sneak up behind them, hold X or A for about five seconds, then let go and watch the blood spurt on the camera. Definitely not for the weak of stomach.The sound is very good, and if you've got surround you can hear where the hunters are. Very useful. Also the kills make very wet sounds, more so than needed.The graphics are very good. Not as good as Ninja Gaiden, but they are better than most.Control is very easy and the first couple of levels will tell you how to use it.And lastly, content matter. I would definitely not get this game for anyone under 15, as there is extremely graphic, horrible bloody violence and gore and also the swearing is exremely abundant and also it is the cruder words that are said more often. You can however turn the sound effects off. Also don't get this for anyone who is can't tell games from real life or anyone who is naturally angry. There was a case in UK about someone killing a guy with a clawhammer (found in the game) and cops found a copy of Manhunt in his room. If you don't control yourself, this game WILL change you and make you more angry and violent. although well done, there aren't many people i can recommend this game to due to the content matter.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2004"}

I stumbled upon a copy of The Lost Chapters for $10 and almost didn't get it. I'm definitely glad I did. The extra main quest doesn't take long, but it's very fun and makes this a more complete game. And having extra side-quests and towns to go to makes it totally worth playing.For those that can't handle the massive open-ended Morrowind or Oblivion, but still want an adventure RPG in a similar style, this game is for you. The graphics are excellent, even though a little cartoonish, but I think their very unique. The music is quite good and the gameplay is fun and challenging. The story is basically your character's life. When he's a boy until an old man, or until the end of the main quest. It's not incredibly interesting with Jack of Blades, who is a bit underdeveloped and very mysterious, and your sister, and mother, but it's decent enough.We all know the story isn't the main thing here though, it's your character. Your actions and your looks are the big thing with Fable. You get to customize your character throughout the game. Haircuts, tattoos, clothing, you name it. And when you drink too much beer, you get a big gut, and when you kill everyone and steal, you grow horns and are surrounded by flies, and your eyes turn red.

{"product_name":"B000HFGKN4","description":"super castlevania IV 4 for super nintendo","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"gotta play this great game","reviewText":"Let me mention some things about Super Castlevania IV that jumped out to me while playing the game.The graphics are pretty dated by this point (what's it been? 18 years since this game came out?). Yeah, the graphics are definitely dated and obviously weak-looking by todays standards.  That's not really a problem of course!The music is mind-blowingly terrific, catchy, and absolutely fitting for each of the stages and environments. In a few cases I was even totally shocked. It's simply much better than many of the themes from any given Mario or Zelda game from the same time period, and that's TRULY saying something isn't it?Like most people, I always thought Symphony of the Night had a really good orchestral soundtrack, but for a game that came out in 1991, Super Castlevania IV comes mighty close in a few levels of MATCHING the spectacular music featured in SOTN.  I was absolutely stunned in a couple of the stages over the sheer brilliance of each note keeping me completely interested in hearing more.The play control is actually not that bad. Certainly an improvement compared to the NES Castlevania games, Simon moves around accurately and comfortably enough for any player to eventually adjust to it. Of course his movements aren't NEARLY as smooth as, say, Alucard from Symphony of the Night.  Good enough that with some practice, you'll be able to pull off walking and whipping like it's perfectly natural.The grapple feature works exactly the same way here as it does in Super Metroid, except in this game, in some areas you absolutely HAVE to grapple through certain areas. The momentum and build-up to swing freely and with precision and everything else about the grapple is exactly the same in both games.  For some reason though, I find it easier to pull off the move with Simon.  Doing the grapple move in Super Metroid sometimes doesn't work the way you'd like it to for whatever reason.  Never figured out why.Some people criticize the game because of its length. It's supposedly a short game for many people. Not to me it isn't! It takes me a couple hours to reach the final stage.Of course, that brings me to my next point- the difficulty. That's one reason WHY the game is so long, because you die frequently.Castlevania veterans will find the game easier than most- meanwhile Mario and Metroid fans like myself find the challenge in Super Castlevania IV overall VERY hard. Dying repeatedly is something you can fully expect, mainly because there's some areas where the amount of enemies that appear on screen can be overwhelming, and Konami apparently had this idea in mind while making the game to PUT said enemies in tricky spots throughout the game, where it's not always so easy as just repeatedly smacking them with the whip.  Sometimes when it gets a little too hot in the kitchen, you might have to ask yourself which enemy you'd rather take out first, so the other one doesn't pose a problem.  A little strategy involved here.  I like it.The password system is great.  You have to write down 3 different shapes (heart, dagger, or potion) and put them in a certain order that occupies 16 slots.  Also make sure you write down the name you chose for your character.  It's easy.  Nothing like, say, the original Metroid's password system, haha.Also, just so you know- this isn't the kind of game where you are free to explore everywhere. Nope, the game consists of 10 or 11 levels with a boss fight at the very end of each one, however in my opinion most of these are definitely LONG levels that make the game feel much bigger overall. However, I will admit I still prefer the \"free to explore everywhere\" style that the Castlevania series is now better known for.Anyway, the VARIETY of enemies you will see in the game is absolutely fantastic. More variety than I was honestly expecting, by FAR. Every creature that stands before you is quite distinct in appearance, and was responsible for influening the way they look today, thanks to games like Symphony of the Night.  It's like this game was just the stepping stone for the creation of the bad guys, and over time as better technology became available Konami was able to make them how they originally wanted.The boss fights are honestly better than the ones in Symphony of the Night. Seriously, they're really impressive looking, and their level of difficulty is a significant increase compared to the bad guys you encounter throughout the regular levels.I'm surprised how much ground the whip covers.  It seriously extends REALLY far!  Enough distance that it should be considered cheating!  However later on in the game when the challenge goes up, you'll be grateful for that extended whip.  Every time you die you lose your whip extention (along with your hearts) but all you have to do is smack a few candles and you should be good to go again.Also, I feel REALLY embarrassed how many times bats actually hit me, haha.  Bats should never be a problem to take out, but in this game they most certainly are!Well, the Super Nintendo needed a Castlevania game, and thankfully Konami delivered with a masterpiece real early in the consoles young life. Super Castlevania IV is just a terrific way to carry on the legacy that is the classic side-scroller Castlevania franchise. A game everyone should have fond memories of after their first playthrough.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0000296O5","description":"SquareSoft has always had a sure-fire hit when releasing any of theirFinal Fantasytitles, andFinal Fantasy VIIIshould be no exception. The basis of a good RPG (role-playing game) has always been the story; spectacular graphics are secondary.Final Fantasy VIII's involved and interesting story line is filled with great twists, well-developed characters, suspense, and romance. As an added bonus, the graphics are beautiful. Everything--from the low-lit jazz club to the steam-filled railroad tunnels--is gorgeous and perfectly sets the mood and tone of a scene.The game mechanics are standard fare for an RPG: acquisition of items and spells, turn-based combat, experience points earned in combat allowing advances in levels. From exploration to battles to dialogue,Final Fantasy VIIIhas it all. However,Final Fantasy VIIIfalls to that great weakness of RPGs: random battles. While necessary for advancing in levels, the battles occur with such frequency that they can grow annoying, making for a tedious game experience.The epic storyline spans four discs--over 40 hours of gameplay--and is based around a mercenary cadet who finds himself caught up with an underground rebel faction. He winds up in a plot to assassinate the sorceress who has just seized power from the president.You could complain of limited replay value, but this gripe is of no consequence: the game is such a satisfying experience, it doesn't require replay.Final Fantasy VIIIis easily worth both the hype and the wait.

That means it had a lot of hype to live up to.  I suspect that's why some people will hate this game-- it just isn't FF7.  However, even though this game isn't FF7, it's an extremely good RPG that stands on its own merits.  It's one of my favorite games of all time (just as good as FF7, although my absolute favorite game is FF9).  Well, let's jump right into the review!Graphics (score 10/10): The graphics were superb when this game came out, and are still excellent, in my opinion.  I still find them pleasing to the eye.  Of course, I'm not nearly as picky as some people, and obviously, I recognize that it's graphics are older now, but they were magnificent for their time.Music (score 10/10): Wow.  When I first heard the opening song (Liberi Fatali), I was blown away.  The rest of the game's music doesn't dissapoint either.  Be it exciting songs or mellow tunes, FF8 delivers.  I actually went and bought the soundtrack, which I still listen to, to this day.Characters (score 10/10): Who doesn't love Squall? He's quite likeable in a grumpy anti-social sort of way....  Plus he's an excellent case study in avoidant-attachment disorder.  Ha ha... Seriously, though, the characters are very well-developed.  I love having unique introspection into the psyche of a main character.  The rest of the characters are excellent, too.  Everyone has a distinctive personality and a role to play in the story; no one feels like they were tacked on at the last minute just to increase the party size (a problem with some other RPGs I've played; I'm looking at you, FF12!).  The characters are portrayed very well and you will become attached to them very quickly.Story (score 10/10): The story, too, is excellent.  I was thoroughly engaged by it; it has just the right balance of character development and intriguing plot points to keep you entertained. I've played this game at least six times now over the years and I'm still not sick of it.Battle System (score 9/10): Combat is turn-based like most Final Fantasies.  You draw magic out of enemies to cast directly on enemies, or to equip as stat buffers.  It's fairly easy to learn this system. However, drawing magic over and over again and re-equiping it constantly (and also re-equiping GFs) can get rather tedious; that's what knocks the point off the score.  Other than that, the battle system is fine.  I especially like the ability to pull the trigger on the gunblade using the R1 button; it adds a level of fun interactiveness to the battles.Gameplay (score 10/10): This is a bit of a catch-all category for me.  Let's see, the first thing of note that comes to mind is the fact that enemies level up at the same rate as Squall.  That means that power-leveling is no longer desirable.  This might be disappointing to some, but I found it to be quite nice because the game isn't overly hard, and I didn't have to waste time power-leveling.  Another point of interest is that you eventually get a way to avoid random battles, which is awesome.  Another point is that there are plenty of mini-games and side-quests of sufficient variety available to enjoy (my favorite is the card game).  So, there should be plenty features here to please everyone.Overall (score 10/10): NOTE this score is not an average, it's my subjective overall score.  I might have given this game a \"8\" instead of a \"10\" if I had reviewed it when I first bought it, but now that I've played so many different RPGs over the years I realize what a treasure I really have in FF8.  This game really is awesome and I recommend it to all fans of RPGs.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2008"}

Summoned by urgent order, the player in the form of the lowly Prinny rushes to meet his boss, Demon Lord Etna in her chamber. You arrive just in time to see Etna beating your fellow prinnies to a pulp. She is definitely in a bad mood, being even more abusive and violent than usual. As it turns out, someone has snatched her favorite dessert from the fridge. Eager to vent her frustration, she orders you to hunt down the ingredients to create a new Ultra Dessert and promises that if you do not deliver the goods by the next morning that you will learn what eternal suffering really means. Since you are at the very bottom of the netherworld food chain, if not its gutter, you have no choice but to snap into action.GameplayPrinnyis a side-scrolling platformer filled with classic flavored gameplay that requires timing of jumps and memorization of the patterns of enemy movements. As non-threatening as dessert making might seem, nothing could be further from the truth. In the game players are given 10 hours and the use of 999 identical comrades from the Prinny Squad to defeat demon bosses spread throughout the game's levels who possess the necessary ingredients to create a new dessert for Etna. Although this may sound like way more than enough help, surprisingly challenging gameplay that consistently has players one blow from either victory or defeat and the nature of the prinnies themselves will quickly change player's perception on this.True to their origins in theDisgaeauniverse where their literal explosive nature makes them perfect cannon fodder to aim at enemies, prinnies are extremely volatile. Players can only only control one prinny at a time because you only possess one red scarf, which not only indicates your status as current game hero, but also keeps you from blowing up. Wave after wave of enemies within the game also conspire to exploit the prinnies' tendency towards combustion, and more often than not are successful, underlining the importance of your 999 friends. This means that players do not actually play as a single prinny. As one meets his end another takes his place and you are kept informed of how many prinnies you have left, as well as how many hours. Prinnies are not defenseless though. Players have use of a variety of attacks and moves like the 'Dual Sword Slash' to deal with enemies in front of you, the 'Hip Pound' which allows you to stun opponents with your bottom and standard platformer jump and sprint functionality for mobility. In addition, prinnies can lift and throw objects like bombs, stomp enemies and even pilot tanks and planes to bombard whatever gets in your way. The game comes with two modes: Standard Mode, which allows you to take damage up to 3 times before losing a life and Hell Mode where one blow means instant death. In this ridiculously comic adventure you will need every advantage if you hope to survive the cost of the ultimate sweet treat.Key Game Features:1,000 Units- Players will get 1000 lives to beat the toughest action of this platforming side-scroller.Lift &amp; Throw- Prinnies are able to lift and throw objects on the battlefield.Vehicles- Steal and control powerful vehicles, like tanks and UFOs.Hip Pound: Jump and pound enemies to stun them. Then you can inflict multiple combo attacks for extra damage.3D World with 2D Characters: InPrinny, character art is created using fluid 2D sprites, giving it a classic look with a comical tone. Battlefields and backgrounds, however, are created with 3D models. This allows for a smooth and unique combat action where certain attacks are rendered in a 3-dimensional view.Boss Battles Galore- 10 Major stages featuring many hidden characters and a boss waiting at the end of each.Music Collection Mode- Find music tracks during game and replay them as background music.Humor- Ridiculously comedic storyline and characters.","reviewerName":"Mali","summary":"I want to like this...I really do...","reviewText":"The story is humorous and complete, the scenery is beautiful, the graphics are good, the soundtrack and music is high quality, the voice-acting is flawless, the characters are cute. The controls are easy.This game has literally everything going for it.But it's so frustrating to play that it ends up being more agony than enjoyment.You will die. Over. And over. And over again. Then a few more times. There is a boss (or two together) at the end of every standard level (fire,ice,water,forest,etc.) and they would be possible to beat if you didn't have 4 hits that disappear faster than you can blink. Even when you figure out a good strategy to beat said boss, you will get randomly hit from the side just jumping or by a stray something or other. Then you die.Fortunately, when you die at each boss, you can exit out to the menu and pick another world. Die at boss and repeat.Unfortunately, my enjoyment of this game is cut short when I must quit each boss or throw the game in frustration. Then I think about what a high quality game it is and try again. And die.I like challenges in a game, but this is ridiculous...Don't be deceived by the impressive trailer. This game is so close to being great that it will piss you off...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2012"}

Don't get me wrong, it's a good game, but when compared to other chapters of the AC saga, it's depressingly bad in almost every regard!First, the game is without question the shortest Console based AC game released. When I finished the game, I was actually surprised because it FELT like I should only have been a little over halfway through. I mean, if the game was released on the PSP or Vita, then the length would have been acceptable, but for a console version? It just doesn't stack up!The graphics are nice! However, they aren't really any better than Brotherhood. So, while I wasn't too disappointed with the graphics, I also wasn't thrilled. I did expect more from the game, because it was a sequel, and I just naturally assume the graphics will be better than the previous title in the franchise.The story and setting was poor at best, and while it could have been worse, it could have also been so much better. It feels rushed, and because of that served as a disappointed. However AC3 made up for the lackluster performance of Revelations.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2013"}

{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"IdrilCelebrindal","summary":"The best of the Zelda franchise","reviewText":"I am not the world's most hardcore Zelda fan.  Nor am I exactly the most skilled at playing the Zelda games.  But I have played Zelda games on every system--from the originals on NES, the updates and new entries for GBC and GBA, to the introduction of 3D on N64.  Most Zelda fans will say that the best of the franchise is Ocarina of Time; an opinion with which I respectfully disagree.My first introduction to this game came through a demo that was on the Zelda promotion disc released for GCN.  Within a few minutes of playing, I knew that I was one day going to own it, no matter how long it took me to acquire the funds for purchasing; I had to own it.  The graphics and the gameplay were Just. That. Good.In general, I'm not one to get excited or negative about good or bad graphics in a game, but in one like WW, it's hard not to be excited.  Do not let the cel-shading turn you off--this entire game is an incredible universe of well thought-out, 360 degree exploration that is greatly complemented by the very meticulous and oftentimes truly extraordinary graphics.The gaming world itself is absolutely enormous.  With the entire world covered in water, the game confines itself to a 7x7 map of squares--but that itself takes half a lifetime to explore.  And it is more than worth it.  While the game starts out fairly linear, it's of a need, as it guides you through the prologue of the game, the eventual introduction and control of your boat, the Wind Waker, and then centers around exploration of the half a dozen most central islands to the story.  And from there, it branches out significantly--reaching a point in which, should you choose, you can spend hours upon hours traveling from island to island and mapping out the entire ocean within the given realm.  Traveling does take time, and can become monotonous for some--but fortunately, not long into the game, you can learn how to warp and significantly cut down on travel time.Gameplay is my favorite it's been for any Zelda game I've played.  While I became somewhat board with the manner of combat in Ocarina of Time--hit the monster, wait a few seconds till it attacks, hit it again and repeat ad nauseum--combat in this game is wild, fast and furious, by comparison.  At the start, on the island where Link starts out, you learn sword fighting from an older man, which includes some very, very cool techniques that can be used in different combinations of your A and B buttons with the control stick.  And the puzzles--both in and out of the dungeons--are far from dumbed down, but never were frustrating enough to make me want to stop.The game includes most of the familiar tools from previous Zelda games (boomerang, hookshot, etc) as well as the Deku Leaf--which allows you to fly using magic and ties nicely into the requisite of controlling the wind--and the grappling hook--which, among other things, allows you to steal items like feathers and hearts off your enemies when targeted.The dungeons play out in a less obvious manner than other Zeldas, though it does follow some of the commons.  However, there are only two that are officially referred to as \"Temples\" while they come up with more creative ways of dealing with all the others.  And the story surprised me in how it ties in with the commonality of the Zelda franchise--so much so that when I realized how it did all tie together, my jaw dropped, I fell more in love, and was officially hooked upon this game.The gamemakers opened themselves up to the potential of enormous possibilities with this game, and it never, ever lets you down.  There is so much to do, so much to explore, so many things to find...once the games reaches it's most non-linear, the possibilities will seem endless.  I have played so many games stuck on their linearity, the world felt more like filler--whereas in games like this, one is more than frequently rewarded for test and exploration.  And many games that try to add side-items to be found through exploration and side-quest usually disappoint.  In this game, for example, you can perform a side-question in which you will ultimately be given a mask that, when worn in battle, will show a life gage for that particular foe.  Certainly not a requisite for winning the game, but undeniably a useful tool.As I've already said, the gaming world is HUGE.  Every single square on the map has an island or fortress of some kind--and the ones not particularly relevant to the game usually have a mini-game or subquest of some kind that almost always leads to valuable rewards.  You find treasure maps scattered literally across the entire world, in which you can travel to the given island and use the grappling hook to dig up rupees, or a heart piece.  There are platforms, and fortresses.  And what's better (certainly an improvement from other Zeldas) there are maps that can be found that show (though don't detail) which of the squares have platforms, fairies, submarines, etc.Music is probably not my favorite, but it's far from being my least favorite, either.  Some themes are better than others--though are undeniably fitting for the given area or scenario--and I do absolutely love the music for Dragon Roost Island.  It really doesn't get much better than that.The game does have it's flaws, but what game doesn't.  For example, swimming in water can be really hard, and really frustrating.  I would climb (or be knocked) out of my boat and swim in circles while trying to get back to the proper position in which I could get Link back into the boat--made all the more frustrating by the fact that you can only be in deep water for a limited amount of time before you drown and lose a heart.  Also, while the targeting system is ultimately a brilliant way for dealing with combat in a 3-dimensional plane, I became frustrated when I encountered more than one enemy and, in trying to un-target one enemy, would automatically be transferred to the target of the other enemy.  Oftentimes, a particular task to or with that enemy would need to be performed while not targeting anything, and the only way in which I find to solve this problem was to back as far away from all the enemies as possible until they too far away for the targeting to stay on.  If there is another simpler, smarter way of dealing with this, I have yet to discover it.Hardcore Zelda fans have long since purchased this game and passed judgment, so anyone reading this is either not too familiar with the Zelda franchise, or, like me, somewhat of a newbie.  To either and anyone I would recommend this game.  It's one of my favorite console games I've played, and certainly the best I've come across for GCN.  Honestly, I love it so much, I can't way to play it again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2006"}
{"product_name":"B000084318","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"New design, same quality","reviewText":"Zelda games have so many fans for a reason. If you like rpgs, this is for you. It may look like a cartoon, but it's still as serious as the other games. And the characters have more personality. The graphics are cartoony, but they are near perfect. The scenes are quite colorful; most of them are bright, a few are darker. The music is pretty good. Nothing amazing, but it sounds nice. Characters look unique, with different races such as bird people, humans, and talking fish.Another thing that's new in this game is the wind waker. It's a little flute-like instrument used to control the wind. You get a small boat that you use the wind to move around. There are different islands which you visit on your boat. At each one is a fish that fills in a square on your map of the islands. You can also play a mini-game where you shoot at the fish with your bow and arrow, which is fun.The story is the usual save-the-damsel thing, but this time it's Link's sister rather than princess Zelda. It's Link's birthday and his sister loans him her telescope. While his sister is showing him how to use it, she spots a girl being carted off by a giant bird. Some pirates are trying to save her by shooting cannonballs at the bird, which may not be the best idea. The girl is dropped in the forest and Link sets out to save her. When he reaches her, some monsters attack, but he defeats them. The bird then comes back and kidnaps Link's sister. It turns out that the girl Link saved is the leader of the pirates, and she lets him come along on her ship in order to save his sister. And so goes the adventure. The plot has a few \"twists\", but isn't unique or very suprising.Combat is similar to Zelda games on the N64. It's easy to learn. It's action-style, you can dodge attacks, and you use a sword. There are a few other weapons to use, like a bow and arrow. None of the bosses are very difficult. There are a few extra quests to do if you'd like.This is a pretty good game all-around. I wouldn't say it's on the top ten best rpgs list, but it's worth a try if you like these types of games.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-23-2004"}

She gets punctured by a stalagmite, attacked by wolves, tumbles down multiple cliff sides, and is punched, stabbed, blown up, and shot by a variety of enemies. All of this is done with extreme realism. When she pulls the stalagmite out of her side, you feel it. Afterward, Lara limps along, clutching her side which visibly shows the bleeding wound. Because she's not just a caricature, these moments have greater impact. She goes through more punishment here than any character I've ever seen in a video game. This new re-imagining is not for the faint of heart. It's not without purpose either, as it's one of the most viscerally thrilling games I've ever played. The mysterious, nightmarish island Lara gets stranded on is full of wildlife to hunt, treasures to uncover, and of course, tombs to raid. You gain currency and xp as you go to upgrade weapons and skills. It's not open-world, but the large areas are designed to be re-explored. There's multiplayer that's fun enough, but getting disconnected after every match and struggling to find enough players is discouraging. This PS4 \"Definitive Edition\" includes subtle graphical upgrades, 1080p resolution, and 50-60fps over the 30fps on PS3. Lara begins her journey unsure and scared, and emerges at the end as strong and capable.

{"product_name":"B0002I0UIC","reviewerName":"TwistaG \"Quoth the Raven 'Nevermore\"","summary":"Could've done better","reviewText":"At this point, it's pretty safe to presume that the GameCube will always get the short end of the pro wrestling stick. WWE Day of Reckoning, like the two Yuke's projects to precede it, is a good game, but nevertheless overshadowed by what's coming out on PlayStation 2 a few months from now. The fundamentals are here, and wrestling fans looking for a solid multiplayer experience will get that and then some. Yuke's has nicked enough of Aki's gameplay mechanics from those beloved Nintendo 64 games and improved its own animation and collision detection to the point where, with a human controlling each competitor, the action is acceptably logical. Location-based damage works properly now, and it's explained with clearly visible gauges, making a submission-based attack worth the trouble. Two counter buttons balance reversal chances well enough, while mixing weak and strong grapples on one button saves controller space. This is still a Yuke's game, meaning that wrestlers will still occasionally refuse to sell a finishing move properly, and the factors that determine whether a wrestler will be dizzied getting up are hidden deep in the impenetrable guts of the game engine, but it's nowhere near as aggravating in that department as, say, two or three SmackDown!'s ago. It's when the AI gets involved that things fall apart. The computer-controlled wrestlers in this game are an interesting mix of capabilities. They're not very aggressive, definitely lacking in killer instinct, and they frequently fail to grasp how to go for the special victory conditions in a gimmick match. A tag partner is worse than useless, merely an obstruction -- consider a two-on-two bout with an AI partner a de facto handicap match. When they're on the defensive, though, they counter moves with preternatural ability. Even the easiest opponents in the early stages of the story mode can put you on the defensive in no time flat. This is aggravating, because Day of Reckoning's spirit meter -- which determines when a wrestler can pull out a finishing move -- gets a hefty boost from counters. Either you go after the CPU with an absolutely relentless attack and hope for the best, or you find yourself rapidly falling behind in the race to hit the big move. Ironically, it sometimes seems smarter to just completely sandbag it in the early stages of a match, because letting the AI max out its separate momentum gauge (which determines how fast the spirit meter fills) leaves it open to the preposterously cheesy \"momentum shift\" move. Hitting a simple two-button grapple on an opponent with a full momentum gauge performs some sneaky maneuver that swaps your empty gauge for their full one. It's a weird way for the game to reward a dominant performance. Day of Reckoning's ancillary modes are a mixed bag. The gimmick match selection is perfectly acceptable, with table, ladder, and foreign object behavior that are as good as can be expected. Create-a-Wrestler is surprisingly strong both in terms of the cosmetic options available (including multi-layered textures for clothing patterns and a hefty tattoo selection) and the move library, which features signature moves and even pre-made movesets for a fistful of Japanese and American stars who haven't officially made it on the roster. The only significant addition it could use is the intuitive dual-analog controls the SmackDown! games use for adjusting the size and shape of body parts. But then there's the story mode, promised to improve upon the nightmarish Revenge mode from last year's WrestleMania XIX. Story mode, unfortunately, has none of the freedom of choice offered in its cousin over on the PS2. There's no option to use an existing WWE competitor, only a created wrestler, and there are precious few branching points on offer. For the very most part, it's simply a continuous succession of matches broken up by subtitled cutscenes and interludes for redistributing attribute points. The mode's design is limited, but those limitations aren't necessarily the problem. The problem is that Yuke's and THQ seemed to simply give up on the prospect of doing anything interesting within them. None of the storylines present all that much drama (curious, considering that they could have been meticulously planned in advance), and the match gimmicks are often aggressively hostile to the notion of fun. Working a tag match where your AI partner has to get the pin is sheer hell, for instance. It boils down to sitting and waiting for the computer to get the job done, and as stressed above, the AI is as dumb as a sack of dead rats. Failure almost never leads to an alternative conclusion, just a screen asking if you'd like to try again. Eventually, there's nothing to be gotten out of the story mode but the extra create-a-wrestler options and hidden characters it unlocks. It's not any fun in and of itself. SmackDown! Just Bring It's story mode was also a useless obstacle in the way of various hidden features, but at least it had the decency to be short and simple, instead of a protracted exercise in self-flaggelation. The long and the short of it is, fine graphics notwithstanding -- this year's model has better arenas, improved sell animations, and much more dynamic camera presentation -- Day of Reckoning isn't much fun to play alone. But then not many wrestling games are, after all. For multiplayer grappling on GameCube, it will do just fine, and once again, there's always next year.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-01-2004"}
{"product_name":"B00006F7S8","description":"It's hard to believe that creator Will Wright had trouble selling his originalSimCityconcept to publishers. That first game went on to fame, notoriety, and great praise--from critics, gamers, and even educators--and spawned countless imitators, not the least of which include Wright's own smaller-scaleThe Sims, which went on to become a phenomenon in its own right. Now on its fourth edition,SimCityreturns to our hard drives, and would-be city planners everywhere will be busy for a long, long time.SimCity 4functions much like its predecessors. You've got the power to zone land as residential (green), commercial (blue), and industrial (yellow). You control the budget. You decide where to place crucial services like police, fire, medical, and even utilities like power and water. You place schools, parks, roads, water towers, and scenery as you accede to the many demands of your Sim citizens. Do a good job and your city will grow and the money will flow into your coffers. Do a bad job and the people will pack up and move away, leaving your city treasury in horrific debt and landing you what the game cheekily considers to be a far easier job: senator. The game requires a balancing act that takes both planning and a persnickety nature. There are charts to read, reports to watch, and, above all, needs to juggle. It's rewarding when it all comes together, and frustrating when you fail, once again, to build anything worthwhile.That's why I wish the game came with a better manual. The included book glosses over most major information and then neglects important aspects, such as the RCI indicator (which explains zoning needs) and parts of the budget. At the very least, the manual should include tips on handling debt. There are two tutorials which cover the basics, but again, they won't help you get out of trouble once you get in too deep. You can find this information in thestrategy guide, which is sold separately, but you really shouldn't have to go that route.The graphics are amazing, showing a vibrant metropolis with scurrying traffic, wandering Sims, smoking chimneys, and sparkling lights when night falls. Fireworks reward each year of service. And wait until you see the cool disasters you can unleash if the mood strikes you--fire, lightning, tornado, volcano, and giant robot. Oddly, there's a significant performance hit even on fast systems. Thankfully, the stuttery scrolling and slow-to-respond zoom don't hurt the game too much since you can pause it at will or fast forward if you need to wait for your cash reserves to build. The most significant flaw is that the game only offers one save slot, which discourages experimentation.Despite minor imperfectionsSimCity 4is an awesome game. You can build several cities next to each other on the map and make them dependant on each other. (You can build the greater L.A. area, in other words.) You can even import your Sims fromThe Simsto live in your city. Such familiar characters can tell you a lot about what your city needs. Put simply, city planning has never been this fun, this challenging, or this deep.--Andrew S. BubPros:Beautiful graphics and animationDeeper and more realistic than ever beforeCons:Runs slowly on most systemsInadequate manual","reviewerName":"Void Zero","summary":"ALMOST TOO REALISTIC","reviewText":"Well, it has finally arrived, and judging by the other reviews it seems that many people are not satisfied with Sim City 4.  I, on the other hand, find it to be a great city simulator with high educational value, especially in the areas of mathematics, geography, sociology, engineering, etc.You play as mayor, and you start a new city by building roads and establishing zones (residential, commercial and industrial).  As time progresses, the land begins to develop, according to land value and access to resources.  As your city's population increases, you add hospitals, schools, fire/police stations, courthouses, rail lines, seaports, airports, parks, and much more.  Small fires occasionally break out, riots flare up; the city becomes alive.  The toughest part of the game, in my opinion, is staying out of the red.  City services cost money, and people do not like to be taxed.  It's a complicated balancing act that gets harder as your city's population reaches one million inhabitants, and this problem is compounded by factors like crime and blight. If things get really bad you can resort to asking for loans and making business deals with other cities on the map.This is a very difficult game, but I am sure that being the mayor of a large metropolis in reality is no walk in the park.  Simcity 4 is a program that requires a high-end computer to run adequately, so keep that in mind before purchasing this product","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-27-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000GPVUOY","reviewerName":"Lestor neeker Wong","summary":"Shoot, Tequila, Shoot","reviewText":"You can see Stranglehold from two different perspectives. You can see it as a repetitive shooter that pits you against waves after waves of (cheap) enemies that suddenly appear from nowhere. Or, you can see it as a great homage to one of the great action movies of all-time, Hard Boiled. I choose the latter, and it was no wonder I had so much fun with it.The story isn't important, since intense action featuring Chow Yun-Fat as Inspector Tequila is the order here. But if you must know, it involves some dead cop and the kidnapping of Tequila's ex-girlfriend and daughter. Reason enough for a massive surge of killing? You bet.Playing through seven levels, you get to control Tequila and his array of skills (most have to be unlocked). Apart from the usual third-person shooting, you'll get abilities like the precision aim, which allows a first-person view, zoomed in, for a free-aim at whichever part of an enemy's body you see fit. Shooting at balls is highly recommended if you're sadistic. Like me.Other skills like the barrage allows a moment of mad, unstoppable shooting and invulnerability. But the most dramatic skills of them is, you guess, the spin attack. Much like the 1,001 movies that Chow has made, this attack involves the guy turning 360 degrees while shooting two guns at various enemies surrounding him. Doves are complimentary. I guess the doves must be there to moan the death of all those goons that dare stay within your vicinity when you does this thing.Using these skills are not free though. You need to earn the juice (ok, \"tequila bombs\") to use them, and using them reduces the juice. You earn it by performing stylish kills, helped by the fully destructible environments in the game. See a signboard above an enemy, shoot it, and it falls straight down to send the idiot to his maker. See a roll cart? Jump on top of it and start shooting people while moving around. See a gas tank near an enemy? Shoot it and enjoy the explosion takes care of matters. You can also combine these actions to score combos for more juices, so that you can use the above-mentioned skills more liberally.There's also the matter of \"tequila time\", which basically happens when you perform kills while interacting with the environment (like, when rolling on a roll cart or sliding up and down on a banister). What happens is that time slows when tequila time is on, giving more time to shun bullets as well as kill morons. You can also activate this by simply diving around and pressing one of the shoulder buttons. It looks great, and it works well. In fact, it's probably a life-saver for most players trying to beat the more challenging levels.On challenging levels, the game features four different difficulties. But even on casual, it becomes extremely painful to play through towards the end of the campaign. The enemy's AI is ridiculously aggressive, and you don't get to hide behind a wall like Gears of War for health recovery. Expect to die (many times) as you search for the best way to neutralize the threat. Things can tougher on the hard-boiled challenge (the most difficult mode) - a hit on you takes out 3/4 of your life! That's how it goes, and it isn't apologetic at all about it.It should be apologetic, however, about the last-gen graphics though. It wasn't so glaring on my old SDTV when I first played the game. But recently, I bought a HDTV, and the flaws are pretty obvious. I mean, when an environment looks dull even on HD, you know it's bad. The character models also look dated, even though they manage to capture the movement of the models quite smoothly. Audios wise, it's just a bunch of explosions and some action music. Nothing of major note here, but it does what it was required.All in all, Stranglehold is a fun shooter that recycles some old gameplay ideas (from Max Payne, I believe) rather successfully. The various attacking methods are fun to use, but the insane difficulty may scare some shooter noobs away. Engage with caution.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2007"}

{"product_name":"B000CQIDTC","reviewerName":"J. JAGELLA","summary":"Half-Life II: Episode One (Hour)","reviewText":"Back in 2004 I was eagerly awaiting Half-Life II along with many other gamers. I heard so much about it that I put it on my \"must buy\" list. When I finally got my hands on a copy, I can't say I was disappointed. The graphics were even better than those of Doom III's, and everything else seemed to be about right. Like the original Half-Life, the game was very engaging. I made up and posted in a gaming forum a list of my own personal \"2004 games of the year,\" and Half-Life II topped the list. Although I mentioned that I didn't consider Half-Life II to be a great game, I liked it nevertheless and said it was the best new game I played that year.For some reason I didn't get around to playing Episode One, the expansion to Half-Life II, until recently. Maybe the considerable system requirements kept me away for awhile, or perhaps I was busy with other games or even busy with work if any of you know what \"work\" is. In any case, Episode One just didn't seem to be compelling enough to try right away.Now that I've played Episode One, I can see that one of the most common observations about the game is correct: It is indeed \"short.\" I rarely feel a game is short, but with Episode One I cannot escape that conclusion. The first time I played it, it took me maybe seven hours to finish.What goes on during that seven hours? Simply put, much of it is rehashed Half-Life II. Alyx and \"Dog\" are back, and you'll see more of them in Episode One. Alyx, for instance, will be by your side for almost all of the adventure. Both indoor and outdoor areas look much the same as they did in Half-Life II although the graphics have been \"enhanced\" to allow for more robust lighting. You'll be peering down a narrow flashlight beam in some dark areas, but fortunately you won't need to swap your light for your weapon like in Doom III. You'll need to solve a lot of puzzles along the way, and much of the seven hours of the game you'll be engaged in finding solutions to those puzzles.Will you like Half-Life II: Episode One? I think most shooter fans will like Episode One. It looks good, has very good gameplay, and it follows in the footsteps of the older Half-Life games. Some gamers might gripe a bit about the short length of the game, but if quality matters more than quantity,  the length should not bother you too much.Did I like Episode One? I think it's a decent game. For the $10 I paid for it, I can't complain too much. My biggest gripe might be the incessant attacks of the ant lions, a holdover from Half-Life II. I didn't like the ant lions attacking in Half-Life II, and I don't like them in Episode One either. Once I discovered how to prevent the attacks of those annoying beasts, though, it didn't matter that much. Sometimes the less likable parts of a game are good in that it's a relief once those parts are done. Once Half-Life II: Episode One is finished, though, I can say that in some ways it's very impressive. For better or for worse, we need to live with the decisions of the game developers, decisions that lately seem to be poor decisions in many cases. In Episode One, I'd say those decisions were more often \"better\" rather than \"worse.\"","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-22-2007"}

Good story - bad acting that we all love and a decent FPS there is more melee combat than normal FPS i must say by necesity.  It seems you either have to shoot at close up or melee opponents as i emptied a whole 30- round clip from long-distance in an enemy before he finally died.

{"product_name":"B00HVBPRUO","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"They Work!!!","reviewText":"I've gone through several gaming headsets over the years after I realized how much of an advantage there is over speakers.  To put these particular headphones in relation, on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being exactly what I want out of wireless 'surround sound', I'd put this at 9 right now.  If Sony provides more game specific profiles using the companion app (last I checked, they were generic profiles) and the sound does improve over time as others have claimed, then these would earn that 10 from me.Regular TV speakers would be a 2, stereo only headphones at 4, surround sound speakers 5, the original Sony wireless headsets at 7, and these improve upon those in a few ways and get a 9.With the original Sony headsets, I could definitely tell if the enemy footsteps (yes, I'm talking COD right now) was moving from front to back at my left or right.  But I would have difficulty telling if that was above or below me (Ghosts added a lot of verticality).  Not only does these new headsets provide that level of detail, I can even tell if they're approaching or going away from me.  These are HUGE advantages - it's more useful than the mini-map for close encounters.I have not tried out the chat/mic features yet.  That may lower my rating if it proves as poor as I've read others claim.  And they barely fit my admittedly large head.  And they pinch A LOT, which I hope will loosen as my other headsets have.  Not sure if I prefer the buttons for volume and chat/game mix over the sliders, but I guess once I have them set to the desired levels, I'm not apt to adjust them much afterwards.So, my initial impressions are very good overall - nothing worth removing any stars for.  I've noted an improvement in my gaming experience, and that's the whole point of getting these things.  Well worth the Ben Franklin.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2014"}

I only switched to games on PC about a year ago so I can play on the go (laptop), also my wife hated when I hogged our living room tv. I am not into extreme gaming so I don't know too much about all the specs on computers. The graphics are great to me; I have a Sony laptop that has a Nvidia card and Intel I7 with 8GB RAM. The graphics look better than COD Black OPS was on 360, but that's just me. I have not found a way to use a controller with this game on PC and that is troubling. I have played through single-player mode with the keyboard and mouse but I just love using a gamepad. I know everyone will say different but I am not used to using the mouse and keyboard. I thought they would have a patch or something to allow a gamepad for PC platforms.With that said the storyline is interesting, of course, but the gameplay is short on single player and lacking on multiplayer. It seems not a whole lot is different; it feels almost like it is just a large DLC put out for MW2 or something. They did add one new feature of joint ops but overall I think I would have passed on this one. I was glad I passed on Rage for PC but I should have waited on the reviews to come in for this before buying. I think you should try to play this at a buddy's house or something before spending the money on it. Now that companies are moving their price point up to the $60 range for games on PC platforms, I think it is better to do your research before buying.

In terms of actual games there may be different versions, (for example the on-rails shooting game has several boards based on different locations) but it's still the same couple of gameplay types. (Let's get technical: 75 mini-games includes 15 dancing & 10+ rail shooting, i.e. 1/3 of the collection are these 2 games.)Honestly after renting the game I can't figure out why people went crazy over this. The Rabbids are funny, the graphics are good, and some of the mini-games were fun, but many were sub par. Not OK, straight out bad. Closing the door on Rabbids trying to exit a toilet? C'mon, not only is it a bad mini-game it isn't even remotely fun. Having said that, there are a few great mini-games like the shooting and warthog racing boss battles.Overall this is an average mini-game collection. Some are quite good and there are a few stinkers. The biggest negative thing I can say is that this game got boring before I cleared the \"story\" mode (Also, P.S. there is no story). This game is far better thanWii Play with Wii Remote, worse thanWarioWare: Smooth Moves.Rent before you buy.(Note: Amazon's product listing says \"Tame Sharks, Eagles, Rhinos, Spiders, and Angelfish -- each with their own unique capabilities\"... uh, no that is not even almost in the game.In addition \"huge, free-roaming environments and epic landscapes that mix reality and cartoons.\" I don't know about mixing reality and cartoons, but there is ONE location in the entire game, the Colosseum. ONE, singular. Free-roaming usually refers to a GTA style explorable world with missions which this does not have.

I used the Nyko Perfect Shot gun, the one that looks like a white glock or pistol. The nunchuk connects to the bottom of it and voila. I'd recommend getting it, makes it funner.Something to get used to is the fact that during the big bosses and occasionally throughout the game you'll have to avoid/dodge the attacks by pressing \"A\", \"B\" or \"Move the Wii mote side to side\". And if you hit both buttons and waggle just to make sure you did everything, it won't work. You have to hit only the button(s) it wants. For me, I only got frustrated at one part with this, since if I didn't avoid I'd die by the explosion and have to restart from the checkpoint (although the 2 points were close together), but maybe it was because I wasn't used to it yet.If you target the weakspots, which will make the crosshair glow red when aimed over, you can cause a lot more damage.

Not linear in the way that there's only one single path and it can only be traversed one way, but linear in the way that the game can baby you and keep you on the right track, even if you're given a decent scope to explore.Well it turns out that I was just looking for the right massive, open game.  Because here you're free to be your own man.  Sure, you can tackle the main quest and it's decent.  But the real treat is the exploration.  There's a positively huge world to explore, and even more underground.Lets say you have some kind of vendetta against the raiders.  They roam the Wastes, pillaging like metal-head versions of pirates, and you don't like them.  Maybe out of strong sense of justice, or maybe one of them just looked at you funny.  Well feel free to wander around, picking them off from on-high with a rifle, sneaking in to set up mines before tossing in a grenade to stir up some carnage, or put on your power armor and run in, guns blazing.There's a big town, the first one you're likely to come across, with an undetonated atomic bomb sitting in the middle.  You can take it on as a mission from the town sheriff to disarm it, or have the mysterious Mister Burke rope you in to rigging it up to blow.  And you're fully capable of doing so, climbing to the top of Tenpenny Tower, and watching the mushroom cloud in the distance as you vaporize the city, and all its residences.  It's all up to you.  Scurge of the wastes, savior, or anywhere in between.  Get into the slave trade business, or shoot your way through the traders' encampment and free the slaves.The only legitimate complaints I know of for the game are the controls with the VATS targeting system, but you don't even really have to use it.  In fact it's often better and more fun not to.  Sometimes the game doesn't even feel like an RPG.  Sometimes it's an action game, sometimes it's a shooter, but it's always an adventure.The graphics are... terrific.  Sure everyhing's grainy and brown and dark and bleak.  But somehow it manages to be pretty anyway.  Everything might be ugly, but it's ugly in a really good looking way.  I'm trying to think of a celebrity to use as an example, but feel that would be in bad tastes.The facial animations can tend to be a little robotic, but the voice acting is top-notch and lively, from everyone.  And in a game with so much dialog, that's very welcome.Speaking of sound, I was surprised to end up really loving the soundtrack.  And I don't mean the ominous background tracks made for atmosphere, but the 1940s hits played from the game's \"Galaxy News Radio\".  I, being a youngster, never even heard any of this music.  But after having it as a constant companion in my fares across the Wastes I grew to love it.My first time through Fallout 3 I played for over 60 hours, and didn't even do everything (keep in mind I did add four of the add-on packs).  And just a few days ago I started a new file.Speaking of add-on packs, there are five.  Broken Steel, Mothership Zeta, Point Lookout, The Pitt, and Operation: Anchorage.  Personally, I found Operation Anchorage to be boring and linear.  The Pitt was similar, but with a better story and an uglier world to explore.  Point Lookout is a valuable addition.  And Broken Steel continues the main story and raises the level cap.  I haven't played Mothership Zeta, so I can't comment.  But I only recommend Broken Steel and Point Lookout (which are offered together on a buyable disc if you don't have access to XBOX Live).  The standalone Fallout 3 is the most powerful and by comparison the add-ons fall short in general.But in all, I found Fallout 3 to be a fantastic game, in my top-ten list of all time.  And in a game-playing career of somewhere around fourteen years, that's saying something.  If you're on the fence about whether or not to buy, I'd say buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-16-2010"}

Journey as the prince in an expansive quest uncovering the mysteries surrounding the Sun Rune, the civil unrest and the dark intent of an unknown power in the greatest Suikoden saga yet!","reviewerName":"A. Griffiths \"Adrian\"","summary":"Long beginning - stick with it","reviewText":"Suikoden 5 is a reasonably accomplished RPG which tells the tale of a kingdom (or in this game, a queendom) under threat from evil forces wishing to control the world (as usual). You play as the prince, who finds himself initially just doing various chores and generally drifting through the country waiting for something to kick-start his true sense of purpose.Now let me say right now that never before have I played a game that took quite as long as this to get interesting, in fact I seriously considered abandoning it during the early stages. We're talking 10 solid hours plus before the game starts to deliver anything more then mildly diverting ambling about. This is a huge flaw, and something the game creators really should have addressed. Ten hours of wandering around with little more to do than press prompt buttons to initiate text-only conversations is really too much to ask.  There are a couple of starter dungeons but enemies were way too easy and after about 3 encounters the paths were pretty much finished. However, I persevered because of what I had read on other review sites, and EVENTUALLY, after what must have been about 15 hours of extremely mundane play, the game finally started to get going. And yes, the reviews are right. Once you get past this initial hurdle, things do get good.So, what does it play like? Well the controls are easy...there isn't much you need to learn to get around the game. The towns and locations in general are quite large and sometimes it seems like the game is making you are run down very long corridors or around large towns just to bump up the running time. There isn't really any need for this, and in that miserable opening section it just contributes to the boredom. And graphics-wise, I think it could be better. Everything looks kind of...childish. Characters are rather bland looking and their facial expressions are very simple. The scenery of the game is also pretty dull...and both dungeons and towns share a very bad \"top-down\" camera angle that cannot be manually altered.  All locations are viewed from the same overhead and vaguely south-east vantage point. You can't rotate the camera at all, and as a result there are sometimes doorways in walls that you can't see! All you can do is zoom in and zoom out. There is no in game map of towns or dungeons, so I think the zoomed-out vantage point is designed to be your map substitute, but it looks awful - character models become minute and the interiors (which exist as floating 2-3 sided rooms within a black empty space) look very out-dated.Right now, let's get onto the fighting. As I mentioned, in the introductory hours dungeons are a breeze, and there is an \"Auto\" option that just makes everyone attack, which I used almost 100% of the time to begin with. Not a good start. I mean, the fact that you can play without having to even think. But the battle system actually has quite a lot of depth to it. Good fighting depends on many things: Character equipment, battle formation (the positions your team members stand in during battle), magic orbs (equip to enable spell casting for the spells that orb contains), skills (raise by spending points on them, and equip the ones you like), and of course levelling up.  I must say that the fights always tended to stay on the easy side. I used that \"Auto\" function mercilessly when I was just roaming round dungeons to make sure I didn't miss any treasure...it was just the quickest way. Oh yeah, on the subject of speed, this game needs to go to a load screen excruciatingly often. After every battle, after every change from town to world map, in and out of every building, between every cut scene and in game screen...a few seconds on the load screen is needed for all of these, and put together, that's a LOT of dead time. It really grates after a while, and as the encounter rate is pretty high there's no escape.OK it sounds like I have a lot of moans, but let me point out the good points. Surprisingly, top of the list in Suikoden V has to be the actual story. Believe it or not, when the loading screens and ugly graphics get you down, it is the story that will bring you back. And this is partly down to that very long preamble, during which time you get to know quite a lot about a lot of characters. Boring as that is, when the game suddenly (and finally) plays an ace with a quite exciting plot twist, you'll be pretty much hooked for the rest of the game. So a big plus point there.Next, there is quite a lot of variety in the gameplay to keep you amused along the way. First of all there literally dozens of support characters to fight with. The game has what could be described as a side quest, in which you try and recruit people from all over the country to help your cause. Most of these can be used in your battle team, while others offer passive \"support\" skills, so the permutation of party members is huge. Next, apart from normal RPG battles, the game also has wars. War sees you controlling combat from a strategic point of view, with several battalions to control and direct. I was a bit unsure about this at first, but after a couple of them I got hooked.So by the end of the game I was having a good time. The story kept me hooked until the end and the gameplay was fun enough to make the time spent enjoyable. If only they had made that long prologue more interesting....","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2009"}

Not that I despise Nintendo, it's just they keep on rehashing out the same product, and keep apologizing more than Microsoft ever could. I also did want to play the new Donkey Kong Country, but got bored of it quickly. It was good to go back in time and reminisce. But in the end she said why did I by this? I said well I think he'll like it when some of the newer games come out, or not. So she still isn't sure if she'll keep it. She got this at Wal-mart so she still has about a week or so left to return it. Here are just the facts coming from a CITT, computer builder, and gamer of over 30 years. Read the facts before you blow 300$ for a few games. And realize the term \"next gen\" is a term that has many variables to it.The Wii U is inferior, no 3rd party developers (as stated many times) want anything to do with it. Because of it's weak 1.2 IBM CPU, and outdated GPU that is equivalent to a ATI Radeon 4560/4570, which is horrible Click the link below..Sorry link not available.........That's why the CEO took a 50% pay cut instead of stepping down, and letting someone new and fresh take over. Also Nintendo was quoted as saying \"we F#$%d up\", with the Wii U, we see that now. And it's well documented. Yes if you love Nintendo games i'm sure it's great for you. But take Mario, Zelda, Metroid, and DK to a brand NEW exciting 3D world. Don't keep tossing around the same 2d side scroller's. This franchise deserves more power, better graphics and a chance to really take it to the next stage. Look at how addictive and fun Mario 64 was. Do that again, and make it shine. I'm not Nintendo, so I don't know why they just keep making new mistakes, after the old ones loom over them like a black cloud. But at least they admit it, and don't try to make excuses like Microsoft.Thanks.It's barely able to run a lot of older games, even though the Wii U's is slightly beefed up with DDR3 memory, that means nothing. Also it only has 2gb of on board memory, which means maybe, just maybe a little over a gig might get used for gaming. Watch the videos with Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, where the frame rates drop down as low as 18fps. Compared to 360/PS3's close to 30. That should tell you this system is NOT next gen, power/or graphically speaking. Nintendo admitted they messed up, read the article and why they aren't even making new systems. They stated if 2014 is a good year, with the release Super Smash Bros., Mario Kart 8 etc. It may just pull through. Who in the world wants a 300$ game system that is on life support?

Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film.

I would have liked more thinking involved (although that's a bit unfair as a criticism, since this is an \"Action Game\").Controls? They're OK, but it's a drag not having free-moving sights (you can only shoot at someone if you're locked onto them). It makes sniping too easy, and switching targets too hard.Storyline?

First and foremost-this game is drop dead GORGEOUS.  I would really love for Ubisoft to do a companion coffee table book with the release of each new Rayman game that gives us a glimpse into the creative process including sketches, renderings, painting styles, color tests, line art and more (sort of like the Disney and Dreamworks \"Art of\" books.  I would buy that book in a heartbeat.  This game (like its predecessor \"Rayman Origins\") is absolutely brimming with jaw dropping characters, backgrounds, game elements, colorful worlds and whimsical enemies.  I cannot say enough great things about the art style.  Sure, games like the Dead Space series, Bio Shock, Gears of War and so many others boast some amazing graphics, but these past two Rayman games are graphically on par in every respect.  The art style and animation is fully realized and consistent and just absolutely stunning and charasmatic beyond words.My only criticism against Legends would be the same criticisms I had with it's predecessor (Even though this game has improved upon some of the concerns I had with Origins).  These games are so beautiful and so creative that I want to bask a little in their colorful worlds.  I want to take my time and soak up all the sight there are to see (and trust me, this thing is so full of eye candy it could make you diabetic) and enjoy the visual splendor I see at every turn.  But what seems to be case instead is that the bulk of the levels seem to rush you through them as quickly as possible and the level is over before you really had a chance to truly enjoy it.  I beat this game in two days and I didn't even play that many hours.  Now I know there are a lot of extra things you can do to lengthen the game, but guess what?  90% of them require you to increase your pace even more so.  I don't mind the occasional, \"move your rear-end as quickly as you can\" manic style of game play from time to time, but that seems to be the bulk of what Legends is all about.  I can only imagine how much better an insanely beautiful game like this could be if it added a whole lot more levels and slowed down the pace a bit.  Just think of a Mario style game but with Rayman graphics.  (Super Mario 3 or Super Mario World come to mind)  Holy cow.  That would be a mind blower.  It would put the old plumber to shame.  It might not be a bad idea to lower the difficulty of the Rayman games a little either.  Again-I had fun with the challenging game play, but I think a lot of kids would have a blast with the art style of Rayman but could never get past the difficulty of the game.  Some of these levels are butt bustingly difficulty (Origins was even harder)  It might create a more easily accessible game if they could just back off a little on the difficulty.Small gripes aside-I thought Legends was a fantastic game.  I hope Ubisoft continues to bring out more new games in this series.  It would be a crime if they didn't.  My only real suggestions for improvement as I mentioned would be to add a LOT more levels and to lower the difficulty while also offering the same great challenging and difficult levels for advanced players.  That could only make a great game even better.  Great job Ubisoft.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-12-2013"}

It's a hell of a lot better than most other PS2 RPGs, (like Summoner for example)and it has plenty to recommend it. Firstly, the story is pretty good, and the characters are enjoyable to play with. Even though the main two (Yuri and Alice) couldn't possibly be more cliched, they have distinct personalities, and Yuri's mysterious past and self-doubts are given a new twist with the Graveyard and Malice elements of the game...so there is some originality here after all. The support characters are also interesting and funny, especially Margarete, who seems to be a favourite of many reviewers, she's a great sidekick, sexy and sassy, with some hilarious special attack moves.Secondly, the graphics are very impressive. OK, so its back to pre-rendered backdrops, but the battle sequences are impressively staged in 3D, with some really bizarre monsters, plus some impressive special attacks from your characters. All of the characters have special signature moves, with great animations, and Yuri can actually change into various monsters and use many special spells during battles. And then there's Judgement Ring...ah, yes, this is a great addition, as you feel like you are at least called upon to use some skill in landing hits on the enemy. It provides just the right amount of extra challenge, in my view. Add to this the implementation of Sanity Points-which means that any battle that lasts for too long can send your weaker characters mad (!), and you have a battle system that stands up on it's own in terms of innovative ideasOn the downside, the game never gets particularly difficult. You always have plenty of curative power and preventative accessories, which mean that a lot of the boss attacks can be easily thwarted. With a bit of dedicated levelling up, there's not much chance of losing out in even the toughest battles.But thats not to say that there are no challenges...I would have to rank Yuri's lone battle against the Seraphic Radiance as one pretty hard encounter. However, if you never got to that part, I don't blame you, as the other flaw in the game is that there are a large number of side quests and secret missions that are nigh-on impossible to uncover by accident. These are often hugely enjoyable and challenging, such as the Dollhouse and the Cave Ruins maze. To uncover Yuri's deepest darkest secrets and save him and Alice from ultimate damnation requires some serious luck and detective work, and it seems unfair to me that a casual gamer may miss out on a pretty large chunk of the story. That includes me by the way, as I needed a walkthrough to work most of that out, and I pride myself as being pretty thorough!Still, on the whole this was a highly enjoyable game, well though out, with good graphics and a great soundtrack. I don't care about the historical innacuracies, that's just nit-picking. I think it's fun that Margarete has a mobile phone!So if you're through with Final Fantasy X, make this your next purchase. Its shorter, but still sweet.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2002"}

You can read about it on the web, but it really just makes it worse.The game play overall is pretty cool.  During one sequence I just 'rode the skyrail' round and round and killed enemies.Finally, there was really no need to add the racism subplot.

{"product_name":"B002V16T0Q","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Technical and difficulty balance issues almost drown an enjoyable game","reviewText":"There are frequent and numerous \"stealth\" missions that are just unbelievable in their implementation.  A wristwatch indicates red/yellow/green for visibility, except it doesn't actually have any real bearing.  Once an enemy has made you the entire level is blown, and I mean the entire level -- every guard everywhere on that map will know where you are.  If repetitious trial and error with reloading at distant checkpoints is your idea of a good time then this is the game for you.The gas mask filter aspect of the game is entirely broken.  Changing filters doesn't seem to do anything, buying multiple filters will increase the time over 15 minutes, and the wristwatch indicator for the gas mask simply does not work.  Good idea, but I don't think anyone actually played the game before release to see if any of it worked.  Out of time, starting to suffocate, change a filter, still suffocating.  Oh look, I died.There are times in the game where you have no idea what to do or where to go.  Sure, you have a compass that shows the general direction of your next goal, but that is surprisingly unhelpful at times.  Other times some sorta cut-scene like moment will occur and then you'll die only to realize you have some short time to do something specific or you will die again.Other times you'll be trying to enjoy the level design or atmosphere, but you have to hurry up to follow your guide who is always pressing you to advance.  In fact, the entire and VERY linear game does a great job of pressuring you to move forward, always moving, giving you no chance to enjoy much of the environment that they clearly worked so hard to create.The game tries to tell you a story about this post apocalyptic future, and there are some interesting aspects in that regard -- but they, at times, can be so overshadowed by buggy implementations and bizarre stealth level dynamics that you may never get to fully explore them.  I simply can not spend my time battling these aspects of the game.  I got as far as Chapter 4: War, Frontline before I decided to put the game down, probably forever.  I really would like to see how the story in the game plays out, but I think it would be best done through a video walk-through.I really wanted this game to be good, and to enjoy it.  Sadly, that was just not the case.  I recommend you let some other person battle the game itself while you reap the reward of the story.UPDATE:After some time off I decided to give this game another chance.  I turned the difficulty to Easy and found many of the technical issues less detrimental.  They still exist, but the consequences of them are reduced.  I found the game, actually, very enjoyable this way.  The levels are very well done, very atmospheric, and often have many ways to traverse them -- especially later on.  Equipment upgrades really are the key to success and so the Easy mode compounds this by having you expend less ammo to kill things -- thus giving you more currency to work with.The plot line develops well and comes to a rewarding, if not predictable, end.  Fortunately, beyond a certain point, the irritating dark-stealth missions disappear.  The last third of the game is mostly run and gun which is very welcome at that point.This game is very much like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. in many ways and if you do some reading you'll understand why.  One of the ways in which it is similar is that the first 20% of the game represents 80% of the things you'll dislike about the game.  Once you breach the surface of the ocean that is the negative aspects you'll be able to take an overdue deep breath of fresh air that is what the game really has to offer.I'm glad I gave it a second shot.  This game will not be for everyone.  I tried to change the Fun rating to 4, but for some reason even though I could change the stars for Fun, Amazon did not save them.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-01-2010"}

However, this game is either a \"love it or hate it\" title. If you are easily offended by gang violence, police bashing, etc., then this title is not for you. Certainly, this game is only meant for adults.Graphics: Not the greatest, but the game is epic and the environments are huge. Therefore, a PS2 game is going to take a hit somewhere when a game is this large.Gameplay: Thankfully, gameplay is pretty good. There are some mechanics like \"flying\" where I agree with some other reviewers below that the designers could have refined some of those functionalities. However, flying does improve the further you go in the game and with the higher end planes you get to fly. Also, driving cars, buses, motorcycles, bicycles, trucks, helicopters, and more is just too fun and the mechanics for said vehicles are excellent.Sound: Simply, great. There are great tunes in muliple styles from the 90s. Also, voice-acting, environmental sounds, etc. are second to none.Story: Not the greatest story ever told, but it fulfills it's purpose and fits in nicely with the entire package.Overall: There are so many things to do in this game that it is mind boggling. There are very few games that come close to the production values and scale of this title, i.e Metal Gear Solid 3:Subsistence and Ninja Gaiden Black for XBOX are the only titles in the same league with this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2006"}

Another surprise was while the Tomb Raider Anniversary came about a year or two later after this one I think this games camera control are vastly easier and less annoying than the are with the TRA game,  especially when you consider that this game came before the previous mentioned you wonder why the earlier game had less problems with camera angle controls than the later released game. The game is apparently a two part storyline arc with this one being the first part and Underworld technically being the final part,  though some have said the Anniversary game is part of this story-arc it was actually just a revised remake of the very first Tomb Raider game though but apparently the main villainous character was built into the later storyline too so on that small part you could consider the Anniversary game part of that story-arc as well.

I think the New part should have dropped off long ago. We are seeing the same formula from New Super Mario Bros./Galaxy and it hasn't changed, not one bit. There are just a few additions to accommodate the Wii U gamepad and those aren't even that impressive or necessary.If you have played games from the series you know what you're in for. This time around the game's difficult is ramped up to 11 and the addition of four player co-op can either help or break the game. The biggest addition is the Boost Mode from the gamepad user. You can see everyone on screen and can tap to lay blocks that your buddies can jump on. You can defeat enemies for them, help with bosses, stop items from running away, and even help block obstacles. This is both a blessing and a curse. With just one or two people it's easy, but with three or more you can't keep track of everyone. If you lay successful blocks you get a rainbow star which makes you invincible and you can defeat anything. A lot of times you will place a block wrong and kill everyone because Wiimote players rely on the Boost guy  a lot.It's also mindless fun, but the game's difficulty will make everyone throw their controllers. I restarted levels 20+ times because I just could not get through them. Nintendo continues to offer cheats, and the worst one yet is the Luigi demo. You can literally hit a green block and watch Luigi complete the level for you so you can move on. What kind of crap is that? Is this what we're teaching the new generation of gamers Nintendo? That games will beat themselves? Half the time I didn't care because after losing 25 lives and rotating the gamepad to friends we just couldn't beat the level. There is a large variety and there's some fun power-ups like the ice flower, but most people will give up early on.Another feature added is the Miiverse. It's honestly just very annoying. People can post what's on their mind if they lose or beat a level and it just feels like Nintendo's version of Twitter, but 5-10 year olds can post on it so you get incomprehensible words, strange drawings, and it just feels really annoying. Of course only the gamepad player can post and see other people's posts. You can also play as your Mii which is fun, but these aren't anything that would make someone buy a Wii U. Once again, Nintendo fails to sell their consoles with their own games.The graphics really haven't changed much from the Wii, they aren't ground breaking like Mario 64 or Galaxy was. I really feel this series is now dead in the water gameplay wise. Mario just needs a serious reboot. It doesn't help that the game is overly difficult and all the new hardware features are forced and can actually make the game feel worse to play. Even the star coins are nearly impossible to get this time, and there's still no reward for getting them all. Going from level to level just made me feel dizzy with Deja vu.As it stands, NSMB U isn't a console seller, and doesn't advance the series at all. The Wii U hardware features feel forced and some times break the game. It's also the most expensive Mario game since the 64 era. $60 for a game you have played many times before isn't a bargain. If you are already tired of the series, this won't change your mind at all.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-16-2013"}

Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare for the X-Box is one of the very best examples I've seen so far.  It has a very \"playable\" feel, making my WASD-familiar brain feel very comfortable switching over to the XBox controller.  While I've seen more than one title using very obvious auto-aim, making your reticle snap-to and stick or making anyone in the neighborhood of your shots suddenly sprout magnets and pull fire to them, CoD: Modern Warfare doesn't do this.  Instead it just makes it easier for me to aim while I'm running and/or crouching, jumping, etc.  It's just plain easier to multi-task.  Given that I typically have some pretty hefty hardware on the PC, I'd expected the XBox 360 version to be toned down a bit, and I was pleasantly surprised when things looked just as sharp on the console as they do on the PC.  My co-workers talked me into this and I'm looking forward to having some people I know to bring me into the multi-player action.Unfortunately, there's one thing about the Game of the Year Edition for the XBox that grates:  it's no different than the regular edition.  While the PC version offers extras, Call of Duty:  Modern Warfare for the X-Box no longer gives you the bonus map pack for paying extra and purchasing the Game of the Year Edition:  any additional map packs (I found one) have to be downloaded from the XBox Live store for an extra fee.  If you're looking at the GotY edition for multiplayer, keep this in mind as the map pack is approx. 800 points to purchase.I've now played this game's Single-Player Campaign through more than once, and loved it. Like other titles in the Call of Duty series, it uses team-based play, and simulates your team using the computer to \"drive\" your teammates. Continuing in the tradition of the other titles, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare adds more structure to the missions, more life to the characters, and more depth to the story. You spend most of the game as new recruit 'Soap' MacTavish, but you also get to flash back to an earlier point in the story, play as your commanding officer, and learn more about him.One odd departure from other games is that there are storyline sequences that are not exactly \"playable\", but neither are they cutscenes. You live a segment of the storyline through the eyes of the person going through it. These are short, so they don't frustrate, and what they do is heighten the drama. It's an interesting technique, and because it isn't overused, it works well here to keep the storyline going.Another great pacing trick is that the storyline spans countries. It crosses continents and it puts you in more than one spot: one of my favorites was manning three guns using night-vision cameras aboard a large plane as it provides air support to your team on the ground. Overall, the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare graphics are very detailed, the environments feel authentic, and the sounds impressed me. I liked the dialogue and I really enjoyed the fact that my teammates seemed to be somewhat intelligent. There were some really neat goals in each mission, and I have fond memories of the adrenaline rush. I'm delighted that they made a Modern Warfare 2.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-10-2010"}
{"product_name":"B0000A09EP","description":"Join Mario and Luigi as they team up in a strange new land for an action-packed quest to retrieve Princess Peach's stolen voice.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"A welcome addition to the GBA.","reviewText":"Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga is perhaps one of the best GBA games we've received this year. Rich color and textures along with new gameplay elements make this a must have for the GBA!  The third RPG in the Mario franchise we've seen.  Mario and Luigi combines the elements of Paper Mario and Super Mario RPG to create yet another RPG masterpiece.To start off are the graphics.  The graphics presented to us are very well done.  Rich colorful environments decorate this game in a way we've never thought possible on the GBA.  Mario, Luigi and other characters are visually stunning.  The animations in battle are simple, yet fun to look at.  You'll no doubt be impressed by the graphics the first time around.The music and other sound in this game is also quite good.  Music from nearly all the Mario games is mixed into the bunch as well as introducing new tunes.  The new tunes are quite remarkable, especially for the GBA.  While some tunes get a little repetitive and loop around much too quickly, you'll quickly get used to it, as it is a minor flaw.The story is that a witch named Cackletta from the neighboring Kingdom of Beanbean has stolen Princess Toadstool's beautiful voice and has replaced it with explosives. Each time Toadstool speaks you'll see a lot of symbols pop up in her dialogue box and then come down to the ground with an explosion.  When Bowser comes to kidnap the Princess he soon realizes that she would probably ruin his castle.  In short, Bowser decides to help Mario and Luigi.What was even more remarkable are the voices in the game.  Mario and Luigi don't scream, grunt, groan and moan for every action they do, but they're voices are still pretty well done.  Bowser's voice is also impressive.  Voices are very well done on this game so you shouldn't find yourself turning down the volume a whole lot.  Mario and Luigi never really say anything; instead you hear them speaking gibberish a lot of the time when they communicate.The game also presents a lot of moments that'll without a doubt make you laugh.  Even the opening cinema and beginning of the game are pretty funny.  So you'll find a lot of entertainment with this that I think you'll really love.The battle system is quite different from your standard Turn-Based RPG as well as on the field.  For example, the A-Button controls one character and the B-Button controls another.  The start button switches Mario and Luigi around so that the other one leads (so if Mario is leading push start and Luigi steps in front).  So they're both on the over world map.  If Mario is leading the A-Button Controls him, and the B-button controls Luigi and vice-versa.What's even more important is that in battle the A-Button ALWAYS controls Mario and the B-Button ALWAYS controls Luigi.  This is always true in battle.  There are four commands in battle: Solo Attack, Bros. Attack, Items and Run.  The Solo Attack allows your character to attack of course.  But remember that if it's Luigi you use the B-Button.  Much like Super Mario RPG you've got \"Timed-Hits\".  Pressing a button right before the attack connects causes a more powerful hit.  Bros. Attacks are different. This is where Mario and Luigi do a duel attack to an enemy.  You must execute by entering the right button commands as they appear on screen. If you decide you want to make them harder to pull off you can do them without the aid of button commands and have the speed at which the attack is executed at increased.  Of course the harder one you choose the more damage it'll do.What's also interesting is that you can dodge attacks.  When an enemy comes to attack you, press the button that corresponds to that character to dodge the attack.  So if an enemy attacks Mario you'd press A.Mario and Luigi can also use techniques on the field.  Luigi can jump on Mario's head and perform a high-jump and Mario can jump on Luigi's for a spin jump.  They can also use hammers which they can smash blocks with too.I've only about one or two cons with the game.  One is you only have Mario and Luigi. No one else joins the party.  This isn't really a con but for an RPG there are some RPGers who expect more characters to control. The other con however, is that they included the arcade Mario Bros.  While this isn't necessarily bad, it's on EVERY Mario game on the GBA!  It was nice at first but after the second Mario Advance game it just began to lose my interest.  I'm sure many will probably overlook the Original Mario Bros. Game.However, Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga is excellent for the GBA. It's the first original Mario game on the GBA and for that I'm glad.  This is without a doubt one of the greatest GBA games we've ever seen before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2003"}

There isn't really anything new in GTA V that hasn't already been done in prior editions. In fact, compared to GTA: San Andreas, GTA V is actually lacking in some areas. The graphics and environment are more realistic and aesthetically pleasing, but other aspects of the game hamper it's replayability, namely the ridiculously zealous police who have near super-human ability and spawn new police helicopters every 5 seconds. Other negative aspects include some of the game physics and vehicle handling. And once again, an almost total lack of building interiors severely limits the scope of the game. There's a casino and race track but they aren't available as properties and no casino games can be played, why not? Why are most of the hobbies and activities incredibly lame? Tennis, golf, and darts, that's it? Why not skate boarding, surfing, hang-gliding, etc?The main story missions are great for the most part, but it seems like Rockstar is really dropping the ball.

The replayability has some huge issues for me, since the amount of nations, large and small, in the game are tremendous, and yet you can only play as some 10 or so of them, not even with the rest as unlockables.- I fully understand the golden arrows over cities, and this is immensely helpful in keeping track of buildings in the scattered towns, mines, workshops that are not labeled on the map- Technology research is a vastly superior method of keeping certain technologies and eras on chronological track without requiring hundreds of \"Marian reform\" type scripted events like in Rome Total War or Medieval II Total War- Gentlemen must go into universities to speed up technological research, or to kill enemy Gentlemen in duelling, in order to slow their research.- The choppy map was resolved by getting a better video card for my computer.  But that still doesn't excuse its excessive memory/graphical requirements.However, what is seriously worth mentioning is the AI.  Compared to RTW and M2TW, it's not a step down---it's a careen down the stairs.  I had to end my Ottoman campaign early because in the middle of Bosnia, a thousand miles from any British settlement, an entire British army appeared out of NOWHERE just 5-6 turns into the game and took my settlement.  I had no army anywhere close to this region, and nowhere near enough money to so much as stack up my cities with militia.So I started easy with Britain.  The experience can be summarized as this: Everyone wants to kill you, and will look only for the most menial and trivial of excuses to do so.  This is not so much an exercise in Imperialism as it is in Accidental Imperialism or Protective Expansion.Example: France is a major power, so I want their land.  I take it, and hunt France down and kill them all.  Spain, my long-time ally, decides to declare war on me for absolutely no reason, though perhaps simply because I border them.  So I conquer them with some difficulty, and take their last city in Northern Italy.  Then, because I border the Italian states, Genoa declares war on me.  So I destroy Genoa, and then Venice declares war on me.  So I destroy Venice, and Westphalia declares war on me.  So I destroy Westphalia, and all is temporarily well.Out of nowhere, Sweden, a nation I'm not even able to see on the map beyond fog of war, declares war on me.  It's war actions for the next 10 in-game years is to blockade my major ports in Britain... with light galleys, the naval equivalent of a soldier on a bicycle with a slingshot.So to stop this BS, I take the war to Sweden directly, conquering all of Finland and Norway, and pushing them out of Sweden... when out of nowhere, they send a HUGE army to Britain, and take London INSTANTLY (because there's no such thing as sieging in this game's AI---you don't have to build siege equipment, you can just instantly attack any city).  Eventually I took London back, since England is where my best troops can be built.After taking Sweden, I notice I'm now bordering Russia.  Since I'm not stupid, I start building expedition armies in England to prepare, and then Russia declares war on me.  So I break Russia badly, taking Moscow, St Petersburg, Arkhansgelsk, etcetera, and forcing a peace with them.Meanwhile in the Americas, I was trying for some 50 years (half the game) to conquer the Iroquois Confederacy, since this would allow me to gain the 13 Colonies back to my Empire, but every time I got enough forces, some other BS would draw them away.  Finally when I got a big enough army, the Iroquois used a strategy called \"We're stupid\" in which they send one general with a tiny little force of some cavalry and peasants to pillage my lands, unimpeded for several turns since my forces literally have to CHASE them around the map.Then out of NOWHERE, the Maratha Confederacy, from all the way in Southern India, lands a HUGE force in SPAIN and takes my city there.  Years later, they take one of my islands in the Carribean.  AN INDIAN ARMY TAKES A BRITISH COLONY IN THE CARRIBEAN.But despite that, the Maratha Confederacy was the absolute best in-game opponent I've ever had in this game.  Their AI was cunning and tactful, And when I landed an expedition force in India, they bribed a tiny Indian kingdom to attack me, bleeding both myself and them, then they came down to crush me, sending the expedition home with only 400 of the original 6,000 men.I sent a second expedition, which successfully gained a foothold in one city, and spent years with Marathans just watching, and marching all around it, with occasional skirmishes to stop them from pillaging towns and workshops.  Eventually, they forced me to divide my force, and then they took my city while most of my army was killing one of theirs.  I had to evacuate this army out of India entirely, and never returned.I only wish there were more AI instances in that campaign like the one of the Marathan Confederacy.  It gave me the best and most intense view of Imperialism, guerrilla warfare, and nasty politics that I never got dealing with the rest of the campaign's AI, which ranged from \"Retardation\" to \"Crippling paranoia\"*****Most recent Update/Edit******Due to prolonged experience with the game, I'm taking serious consideration into reducing the amount of stars I've given it.  That would force me to delete the review in order to re-submit it again.  Leave comments if you care enough about me (Awww) to have an opinion.*********See reasoning for this at bottom of review.**********Well, not aside.  I want to address this first.If it weren't for Steam, I would have pre-ordered Empire Total War, and have had it brand new and shiny in my hands and on my computer the day it came out.Instead I didn't.  Instead I didn't buy it and played it on another computer.Because \"Steam\" is REQUIRED to play this game.  Because in order to play this game, you must go through what some Amazon-er in the discussion threads called \"SecuSteam\", which is kind of stupid, but it iterates the fact that Empire Total War is using a DRM reminiscent of EA's debacle with Spore and every other game they've released since mid-late 2008.  And because \"Steam\" received an \"F\" rating from the Better Business Bureau.As such, I do not trust it.  I will never buy a game that has installation limits, activation requirements, no re-sale ability, and the potential for shady malware infection as SecuROM did with EA's games.  I said it so before, if the video game companies want to treat me like a pirate, I'd be better off becoming a pirate instead.  These kinds of DRM only encourage normally loyal consumers to instead opt for the pirated copies, which they can play without restrictions designed to thwart it.  It's what people who use metaphors call a \"catch-22\".To the game...I overestimated this game, I think; I'm someone who owns (and PURCHASED) Medieval II Total War, upped the graphics to their highest settings, and unit scale to Huge, and ended up with choppy action moving in \"screenshot mode\" with severely low framerate.  I struck a neat balance between graphics and speed by removing all Anti-Aliasing and shadows.I was shocked, surprised, and shocked that Empire Total War actually ran BETTER than Medieval II Total War, with Anti-Aliasing x2 enabled.  There's still minor graphical issues, but not enough to detract from gameplay.The game engine is a major leap from RTW and M2TW, but not in the sort of massive way that was Shogun/Medieval Total War to Rome Total War.  The campaign map is actually smaller, though there is far more information in your settlements and armies to take in, and it hurts slightly that the text on a 1024x768 window (in windowed mode) is very small and difficult to read.  There is text almost everywhere, and opening up settlement info is no longer like in RTW/M2TW where you have a list to select buildings to build, tax rates, recruitment, etcetera.Instead, opening a settlement's information is more like opening the \"Settlement Details\" scroll in M2TW/RTW, which shows you things like religion, and the specific aspects causing unhappiness and population growth.  Taxation has its own separate scroll to open, by which you can adjust the tax levels for the Upper Classes separately from the Middle/Lower Classes.Despite the significantly longer loading times compared to M2TW, the game's campaign map is fluid, if a bit choppy, and there is no additional loading required to shift \"theaters\" from Europe to America to India to the East Indies, etcetera.  It becomes a little tough, however, to keep track of the Americas when they're basically on what amounts to an entirely different map, and you can't just scroll there like you could in M2TW.Turns are back to RTW basics, with two turns per year, each turn either Summer or Winter, and movement points are far larger to reflect an easier time in moving things around.  Though still it's slightly inaccurate in being far too much time to move things around.The campaign aspect of the game is indeed a whole 'nother being for the Total War player like me---unlike RTW to M2TW, you won't be able to hop in and master it all within one gaming session of an hour or so.  There's far too much to take in all at once, and the camera controls are different (in that the Right click button no longer scrolls when you hold it down) and cannot be modified.Battles:The sea battles are exactly as I pictured they would be in fantasizing about naval battle in Rome Total War.  You have the same deployment-grid layout as with ground battles, to arrange your ships as you want.Naval combat is rather like that in \"Sid Meier's Pirates!\", only you must micro-manage ALL your ships at once, which is what causes problems for so many as I've read in forums already.The sea battles are fun, even if they're still rather \"Beta Stage\"-ish.  There is no clipping with the ships, so you can gape in horror as one of your surrendered ships suddenly gets jerked back by the wind, and rams right into the side of your flagship, bringing both ships to a total stop and letting the enemy bash you to death.You have no control over the melee combat in boarding ships, but you have total control over broadsiding, as you can pick round shot, chain shot, or cannon shot, manually rotate your ship into position, load up the cannons and wait for them all to be ready, and then fire once an enemy ship comes into your target radius.Land battles are essentially unchanged from the Total War standard, which is great.My experience with the Rome Total War mod \"Napoleonic Total War II\" and with the gunpowder units in Medieval II Total War left me a bit disillusioned in thinking the AI would have severe problems in infantry firing, as if one rifleman gets out of line, they all stop and wait for him to fall back in place before even reloading.This is all fixed, as gunpowder infantry fire at a steady pace, uninterrupted by stupidities in pathfinding or AI.  And they no longer freak out and stop firing if their line is bent in any way; I've seen riflemen continuing to fire even after a stupid move by my part has their line bending like an arc.Artillery in particular are incredibly impressive, and made even more so by the fact that they are LOUD AS HELL!  I zoomed in to a group of my cannons on the field, and jumped in my seat as they fired, with a sound like someone firing a gun near my face.Unlike Medieval II Total War with Rome Total War, this is not a game that could replace its predecessor, due to its extreme changes in the game engine, as well as the completely changed battlefield mechanics due to the fundamental shift in warfare from melee to gunpowder.My only major complaint on the game itself is that all the game files are in separate \".pack\" files, and as such cannot be modified directly as Rome Total War or Medieval II post-unpacking could be.  Unless they release an unpacking tool at some point, I don't see how this game will be open to modification.*******EDIT*********And my new major complaint: I am a Total War player since 2004, though I am limited to the engine used by Rome Total War and Medieval II Total War.  From that perspective, this game is almost unplayable for me.Even approaching it as a completely new gamer to the experience, I found it so immensely and insanely complex and off-putting by its hellish amount of details and multi-tasking, that I cannot get past a few turns in the main campaign.The new campaign map is far more animated than its predecessors.  As such, it is choppy for me when trying to scroll.  There is so much information to take in, as not only do you have cities in regions to handle, but every region has one city, and several satellite towns and farms and ports that you must INDIVIDUALLY handle or else have your region fall behind in economy and production.The fog of war does not hide unknown settlements, and so there will be city labels all over the map, further adding to the confusion in determining where everything is, especially when these satellite towns mentioned don't even have labels, so I found myself clicking on enemy towns for several seconds to build better farms, unaware that it wasn't even in my territory.Rather than the placid colors and shapes and small vegetation from the previous games' maps, this one has everything in stark bold colors, with huge trees littering many areas, green grass like Eden in twilight, that it's a merciless assault on the eyes when you have to keep track of so many things on this landscape all at once, or else risk having enemy armies ransack all your towns and farms without you even realizing it until two turns later.This micro-managing of farms and the like also causes problems with costs.  It means you have to spend 2000 money on each individual farm in each individual estate in a single region, adding up to around 10,000 for farms within a three or four region nation.  This is simply BAD ECONOMY for a WAR game.  When you're spending enough money for half an army just on farms, whereas in previous games you'd spend less than half that for the same amount, you start to hemhorrage money and start getting enemies raiding your territory because you can't afford a standing army to stand in EVERY SINGLE MINI TOWN and port and farm.Then the information.  There is tons of it, and I haven't even figured out what most of it means.-I don't understand why the tax rate is uniform for your entire nation rather than differentiated between cities.-I don't understand what the golden arrows floating above cities means.-I don't understand why I'm supposed to care what sort of crop is being traded where.-I don't understand why I should be forced to research technologies and the like, Civilization style, taking two years and 3000 money just to be able to build fences around my farms.-I don't understand why I can't hire mercenaries, and yet I can train soldiers from a general when out of a city, and yet those trained soldiers end up spawning at my capital.-I don't understand how upgrading governmental buildings, improving bureaucracy, and the like, somehow causes UNHAPPINESS due to \"repression\", which seems to occur no matter if your government is a humble republic or a tyrannical empire.-I don't understand what purpose the \"gentleman\" agent serves, as he can't do anything.  Nor can I even train agents, as they spawn randomly wherever the hell they feel like spawning. (NOTE: I know what Gentlemen do now)So it appears that my opinion on Empire: Total War has changed very drastically.  I still haven't given up on the game, but I'm not liking how my review stands at five stars as of late.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2009"}

It's a third person platformer with some light fighting involved.  The combat is very easy on NOrmal and requires almost no strategy.  This is magnified because the Prince doesn't even have a block in his arsenal.  Basically just mash the attack button until you win.  The platforming isn't terribly tough either and is mostly timing based.  It gets a little tougher later on but nothing to make you throw the controller.  The graphics are good but nothing amazing and compared to the beautiful Prince of Persia 2008 it's a big let down.  The story is decent as well but not outstanding....it just gives you a purpose to play and doesn't really draw you in.  The Prince's character isn't well developed either.Compared to Prince of Persia (2008) this game lacks.  The graphics in that game were amazing for its time and is still very beautiful.  The story is much tighter and the characters are more likable.  The chemistry between The Prince and Elika was executed about as well as any I've seen in a video game while in the Forgotten Sands it never seems like brotherly love between The Prince and his brother.  Also the Prince was more \"human\" in that he didn't have these mythical powers to make him invincible such as rewinding time and freezing the water.  The combat was more varied and the environment was open world in that you could change the path and the experience by taking different routes thus changing the way the wold is traversed.I know it sounds like the game is horrible...it's not.  It's worth at least a rental to play thru one time but if you are willing to spend 6 dollars on a rental you might as well buy it for 15.  It's a fun game to play through while it lasts but it isn't essential must play gaming.  I'd give this one a solid 7/10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00006HBTW","description":"It&#x92;s a pretty bold claim but for many,Mario Partyis the best multiplayer game series ever. No need for guns or complicated role-playing elements here--Mario Partyis fun because it&#x92;s simple. The original N64 game created an entirely new subgenre--an unlikely combination of traditional board games and lots of ultrasimple arcade titles. The idea is that you travel around the board trying to collect stars, which must be paid for with coins, and you get coins by competing in minigames, which occur at the end of every round. These minigames generally don&#x92;t last longer than a minute or two, and many are based on oldGame & Watchtitles. There are over 50 minigames inMario Party 4, and each involves either a free-for-all, two players against two, or one against three (depending where you land on the board at the end of your turn). These can involve anything from skydiving to basketball dunking, or car racing to hide-and-seek, to name a few.Admittedly, this basic description of the gameplay might not sound too exciting, and indeed if you&#x92;re playing with less than three human opponents it can be pretty tedious. But play it with the full complement of non-virtual rivals and the game&#x92;s infinite capacity for cheating, backstabbing, and ganging up allows it to completely transcend the humdrum sum of its parts. There&#x92;s nothing terribly new in this third sequel except that the graphics are much improved and the minigames are all new, but that really misses the point: get this game out at Christmas instead ofTrivial Pursuitand you&#x92;ll wonder how you ever got through the holiday without it.--David Jenkins, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Tamer","summary":"Great but needs minor improvements!!!","reviewText":"I just brought the gamecube back in May of 2003 and along with it, i got Mario Party 4.

I really got it for the Metal Gear Solid 2 demo, but I figured I would be playing the actual game too. What can you expect from konami? Great games. Suikoden and MGS. However, why did Konami do it. Why did they sell us out. MGS 2 is really short, and this game proves to be even shorter.The combat is great. You got slash and attack. You get a second mech, but its just fun. Moving around feels fluid, you will see your legs leave burn marks on the ground if u glide on them, and it also feels great to just traverse around. However the arenas are usually really small, so you won't have much to explore. Anyways at first I had no clue what to do on any place, but I soon figured it out. The real problem is how they did it. You do stupid little tasks with your ship thingy, all the while hearing about how this enormous battle on mars is going to take place, at the same time you are stuck with a robot who is learning to be human. Which part sounds familiar to you? Practically every robot story is about how the robot in the end usually grows to feel emotions. It is really cheesy. Then it starts to get boring and old.So you finally meet up with the big bad guy? YOU CAN'T BEAT HIM. YOU CANNOT BEAT THE LAST BAD GUY. How terrible is that. Its like your fighting him, then you can't do anyting against him. So you go to this place. Get ready for the battle of mars, wrong. They just end it. It is terrible. The game lasted about 4 hours, mabye 2 if I sped through. Almost as horrible as the ending, is the bonuses. Theres basically nothing you will get after acomplishing the game. No upgraded mech weapons or anything, so I fail to see any point in replaying it. Where the game does good in graphics and fighting, it fails miserably in every other possible aspect.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2003"}

Being able to choose from an arsenal of weapons that can level up to unlock some unique attachments makes for a unique experience with every solider class. The addition of vehicles adds for an extra challenge in the game. You can jump into a tank, jet or helicopter and start an all out battle. The vehicles have also been upgraded to take more damage unlike Battlefield 2 where the vehicles could be destroyed with only a few hits. This time around it feels a lot more realistic.The campaign though is a let down. The story is not that interesting and it is very linear with little challenge or variables. It's pretty much running and shooting and trying to get into the campaign.The game is really all about the multiplayer experience though. The multiplayer experience consists of 24 people going through various categories such as rush mode which is pretty much like a capture a point to advance mode. Conquest which is like a domination and of course the normal Death match.Overall, the game is a great multiplayer game that will have you putting a lot of time into the online experience. The campaign is weak, but the multiplayer experience is well worth the purchase.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

The graphics are gorgeous (on point with the Uncharted and Batman games), the concept is original, the voice acting is on point (pretty sure I heard John de Lancie in there). I'll also say that having only played the first Assassin's Creed and not the second one, that this one is far superior in pacing, intuitive controls, and instruction. All that out of the way, I have to say these games just aren't for me. There's something I find gimmicky and kind of frustrating about the controls, the plot, the whole shebang. Perhaps I've just gotten too old to want to spend the time to master a new game like this, but I find there are too many options, menus, and bells and whistles for me to really care about. And though I'm easily frustrated by the game, I also find some parts far too linear and hand-holdy. Finally, the blue/red 3D is a joke, kinda sorta seems to work a bit, but makes everything look odd, and is especially frustrating wearing the 3D glasses over my regular ones. All in all, not for me, but if you ever thought what Uncharted needed was to be blended with elements of RPGs and Sci-Fi, mabe you'd dig it more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2012"}

Cooper","summary":"The first real Guitar Hero for the next-gen platform","reviewText":"I was among those who purchase Guitar Hero II a few months back, and was instantly hooked to this genre of gaming.  At the time though, it was obvious we were given little more than a straight port from the Playstation 2, albeit with downloadable content and a few extra songs.  XBox Live functionality was virtually unused, the graphics looked dated, and the game just didn't feel like it belonged yet - though I did play it consistently so it was a good game despite the flaws.Guitar Hero III is what we should have gotten with Guitar Hero II on the 360.  The 3D character models, animations, etc. are much more lively and entertaining.  The between concert cartoons are funny and timely considering what one pictures of a band.  Finally we have co-op over X-Box Live, as well as new game modes.  The game feels familiar, yet this is mostly everything done right that was wrong with Guitar Hero II on the 360.Topping off the improvements is an excellent song list, and like before I find myself looking into bands that I had heard about but never experienced.  Some of the old songs are fun to go back and watch videos and how awful the band looks from today's timeframe, yet the songs are classic and worth playing over and over again.The new \"boss fights\" are an interesting twist, but on Medium difficulty at least pose not much of a threat to your being able to beat them after a couple of tries learning the game mode.The wireless guitar is a welcome addition to the 360 as well... more than once last night I kept adjusting my legs not to get wrapped up in the cord, before realizing that there was no cord.  Then I gave the devil salute and began to rock harder.Excellent game, especially for parties with more than one controller.  Worth the purchase as an entry level bundle if you don't have Guitar Hero II, or if you have the money to burn.  Otherwise you should be able to get it by itself and use your old guitar.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2007"}

{"product_name":"B002I0K1Y0","description":"","reviewerName":"Saikron","summary":"Monster Hunter Comparison Incoming","reviewText":"I don't know why people get their panties in a wad whenever somebody compares SS to MH. It's really a short hand way to explain that they are both use the hub world and monster arena mechanic, they both focus on action oriented combat and combos, they both have similar gear chasing and multiplayer mechanics, and they both focus on taking down big bad monsters.So let's focus on the differences, which in my opinion are where SS falters. Character customization in SS is very limited, not because you have a lack of options, but because you have like two dozen ways to customize your character that really have very little impact on how you play the game. No matter what I do it feels like I'm still spamming the same 4 or 5 different spells. I can also choose the balance between defense or offense while spamming those 4 spells. It's kind of disappointing.The other big difference is that there is significantly more gear grind in SS than MH Tri. I played all the way through MH Tri with ZERO grind. It was difficult, but it felt like success was just out of range every time I had to try again. SS is completely different. It's obvious that I'm not going to get anywhere without grinding more powerful spells and getting a higher attack/def level.There are also other minor grievances that are slowly getting on my nerves as I continue to play, like the fact that so many of my allies' attacks knock me down in multiplayer, or the fact that the random people that I play with seem to really enjoy sacrificing me even if we are only a couple minutes into a 30 minute battle. Basically, this makes me want to use only long range spells and healing and take fewer risks, thereby reducing my spells used down to 2 offensive and 1 or 2 defensive.EDIT: The last advantage that MH Tri had over SS, is that the MH Tri community is mostly composed of intelligent, constructive adults unlike the first comment on this review. Playing as a sacrificed soul is mind numbingly boring, you trade the soul reward for a bonus item, and it makes you want to play like a prude to avoid dying near a spiteful 12 year old.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2013"}

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"Tierra12 \"Tierra12\"","summary":"Great Addition to the series","reviewText":"I am a long time female fan of the RE series (except for the live-action movies) so when it was announced that there would be an RE5 back in 2005 I was extremely excited especially since I loved RE4 and thought that game brought a freshness to the series which had previously started to become quite stale.  I patiently followed along with all the footage and information that surfaced before RE5 came out.  As the years passed my anticipation for this game's release remained high and I must say that this game for the most part lives up to the hype.Brief Story synopsis -The game takes place roughly ten years after the events of the original Resident Evil and features the return of ex-Special Tactics and Rescue Service (STARS) member Chris Redfield.  Chris returns older and more mature with a very muscular body type which may or may not sit well with female fans that preferred his build in the other RE games (his Gamecube look in RE: remake in particular was well done).  It took me awhile to get used to his massive arms and thick chest in RE5. Also in some cut  scenes his face resembled Solid Snake's from Metal Gear Solid which is not a good look for Chris.  In other scenes he looked more like his old self only older and on steroids.This time around Chris is a member of a group known as the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance (BSAA).  He travels to Africa to investigate reports of terrorist testing bioweapons in Kijuju (a fictional African country) on innocent people transforming them into blood thirsty virus infected people/creatures.  This time around he is aided in his investigation by West African native and BSAA agent Sheva Alomar a new female in the RE universe.Controversy-Before this game was released it was surrounded by controversy since the main protagonist is a white man and he is in Africa combating black zombies/virus infected.  So the challenge to the producers was to make the game they wanted to make, have it take place in the location they wanted, feature the character they wanted and find away to present the going-ons in a fun and culturally sensitive way.  Personally as a black woman I did not find the game to be either offensive or racist.My view-RE5 is definitely a worthy addition to the series unlike the poorly made RE movies or the Gun Survivor and Umbrella Chronicle series.  The co-op features are highly advanced and fun.  The visuals are realistic and top notch.  Some loose ends from previous games are tied up nicely for those of us who have been with the series from the beginning.  RE5  has a high replay value from the mercenary missions, playing the game in two player format off-line with a friend in split screen, on-line, in single player mode with an AI partner ( for the 1st time that I can think of in an RE game the computer actual makes for a good partner), and being able to go back through the entire game and play as Sheva.  It definately changes the gaming experience.  Also the costume changes and weapons choices and upgrades are fun.  I only wish that Chris had a clubbin' outift that would've rocked.In addition to the aforementioned things this game is also special to me since it features two of my favorite RE characters Chris Redfield and his nemesis Albert Wesker.  They finally have a resolution to their conflict that is very satisfying.  Also Sheva the new RE woman is a great addition to RE universe not only because she's black like me, but she also has a lot of positive aspects.  She's likeable, sexy, useful (unlike Ashley Graham in RE4), confident, believable, and strong.  Her voice actor is also pretty good.  I hope she returns as Chris' partner in another installment or plays a major role in future RE installments.Rating: A-","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2009"}

you defend people from bullies and gangs.There is so much to do in this game in free roam.Once you beat chapter 1 the school gate opens up and you can explore the whole city.The city includes a carnival(You can even ride certain rides there are 3 and play games),a beach,lighthouse,a waterfall which isn't far from the lighthouse,townhouses,barbershops,stores,clothing stores,bikestores and other places.You can basically do anything in this game take showers,swim,wash hands,buy sodas,kiss girls and even guys,pull firealarms,etc etc.You are mainly fighting bullies but if you want to you can hit anyone girls,boys,children etc but doing so will often cause the perfects to come after you.If you wind up in the principles office 3 times you have to cut the lawn but it doesn't take that long.You have 2 classes a day and there is a clock on the upper left to tell you what time it is.Passing these classes often offers big rewards.I will break this up into what you get to do in this game and weapons and vehicles at your disposible.KissingThis boost your health but it's also fun to do in the game.Generally once this becomes available you must give the girl flowers or chocolates to get a kiss however once you complete art 5 you can kiss without giving gifts and it raises your health by 200%.To Kiss Press L1 and the x button you will see a little flower symble give flowers or chocolates then press x again when you see the lip icon.The kissing varies too with the exception of Eunice the girls will only smooch you until you complete art 1.Once you beat art 1 the kisses get longer.Beat art 5 and you actually get makeout kisses which are the longest.There are 8 kissable girls.Once you kiss these girls they will actually follow you around or even chase you till you give them another one.Usually the thing that will end it is if you get caught by the perfects or someone picks a fight with you.If one of your girlfriends see you kissing another one of your girlfriends they will either fight each other,you or both.Pretty smart game AI.They however forget about it and will let you kiss them again.I can't think of a better way to get my health up.If you run out of flowers you can always go to the girls dorm and pick some or buy some at the yum yum store.Note drinking sodas will also give you a healthboost but not as much as kissing.Kissable Girls1)Eunice The big fat girl you get to kiss her very early in chapter 1 once you get her chocolates back that someone stole from her.She is the only girl to give you a makeout kiss before you complete all the art classes.Once you get her chocolates and she makes out with you you can always kiss her as long as you give her chocolates.2)Beatrice She is the cute nerd queen and becomes kissable once you beat the bitch story and chapter 1.She wears glasses and has a ponytail and wears a green dress.3)Angie Shes the cute girl with glasses and a ponytale.She becomes kissable after beating art 1.4)Christie She the fox that has red hair a ponytale and whiteshirt with what looks like a police badge.She also becomes kissable after beating art 1.5)Pinky she is the hot prep queen she becomes kissable once you beat carnival date in chapter 2.6)Lola Shes the hot greaser queen and wears a black outfit.She becomes kissable in chapter 3.7)Mandy shes the hot cheerleader of the football team.She hates you at the beginning of the game but becomes your girlfriend and kissable once you beat the disgrunted mission in chapter 5.8)Zoe Another red head is the queen of the townie girls.She becomes kissable once you beat final showdown at the end of chapter 5 basically the end of the story.You can also kiss some guys there are 6.Basically you have to have 60% respect from their clicks before you can.Unlike the girls once you beat art 5 you still have to give the guys flowers to get a kiss and the guys kiss also brings your health up.Kissing the guys in the game is just for laughs.Kissable guys1)Trent He's the white haired bully.2)Conelius He's black and the only kissable black in the game and he's the nerd with glasses that looks like Steve Urkell.3)Gary Prep King4)Vance Greaser King5)Kirby Jock

It is more than possible to beat these guys but you have bide your time; blocking, blocking until the right moment to strike. Battles take minutes - not a few seconds and can have you fighting around the entire area. Once I'd worked out the fight system I was away - acrobatically leaping around the place, solving puzzles and killing bad guys and having a great time.The game is frankly a joy to play - you rarely feel a series of jumps is unfairly hard and for the most part enemy battles are fun and very cinematic.Much praise has been heaped on the graphics and rightly so - I would however have like a little more varity in the feel of the game. Even ice caverns had a similar subdued look, which, whilst were in keeping with the overall appearance, didn't come across as different enough to create the impression of a new place.So it's a great game well worth your money - but I do have a problem with the bugs. It's by far the most buggy XBox game I have so save often - go back to save points even if you've done very little since the last save and don't overwrite previous saves. You will have to go back to a previous save at least once.Sometimes the prince would get stuck in a falling motion and this motion carried onto the restart so when you reloaded the prince is still waving his arms as though dropping to his death, despite being an inch off the ground. Other times the game simply said 'no no no' and crashed out to the retry/quit screen, and at least once a non-playing character (the female lead) committed suicide by leaping off a wall, thus preventing any progress since she was required to open a door.Sure I could've lived without these issues, but they don't prevent the game from being enjoyable. Go get it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-05-2004"}

Among other things, the Dunia Engine delivers realistic, interactive environments, special effects, real-time night-and-day cycles, and smart enemy AI.Expansive, Realistic EnvironmentFar Cry 2 is set in a fictional region of Africa where you are caught between two rival factions at war. The Ubisoft team spent a lot of time filming and photographing in Africa to get all the details of the landscape and native wildlife. The result is a huge gameplay area that is 50 square kilometers, taking players into and out of the jungle and savannah. Wild animals such as zebras, buffalo, gazelle are encountered during the game, with both players and enemies allowed to interact with them.Far Cry 2 features an incredible level of detail and realism, with a minimal in-game interface to detract from immersion. For example, players will need to navigate the world using an in-game map and navigation system, weapons will disintegrate over time, and fires will spread and propagate.Each of the actions a player takes is reflected in the environment and changes the content of the game. To fulfill your mission, you need to play the enemies against each other, using both strategy and skill.Huge Range of Weapons and VehiclesFar Cry 2 offers gamers a wide range of weapons, from a machete for hand-to-hand combat, to a sniper rifle that can stealthily pluck off enemies from afar. As weapons disintegrate over time, they might jam or even explode in your hand.There are also a large range of vehicles such as gliders, trucks, cars, and boats that will let you fly, drive, slide, and hover over the open landscapes.Multiplayer Options for up to 16 PlayersFar Cry 2 supports up to 16 players and has four gameplay modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Capture the Diamond, and Uprising. Players can choose from six different classes in multiplayer, each with its own set of pros and cons.

This shares the name only, and should have been titled \"Grand Theft Auto: Africa.\"The Dunia engine gives great results, as my 8800GT would scarcely slowdown while running across miles of jungle landscape.  The graphics were phenomenal, the only thing that disappointed me is the appearance of the characters.Like the Grand Theft Auto series it's a go anywhere-do what you want game.  The trouble with these games are the activities are largely filler except for the missions to advance each level.You're a mercenary playing off competing factions, but in this world everyone is a mercenary, they all look alike, and except for two-three sequences the only person they want to kill is you.The gameplay is maddeningly repetitive, every time you do a mission for an arms dealer it's the exact same mission, every mission for the Resistance it's the same house and same people in different locations, every time the bad guys come at you in a vehicle they always floor it until they're on top of you then stop it and step out.  Blam Blam, that was fun.The guns wear out by becoming inaccurate, then unreliable, and finally coming apart.  However this happens so fast it's no wonder there's a huge demand for arms.  The flamethrower is fun the first time or two, but sooner or later the game boils down to driving endlessly to get to the next objective.  Are we there yet?Only very late in the game does the story start to develop, and it blows it completely on the ending.  You have two choices, and both are stupid.You can take your pick as to which is more disappointing, a game that is frustrating and boring, or a frustrating and boring game that could have been great with a good story and action.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-27-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00309U0M6","description":"","reviewerName":"drollere","summary":"video game as multimedia art","reviewText":"this is a significant step up in conception and execution from the original DS. rather than repeat the many positive observations already raised in other reviews, i'll hit a few personal high points.as in DS, it is possible to play through the game on the \"normal\" difficulty and die only rarely. this greatly enhances the cinematic immersion and mood reality of the game and downplays the usual \"run and gun\" gamer environment (although \"run\" is, in several situations, the first move necessary to survive them). in fact the game is most enjoyable when played slowly and cautiously -- scanning the environment for hazards, moving carefully around corners, through doors and debris (several \"gotchas\" are waiting in these situations), and listening for the sound of approaching necromorphs (especially from behind). the hazard contexts vary from narrow corridors to open chambers, from mine shafts to outer space, so the sources of danger are continually changing.playing slowly allows one to savor the settings in this game, which are genuine works of art -- visually, aurally and conceptually. each environment has its own mood, lighting and color scheme. colors are used with a painter's eye to light and texture; dominant colors are artfully balanced by complementary accent hues, dark is punctuated by light. it is rewarding to replay the game just to enjoy the superlative uses of color, sound and lighting. the music score tends to introduce the mood of different locations or to ratchet up the panic in ambushes, but otherwise is well balanced by dramatic silence. (compare \"assassin's creed: brotherhood\" where the repetitive music becomes an annoyance.) the \"predicament tension\" is nicely scripted -- just when you think you're clear of a hazard, you're not!the diversity of weapons is not overwhelming (compare the useless assortment in \"red dead redemption\"), and one attraction of replay is to try out other combinations ... although the brutalizing tools (flame thrower, sawblades, sniper rifle, contact beam) are not as versatile or effective as a fully upgraded laser cutter, line gun, pulse rifle and javelin gun.DS 2 is completely stripped of any \"busywork\" activities -- those pointless routines where you collect flags, tokens or charms, hunt down a list of individuals, do chores or errands, take on jobs, and so on. for some reason game developers seem to have concluded that these add \"realism\" when in fact they usually add tedium. none of that in DS 2 -- you have stuff to do and you get to it.the final boss battle between clark and the marker conceals an amusing and possibly pointed irony: it seems very hard until you figure out how easy it is. (hint: alt fire from a fully upgraded pulse rifle or line gun is the first step.) and, even as the credits roll, the narrative takes an unexpected and ultimately humorous twist. (\"what?\") two twists, actually ... but the second is only a promise that DS 3 will be forthcoming.in my previous game reviews i complained that the stereotypical game narrative is generated by another character (typically female) telling the male avatar what to do next and when or how to do it. in DS2 isaiah clark makes many of his own decisions, has to resolve some unannounced situations, and has to exert repeated control over other characters. finally, a game persona i can relate to. i also regretted that the \"talent\" was credited below texture mappers, QA testers and accountants: in DS2 the credits roll over the closing sequence with the actors at the top where they belong. (of course ... the game executives get top billing in the intro.)two technical innovations would greatly amplify this game. first, there is really no reason why the player could not choose the gender, male or female, of the focal character; yes, more dramatic and sound production would be involved, but this is a game that appeals disproportionately to female gamers. second, there is no reason why a subset (or even all) of the creature encounters could not be randomized, so that they vary from one replay to the next.DS 2 is flawlessly produced and ran on xbox without a single lost save, animation glitch or control anomaly.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-18-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMB3","description":"The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Timemay be the greatest single-player video game ever created in any genre. It's that good. Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide. WithThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Nintendo has come up with an all-consuming adventure title that will provide days of engrossing gameplay.--Eric FredricksonPros:Best single-player video gameFreedom to explore a rich, complex worldHelpful fairy guide gives hintsCharming, humorous, lighthearted, yet challengingCons:Some puzzles can be frustratingOnly one saved game per player--don't save when you're stuck!Much more fun with Rumble Pack","reviewerName":"Yuri Cunha \"Juggalo\"","summary":"Best Game Ever?","reviewText":"This title might be the best game ever. The best title for the N64 it is, beyond any doubts.- Graphics: I haven't played much N64, but, for all I know, this is the best you can get in the plataform. Beautiful enviroment, landscapes, well-designed characters, different places and detailed textures for this plataform. The graphics are hot, I mean it! And you didn't even need graphics, this game would be great even without them. This game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such 3D graphics plus the lock-on camera, this game will be forever reminded because of that. Approved graphics.- Sound: This game has the best soundtrack ever, if you ask me... Nearly every song in this game wins a 10/10 score. I really want to find a soundtrack for this game, because both the Ocarina songs and the in-game songs are awesome. Characters don't have voices, except when they scream, when they're scared and this kind of thing, so the voice acting isn't great. But the sound wins a 9/10 because of the nearly perfect soundtrack.- Fun: This game touches you with a great story, great characters, great songs. You really feel as if you were Link in the beautiful land of Hyrule, and that makes the game so good that you can't say it's not fun. When you feel like the character, you just can't stop playing, even in the boring parts (in other words, the Water and Fire Temples). The different times you play and the many secrets hidden (I mean it, many secrets, I highly doubt you can get them all!) makes the game even greater, even more perfect.- Educative: I really don't know why this game is rated E for Everyone... I feel like the game has some scary parts (in other words, the cemitery and the Shadow Temple), so it should be rated T for Teen, even though it has no great violence, no red blood (just green blood sometimes). But you parents shouldn't worry about that. This beauty must be taken to your children.Overall, there's nothing to say. I don't know what you're doing reading my review if you haven't played this game yet. This is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime (The Wind Waker, the last game in the series, is very good, but it isn't nearly as good as Ocarina Of Time). It might take a long time for you to beat it if you're always busy, because the game is not short, but you must try. It'll be an unforgettable experience to be Link in Hyrule.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-12-2003"}

For me, taking my time and exploring is generally more fun, and so i usually stick with role playing and sports games (i understand sports style action better than shooter action). However, i pre-ordered this game on a whim and haven't been disappointed. You might laugh, but for me, at this point, playing on the Easy mode is challenging enough, lol. I still die plenty of times, but i dont feel overwhelmed. I'm getting used to the run and gun, then hunker down fire a few shots and move again style. The graphics for the game are quality in my opinion, and the feeling of being in the midst of a war is spot on (at least the way i imagine things to be). At this point in the game, I'm the Russian dude infiltrating an arms-dealers mansion. The storyline so far has been a little cliche, but still is pretty good, and if I'm not mistaken, one of the voice actors is the White House Security Chief from the tv series 24.Anyway, i haven't played the MP yet, although i plan to once i can aim a little better on the fly, but so far, i have really been enjoying this game.Update (11/3/11): I have finished the campaign (on Easy) now. It really isnt that long or involved. However, what it really does is prepare you more MP, which is a blast. I played for about three hours last night (capture the flag) and had a great time. As i said, I'm not that great, and so for the evening i collected 9 kills and was aced 43 times, lol. However, once i realized that i was going to keep dying a lot, i started acting as a decoy, which was actually an effective tactic. Each time i was killed, i had the pleasure of seeing my slayer slaughtered afterwards while i was waiting to respawn. The one caveat was the guy running around with a knife. He killed me and i then watched him kill 2 of my teammates in a 5 or 10 second span. Lesson learned: dont mess with that dude!Also: you can play in no TK games, which for me is a real advantage, since i can make an identity mistake on occasion, where i see movement and shoot before i see if it's a teammate or not. I did that while jumping off an overpass, and it was uncanny just how awesome my aim was at that moment. Three quick shots later, i realized it was a teammate. To be fair, he seemed to be heading away from the action for some reason, but fortunately, it didnt matter since there were no TK's in the server i was on. It did seem to scare him though, lol. I dont have a headset, but it was pretty awesome and often hilarious listening to the back and forth. Lots of inappropriate language made it an even more fun experience. Of course, I'm an adult who has been known to swear on occasion, so i felt right at home. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-01-2011"}

Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Talduras","summary":"A Solid Remake of a Classic.","reviewText":"Anyone who had the original Nintendo (NES) is bound to know of this game.  This is essentually a remake of that game, and a solid one at that.Here's a short list of some features added to the remake:- More areas to explore.- Added cutscenes and improved visuals.- The original NES Metroid (unlocked after finishing Zero Mission).- Improved sound effects and soundtrack.- Added story elements.Lets start with the differences.  The most obvious change is the visuals.  Nintendo started off with a clean slate here, and the outcome is a game that looks similar to Super Metroid (for the SNES) or Metroid Fusion.  The control takes a page from Metroid Fusion, though Zero Mission seems almost as though it's running at a quicker speed (as noted by the short hangtime during jumps).  The sound is also updated, though it's fairly standard stuff here.  Although, thankfully, the sound from the Power Bombs won't cause as much problem with your ears, unlike with Metroid Fusion.  The music, I feel, is one of the better touches here.  For the most part they keep the melodies the same, while also adding a few new ones, but they are updated to GBA quality.  The music for the first area would be enough to give any fan of the original game a trip down memory lane.  Also, in addition to all this, the game has been expanded with more areas than the original, but given the differences in control the time comparisions between them are extremely relative.It should also be noted that this game has the original Metroid packed onto the same cartridge as well.  All you need to do is finish Zero Mission on Normal and it will be unlocked as an option in the options menu.  Better yet, even though the game keep the password system of the original, you are given the option to save that password and bring it up the next time you play.  This makes the upcoming release of that very game for the GBA (part of the NES Classics Series) kind of pointless.That said, the game (focusing back on Zero Mission here) isn't without its flaws.  If you've played Super Metroid or Metroid Fusion, something will seem like it's missing here.  That may be because of the way the item finding is handled.  In fact, most of the items, such as Power Bomb and Space Jump, are found so close to the end of the game that you almost wonder why they included them at all.  Along that line, they also left a few doors that can only be opened by power bombs near the earlier parts of the game, which seems pointless because the upgrades behind those doors are just more of the endless missile tank or even power bomb tank upgrades that only upgrade your maximum supply.Also, the difficulty is very unbalanced.  Normal areas are often too easy no matter what difficulty you pick (easy, normal, and hard, the latter of which can only be unlocked after finishing the game at normal difficulty).  This in sharp contrast to boss battles with Kraid or Ridley that can be hard to the point of unfairness.  In fact, neither GBA Metroid title seems to have the dynamic boss fights that Super Metroid had, and I also feel that game had better pacing with item upgrades as well.All in all, the game is polished and fun.  If you're a fan of Metroid games, this is likely already in your collection, and you'll enjoy the added bits of story (I won't spoil anything here).  If you're new to the series, this would be a good entry.  If you're looking for something with replay value... well, you'd almost be better off hunting down Super Metroid.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-23-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000FPM3HS","reviewerName":"Rich Stoehr \"Idle Rich\"","summary":"Such a sad, unlucky girl...","reviewText":"What an oddity 'Rule of Rose' is! Why would anyone choose to play a game in which the main character is a nervous, awkward teenage girl and the story the game tells could best be described as disturbing? And yet, there's lots of good answers to this question. How about, just for starters: beautiful graphics, unique gameplay, and a compelling and rich plotline?The graphics of 'Rule of Rose' are one of the things that sold me on the game almost immediately. Just watch the game's opening trailer to get a taste of what you'll see -- visually lush and beautiful animations, expressive characters, and a style perfectly suited to the game's story. Like the 'Silent Hill' series, 'Rule of Rose' takes a simple real-world environment and wraps it in darkness and just a slight tinge of surrealism to keep you off-guard. As gorgeous as the backdrop is, the creatures and dark edges of the story are rendered just as lovingly, products of a twisted imagination. In some scenes, sun streams through huge windows and bathes the world in a golden glow, while later the same windows are darkened except for occasional flashes of lightning, illuminating shuffling figures and featureless masks for faces. The visual style of 'Rule of Rose' is breathtaking, both terrible and beautiful.Playing through 'Rule of Rose' can be frustrating at times. Jennifer, the main character of the game, is awkward, kind of slow, and clumsy with weapons. She is no fighter and is easily overpowered. This makes sense for the way the game's story is told, but can still make the experience difficult sometimes. This is more than offset, though, by the added dynamic of Jennifer's faithful friend, Brown the dog. Once you find and befriend him (early on in the game), Brown becomes your indispensible companion. He will help you find everything from restorative items (scones and lollipops for Jennifer, bacon and bones for Brown) to the next item needed to progress the story (everything from keys to teddy bears) and more. Brown also helps Jennifer in combat by frightening some enemies and giving Jennifer a better chance to strike or run away. Jennifer by herself may have made for a somewhat weak and frustrating experience overall, but playing 'Rule of Rose' with Jennifer and Brown is considerably more interesting.Which all leads to the story. Told mainly through a series of crudely-drawn storybooks Jennifer finds and assembles along the way, 'Rule of Rose' is like a modern-day Grimm's fairytale gone horribly wrong. Thematically, the nearest comparison I can think of is William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies,' as 'Rule of Rose' is another story is which children are left to discover a society all of their own making (the mysterious Aristocrats of the Red Crayon), and the result is seldom pretty to look at. The children in 'Rule of Rose' are cruel and malicious to one another, as conniving and manipulative as any adults, and as selfish. Even so, 'Rule of Rose' is hard to turn away from, once begun. The storybook motif and the way the stories translate to Jennifer's reality are compelling, and in their own twisted way, beautiful too. Discovering the fate of the Aristocrats and the identity of the mysterious Stray Dog kept me playing to the bitter end.Add in a surprisingly touching music score by Yutaka Minobe, consisting mainly of string arrangements that are positively haunting, and chillingly effective voice acting for each character, and 'Rule of Rose' comes together as an occasionally frustrating but overall compelling game.Mind you, 'Rule of Rose' is not for everyone. The story features cruel behavior among children, and hints at physical and sexual abuse and cruelty to animals. There is very little that is overtly shown, but the undercurrent of dread and the implications of the story will frighten some and downright offend others. On the other end of the spectrum, those who like action games packed with blood and mayhem are likely to be disappointed by the slow pace of the story and the limited combat moves of the the teenage heroine. For those, however, who can appreciate a dark fairy tale, who can see beauty even in terror, who believe that even the story of a sad, unlucky, lonely girl has merit, 'Rule of Rose' is a game well worth the playing.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2008"}

After many years of no addition....Comes Splatterhouse for 360 & PS3. I've seen and heard mixed opinions of this game. Both from friends and people online. It looked to be promising in my opinion. And though I still have a TurboGrafx 16, I don't have the older Splatterhouse games. And haven't played them in years. Good thing I didn't ebay them, cause this game actually has all 3 Splatterhouse games as achievements/unlockables. So, onto the details of the game......It's got elements of a B horror movie fused with things you'd expect in comics. The gameplay is fairly simple & fast paced. Yes, the loading time can be a bit on the slow side. The graphics are not on the level of say Gears Of War or Dead Space. However they are pretty good! The camera can sometimes be a little bit of a annoyance. But overall it's fine. The original Splatterhouse games we're 2D side scrolling games. This game is 3D with some  2D ( w/ 3D look) side scrolling levels. The game is very bloody/gory. Throught the game you get weapons such as. 2x4 with a big nail in it, a meat cleaver & a shotgun. You can even use limbs and heads as weapons! And as you pound & bash your way through levels, you earn points you can spend towards upgrading your character atributes (kinda like Prototype). And also if you beat the game on a hard difficulty, you unlock the option to play the game with a friend in multi-player. I bought the game for $9.50 used @ Hastings. And in my opinion it's well worth even a price range of $35.00. This game may not be as good to others as it is to me....But you if your a fan of the old Splatterhouse games, you can't go wrong with this pick-up.

{"product_name":"B000FQ9YB0","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"It's a Wii, Wario, and I love it.","reviewText":"Just under two years ago, Nintendo introduced their new Nintendo DS handheld in style. Wario Ware: Touched!, which contained 180 wacky \"microgames,\" was the perfect way for DS owners to reach out and touch their new handheld in ways they'd never thought of. It's early 2007, and as Nintendo Wii owners finish up their Legends of Zelda, it becomes that time again. Wario's back, and he's back with that same ridiculous style, creativity, and grace that makes his green clouds of flatulence as pleasant as a field of roses.Wario Ware: Smooth Moves turns your Nintendo Wii remote into...well, into just about anything you could possibly think of. The game uses 21 different poses, and each one is introduced as the game progresses. You'll drive cars with the \"Chauffeur\" pose, holding the Wii remote like a steering wheel. What if you're attacked by a ninja during the night? Well, you'd give him a good lashing with the \"Samurai\" pose, of course! Maybe you'll have to balance a broom on your hand with the \"Waiter\" pose, or use a flashlight and find characters with the \"Remote Control\" pose, holding the remote...well, like a remote! Just like the Touched!, Smooth Moves! uses simple mechanics that are sometimes only difficult because the player thinks too much about what it is that he or she is supposed to do. One of the poses, the \"Discard,\" is as simple as putting the remote on a solid surface (like the ground) and picking it up at just the right time.Deserving a paragraph of praise all on his own is 9-Volt, the Wario Ware veteran with Nintendo-flavored microgames. 9-Volt had some classics before, but makes a valiant return in Smooth Moves! with microgames that really take you back in time, popping in SNES cartridges and even playing a few levels of Star Fox with the remote. You'll catch fish from Animal Crossing: Wild World, fly in Balloon Fight, slap paws with Nintendogs, and douse flames in Super Mario Sunshine. What a wonderful collection of microgames!The surprise this time around is that each character doesn't use a specific pose. Each character in Touched! had a unique control mechanic, and Smooth Moves! switches things up a little, forcing the player to think even faster. As the game progresses, the player might be using the Thumb Wrestler pose one moment, only to switch things up the next moment and hold the remote above his or her head with the Mohawk pose. In fact, 9-Volt uses all 19 of the normal Wii remote mechanics! This makes Wario Ware: Smooth Moves! even more intense than its predecessors, adding some extra excitement to the game.With that said, the ways that the remote is used are all quite creative, and the microgames themselves are just as hilarious. You'll hula-hoop donuts with the Big Cheese pose, unlock trapeze artists from closets with the Finger Food pose, and blow up balloons like dynamite with the Handlebar pose. Rarely if ever is the insanity held up by Wii remote inconsistencies. In fact, the only time most gamers will have a problem is when they simply don't understand what a microgame is asking them to do. Fortunately, Nintendo implemented a replay mode where microgames can be tried at will, giving players no excuse not to understand games once they've tried them out.Some will discredit Wario Ware: Smooth Moves! as a visually unspectacular game, but others will be very happy with the variety of things happening on the screen. The game never slows down a bit, and the visuals are absolutely absurd. It would be unfair for anyone to be spoiled with revealing information about the graphics, so that will be withheld. Just the way that the different styles are introduced is entertaining, and the character storylines are told with hilarious cartoon cinemas. Wario Ware: Smooth Moves! keeps all of that style and ridiculous humor that fans will want to see when they pop the game into their Wii. The sound effects and music are just as insane, with the former consisting of bytes from classic games like Super Mario Bros. and the latter constantly getting more and more intense with each passing microgame.[...]","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2007"}

Johnson","summary":"convenient, but certainly not a must have","reviewText":"I like many people failed to see the need for this if the wireless controller takes regular batteries too.  I have a slew of rechargeable batteries that I lose, find, lose and find again for my digital camera.  I also have three battery chargers for the same lose/find reason.  I have had my 360 for about 3 months, and have been happy using the rechargeable battery solution for a while.  There is a small inconvenience in remembering to charge the used up batteries as they go dead and there's the small task of keeping up with the good batteries.Since I like little gadgets to begin with and I had it to spend, so I went ahead and got the quick charge kit plus an extra battery pack for my 2 controllers.  The first charge is kind of long, but afterwards its fairly quick.  I have not had any problems using the battery pack vs. regular batteries, and I didn't expect to; It does what it is suppose to do.  It claims a 25 hour play time, which I haven't verified with a stop watch, but I do notice that play time is pretty long, and also a fully charged battery pack shows up as such on the screen controller battery life indicator when you press the XBOX button on your controller.  With \"fully charged\" rechargable batteries, I have noticed that the charge indicator is always one bar less than full.I definitely agree with both sides of the argument on whether or not to get this or stick to using rechargables.  It all comes down to convenience.  If you are tired of having to recharge batteries as they go dead and have a few extra bucks to spend, then this may be the route to go.  However, if you have no problem recharging batteries as needed, then there is really no need for you to get this, because the only way it saves you any money is if you used to use non-rechargables in your controllers.In all honesty, if you want to save some money, stick with the rechargeable solution, because in reality the quick charge kit costs a bit more then a standard AA battery charger and the battery packs themselves cost about the same as 4 NiMh rechargeable batteries.  Also with the with the standard battery charger and batteries you can use them for other things.Keep in mind it only comes with one battery pack which is better than nothing I guess, but if you want more battery packs for your other controller(s) you have to by them seperately, for the cost of about 4 NiMh rehargable AA batteries.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2007"}

This game is even more about total speed getting from point A to point B than the previous games, with level design all its own.  The levels are designed so that, if you want to, most of the time you can just hold down left or right and watch Sonic (or one of the other characters) ZOOM - until you are slowed down and have to decide how to proceed.  Don't get me wrong, the levels are huge, with many paths for Sonic to take and a lot of stuff for the floatier characters (Tails and Cream) to explore.  But everything, from each level's racing-style opening to the delightful fast-driving Eggman-vehicle bosses, and especially the level design, is all about speed.You can probably dash through the first four levels on your first game, but from zone five onward the difficulty level, both in the levels and against the (I have to mention them again) speedy frenzied moving bosses, increases steadily every zone.  The game is just difficult enough to keep me from zapping right through it, which is a good thing and keeps me coming back.  I completed the first Sonic Advance the first day but have not beaten this one yet.  I also have explored plenty and have not yet found a single chaos emerald, but I am sure they are there.  This and the difficulty curve all keep me interested.Another thing I like are the three action buttons.  There is a jump button (essential), an attack button (with different effects depending on your character, including a ground pound that breaks floors and can aid in exploration for Sonic), and a 'trick' button, with high-speed effects that vary by situation.  What's so good is that only the jump button is necessary, but if you are fast enough and want more variety you can make the game feel much deeper by using one or both of the other buttons in just the right situations.I don't know just how long this game will keep my interest, but on the second day I have had it, MAN is it fun.  It's all about speed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-01-2005"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8M0","description":"Normally, Nintendo contract players such as Mario, Pikachu, Link, Donkey  Kong, Bowser, and Kirby are generally happy and well-mannered, but inSuper  Smash Bros. Melee, the pleasantries get thrown out and the gloves (except  for Mario's) come off. This update of the N64 favorite features these and other  video game icons in furious, yet utterly absurd fisticuffs that usually make for  a smashing good time. Just make sure you have at least one human opponent to  pound on.Starting off with 14 characters (an additional 11 are waiting to be unlocked),  the game has a pretty standard premise--let Nintendo's stars beat on each other  until the timer runs out. However, a lot of emphasis is put on knocking  opponents off ledges while avoiding the same fate. In typical Nintendo manner,  there are quite a few power-ups to assist you in the melee. The actual combat  isn't as intricate as in other fighting games; however, the ultra-cartoony  layout of the many, many arenas sometimes adds a strategic element not usually  found in similar titles.Super Smash Bros. Melee's strength lays in the mayhem created in  four-player fights. The camera does an excellent job of positioning itself so all  combatants are constantly visible. Also,Meleesports some of the best  visuals seen in a Nintendo product. All the characters are highly detailed, and  the movements of each are smoothly infused with personality. Donkey Kong lumbers  and Princess Peach fights with grace.As the multiplayer mode is the key reason for this game's existence, the  single-player mode is decidedly weak. The game features an adventure mode that plays  somewhat like an old-school, side-scrolling Mario game. Sadly, despite its good  looks, its gameplay is rather uninspired. This game is clearly at its best when  there are two or more players with controllers in their hands.--Mark  BrooksPros:Fantastic graphics and sound keep the action upbeatMany new characters and other goodies to unlockCons:Single-player experience is comparatively weakToo cute for a few folksAdventure mode is boring","reviewerName":"Movie Lover","summary":"Most awsome Game Cube game ever!!!","reviewText":"This is the best Nintendo game ever.

{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"Chip L \"chip1978\"","summary":"A very bland, safe sequel","reviewText":"If you've played Modern Warfare 2, then Modern Warfare 3 should be no surprises to you. And if you didn't like MW2, you won't like MW3. If you liked MW2, you'll find MW3 to be a very by-the-numbers sequel that plays on almost every level just like MW2. If you loved MW2 you're going to love MW3.The single player campaign is short, coming in at about 8 or 9 hours on hard difficulty - far less (5 or 6) on normal difficulty. Most of the campaign is played as infantry on the ground, but there is some break to that monotonous gameplay: driving a boat, manning an AC130 gunner, or remote controlling a tank. The gameplay is strictly linear. There's very little opportunity to deviate from a predetermined course. Most of the single-player game is spent shooting then moving to the next barrier for cover and shooting without much tactical thought. The story is a convoluted mess with numerous plot premises that are ridiculous. If you believe a handful of individuals can single-handedly start and finish World War 3, then you won't mind this game.Multiplayer is the bread and butter of Modern Warfare. There are many different ways to play: deathmatch, team death match, and a wide variety of team based objective games. Players earn more \"experience\" with more games, wins, and kills. Leveling up earns access to new guns, attachments, perks, and tactical items. It is the most robust multiplayer game that encourages frequent replays; however, it also tends to penalize newcomers - as hardened players will have access to advanced weapons that newcomers will have to spend substantial time to earn. The result tends to favor people with the most experience. While MW3 tries to offset this with \"prestige\" (resetting a player's bonuses), it doesn't change the end result that generally people with the most experience (who already have an advantage due to the sheer time they've spent on the game), also have a distinct advantage in unlocked bonus weapon power-ups.The co-op multiplayer consists of two options: a wave-based survival mode (e.g. Horde mode on Gears of War or Firefight mode in Halo), and missions that are distinct from the single-player campaign. Notably absent is the ability to play the whole campaign through in co-op. The biggest gripe with the co-op survival is that it requires advacement in rank to unlock weapon and equipment drops. The rank from multiplayer does NOT carry over to the co-op games. So in order to unlock weapons and equipment, a substantial amount of time on co-op must be expended. When you factor in the substantial amount of time required to rank up for really good multiplayer power-ups - I think the game asks too much before granting its unlocks.The biggest gripe I have is with the graphics. Across the board, MW3 looks about as polished as MW2. After 2 years of development, with a short campaign and only very minor changes to multiplayer, I have to ask why the game basically looks the same as MW2. As we've reached the end of life-cycle for xbox and playstation, we should be seeing some of the most impressive titles - graphically speaking (see e.g. Drake 3 or Gears of War 3).MW3 is a mediocre game that cashes in on the immense popularity of MW2 without offering anything new or upgrading the game in any significant way. Unlike MW2, I don't think people will still be playing MW3 a year after its release. If you're okay playing an extended version of MW2, you'll like this game; but if you were looking for an upgrade, sit this sequel out.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00503E8S2","description":"","reviewerName":"JOHN SPANGLER \"Johnny Spang\"","summary":"Don't listen to the 1 star reviews from guys who didnt' even play the game","reviewText":"Haha, it's funny how people review games and don't even play it before reviewing it. Fiction can be fun people, but make no mistake, in reality, COD is back and it's about to blow you away. And yes, contrary to the bogus reviews on here, this game is a blast and is everything you've came to expect from the series and then some. I picked mine up at WallyMart last night, played for about 3 hours. Unfortunately, my eyes nearly fell out and I knew I had to get up for work, but man, what a ride it was for day 1!Mind you, I only played the Special Ops, Survival and Campaign mode so far, but I can tell you what the multiplayer will offer and what you will expect.While I may be the minority, I'm most excited about the Special Op and survival mode missions.  The Survial Ops mode is kind of Infinity Ward's answer to Treyarch's Zombies from Black Ops and World at War. Who seriously did not have a blasting Zombies into Oblivion? Well, this time around, you don't take on Zombies, you take on soliders and relentless attack dogs. The action is non-stop, I actually found myself sweating when I finally survived to like round 5.  The survial mode pits you solo or with a friend to survive against endless waves of increasingly difficult enemies. There's a ton of different maps to play in these modes too so you'll never get bored with it and the maps are also enormous in size.  each with increasing difficulty and paths opened up as you continue your onslaught of the baddies.  It's very addicting, and the challenge will test your skills to the max, but is actually good practice for you when you take your skills online!The special ops mode are like quick fixes of the campaign mode if you're in a hurry. Different missions like infiltrating a terrorist infested hijacked plane and missions that have you disable chemical weapons from terrorists. They are basically mini campaigns that you can play with a friend or go solo. This will add tremendous replay value.Modern Warfare 3's singleplayer campaign was amazing for what I played and felt like Saving Private Ryan all over again, although I heard it might be pretty short. Good players might be able to beat it within 5 hours which is very disappointing considering the other COD games had longer campaigns. The story could be better, but again, what matters is how fun the game is, and that's what this game always give the player, fun factor. And be ready for the firefights in the campaign. They truly are a breathaking experiences.While I haven't played the multiplayer yet, don't expect huge differnces from last year, but this is the heart and soul of any first person shooter. But expect the experience to suck you in as the previous installments continue to do years later.  I heard it's got a real nice leveling system and checking out all your stats can be done with ease this time around. The game boasts 16 multiplayer maps in all and expect future DLC maps in the future.  It's that type of game with the surreal experience that will let you play for hours or minutes at time and still leave satisified I'm sure.The game itself looks astounding. Contrary to the Battlefield fans, this game is pretty and runs at a silky smooth 60fps with no slow down or choppiness to be had. Infinity Ward knows this engine well and it looks better than ever. The explosions, the colorful and vibrant effects and environments look FANTASTIC! The guns also look amazingly detailed. The amount of blood in the game doesn't seem to be too over the top, but there is still a good supply of blood and is rated M for a reason. A staple of the series is the amazing sound. You got a good sound system? As usual you're in for a real treat.  If you want to know what the sounds of War really sounds like, look no further than Call of Duty!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2011"}
{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","summary":"Best Console Currently Available.","reviewText":"I'm copying part of a review I wrote for the 80gb model, then adding to it.9/19/08I've been a fan of the Playstation series since the beginning, and I proudly own a PS1, PS2, PSP and now a PS3. I'd have to say that this system is wonderful! I like everything about it. It's sleek, runs quiet, and pumps out an amazing picture (I\"m only using a 26\" LCD that supports 720p Picture resolution.) I'm a little disappointed that it won't play PS2 games, but I still have that system laying around. No complaints so far!Update: 10/2/09My system gets moderate to heavy use. Mostly as a DVD/Blu Ray player, though I've been playing way more games on it now that I have more time. It's still going strong. I recently upgraded from the stock 80gb hard drive to a 500gb one. The upgrade only took a bit of reading, and a couple hours of time (mostly for system back up and system restore... actual physical labor was about 5 minutes of work...) Over the past year, I've dabbled with the multimedia features as well as many of the fun miscellaneous things the PlayStation Network provides.Over all, I consider this a must-have system for anyone who wants a complete media center. This will store/play all your music, play all your movies and even work as a PC if you install Linux (my next project, actually.) My only complaint about it is still the lack of PS2 support on this model. I'm hoping for Sony to get their act together and release software emulation via the PlayStation Store... I'd be willing to kick them some bucks for the convenience of playing my favorite PS2 games without having to dig up my old systems.Update:  1/17/11System's still going strong!  I've finished several games, and my TV has been upgraded to a 50\" HDTV, and the picture is amazing!  That whole support for Other OS went the way of the warrior a while back, so those hopes were dashed.  I still stand by the 5 star rating, however.  The game catalog keeps improving, and the fact that I can stream Netflix and watch Blue Ray discs on it keeps it in the game.  I've been considering buying a slim model so I can have a set up in my room with the little TV!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002BS47TE","reviewerName":"Ray-Review","summary":"Great Addition to the Franchise","reviewText":"Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker is a fine addition to the franchise. It tells the untold story of the creation of Outer Heaven as well as the back story of Naked Snake (Big Boss). This is the direct sequel to MGS3: Snake Eater and MGS: Portable Ops and it completes it rather well. Hideo Kojima both directed and produced this game so I was very excited to see what he could do with it. This game combines all the elements of previous MGS games such as the camoflauge system from MGS3, the gameplay mechanics of MGS4, and the system of Portable Ops. But what Peace Walker accomplishes is not gameplay alone, but storytelling. The trilogy of Metal Gear Solid 1,2 & 4 goes through the philosophies of modern warfare and human instrumantality. But the trilogy of Big Boss's story is a more emotional and personal philosophy of how a man goes through war and can overcome himself. The story of Peace Walker revolves around Big Boss as he encounters a tape which contains his dead mentor's (The Boss) voice on it, but she is still alive. As well as encountering that mysterious tape, Big Boss also must stop a nuclear warhead from launching, which is a typical story for Metal Gear.The story itself is good. The sound is what makes this game very special. For a PSP game, this is really an unbelievable milestone. The musical score is great but I feel that they could've done a bit better. The voice acting is up to standard with previous Metal Gear games with the returning voices of David Hayter with his signature Snake voice, as well as Christopher Randolph as Huey (no spoilers). Sometimes I feel that the voice acting was a bit rushed but the quality of it can make a nit-picker like me to look pass it. For a PSP game, this is probably the best sounding PSP game of all time.The gameplay in this game is the least to say, very very difficult. I found myself having to repeat various missions because of little mistakes I made. I'm not saying the game requires the player to be perfect but, it does require a lot of stratgy and planning. Since there is only one difficulty setting you don't come to expect this game to be very easy. Although the game doesn't emphasize running and gunning, you can do that it you will but I suggest stealth. This game requires a lot of patience and if you don't have that, than you will be punished throughout the game. The game emphasizes Co-Op, and believe me you will need it because the boss battles are crucial. Although I havent done co-op yet, I am starting to need it. I am about half done with the game and its only getting harder. Among main missions, there are extra ops which are similar to VR Missions which can help level up weapons as well as pass the time when you don't feel like going straight into the story. The game has a very deep operations system which is basically controlling Outer Heaven, you get to capture people like Pokemon and sort them out to what their specialties are. You can also deploy teams to do missions that destory enemies, capture more troops and recieve items as well as parts to building your own METAL GEAR, haha yea I said it, you get to build Metal Gear ZEKE which will be seen in the original Metal Gear game if you know the chronological story. I highly recommend this game to the PSP owners who have been craving for a good game, and Metal Gear fans NEED this game in their collection. Just be aware of the difficulty of this game, its a game thats worth playing and worth your time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-21-2010"}

Blizzard","summary":"An Underrated RPG","reviewText":"Many people interested in Japanese RPG's have probably already heard of Nier.  In Japan, it has developed a bit of a cult following, thanks to its originality.  This game is a bit of an oddity, it is mostly a traditional action-RPG, similar to Demon's Souls or Zelda, with elements of other genres thrown in.  Nier sold far better in Japan than it did in the United States, however, there were also two versions of the game released in that territory, Gestalt and Replicant.  The States got the Gestalt version with its older protagonist.  The States also did not get the accompanying book, Grimoire Nier, which was released only in Japan.Story:  The initial story of Nier involves a disease called the Black Scrawl, which is always fatal.  The main protagonist, Nier, has a daughter who contracted the illness.  During the first part of the game, it is all about curing her, the second half is in finding her.  To help Nier on his quest are three companions, Grimoire Weiss, Kaine, and Emil.  Nier himself is a father willing to do anything to get his daughter back, even if it involves killing nearly everything in sight.  Grimoire Weiss is a talking book that does nothing but complain and provide insight on what is happening.  Kaine is actually a kind-hearted woman who has that part of her shrouded in coarseness, with a very, very thick layer vulgarity and anger to keep others at bay.  Emil is a young boy whose only desire is to fix his eyes, which turns everything he looks at to stone.  All of these characters help Nier fight Shades, the eerie antagonists who seem to do nothing but attack any human.Nier's story is exceptionally dark and quite depressing at times.  The story is a bit unusual in that you must play through the game four times to see all of the endings.  Thankfully, you don't have to restart from the beginning, but only from the second half which can be played through in about three hours, longer if you want to tackle side missions.  During the first playthrough, you are focused on finding Nier's daughter and cutting down any Shade getting between you and her.  During the second playthrough, you get to see what the Shades are actually saying along with specific stories surrounding individual Shades Nier must fight.  The remaining two playthroughs are identical to the second with only the last scenes being different.Gameplay:  Nier is a bit of a mixed bag of play styles, it is a generic hack-and-slash primarily, but it is also a top-down RPG, side scroller, and text-based adventure at other times.  Some of the games more interesting moments are during the text-based portion, it adds more depth to the game.  This section also is a little humorous since Grimoire Weiss tries to argue with the narrator for using Weiss instead of the full name, the narrator then proceeds to lightly insult him throughout that section.  The hack-and slash portion is fairly standard, once you figure out the fighting mechanics and decide on a main weapon, in my case, spears, the game becomes a bit of a button masher.  Luckily, there are few areas where you are required to fight to proceed with the story, usually, you can simply race past the enemies should you choose not to.  Grimoire Weiss allows Nier to cast spells, and during the second portion of the game, Emil and Kaine join Nier in battle, though, you only get experience points in battle for enemies Nier has defeated directly.As Nier is an RPG, there are magical elements, quests, and even fishing thrown in.  This is a game where language is powerful, it is seen in the music and in the magic.  Words can be combined and attached to weapons and spells to increase various stats, magic animations hold the magical energy together with words.  Even when shades are defeated you hear ghostly, indecipherable words being spoke.  Nier himself has a number of spells that can be used, ranging from orbiting spears, to giant lances, to ghosts of Nier attacking enemies.  The quests are very similar and rarely vary from shopping and gathering quests, to fighting quests.  There are a few that are different, such as the lighthouse lady quests, but most are the same thing, over, and over again.  The fishing and cultivation mini-games are mostly a way to earn additional cash and involve luck or simply waiting for stuff to grow.  Once Nier has obtained weapons, he can upgrade them at a shop using various materials he finds and funds he gets from quests.Audio/Video:  Graphics-wise, Nier is a bit disappointing.  The graphics are decent, but the lighting effects make everything seem muddy.  The weather effects do not help this at all since dust or fog absorb light even more.  The character designs are quite nice, Nier himself does take the award for being one of the ugliest characters in the game.  Also, the character model borrows from Nier Replicant, which had a younger protagonist, making the much older, in the U.S. version, Nier move a little oddly times.  Kaine wears stilettos and not much else, but the outfit is... interesting.  Emil's outfit is initially standard, but in the second half, it is suitably creepy and intricate.  Environments have that post-apocalyptic feel to them, which is suitable since humanity is facing extinction.The audio in Nier is absolutely outstanding.  The voice actors do their jobs quite well.  The music is very, very good.  Nier's soundtrack rivals almost any other video game, even Final Fantasy.  Language takes center stage in this game, even in the music.  There are a handful of different themes, mostly vocal, but they vary quite a bit with additional instruments.  In many of the songs, there is a single person performing the piece.  Most of those titles are written and performed by Emi Evans, including the game's final theme, \"Ashes of Dreams.\" Ashes is performed four times, one for each ending, each in a different language, English, French, Japanese, and Gaelic.  As a side note, the soundtrack lists the Gaelic version as GER, which many believe is German, Emi Evans confirmed there is no German anywhere on the soundtrack.  Aside from Ashes, none of the songs are performed in an understandable language, Evans took those four languages, twisted them, combined them, and then created songs with words that simply sound nice.  I cannot recommend Nier's soundtrack highly enough, it is a must listen.  Top songs include, \"Ashes of Dreams,\" most of the \"Song of the Ancients\" mixes, Kaine's themes, Emil's themes, and the various forms of Yonah.Misc.:  Nier was an interesting experience, the gameplay wasn't complex, but the story was quite intriguing.  The action RPG portion of the game is not very deep, nor is the game crushingly difficult to play, such as Demon's Souls.  The graphics are a bit sub-par, but great games should rarely be considered as such solely on eye candy.  The story was fascinating, more so after completing the game the first time and seeing where the Shades come from and what they are saying.  In many cases, viewing the individual stories of the boss Shades made the battles from the first playthrough tragic in subsequent playthroughs.  Indeed, some of the battles went from taking down the evil Shade the first time, to a series of unfortunate misunderstandings that led to battle in the second, third, and fourth plays of the game.  In fact, some of them actually made me a bit misty-eyed, like the one between P-33 (a.k.a. Beepy) and Roc (a.k.a. The Shade Wolf).  Nier's saving grace comes from the originality, few games take the risk of adding in a text-driven adventure game to the middle of a hack-and-slash, nor do they add side-scrollers.  Few games rarely have the caliber of audio Nier has, even most AAA titles.Overall, I enjoyed my experience with Nier.  The game world isn't too large, but that means the areas can be relatively rich with content.  The main story is original, though very depressing at times, but the side missions lack variety.  The art design in some cases is quite inventive, especially those involving characters or enemies, but it gets bogged down by lighting effects that make everything seem muddy.  The game has different modes of play which allow it to take a breather from the standard action RPG model.  As for trophies, this game is mostly about gathering and grinding.  A few trophies do require skill, but during multiple playthrough's, those are going to be quite easy given how powerful Nier will become.  The weapon upgrading trophies will be difficult to earn, only because of the patience involved in doing them, same is true with the money-earning trophy.  One of the more difficult trophies will involve completing the game within a certain amount of time.  The player will have to race to get it done fast enough.  Nier will very much be a niche title, appealing to those who like Japanese RPG's first and foremost, people who like action RPG's but don't necessarily like JRPG's, may want to consider renting this before purchasing.  Given how the story evolved, it is possible to create a Nier 2, but it is far from certain that Square Enix will want to do this especially with the game's developer, Cavia, being disbanded.  It would be in Square Enix's best interest if they could get the game's composers to do more titles, such as Final Fantasy, to truly showcase their masterful work.  This is a game that doesn't do anything remarkable, gameplay wise, but it is still fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-31-2011"}
{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"NeoTristan","summary":"Uncharted 2 is Among the Best","reviewText":"The long awaited and eagerly anticipated sequel to the most exciting cinematic game experience I've had since the original 'Uncharted: Drake's Fortune' and 'Metal Gear Solid 4' is finally here.Drenched with colorful, lush, and bright graphic and environment with some intensely dark atmosphere, this is the liveliest and most awe-inspiringly beautiful game this year and it's the feat few games have ever come close to in the history of video game.  Graphics definitely improved slightly from already top-notch original.  Animation is fluid, natural, and life-like, captured by now-common Hollywood filmmaking motion-capture technology to create CGI. In fact, everything in this game is superbly on par with the best of top-notch Hollywood summer blockbuster. This game is better than anything I've seen during this year's (2009) dreadful summer movie line-ups. Griping pulpy action-adventure storyline in remeniscent of 'Indiana Jones' series, exciting orchestra and atmospheric scores using lots of drums and flutes, intense 3rd-person action, platform and puzzle gameplay mechanics and seamlessly integrated cutscenes peppered with many filmmaking techniques and signature camera movements are nothing short of brilliant. It borrows the best elements from various games and movies, thoroughly digests, and in turn creates something so familiar yet different.  U2 oozes with quality in every second it's on your screen.Despite the wave after wave of baddies with assortments of guns and more guns, this is not a mindless 3rd-person shooter. The importance of using cover is imperative. Without cover, stealth and acrobatic moves, you are likely to get killed within few seconds. Yet the satisfaction of pumping bullets into baddies is immensely gratifying. Newly implemented stealth attack is a nice addition to the original. Jumping from one ledge to anothor is exciting and platforming is all about how to get to the next area. Puzzle-solving is less complex but adequate enough for the game's main attraction is story and action. There are also a few stages where you are shooting for your life on moving stages.Acting is superb and real actors in motion-sensor suit were casted for acting and voice. One of few game that can really claim that the acting is top-notch along with superb voice-acting.  The score and the sound effects are incredible.  Hearing the main theme for the second time is a pure joy and an instant reminder that U2 is a sequel to an outstanding and highly successful blockbuster.U2 is a prime example where linearity, if well-structured, gives you more intense sense of urgency and excitement, something open-ended, free-forming games often lack. Furthermore, without the loading time, it actually feels as if it were, free-roaming game. Cutscenes are used by in-game graphics and they are blended seamlessly together. This is the closest thing to 'Interactive Movie' alongside the renowned MGS series. Throughout the game, the feeling of you being involved and immersed into the very game you play as if you were the main protagonist is constantly and continuously maintained.Naughty Dogs added co-op and up to 10 competitive multiplayer this time and main campaign spans 26 chapters in 12 to 15 hours single player campaign plus unlockable contents, hidden treasure hunts and trophies collection.Combat and movement is slightly more refined than the first one and stages are more diverse.  There are more contents and the game is also slightly longer than the first one.  The only downside, as a fan of action-adventure game, is just as the first game was, that the puzzle elements are too far and between and platforming still feels little too automated.  But Platforming is exciting nontheless and figuring out how to get to the next is puzzle itself, so as I said before, the main focus here is story and action and the pacing is incredible to make you forget the minor complains.  Everything on screen is pure joy to your eyes and graphical attention to detail like no other game currently in the market.Exciting action adventure game with awesome combat in breakneck-pace, quality script and great presentation, Uncharted 2 ventures further into where many games have gone before but few games succeed and places itself among the very best of video game.  Get it now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"fallowstarz","summary":"You call THAT tenderloin ???","reviewText":"Bioshock is the greatest first-person shooter ever made, by quite a wide margin. But it is not a great game, merely a good one.The story of Bioshock is passable, and while the style of exposition, in which the player learns more about the story by picking up and playing audio diaries, would have been a great addition to a game that was already story-based, it does not suffice to create a game that is story-based, on its own. There are virtually no cutscenes in the game, and while the diaries and radio transmissions are well-scripted and voiced, their characterization of the inhabitants of rapture quickly becomes redundant and superfluous, while their explication of the chain of events leading to the downfall of the attempted utopia remains oversimplified and unconvincing. Bioshock's is a story which ought to have been told from more angles.The plot itself, while frequently advertised as revolutionary and ultimately surprising, seems literary only in comparison to those of other action video games, and if Bioshock were a screenplay for a feature film, the plot's resolution would almost certainly be rejected, not because of its self-proclaimed boldness, but rather because within the established canon of science fiction, it would be sen as hackeneyed beyond passability. There are four or five stories that have been told again and again in science fiction, with only the superficial details changed, and the story of Bioshock is one of these, verbatim.The soundtrack to Bioshock is superb. Blasting one's way past drug-addled mutants in the ruins of restaurants and hospital waiting rooms, to the sound of pop hits from the 40's and 50's creates the kind of thematic redefinition of music seen in films such as David Lynch's Blue Velvet, and Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs. The art direction and virtual architecture in the game are also superb, but a couple of production issues detract from the player's enjoyment of being in Rapture. First, although the game supports surround sound, the direction of the speakers used to play the various sounds within the virtual environment, does not consistently correspond with the direction of their source, relative to the player. Being fired at from the left might result in the sound of gunfire being evenly mixed throughout all speakers, leaving the player with no audible clue as to the direction of the ambush. It is absurd for the game to support 5.1 and 7.1-channel sound, if it is not going to take advantage of obvious opportunities to use it. The second major technical flaw is in the lighting. Light sources in this game illuminate to an unrealistically high degree at close range, and an unrealistically low degree at long range. Frequently, a light bright enough to clearly illuminate its immediate surroundings, will not prevent a section of the same room, which is only fifteen feet away from the light, from remaining completely dark.The gameplay is excellent, and although the enemies in this game are frequently stupid enough to come rushing into a corridor where they have you pinned, allowing you to engage them all from the front, rather than waiting in the adjacent open area for you to emerge from the corridor, the great physics in this game's combat more than compensate for the lackluster AI, which is partly explained by the game's story. There is a realistic feel to using the weapons, and at any given time, there are a few different feasible tactical approaches to combat, of which charging in Rambo-style is usually the worst. Compared to games like Resident Evil 4, there is almost an overavailability of ammo and healing items in this game, which makes returning through rooms that have already been cleared of enemies to scavenge for them, whenever the player has been weakened from battle, almost too powerful of a strategy, which detracts from the necessity to use ammo and Eve efficiently and take a minimal number of hits. There is also no penalty for dying in this game, but it's not as big of a problem as the overabundance of items, because players looking for a challenge can always choose to return to their last save position every time they die, rather than taking advantage of the infinite, free respawns which the game offers them.If you're new to First-Person Shooters, this is a good game to start with, because it was designed to be finishable by almost anyone. If you like great stories, but for whatever reason, you never read or watch movies, then you might like this game for its story, because it is actually pretty decent by video game standards. If you're a hardcore gamer, you might like this game for a while, just because it's fun, and it has interesting level design and combat physics. And if you're a first-person shooter fan, you'll almost certainly like this game, because it excels in most areas, compared to other first-person shooters. I can't honestly think of many categories of gamers who wouldn't like this game at least a little bit. But like the majority of other games, it would be very hard to argue that this is a work of art, and harder yet to argue that it is an important one.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-29-2007"}

Although I have all three systems now, I haven't played very many, and with $60 a game, it's a perfect alibi. But of all the new games I've played, next to Metal Gear Solid 4, this is one of my favorites.GRAPHICS: Like all the new games, they look great. The world is expansive, realistic, and everything moves flawlessly.MUSIC: It's like the music on movies. You really do not pay attention to it, because it segues in with the main picture itself.STORY: When you look at the cover, you probably think that it's just about an assassin's adventures in the 10th century, but there's more to it than that. It's a twist that really makes this game unique.The game's concept is that memories of ancestors are embedded in DNA. The Animus is a device that allows a person to relive those memories. Dr. Vidic, holding a young man named Desmond Miles against his will, forces him to relive the memories of Altair, an assassin in the 10th century. What does Vidic want, though? So, it's really divided into two stories: Altair's, and Desmond's.GAMEPLAY: Here we go to the meat of the review. As an assassin, Altair has a lot on his arsenal. He can throw knives, which he gets by pick pocketing thugs, he can use a sword, he can use his fists, and my favorite, he can assassinate targets using his hidden blade, which he had to cut off his own finger to use. The combat system relies heavily on blocking and countering, and once you master those two moves, a swordfight is quite easy. Altair is also as strong as an ox, so he can climb almost anything. He scales tall buildings like Spider Man, then he looks around to update his map. How does he get down? He takes a leap of faith off the building and lands in hay.There are a total of four cities and a world map. In the unfamiliar towns, guards will come after you if you are exposed or cause trouble. Altair can blend in with the crowd if things get too suspicious. There are also hidden flags, and a lot of them, in each area, though I haven't got them all. They're kind of like the hidden packages in GTA, you could say.Most of the game involves assassinating different people who all share a connection. Altair loses his high rank early in the game, along with his weapons, and the only way to restore his reputation is to please his master and kill. He collects the information about his targets by pick pocketing maps, interrogating people, eavesdropping, and various other ways. Once he is done, the mission begins.There are also more elements in the game, but I'll let you discover them on your own. While some people would say the gameplay is repetitive, which it kinda is, I think that it's unique and pretty entertaining. Though, I hope for a little more variety in the sequel.ACHIEVEMENTS: Since I'm reviewing the 360 version, I might as well mention the achievements. Much of the points are gotten as you progress through the game, though points are rewarded for things such as collecting all the flags, having a 10-minute battle, blending in with scholars 20 times, and even going through every conversation between Desmond and Vidic's assistant, Lucy. On my first play I got 33 out of the 44 achievements, getting 810 out of 1000 Gamer Points. Can you beat mine?  Post your scores by commenting me.BUY: If you don't like repetitive game play, you might want to rent it first, since the game has mixed reviews, but otherwise it's a must have for the 360 or PS3. It's also a greatest hits title, so you can get it for cheap.Bring on the sequel!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-04-2009"}

But there's something to be said for the well-executed gameplay and interface and the well-designed levels. The game even has a sense of humor. What's wrong with it?  Just a few non-critical things.  The zombie add on is actually more fun than the main game (assuming you play that add-on at around level 10) and there's more walking back and forth around levels than ideally I would like.  The game isnt actually hard in the longer run because there's little penalty if you die. You lose some cash but cash is everywhere.  But those are minor points.  Its easily a 4 star game.The only people who might not like the game are those who want a deeper RPG game with their combat.  Sure, you can customize your characters abilities but ultimately this is a game about acquiring better guns and trying to stay alive as enemies spawn around you.  The auto-spawning is _part_ of the gameplay otherwise the game would be too easy.  You have to balance your limited ammunition and additionally use the right guns for every enemy type.

{"product_name":"B0050SY4DG","description":"","reviewerName":"Evildead11","summary":"Resident Average","reviewText":"The reviews of Resident Evil's latest release seem to be to either extreme - love it or hate it.  I assume that has a lot to do with die hard RE fans chiming in.  I can understand some of the praise and certainly some of the criticism of this game.  I've played every RE title from the very first entry until this one, and for the most part, liked them all.  However, that's not to say that each one didn't have it's own flaws.  Resident Evil 1 thru 3 were great games, but the long load times from one room to the next, the bad camera angles, clunky controls and very questionable voice acting were definitely negatives.  However, those negatives didn't stop them from being classics.  RE: Code Veronica was insanely, frustratingly difficult, but still a great game.  Resident Evil 4, my personal favorite, was one of the best installments to date, but still didn't have the best control set up and the inventory system was tedious.  RE: 5 was a very good game, even if you had to put up with an idiotic AI partner.  RE: 6, while not the greatest game ever, did make some improvements over previous installments.  The controls, for one.  I've read some reviews that criticized the controls, stating that they were similar to that of Gears of War.  Well, what's wrong with that??  GOW games had great controls!  I've read a lot of complaints about the real-time button mashing and how there is way too much of it.  Well, to those people I say you probably didn't get too far along in the game.  It does start of with multiple real-time button mashing moments, but later in the game they are scaled back and really only used primarily as instruments to shake of attacking enemies.  The invenotry system is more fluid - no more trying to \"Tetris\" your equipment into a suitcase.  The voice acting is decent (actually an improvement over past RE games).  The story is true to the franchise and is decent, although not the groudbreaking storyline I was expecting.  I will add that you should really play the game on a higher difficulty level to maximize the fun.  On lower difficulty, it's much too easy - you can pretty much melee zombies to death, while rarely pulling the trigger of your gun.  The bottom line is that, while it's not the best game ever played - and maybe not even the best of the franchise - it's also not the worst.  It's a decent game.  A little diappointing, maybe, what with all the hype surrounding it prior to it's release.  However, the fanboys that are trashing it as the worst game ever are simply out of their minds.  Would I recommend spending $60.00 on this game?  Not so much.  But when it drops to about $40.00, it's absolutely worth a purchase.  And if you've had the displeasure of playing the game that is TRULY the worst in the franchise - Operation Raccoon City - RE: 6 will be a breath of fresh air!  In summation, don't believe the hype - positive or negative.  It's a good game - not a terrible or great one.  If you're a true Resident Evil fan such as myself, you should derive some enjoyment from this game.PROS- Improved controller layout over previous installments- Improved partner AI- Improved inventory system- Better voice acting- Looks nice graphically- A decent challenge if played on the right difficulty level- It isn't Operation: Raccoon CityCONS- The game seems a little contrived.  Not a whole lot sneaks up on you- WAY too easy on lower difficulties.  You can pretty much fight your way through zombies with hand to hand combat- Doesn't meet the high expectations of hardcore Resident Evil fansOverall score: 8/10","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2012"}

(First time for simulation)","reviewText":"I have played Forza Motosport 3 and did not enjoy the experience, I find racing got too stale quickly. I have also played Gran Turismo 5 too and found it difficult to get used to. I like to play games for fun, not the steep curve in difficulty and make it utter realistic that is not a game anymore. My first opinion is Forza 4 feels just WOW. After getting for nice low price from Amazon, the racing in the game, felt more significantly smoother than Foza 3.I wanted Xbox Exclusive game and Forza had high rating.Presentation and Gameplay:One thing I don't like about games that do not feature full suited career mode but Forza 4 totally nails it here. Career features tons of races and difficulty increases very gradually. The menu navigation are presented in simple manner with one drawback, I would have prefer to directly upgrade the car or do tuning by selecting the car instead you have go menu back to upgrade section. This isn't troublesome but little annoying to my opinion, otherwise as said it easy navigate. Forza is simulation racer, for non-sim racer, I was bit hesitant about getting it but playing and lost track of time, I realized that I got into the game and learned the mechanincs with ease. It starts quite easy and so far (reached level 23 in Expert Division), I find the races  to be beateable on first go, providing that no mistakes done and thanks to \"Rewind\", it surely comes as plus for novice racers like me. I am fan of TV Series Top Gear, and was amazed to see that Jeremy Clarkson provides voiceovers on various vehicles in Autovista Mode. This gives the game a high quality feel. Customization is one thing I enjoy doing and Forza provides quite bit for tuner and some vehicles so you can get that unique look on your rideGraphics:Xbox 360 is aged console similar like the PS3 but that didn't hamper the developers to dish out the most beautiful and details visuals that I ever seen in a video game. I have seen Gran Turismo 5 looking great but I from the direct comparison (did myself in own setup running both games). Forza 4 looks more visually superior, shading is right and reflections are real. The car models in Autovista are truly amazing, incredible level of texture and shading level. I was at awe most of time when looking at the cars. I may not have that car in real, but Forza satisfies my inner desire of driving such exotics.Multiplayer:I have tried a bit, did some races and see in game player community for clubs (clans), auction house and store. As mentioned before, I am not great racer and not good for online racing yet I will sure give it more try but so far it was utterly smooth, no lag almost or anything weird happening. Cars from Career mode can be driven in Multiplayer too which is good thing as we racers like to show off our ride.Kinect Features:I have kinect so I give it a show first time. Racing with kinect can be tiring as you have put hands out like holding invisible steering wheel. Head-tracking is excellent, requires a little of calibration before usage so it tracks more accurately. The Autovista mode of Kinect is absolutely garbage, tracking is horrible, from the looks its more software problem, I disliked the selection menu of cars using kinect, it is so difficult to browse. Thumbs down for Kinect. Great Ambition but requires more improvement.For any car enthusiast, stop playing arcade racers like Need for Speed (except Shift, whihch is aim and haven't played), go grab of copy of Forza 4 and you will know this game will give the experience to drive your dream in most realistic detail and manner.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-20-2011"}

The achievements wouldn't hurt, but not being an achievement hunter, that wasn't much of a factor.Game play is pretty much identical.  The hair is finer, and more detailed, the water scenes seemed a bit better, but all in all, not having played them next to each other for direct comparison, I really didn't notice anything that jumped out at me otherwise.But past the comparisons, it's still a fun game to play.  I like the paths for advancement, and weapon upgrades.  It's nice to get to decide where you want to focus your abilities, since I know some people prefer guns, others prefer the bow, so you can pick what you want to improve first.Sound is well done, the surround working well on my system.  The controls are fine once you get used to them, although I've never been a fan of cinematic movie scenes where you have to press A at the right time, etc...The puzzles aren't too difficult, so sometimes things are just a bit easy, but the fact that you can wander freely for a lot of the game helps offset that.  It's linear where you have to go, but you're not locked in having to follow only the storyline directly, you have freedom to wander.The landscapes are pretty impressive in some places, amazing detail and it's just visually astounding when you're up on something high looking down.All in all, if you haven't played this on another system, it's definitely worth getting.

The introduction of voice acting, goofy at times and strange, added a new experience to the series, along with the new battle system, the elimination of the world map, and the Sphere Grid.The graphics are nothing short of superb, easily surpassing the past installments and many of today's games.  The fully 3D backgrounds, characters, and realistic FMV's are also part of the leap that Square made.The story that is unveiled throughout the game is FFX's shining point.

The graphics may be inferior to the latest PC games (Wii graphical capabilities are not one of its strong-points) however, I cannot remember when cutting-edge graphics were essential in the enjoyment of any cRPG. Having said that, the environments (from the grass and the creeks to the trees and the skies) have been designed to maximize the console's potential in most instances.Not so with the sound: good music but low quality sound. And the dialogues are still scripted, not voiced. It makes no sense to hire top talent to compose the themes and sounds - only to present them badly.The use of the motion-sensing Wii-Remote together with the Nunchuk follows a steep learning curve. Once mastered though the real fun begins. Moving with the Nunchuk and fighting with the Remote make the game such an immersive experience. Swinging the Wii-Remote actually swings Link's sword - and aiming in the screen will ail your arrows and projectiles.It surprised me and brought back memories at the same time - and I had not have so much fun in years.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-11-2010"}

{"product_name":"B000R39GPA","reviewerName":"D. VASQUEZ","summary":"This game ended up as disappointing in practice as it was promising in theory","reviewText":"I always wonder why star wars games for the most part end up being crap, i mean some for sure are good, but for the most part they're either bad, or barely slightly above average. With some notable exceptions of course which i'll mention in a bit.This game fails in so many different ways, there was so much potential in it, but somehow at each point in the game where you smell the potential, it somehow manages to not only disappear, but you basically forget it was even there. The developers here succeeded in ruining almost every possible piece of this game that could have been fun, and in many cases, i don't understand why. Let's go into the details...There is some good, let's start with it first and get it out of the way...GRAPHICS: Game has generally attractive graphics, may not up to par with some big dogs we have on the PS3, but it looks very well, specially lightsaber effects, as well as force effects. There are some levels though, that seem kind of messy, particularly the junk / jungle type of levels, personally i felt the ship type levels were the most visually attractive.STORY: the story is kind of simple, but it works well, some voice acting could've been better, i particularly found the main character dull and boring, but overall, it gets the job done.Now with the bad....brace yourselves....GAMEPLAY: my my, where to begin? how i hate you, let me count the ways...There is just so many things wrong here, it's hard to focus on a single thing. For starters, you're supposed to be this huge powerful Sith, and the force powers you acquire are supposed to reflect that, but throughout the entire game you don't feel like one at all. Even the most simple of enemies, like the stormtroopers, can kick your ass, it just doesn't make sense at all with the power the game tries to establish. Every hack and slash game has it's share of low level and high level enemies, in the case of god of war for example, you have your share that give you trouble, and you have your share that you mop the floor with, but god of war manages to make you feel like the powerful being that you are.Not here though, here you slash at a storm trooper 3 times, and he gets up, you STAB him with your saber, and he gets up.... i mean what the hell?, and it only gets worse as your force powers increase. Yes you have the amazing power to bring a star destroyer down with your bare hands, but a storm trooper with some silly shield can take every force power you can throw at him? lighting, force push, grip, nothing works on many these guys, it's like the game makes you a god, and then sets everything up so your power is useless, what the hell is the point of doing it then?Every part of this game that could have been fun, ends up being ruined by extremely HORRIBLE design, everything ends up being just unbearably frustrating, not fun, the star destroyer example above is one example, one of the most horrible gaming experiences i have ever gone through. That particular piece could've been made GREAT, but it's just one of many things that end up getting screwed up, and you just don't wanna have to go through it ever again.Another thing that SUCKS BIG TIME, is the fighting mechanics, often you'll find yourself dying, and it's not obvious at all how it happened, you're slashing here, slashing there, and all of a sudden, you see 90 percent of your life went away, no explosion, no nothing, you died, this happens VERY VERY often, particularly in jedi fights, where the mechanics are the most HORRIBLE.This is one of the places where the wasted potential is more obvious, the fights don't make sense, you can't even clearly tell when your opponent is blocking or not, or if you're actually hitting him, if you're being effective at all. Jedi Knight series is very old and even the fights there were much better than the ones here. What happened here? this is where the game needs to thrive. Camera view also doesn't help here.I could go on forever with the gameplay shortcomings of this game, but let me move on to even another area where this games \"SHINES\". And it's BUGS, this game has MANY MANY BUGS. They range from frustrating clipping problems, all of the sudden you can't move and nothing is on your way, sometimes you get frozen in mid air while you jump, there are platforms you're supposed to be able to climb onto, but when you try, you keep slipping off OVER AND OVER, makes you think like you really can't get on there, but you CAN, 15 attempts later you do get on, it's just STUPID. Also when you pause and then unpause, there's a small delay many times of 1-2 seconds for some reason, before you can actually move, unfortunately though, enemies CAN move while you're frozen like a bitch, so many times they'll end you in those 2 seconds. Bosses (Vader for example) sometimes freeze, and you need to die in order to start over again. Also, i've died one or two times because when a real time video occurs, of enemies coming into play, sometimes they fire at me before the video is actually over....so when it is you're already less than half health...Did they bother hiring testers for this?I could say much more but the above probably covers enough. Thankfully the pain only cost 8 dollars for me, but feel sorry for those who bought at full price. Hopefully the sequel will improve this a lot, much like Assassins Creed 2 was a huge improvement of the first one, we shall find out soon enough.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2010"}

In a haunting gothic world that fuses the look and feel of Dickensean London and Wiemar Germany, you must use stealth, gadgets and magic to undo the sinister conspiracy that cost you your good name, and your citizens their freedom.Dishonored will feel immediately familiar to any fan of PC stealth gaming. Its world fiction could be lifted exactly from Deus Ex; it takes place in a crumbling industrial waterfront city decimated by plague, instead of nano-augmentation you have black magic, and instead of insane AIs talking to you it's creepy trickster gods. Even the arsenal is remarkably similar (ooh, a tiny crossbow with stun darts!) The visual design of the game is also more than a little reminiscent of Half Life 2. Dishonored comes by these similarities honestly, however, since designers from both games worked on this one too. And if your game is going to be a pastiche of other games, it might as well borrow from the best.In terms of Gameplay, Dishonored serves up a mixed experience. It's exciting sneaking around and ambushing your enemies, but combat controls are only so-so, and while there are lots of interesting powers and gadgets to use, only a handful support a bloodless solution. Nonlethal combat can, as a result feel frustrating, when it's so easy to run out in the open and let your sword do the talking. Perhaps because of this, your bodycount is now inversely proportionate to the quality of your ending, and while it's neat to see murder have consequences, the baddies in this game are so irredeemably rotten that sparing them seems a little out of character, especially since they've killed your empress and ruined your life.Big props go to the art side of things. Voice acting is outstanding and there is a LOT of dialog. The character models are a bit cartoony, but they work, and the environments are a wonderfully grotesque mess of baroque slums and gnashing iron machine-works. Much like Deus Ex: Human Revolution, the game will not overtax your video card, but it uses slick lighting and lots of detail to minimize the harm caused by blurry textures and low poly counts here and there. Critically, the environment is very expressive of where you can and cannot be seen, WITHOUT these locations seeming contrived.PROS:-Great atmosphere-Good story, acting, and art assets-Satisfying stealth/ambush mechanics-It's always nice to see a new franchise that isn't awful-Manages to avoid the Unreal Engine's usual horrible texture pop-inCONS:-Essentially made up of parts of other, arguably better games-Nonlethal combat is limited and frustrating-Visuals suffer from accommodating consoles just a little-Hopelessly bleak game universe can be a little taxing; If solving a puzzle where you lure man-eating rats away from a switch with a pile of tasty human corpses isn't your cup of tea, stay away","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2012"}

Very challenging though","reviewText":"Ok this game is super fun like the other Midnight club games, your in a city and you can drive anywhere and you have to find racers and when your race you go from check point to check point so you basically choose your own path but its easy. But this game has ONE difficulty setting so it gets pretty challenging. So its good fun and all but dont expect to beat it as easily as your would beat Mario Kart or something.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-01-2011"}

{"product_name":"B0053B5RGI","description":"The Next Evolution in Pokemon comes to Nintendo 3DS.","reviewerName":"Jessie Scott","summary":"The Next Evolution of Pokemon - An In Depth Review","reviewText":"Pokemon is back on the 3DS (and 2DS)! It has many notable improvements, while still relying on the same mechanics that have been around (and updated) since the Blue/Red generations.--Be sure to go to the Title Screen, select Mystery Gift from the Internet to get your special Torchic while it lasts!--**SUMMARY**Graphics: 5/5 - The graphics are nothing less than stunning. The games exploration is non-stereoscopic 3D that transitions into stereoscopic 3D battles. The 3D effects are gorgeous. The pokemon look better than ever and it looks like it could have come straight from the show. NOTE: While the 2DS can obviously play this, players will miss out on the phenomenal stereoscopic graphics which is a shame. The 3DS is the definitely the better experience.  Note: there is lag when the 3D effects are on during battles.  It doesn't bother me at all, but others have noted that they don't like it.Audio: 4/5 - The chiptunes are still here with several familiar themes, remixes and brand new arrangements. Considering the more powerful hardware of the 3DS, it would have been nice to hear some higher quality music. The sounds from Pokemon and their moves have received an upgrade.Gameplay: 4/5 - This is still the Pokemon that has been around since Red/Blue: Catch Pokemon, Defeat Gym Leaders, Challenge the Pokemon League. Limited to 4 moves, there are TMs and HMs (Technical and Hidden Machines, respectively, that allow you teach a Pokemon a new move). The addition of new battle types (Horde and Aerial), improvements to experience gain (players will get experience points for capturing Pokemon and the item called EXP Share that does what it sounds like), and the new Mega-Evolutions keep the game feeling fresh.Online: 4/5 - The online does what it promises - makes it easy to meet people for battles or trading.  You can search for trades or opponents over the internet without the need for a friend code.  You can still swap friend codes for an easy invite though.  The Pokemon Online Bank is set to come out in December with a 4.99/year price tag which will make transferring Pokemon a lot easier.Overall: 4/5 - This is a fantastic addition to the Pokemon franchise, and certainly worth the purchase price. The game is gorgeous but still suffers from old gameplay tropes and plays like previous iterations, for better or worse. It is definitely faster paced that the older games.  The new gameplay mechanics are a welcome addition and I have been having a blast so far.**IN-DEPTH REVIEW**--Graphics--The 3D battles and effects are truly amazing. The Pokemon aren't just pop-up book style cutouts, having depth and looking like true 3D. Each Pokemon is animated as well, making the old sprite based games look ancient in comparison. Each move looks fantastic and realistic, as if it was taken from the show. The Pokedex pulls up in 3D as well. Like any other Pokemon game, there are some fantastic models, but there are also some ridiculous ones as well that I can't imagine people will use other than to add another number to the Pokedex of caught Pokemon.The camera is typically at an angled, top-down view. At certain locations the view is zoomed in to show detail or where the character is going. The scenery looks great as well, with the blue water sparkling as it shifts, grass blowing in the wind, and the towns looking vibrant.Character models have seen a huge improvement as well, getting a full 3D makeover. Player can choose to be a something-teen boy or girl, select one of three face/hair/skin color combinations, and even have the ability to find/earn/buy new clothes to equip on their character, allowing them to look diverse and unique.The battle screen looks similar to the older games, with a typical backdrop and the Pokemon themselves in a \"terrain\" circle (surrounded by grass, for instance, when in the plains) and across from the enemy. The backdrops have been improved and look great. The screen zooms in and cuts between the two contenders while selecting a move to perform and helps make it feel like each battle could be part of the show.--Audio--I was expecting the same chiptune roars and squelches that I've heard before. And there are still there.  There are also some new ones that I was not expecting. The first time I ran into a Pikachu I knew I was going to hear that 8-bit thunder-cry it's had since the first generation -- instead I heard it say \"Pikachu\" as it would from the show.  Some are less impressive than others; the quality varies.The music is cheery and bright, not much has changed here. The songs sound like they came from any of the last few generations. This is a good or bad thing depending on how much you like the previous tunes.  I can't recall any particular tune as nothing is extraordinarily fantastic.Aside from the music, there are some classic sounds as well. Booting up the computer elicits a familiar sound. Opening up your backpack sounds like shifting leather/cloth material. The sounds aren't overly fancy, but get the job done.--Gameplay--There have been numerous upgrades to gameplay. Starting the game greets the player with the Professor greeting the player and explaining what Pokemon are. Then you choose your gender and get started. Within a few minutes, you'll have your first Pokemon and will be off battling and capturing!  The starts are classic Fire/Grass/Water types; pick the one that looks best to you and be assured you can trade for the others later.You can run from the outset by holding B. Before you even defeat the first Gym you'll get Roller Skates that allow you to glide around extremely fast. Use the Skates by moving the Circle Pad. You can go back to the traditional movement style by using the Directional Pad.Experience points have seen a much needed upgrade.  Capturing a Pokemon no longer results in 0 experience points, you'll still get the normal amount.  Also, after defeating the first Gym leader, her younger sister will give you the EXP Share Key Item before you head out to Route 4. This handy item gives ALL Pokemon in your party 50% of the experience that the active Pokemon earn. The active Pokemon who participated do not have any reduction in their XP for having the item on.Battle is the same as it's always been: a maximum of 4 moves, you pick one, and the higher speed goes first.  Each move has a number of times it can be used between Pokemon Center visits. There are, of course, new moves which add more depth.  A new Pokemon type has been added: Fairy, which is strong against Fighting, Dragon, and Dark.  New battle types are present too. In addition to the classic single and doubles matches, there are also Horde Encounters where up to 5 wild Pokemon fight the player. There are also Aerial battles that pit two flying Pokemon against each other high above the ground. These add variety to the typical battle styles which helps keep things feeling fresh.Battles do move quickly. The animations are fantastic which add to the joy of watching each battle play out. However, many players will find themselves watching the same move get played out over and over again when they first start. The same mechanics basic battle mechanics are in place, with moves being more effective against some types than others, and Pokemon who use moves that match their type get a nice power boost.Catching Pokemon is still a similar affair too. Weaken the wild Pokemon, throw a ball, and wait for it to jump around 3 times to see it captured. The Pokemon in the beginning areas tall grass are quite varied as well, meaning you can start to capture them all, or just build a large variety team early on. In the first forest it's possible to catch at least 7 to 8 different kinds of Pokemon if you stick around long enough. Each Pokemon still has a % chance to show up, with common Pokemon like Caterpie and Weedle showing up the most.Money is doled out quite frequently. I try to keep a full stock of Pokeballs at all time and several potions on hand just in case.There are new mini games: Pokemon-Amie lets you play, feed, and pet your Pokemon to enhance your bond with them and Super Training allows you to increase their EV (base stats) for the more competitive players.  After playing Pokemon-Amie with one of my Pokemon, in hopes of increasing it's happiness to evolve, I discovered that there is both affection and happiness in X and Y, and these are two different things entirely.  When you maximize your affection in Amie, your Pokemon will have a closer bond with you; so far my Riolu has dodged attacks and had more critical hits, in addition to sometimes playing an animation of my character petting him for good work after the battle.Player Search System (PSS) is a new way to find, trade and battle with players locally and globally.  This should make online interactions quicker and easier than ever before.Mega-Evolutions are a new temporary evolution state that certain Pokemon can achieve during battles only.  Only certain Pokemon can perform these evolutions with a Mega Stone equipped, like Mew-Two, Charizard, Blastoise, Venosaur, and Blaziken.  There are others to discover as well!--Online--Online works really well, including being able to trade using the Global Trade Station (GTS) and conducting battles from the start.  You can trade, battle, send messages, and grant O-Powers to others.  There are no co-operative elements to the online, which is understandable given the single player driven type of game this is.  You can easily add friends through the Friend Code function or by detecting them using a local connection.  Once there, it's easy to look through your lists.  At the bottom of the PSS is a huge list of players that you can scroll through.  All in all, the online is functional and useful for staging battles or trading for your favorites.--Overall--This is definitely the next evolution of the franchise.  The same gameplay mechanics from past generations are here with notable additions.  The graphics are beautiful, the highest selling point of the game likely.  The sound is adequate and well done well, but nothing stands out as striking or extraordinary.  The mechanics have been refined further, but I can't help but think this may have been an opportunity to try something new or synthesize new mechanics to give the series a fresh take.  I suppose the old adage of \"if it's not broke, don't fix it\" applies here.  Everything is refined and works.  This game is a 3DS game definitely worth owning.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2013"}
