This game has a cool storyline, excellent controls, beautiful graphics, and an awesome open world. This is the first Assassin's Creed game where I feel like the game is a true open world--as the protagonist Edward Kenway you can completely stop playing the main story and pillage and plunder the Caribbean at your will. The game map is massive, with plenty of side quests and hidden secrets to keep you entertained for hours. The story feels short, but was most likely intentional to allow the player room to explore the map at their own will.

They easily competed for awards left and right, and Game of the Year was no exception. In my opinion, Skyward Sword is a strong contender for that title. It's a retention and refinement of the same ol' Zelda formula, and fans new and old will find much to like here. While the game is rated for everyone, I strongly recommend that players with a great deal of patience should be the sole audience. More skill and dexterity is required to master Link's movements in this legend, so many newcomers or younger gamers may find themselves often frustrated when trying to master the controls. But this isn't to say that the controls are flawed. In fact, while trying eagerly to perfectly fit the Wii's controllers, Skyward Sword shows you just what the Wii is truly capable of--and, at the same time, what it's not capable of.So this is the beginning of the legends. Much is different in this installment, but the game is very much still Zelda. Some may argue it's too formulaic, but consider Ocarina of Time, which actually retained the same formula, translated that formula to 3D, and incorporated the auto-jump and Z-targeting. Skyward Sword keeps the Zelda mantle on, but has so much more detail inside. The motion controls truly change everything--but everyone may not be willing to adapt. Perhaps the only challenge people expect from Zelda titles are dungeons. Sadly, this is no longer the case, but this does not mean that this game is bad; the controls are a new kind of challenge, and, while Nintendo's console's main feature is still relatively new in the gaming world, they still know how to perfect it in its nascent state.As I'm sure everyone has been, I was eagerly awaiting 1:1 sword controls, but, unfortunately, became frustrated when I just couldn't get them right. Are we as gamers truly ready for full motion controls? Are they what we really want? Other Zeldas seemed \"easy\" to control; combat was awesome, but never a chore. Now, because we have 1:1 movement, we have to actually be good at controlling Link. My arms did get cramped at times, but I never could get myself to stop playing. If I had work the next day, I still played about 2-3 hours a night, easily. The motion controls did require some configuring every now and then, but, for the most part, controlling wasn't a hassle--much. It becomes an issue only when the sword isn't swinging at the right moment or intended angle, or, when you're flying, when your Loftwing starts flapping uncontrollably for no apparent reason.Continuing with the controls, I initially found them baffling, but they became more intuitive over time, second nature almost. The game itself is the same Zelda we've all come to know and, for the most part, love. The controls, though, make it a whole new game. As I mentioned before, controlling Link was never really an issue in past Zelda titles. Even with Twilight Princess, people thought that motion controls were to be simple and simplistic. Super Mario Galaxy and 2 pushed the Wii to new levels, but left out the MotionPlus peripheral. There are very few titles out there taking advantage of this gismo as its main interface, games such as Wii Sports Resort and Wii Play Plus, both of which were, in retrospect, teases of Skyward Sword. In this game Link finally follows your movements with the sword to a tee, but strikes in only 8 directions; this restriction, I think, is necessary, as it may be nearly impossible to swing 1:1. To vanquish your foes, you have to rethink your strategy. I've had more trouble with common baddies than the big baddies, the bosses. I've become accustomed to running up and swinging wildly, not expecting my enemies to block my attack. Now, the enemies have personality; they have feelings. So, instead of slashing away, I found myself stealthily running up to enemies from behind, which worked far better.If the aim was off, you can swiftly press the down button on the D-pad (where you'd normal call for Fi) and it automatically centers. The MotionPlus calibration is necessary only every once in a long while. In the beginning of the game, I used to calibrate quite frequently, until I realized I can just hit down while the Wii remote is also pointed at the center of the TV; it's a quick calibration that works solidly. Contrastingly, one thing I wished that was different about the buttons was A and B. I often confused the two.The dungeons in this game are relatively simple, but just way too long. There are too many rooms consuming the time it takes to complete dungeons. Thankfully, there aren't too many \"dungeons\" in the game. You'll do a lot of back-and-forth progress between Skyloft, but there's a good deal to do there that should keep you interested. Besides the stamina gauge--and, of course, the controls--upgrading gadgets is probably the best addition.I personally don't like the term \"fetch quest\" very much, but do admit that they are plentiful here. Something as simple as giving someone a map is turned into a chore, the task becoming unusually long. Nintendo was trying to fit too much into the game that a lot became cumbersome. With the state of things unnecessary, some of the gear given were pointless, used only for one or two dungeons. There really wasn't any artillery that could make you progress through the game, except for maybe the whip. But there were some good in that: the sub-par weaponry merely built the game up because more than ever I wanted the Master Sword, Hylian Shield, and bow.By the end of the game I found the final boss to be a disappointment. Then again, I had the Hylian Shield by that time, so I'm not sure how much of a challenge he would've proven otherwise. The final cinematic, though, was fantastic. It added a flavor many Zelda fans--including yours truly--have wished for (or at least pondered about) in a title.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002ZJNWWC","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Romano \"Avid Gamer\"","summary":"Medal of Honor is not in the Same League as the Call of Duty Series","reviewText":"This review is based on the Single Player Campaign. I really wanted to like this new Medal of Honor game. I heard so much about it. It was suppose to be one of best video games to come out this year. I preordered this game so I could play it on the first day it came out. Well guess what? After playing the Single Player Campaign, I can honestly say it is not as good as the Call of Duty Series.This game will definitely be coming down in price in the next few weeks. First of all, the graphics are just okay. I noticed right away the graphics are not as sharp and crisp as the Call of Duty graphics are. There is one mission where you play through an airplane graveyard like in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. You see planes lying around on the ground like in Call of Duty. I noticed right away the planes are not as detail inside or out as in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. In fact, I could tell right away that Medal of Honor is trying real hard to be almost like the Call of Duty Series.The story in the Single Player Campaign is heavily scripted. You don't have a lot of freedom to do whatever you want throughout the campaign. For instance, if I wanted to kick in a door to a building I want to enter, I can't do anything until my fellow teammates come up to the door. Then I'm allowed to kick in the door. Another time I was with a group of Army Rangers assaulting a machine gun nest in a Afghan village up in the mountains and I actually went by myself all the way up to the machine gun nest without my fellow Army Rangers teammates tagging along and threw a grenade into the nest and shot up the machine gunner with my weapon. Well guess what? Nothing happened. I went ahead of the script in the game. I was yelled and screamed at by my fellow Army Rangers to go all the way back to where they were hiding behind some stone walls and I was suppose to give them cover fire so they could assault the machine gun nest themselves. I kept wondering why couldn't I assault the machine gun nest on my own?In Medal of Honor, you are not allowed to make decisions on your own. I was in an Apache Helicopter assaulting some enemy mortar positions on a mountain side and I use a machine gun instead of a cannon on the Apache to take out the mortar positions. Well I kill the enemy mortar crews with the machine gun and I knocked out the mortar positions but the game would not advance unless I used the Apache cannon on the mortar positions. Why can't I make up my own decision on what weapon to use and how to complete the mission? Another mission I was on a cliff above some anti-aircraft guns. I wanted to use a sniper rifle to take out the enemy anti-aircraft crews and the game forces you to call in air strikes to take out the anti-aircraft guns. The game gives you no choice. Why can't we have the freedom to make our choices and decisions in the game? We are not babies that have to be held by the hand on how to play a game.At least with Call of Duty: Black Ops you have the freedom to pretty much do whatever you want. I can't wait until that game comes out on November 9, 2010. Call of Duty: Black Ops is already setting records before it even comes out has being one of the bestselling video games in gaming history. Medal of Honor had a chance to be right up there with Call of Duty: Black Ops and the game developer and game publisher for Medal of Honor blew it. What a shame.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-13-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00002DHEV","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better-suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$100 recommended retail price, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"Adrian Cooper \"That Guy from Venus. :D\"","summary":"Great for ALL AGES!!!!!!!","reviewText":"This system is one of the greatest home consoles EVER made!

I've played COD3, COD4 and COD5 (WAW) with my boys and *surprise* they aren't 18 yet...I'm not alone. Sure, these are \"Mature\" games intended for adults only...But if you think kids don't play violent video games, then you're fooling yourself and/or you have yet to become a parent.  In fact, they've LEARNED a great deal about history from the COD series, like why we had to defeat Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in WWII. As ugly as it is, it's a history lesson. They have asked me questions seemingly without end about WWI, WWII, the Korean War, Vietnam, The Gulf War and today's wars as a result of those COD games. In a way, I'm thankful for that. But this is not your \"normal\" Call of Duty game. It's morphed into something else.Now I understand WHY Infinity Ward (or Activision) wanted to just call this game MW2 and not associate it with the other COD titles. This game takes an UGLY TURN that is ABSOLUTELY INAPPROPRIATE for minors, perhaps even inappropriate for everyone. Apparently I'm the only one who didn't get the pre-release memo that \"The Moscow Airport Massacre\" was leaked a couple of weeks ago, probably by the publisher to guage public reaction. I was completely BLINDSIDED by this unnecessary inclusion of random and total CARNAGE of innocent (and unarmed) civilians...To be fair, there is an option to \"opt out\" of this GRUESOME scene when you first load the game...But you aren't told what the scene is. (It's a convoluted story at best and if you \"skip\" the airport scene, then you're REALLY going to wonder, \"what's going on here?!?\") Being a \"war\" video game, I mistakenly interpreted this warning to mean SOLDIERS would be dying in the awful ways that some soldiers die -- Slit throats, bayonet stabbings, shot between the eyes, limbs shot off, etc. And while most of us have seen the splatters of video blood as bad guys are gunned down, this one is a little different. This is simply HORRIFIC in a way that is hard to describe. I found it extremely OFFENSIVE, especially given the Ft Hood shootings just days ago. There are endless ways to create and tell a story, and this was the WRONG WAY!The scene comes up quickly (Day 2) and it's pretty much a bunch of bad guys with assault rifles strolling casually through an airport and mowing down a few hundred innocent civilians who scream and cry and look at their bloody hands and their dead loved ones while crawling around in their own pools of blood, then die...And YOU are forced to be a part of this \"Massacre Team\". WTH?!? While I understand the premise (which I would've missed if I'd skipped this), I don't think something this over-the-top violent directed at unarmed people was even needed here.  For example, Uncharted 2 had sufficiently bad guys without having to venture down this path.And unlike COD4's excellent storyline where you play the \"hero\" parts, this game was apparently designed by Darth Vader himself. You'll get to witness Wash DC (and historic landmarks) become a big burning pile of rubble. Most of the characters you play will be double-crossed after completing a mission and KILLED without warning. And by the final stage, you'll be forced to shoot large amounts of Russian and UNITED STATES ARMY Troops indiscriminately in order to complete the game...And you don't even get \"THE Bad Guy\", which is an obvious bridge to MW3. Clearly MW2's story relies heavily on SHOCK VALUE and COD has become a wholesale bloodfest with no redeeming value. Everyone's a target, just mindlessly point and shoot. I played COD4's Single Player Campaign over and over and LOVED it! After playing MW2 just once, I felt like I needed a shower and a shrink...As for gameplay, I don't play online and this is the shortest SP Campaign I've paid 60 bucks for. The graphics, sound, voice talent and weaponry are really top-notch...But we all kind of expected that. I really DON'T LIKE how the screen basically fills up with \"blood splatters\" as you take damage. These become more and more opaque and take up more and more of the screen to where it's really difficult to see anything. I don't think this was necessary.  If you're taking damage, you kind of need to be able to see from who as well as where you can maneuver away from it. It's already been proven over and over that damage can be sufficiently communicated to the player without resorting to tricks like covering the screen with blood. This was a disappointment for me...MW2 has some of the most INTENSE fighting you're going to find anywhere...And I mean shooting, reload, shooting, reload, throw a grenade, shooting, reload, shooting, etc.  So if you like that, you're going to get it IN SPADES with MW2!  But compare it to Uncharted 2 again (since it seems to be the new \"standard\" for PS3 games).  U2 had VARIETY...Yes, there was shooting, even a lot of shooting. But there were other things that broke up the monotony, like platforming, puzzle-solving, *dialogue*, a \"quest\" for treasure as the game's basis, etc.  MW2 is simply non-stop shooting and blowing stuff up, with an obscure plot thrown in as an afterthought...There are no history lessons in this COD title. This game teaches that it's OK to kill truckloads of US Army Soldiers, a logical (if alarming) progression from killing Liberty City Policemen and SWAT in GTA-IV. It uses the cheap trick of SHOCK VIDEO IMAGERY to cover up an incoherent and unbelievable story plot. It teaches that you can't trust your superiors in the military or they will double-cross and kill you. It butchers everything sacred to the American Psyche and makes you question, \"Have we really come this far since the innocent use of primitive video lasers to shoot an army of slowly-dropping aliens?\" and is it even healthy or desirable? If there were ever any boundaries to video gaming violence, there sure aren't any more...And to delude ourselves into believing there aren't societal implications as a result of this is just naive. It's truly a SAD DAY for our old friend Call of Duty...I think I just heard him say he needs a shower and a shrink.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-10-2009"}

I do not count L4D2 a DLC if I had known I was going to flush 60 bucks when I first bought this only to get slapped in the face I would have waited for part 2. Long story short this is not how any game company should release games. I did keep it because I love zombie games. I liked this game very much until Nothing came out for it. I would tell you to buy this because it is very different from the second one and it's fun to play. I would also go the used route and I have found this game as low as 899 in the used section of games. If you want gore this has plenty of it and it plays more like MW3 then other fps games of its kind. I still play once in a awhile.  Buy it if only to add to the collection of undead games. Way more fun with friends on Live. I loved that about it. You must stick together or you will die for sure. The AI in the game spawns randomly so stick together and stay away from witches they will really mess you up. They hate long walks on the beach and your face must look like a juicy burger because once you wake her she is going to kill all of you unless you have weapons and ammo on deck.

Frantz 2.0","summary":"WWE 13","reviewText":"Having been a fan of Wrestling games for sometime now I consider myself an \"expert\" at this genre of game. This game holds up well with previous recent WWE titles. The controls have changed since WWE 11, which is the last wrestling game I played. It took a while to get used to but once I did I enjoyed the control I had with my character.The \"Attitude Era\" story line is absolutely fabulous. Reliving history and recapturing that feeling that this Era had is just awesome. It brings back fond memories of when WWE was good, and exciting to watch. The only Gripe I have about this part of the game is the Censorship. Stone Colds gestures are heavily edited. As are the old \"WWF\" logos and title belts. They also went as far as editing former superstars names on a card with a Blur (I believe the name edited was Al Snow). Other than that this is one of the best, most challenging stories in a WWE game.Nothing seems to have changed in the Create modes. I wish there was an option to carry your creations from previous games. There are a ton of unlockables. mostly rings, belts and attire. There are a few wrestlers that can be unlocked but most are duplicates of certain Superstars.Anyhow, good game. I do enjoy it even though I am not a fan of the current WWE product. Not quite as good asWWF: No MercyorWWE Smackdown vs Raw 2006but not a bad game either.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-17-2012"}

The gameplay is awesome with some very cool options, the entrance's are great and the finishers are well done.  I always have super fun playign this game.  The only negatives I found were not being able to turn off the horrid music at the start screen or when setting up a match, save the glimmer of Motorhead it all sucks, I end up mutting the TV.  If you turn it off it turns of the entrance music which is dumb, in SVR2008 you could turn off crap tween music and still have entrance music turned on.  The only other issue I found was even with reversals turned off the AI is insanly hard, unless you learn to reverse every move perfectly you are literally screwed.  Over all though the game is great and I love the accelerator feature on Xbox live that unlocks everything, you can have all the fun and customization you want right out of the box without having to play through long annoying story lines and nazi AI to unlock stuff.

After a week of mashing my mouse buttons, I feel D3 will very likely have the same effect on me.That said, this is exactly what makes this game so special. There are many other games that hold my attention in a different fashion. I don't expect this to be an expansive universe like WoW, rather I see this as a game that will allow me to click more and think less (and this is coming from someone who considers himself a thinker). For that reason, D3 fills that void perfectly.The beauty about the Diablo series is that it allows almost anyone at any skill level to start playing immediately. At the same time, it does a great job of keeping gamers interested, at least for short sessions of click bursts. And for those of us who want to make it really challenging, the hard core option is still there (if you die, you die).Do I love everything about the game? No. But I don't have to love every part of the game for it to meet my expectations and have a great time. D3 won't likely win game of the year but I like that it kept the old formula of success and added a layer of freshness to the popular series.If you're a Diablo veteran, I don't think you'd be disappointed. Everything you loved about the other two are back. If you're new to Diablo, as long as you know what type of game it is and you keep your expectations to what the game is supposed to be, you will thoroughly enjoy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-23-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000WQWPOQ","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"A blast to play, but not enough play testing beforehand","reviewText":"In line of the new superhero boom, Prototype and Infamous has graced us with there presence, and the nightmarish days of Superman Returns and Superman64 are all but forgotten. Alex Mercer, a seemingly normal science nerd, awakens on a mortuary slab to suddenly find himself hunted by GENTEK scientists and a special forces paramilitary organization, trying to piece together his life and memories for those he consumes.Visuals in this hold up greatly, and the feel of Manhattan, though they were prohibited from using some of the facades is so real its almost visceral. Building heights and skyscapes are well detailed and accentuated even from the highest points, and gliding down doesn't produce more than the most forgivable lag in visual detail. The only problem is seeming to becoming almost endemic: TYPEFACING.You notice how these black letters contrast rather well with the stark white background. Eevn wehn I pourspely mipsslel eevry wrod in a sneetcne you can udnretsnad waht I'm syanig. Thats because you can actually read them (And because of an interesting brain chemistry quirk in which, at least with jolly 'ol English, you only need to have the first and last letters in the right positions, but I digress). Having a blood red scrolling text against a midnight black background is a one way road to what did that say? Even though this game has the magical ability to reread a page of scrolling text, in itself a miracle, its almost as illegible the second time. I'm not sure if all of these recent games with a few rare exceptions are being playtested on $5500 Plasma-hi-def-laser-inscribed-holo-uh...nano-based? televisions, but the uproar over Dead Space should have gotten the message across that you need to be able to read text to enjoy it, and read it on a gamer salary television.Audio, as should be expected, is top notch. While the main character has the expected problem of having smoked since kindergarten, and never speaking with anything other than a near-emo vengeful hiss, the characters fill their roles well. Memories that you consume are told from a first-person, in-voice style, and radio intercepts vary from more than three messages, and are done with multiple voices.Gameplay is where the game hits its finest points and its most groaning misses. The game is fantastically fun. Pounding tanks into scrap, carving enemies up like turkeys being filleted with chainsaws, ripping industrial air conditioners out of roofs at throwing them at apaches never loses its charm. The side missions are your basic cookie cutter, but there well put together and intelligently thought out so that, even from the first try, they're actually games of skill and intelligent upgrading rather than nonsensical trial/error chores. The web of intrigue, which is essentially your logbook and movie storehouse, while a bit of a strange design, helps flesh out the story nicely, and the links between the various parties become apparent even early on and mesh together well. Best of all, you're not spoon fed any of story, and have to fight for just about every scrap, at least to start.Powers are varied and have their own uses, and though the fall into the standard templates, are creative and have varied uses.But there are too many points where the game stumbles and falls flat. Running fast creates pothole like craters behind you, which you'd think would be the proverbial trail of breadcrumbs that the delta force would use to follow you and place a 50 cal round in your head. Jumping from a high rooftop will create a concentric explosion that blasts cars around and creates a general panic, while having your flesh ripple and gurgle like a lava lamp as you turn into someone else garners nary a raised eyebrow by crowds of passersby. Commanders seen by dozens of men grabbed, consumed, and then flown away with are welcomed by the same soldiers that were trying to fill the obvious clone with lead not ten seconds prior. \"Evading\" the military consists of running around a building corner. And the difficulty is like a wild roller coaster. Monsters encountered in the first real story mission can tear you to pieces within a few heartbeats, regardless of approach. Healing becomes a problem quickly, as you can consume enemies while being pummeled from behind. The standard button configuration make combat on the fly difficult(left stick to move, left d-pad to change powers), as you can't move while activating or deactivating a power without an extra knuckle on your thumb.But, as most of you are probably thinking, these are nits. And while some of you probably pound the desk and either agree wholeheartedly or think I need to find something better to whine about, these are the only nits. A few control issues are present, but not enough to bear mention, though the lack of a ledge grab ability is a bit curious. The game overall, is fantastic, entertaining, and actually playable on a higher difficulty setting without sending normal players into fits, though some of the 360 achievements are laughable pipe dreams. But all told, this, like Infamous, is worth full market price, as it'll encourage more of the same.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2009"}

At its core, Diablo is a game about loot and finding better loot. This time around, they have updated some things that may enhance your experience, or possibly hinder it. Firstly, every class has two genders. Simple change, but a nice bit of polish. Skills are learned automatically as you level up, which may keep you from getting overpowered early on or even getting overwhelmed with choices. Blacksmithing can create just about any elite weapon or armor you want, though I will admit that some of the creations don't look as good as the rare loot you can find.The story can be ignored. It's not horrible by any means, but some parts feel forced and you may find yourself struggling to care about events and characters.

Now we're 6 years ahead and Uncharted is one of the most respected and well like series in gaming history. Uncharted 3 is a solid roller coaster ride of action, suspense, and excellent voice acting that will really keep you sucked in.After the events of Uncharted 2 Drake and Sully find themselves in a fight at a bar with a strange woman wanting Drake's ring. What this ring does and how they get themselves into more trouble will be left for you to find out. The story gives us some history on how the two met as well as being the most dangerous treasure hunt Drake has been on. These guys seriously want blood and they are more viscous and violent than any of Drake's other adversaries.The story isn't anything to balk at because there are some extremely harrowing scripted events, and the characters are just perfect and you get attached to them even more because Naughty Dog brought out a new level for each character (especially Drake) for this big finale.The game is mostly the same combat wise with cover, lots of guns, and explosions. There is a great variety of guns that we love in the series as well as  a few new ones, but combat still has a few issues like snapping into cover doesn't always work, and the game is extremely hard with way too many enemies like in the previous games so this has never been addressed. You will die dozens of times during certain scenes and I really wish they would have fixed this and made it more reasonable and not so difficult. The stealth sections are still poorly designed because you have no idea where to go and there are too many enemies to sneak past or take out silently. One area will be choked up with enemies and if you kill one the next will see you because he's just a few feet away.Despite the combat being the same, the hand to hand is improved and is a blast to use thanks to great animations and quick counters to knock these guys flat.  The platforming and climbing is the same and that's a really good thing. Cleverly laid out levels are really fun to explore because you never really get lost. But what is special about Uncharted are the unique puzzles that span entire levels and are even bigger in this game. They are a little easier to figure out only in the sense that the clues you get can actually be used like they should unlike in the last game where the puzzles were almost impossible to figure out. Each puzzle is completely different from the last, but there aren't as many as in previous games because this one is cut scene heavy, and there is a better balance of shooting, puzzle solving, adventuring, and cut scenes, so the overall flow is more natural.Of course the best part about Uncharted are the scripted scenes and these go way over the top with horseback riding, combat in the air while trying to get into a plane, a battle on a sinking ship, and just a whole bunch more that make the game feel like a blockbuster movie. This was my favorite part of the whole game because it just sucked you into the experience like most games can't do, and I really felt the situations and the danger Drake was in thanks to clever camera work. The visuals are probably the best the PS3 has seen (better than Killzone 3, Resistance 3, and I daresay maybe better than God of War III). The huge open landscapes are just riddled with ridiculous detail that I didn't think the PS3 could even do. Beautiful lighting, high-resolution textures, and the animations are so detailed with Drake tripping over himself, putting his hands on stair rails, so this makes the entire game feel organic and fluid.Uncharted 3's multiplayer is also a blast with unlockable characters, guns, and other goodies to keep you playing. I really like the multiplayer and the style works great, but of course it's nothing to break grounds for online shooters. Co-op single player is a welcome blast, so the whole multiplayer suite involved helps sweeten the already great package. Uncharted will be remembered by myself and most gamers who appreciate and excellent game. The third entry is the perfect ending to an amazing trilogy.Collector's Edition: If you want to spend the extra $40 then you will be treated with everything coming in a beautiful chest (its heavy cardboard unfortunately), as well as a replica of the ring, a belt buckle, and a 6' figure of Drake, plus a special packaging for the game case. The whole collection is beautiful and very well designed, but this is for collectors strictly and people who aren't really hardcore fans of the series should probably pass this up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-28-2012"}

I have over 2000 hours and 8 characters in Demon Souls....So when i heard Dark Souls was coming out i patiently waited for the Killer experience.\"BUBBLE BURSTING\"Yes...thats what happened when i got Dark Souls.  My hopes were all for nothing.  First of all i dont understand why companies choose to kill something that was working fine in the first place.Here are the TOP 3 KILLERS in this game:1). Co-Op/Multiplayer online experience2). Gameplay3). Rewarding systemHere how the developers \"GANKED\" us, the players.They shafted \"Atlus\" and went with \"NAMCO-BANDAI which was a bad move.They went \"Multi-Platform\"...even thoough i like the XBOX i also have the PS3 and i think they should have kept it an exclusive for PS3.  So by making this game multi-platform they had to use a \"Multi-Server\" System, which is broken, to accomadate the INVADING and Co-Op play which made \"Demon Souls\" a CLASSIC HIT.....The Gameplay SUCKS.....the characters move as if they have cement boots on.  They chaged the movesets for weapons which now it feels clunky.  Worthy Items dropped are FAR and FEW between.  AFter you kill a BOSS you DONT get the BOSSES SOUL like in Demon Souls.  They upped the DIFFICULTY level which is fine with me BUT they should have upped the rewarding system as well.This has got to be the BIGGEST \"BUST\" of a game in recent history...\"Alla EA Sports taking over NFL Football\".Needless to say i traded this game in for SKYRIM......++UPDATE++When i saw the price drop to 20$ i said lets try again.  So i have been playing Dark souls for the past 2 months.  I was surprised how much the mechanics has changed although it still has a FEW of the CHEAP deaths you will encounter like getting killed by an enemies sword while hiding behind a BRICK WALL but thats ok cause i can kill them using the same CHEAP trick...LoLim level 130 NG+++ and i must admitt im liking this game.  what i have learned is not let this game frustrate you.  I know, i hate dying all the time too.  But you get a chance to go through that level again and double the souls that you lost, if you are lucky enough to get back to your blood stain.  LoL.  I use a lot of the same cheap tricks on the enemies.  Example, if you use the FOG ring you can sneak up to most enemies before they even see you.  If your Toon is properly leveled you can get a BOW, stand at a distance with FOG ring and kill at will.  I used this trick once to kill the boss MANUS but i mostly like going head-to-head combat over cheap tricks.  So if anyone is not certain about this game give it a chance and use patience and tactics and also use the environment to your advantage.  You will die LESS.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2011"}

We've always enjoyed the sports type games that let us all interact together without just sitting on the couch like dormant zombies. Here is a brief review of all the games:Bowling: Probably the most disappointing because of the ease of the game. My 20 year old, the first time playing, bowled 11 strikes in a row. It just isn't that challenging. They need to have some physics on the ball I think and let you choose the weight of the ball and have that affect the strength of the throw or something. Every ball you can blaze down the lane with the same motion and throw a strike. Too bad, we enjoy bowling.Skiing: This one is really fun. Keep low and make sure your jumps don't get away from you.Tennis: Surprisingly fun.Golf: One of my favorites. Slow paced game, accuracy matters.Boxing: For a head to head combat, I enjoy this one better than the Gladiator combat from the first one. Still trying to figure out how all the moves work on it but it is fun to beat up your opponent.Archery: They say updated but I haven't played this much to see much difference. Different competitions but it is still the same game. Nock and arrow, draw, aim, shoot.I love my 3D TV. It does a wonderful job of 3D. We tried bowling once with 3D though and it just wasn't right. I did not mess with the 3D depth option since we were just trying to have a good time without me messing around too much but the pins at the end of the lanes were a bit blurry. I need to try some of the other games with 3D and adjusting the 3D depth of the game. I was really hoping that this would add an extra...wait for it...dimension to the game!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-07-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0001ADAMO","description":"Drawing inspiration from Sergio Leone's classic spaghetti westerns and Clint Eastwood's hard-boiled, serape-clad performances, Red Dead Revolver stands tall with a conceptual basis that the video game industry has not vested a lot of interest in, yet many have yearned for. There are few things sweeter in this world than getting the opportunity to step into the boots of the pale rider and the quickest gun in the west. This is essentially what Red Dead Revolver offers.All of the staples that we've come to recognize from films of this ilk (even the horse operas) are included in some fashion. You'll ride horseback and leap onto a runaway train, exchange fisticuffs in a bar brawl, and stare death in the eye in a high noon showdown. Thematically, developer Rockstar San Diego has hit the nail right on the head. You really do feel like the toughest cowboy to ever step foot in the west. Grainy graphical filters and era-specific camera effects are also used to make the cutscenes feel like the films that this game pays tribute to. Continuing its streak of wowing gamers with brilliant soundtracks that perfectly accompany the atmosphere of the game, Rockstar has decked this game out with an incredible selection of songs reminiscent of spaghetti western master Ennio Morricone.While it sounds like the perfect game up until this point, Red Dead Revolver has a hobble in its strut when it comes to the delivery of gameplay. Granted, you will find yourself smiling wryly at the outrageous missions and scenarios that you'll get yourself into, but you never really feel like you have your feet firmly under you. Each mission comes and goes at such a rapid pace that I will go out on a limb and say that the game doesn't necessarily have levels, but moreover pockets of intense action. In this regard, it's all about the big moment and payoff. Exploration is limited and the environments are usually fairly small. The same goes for the delivery of playable characters. You'll spend most of your time as Red, but will control five other characters throughout your quest. Each one has a different attack and Bullet Time-esque special move. Again, however, you play as this character for 30 seconds to a minute, then move on. I just never really felt a connection with the characters or their surroundings.As you would expect, the majority of gameplay is dedicated to running around and blowing vermin to kingdom come. The execution of this is commendable, and is very much in line with the Max Paynes of the world. Although just split-screen, multiplayer is surprisingly addictive and loaded to the hilt with extras that players can unlock throughout the game with cash earned along the way.I really enjoyed the time I spent with this title, yet walked away wishing that it had a little bit more meat on its bones. If you find satisfaction in mindless action games in the tradition of Max Payne, you'll surely get your fill with Red Dead Revolver.The EdgeThe Xbox version puts a bullet right between the eyes of the PlayStation 2. Not only does it run at 60Hz (twice the framerate of the PS2), it features 480p widescreen, twice the sound memory (on the PS2 you'll hear up to three ricochet sounds, whereas on Xbox you'll hear upwards of six to nine), and double the texture resolution. With hard drive caching the game loads twice as fast, as well. As if the technical edge wasn't enough of a reason to invest in the Xbox version, it's also Live Aware, and comes packaged with an exclusive multiplayer level (the Coliseum). Without the slightest hint of doubt, the Xbox version gets The Edge.Concept:Clean up the west as a merciless cowboy in this heavily influenced spaghetti western gameGraphics:The character models are not the most detailed, but the environments look nice and I love the cameraworkSound:A remarkable soundtrack lures players into the vibe of the westPlayability:Unnaturally short levels and satisfactory run and gun actionEntertainment:The stages should have been longer, but replay is abundant in the number of unlockables and enjoyable multiplayerReplay:ModerateRated:8 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:June 20042nd Opinion:Buck up, cowpokes. All y'all cowboys that been hankerin' for a good ole fashioned western, you best get ready to draw. Red Dead Revolver is without a doubt one of the finest titles to tap the often barren landscape of old west games. With a straight flush of soaring production values, the game offers a completely immersive gallop through the sights and sounds of an old cowboy flick. Chapters are short and fast paced, with a remarkable variety of challenges. Anything you've ever seen in a western movie you'll see here, from the duel at high noon to the high speed train robbery to the sleazy saloon girls. You are constantly unlocking new game features, which helps to drive the action forward. Combat is definitely more stylistic than it is technically perfect. The gun targeting system is generally well implemented, but frustrating at times &#8211; particularly with fast moving opponents. But if the old west strikes your fancy, I reckon you'd be a coot not to pony up the cash and take a shot at Red Dead Revolver.Rated:8.5 out of 10Editor:Matt MillerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"BRIAN","summary":"ROCKSTAR HAS DONE IT FIRST  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","reviewText":"RED DEAD IS AS GOOG AS IT CAN GET IN THE OLD WEST.IM VERY GLAD AT THE M RATING AS WELL THIS GAME ISNT FOR CHILDREN ITS FOR ADULTS TO HAVE FUN .THE GRAPHICS ARE AS GOOD AS THEY SHOULD BE FOR THE TIME ERA OF THE GAME .THE SOUND IS FANTASTIC OVE OF THE BEST FEATURES ALONG WITH THE STORYMODE WHITCH IS GREAT THERE ISNT ANY NEGATIVE POINTS TO MY OPINON OF THIS GAME ITS DEFENITELY A BUY NOT A RENT A BUY SO REMEMBER TO PUT THIS ONE ON YOUR XMAS LIST TRUST ME .","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-09-2004"}
{"product_name":"B0007TFLLC","description":"The era of no-compromises handheld gaming has arrived. Get ready for immersive, 3D gaming on a console that is poisedto change the way we think about portable devices. With wireless internet, video and digital music playback, and incredible data storage and connectivity options, the Sony PSP--or PlayStation Portable--is a complete solution for the mobile digital lifestyle. Sony has hit the mark by combining both horsepower and groundbreaking features into a package that weighs just a hair more than half a pound.DesignThe PSP's exceptional performance comes from a 333 MHz processor that dwarfs the speed of competing handheld consoles. Add this polygon-pushing muscle to 4 MB of fast DRAM and 32 MB of embedded RAM, and you've got a device with graphics rendering capabilities close to that of the PlayStation2. And because no game is complete without audio, the PSP is generously appointed with built-in stereo speakers, as well Dolby Digital 7.1 surround sound capability. Sony has also pulled out all the stops with the PSP display. The bright, 4.3-inch LCD sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution--plenty of real estate for heavy gaming action and widescreen-format movies. All of this is powered by a removable, and rechargeable, lithium-ion battery.Screen machine: The 4.3-inch display sports a 16:9 aspect ratio and 480 x 272 pixel resolution. Movies and games on the go have never been more gorgeous.From a controls perspective, the PSP is made for gaming. If you're familiar with a PlayStation controller, you'll be a pro at the PSP's controls in no time. Directional buttons, as well as an analog stick are provided. Meanwhile, the familiar left and right shoulder buttons, as well as triangle, circle, cross and square buttons are integrated into the device's slim case. Finally, home, select, and start buttons give you quick access and control over the PSP's important functions.To have and to hold: The PSP's easy-to-master controls are cleverly integrated into the device's slim profile.Supported MediaAt the heart of the PSP is a new, proprietary media format known as the Universal Media Disc, or UMD. Each UMD can hold 1.8 GB of data, enough room for rich and complex games. UMDs, which are housed in a protective cover, slide into the rear of the PSP. Sony has declared the UMD an open format for developers and media content owners, so movies, music and other media are on the horizon from third parties. Sony has also signed on many popular game developers for the platform, so a deep library of titles is on tap.While the UMD is great for read-only media such as games and movies, Sony solves the problem of data storage with the addition of a Memory Stick Duo slot. With Memory Stick Duo media, you can store your saved games, downloaded online content, personal video and audio files, and more. When you want access to these files from your PC, simply use the PSP's USB 2.0 port to turn the device into a fast portable media drive. Then, drag and drop files such as your photos, MP3s, and videos onto the PSP, just as you would any other removable storage device. The PSP ships with a 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, and additional media with higher storage capacities are available.Major media: Sony's PSP-compatible Universal Media Disc (UMD) can hold 1.8 GB of data.ConnectivityThe PSP blows away the competition in the connectivity department. Indeed, the PSP's ability to connect to the internet, and to other PSPs and USB-based peripherals, is a real advantage. At the top of the list is Wifi connectivity, or IEEE 801.11b. Use this wireless internet standard to connect to other gamers around the world for hot multiplayer action--all from your couch, or your local Wifi hotspot. As mentioned, the PSP's USB 2.0 port is great for PC connectivity, but it also opens the PSP up for a whole range of future peripherals. Sony has plans for the PSP in other ways, too; the unit's infrared port speaks of remote control capabilities in the near future.A Digital CompanionIf you haven't already guessed, Sony has positioned the PSP to be much more than a gaming device. Out of the box, the device is ready to serve as a portable video player and photo viewer. By using the new H.264 MPEG-4 video standard, Sony obviously has its eyes on making the PSP a robust video device with support for feature length movies and more. In addition, the PSP offers a great way to transport and share your photos in JPEG format. And let's not forget the music. Load up your favorite MP3-encoded songs onto a Memory Stick Duo and you've got a portable audio powerhouse. The device also supports Sony's ATRAC audio codec, so you can play songs acquired from Sony's Connect Online Music Store. Sony even ships a nifty pair of earbuds--complete with an inline remote control-- with the PSP.What's in the BoxPSP device, AC adapter, battery pack, 32 MB Memory Stick Duo, earbud headphones with remote control, soft case and hand strap.","reviewerName":"Mode7","summary":"Why rate a product in only weeks after launch?","reviewText":"Every console would fail if we rated it solely on the merits of its software library/functionality at launch.

{"product_name":"B000AB603U","description":"It's the dawn of a new age in real-time strategy (RTS) games. A brave New World is rising--a hostile yet beautiful world, filled with innovative gameplay, new strategic scenarios, eye-searing graphics and much more. Welcome to a world calledAge of Empires III.CampaignIn this action adventure tale of historical fiction, players take on the role of Morgan Black and his family, struggling against the hostile wilderness and a mysterious cult that's crept in from Europe.In a series of 24 scenarios divided into three acts, Morgan Black and his descendants help the Aztecs resist conquest by Spanish conquistadors, pit the French against the British in the French and Indian War and help Simon Bolivar lead revolutions in South America.MultiplayerWhether you're searching for a quick game or hoping to talk strategy with friends online,Age of Empires III's Multiplayer site is your community destination.Here, you can play with persistent Home Cities that gain power and strategic options the more games you play, compete for a spot on dozens of ladders, help organize your clan or chat after a game -- all without leaving the multiplayer portal.Fans ofAge of Mythology's Quick Search can still look for games swiftly, while players looking for something specific can browse game lists to find the set of options that matches their tastes.New Feature--Home CitiesThis revolutionary new feature to the RTS landscape is incorporated into all aspects ofAge of Empires III-- from Campaign to Multiplayer -- and is unlike anything you've experienced before.Much like the persistent character from a role-playing game that encourages you to keep playing, your Home City is an important support system to your efforts in the New World. During a game, your Home City can regularly send you supplies or military reinforcements.You are the leader of your colony, but your success brings glory back to Mother Europe. The more games you play, and the better you do, the more powerful your Home City will become. Every few games, you gain the ability to both upgrade and customize your Home City:Upgrade your city by unlocking new types of soldiers or buildings, or improving those you already have.Broaden your tech tree in whatever direction most fits your play style--invest in warships, native alliances, cavalry, artillery or economy.Customize your Home City by changing the appearance of buildings, the weather or even the types of people who walk, work and perform in its streets.Throughout a game, as well as in between games, you can visit your Home City to watch its citizens go about their lives, get an opinion on how you're doing, plot your next move or just marvel at the beautiful sunset.Full 3-D Graphics, Destructible Environments and MoreWe first set out to reproduce the rich detail ofAge of Empires II: Age of Kings. As we strove to make the fascinatingAge of Empires IIItime period come alive, that goal quickly evolved: We at Ensemble Studios wanted to create the best-looking game ever. From the stunning water effects to the hundreds of units battling on-screen, you'll feel like you're a part of the action in the New World.Tone mapping--This photo imaging technique balances the colors in a scene on the fly. The end result is a rich, warm game where bright colors are vibrantly rendered alongside darker counterparts, such as shadows.Lighting and shadows--The sun is always shining inAge of Empires, so it's important that lighting and shadows be an awe-inspiring experience. Units and buildings cast shadows according to a real sun position, and even cast shadows on each other. High Dynamic Range rendering allows us to represent the shiny glints of sunlight that bounce off highly reflective surfaces.Bump and specular mapping--Water glistens like water. Metal shines like metal. These advanced techniques serve to provide an extra level of rendering detail heretofore unseen in real-time strategy (RTS) gaming.Water--We felt that portraying stunning, realistic water effects in the game was so important that we devoted a programmer to it full-time. You'll find the water rich with details like foam near the shore, accurately modeled water motion, flotsam in rivers and realistic water colors. Plus, reflections change with the viewing angle, the angle of sunlight and the motion of the water. The overall effect is breathtaking.Cliffs and Riverbeds--Instead of just stretching terrain, we built a system to attach geometry to the terrain map to allow for realistic overhangs and steep cliffs, from areas like the American Southwest. This effect is supported on random maps too.CivilizationsBritishQuick access to Settlers gives the British one of the strongest economies in the game. The ability to upgrade two key units -- the Musketeer and Hussar -- make the British military formidable in the late game. The British Home City emphasizes improvements to technology and naval warfare.DutchAlthough Dutch Settlers are limited and costly, their civilization makes up for this economic disadvantage by building Banks and generating coin automatically. The Dutch Home City emphasizes upgrades to defense and economy.FrenchAlthough the French economy starts slowly, the Coureur unit, a Villager with strong fighting skills, makes the French difficult to attack early. The French also have the strongest cavalry unit in the game -- the Cuirassier. Plus, the French are experts at allying with the Native Americans.GermanThe Germans have fewer Settlers and therefore a slower economy. Fortunately, both the Settler Wagon and Uhlan cavalry spawn for free from the German Town Center. Plus, the Germans start with the ability to send Mercenaries from their Home City (long before other civilizations can).Native AmericanEuropean civilizations can learn new technologies and gain troops by forging alliances with the Native Americans. A British player who allies with the Iroquois is essentially playing as two civilizations: the British and the Iroquois.OttomanFor the Ottomans, Settlers spawn automatically from the Town Center. Building a Mosque and conducting research help keep that Settler production steady. Befitting their position straddling Europe and Asia, the Ottomans have more unique units than any other civilization.PortugueseStarting the game with two Town Centers, the Portuguese can quickly produce Settlers, control territory or support their allies. The Spyglass ability allows the Portuguese to easily spy on the enemy. The Portuguese also have a strong navy, strong light infantry and the best Dragoons in the game.RussianStarting the game with extra resources but fewer Settlers gives the Russians the flexibility of focusing on economy or an early raid. Russian infantry, individually weak, are trained in blocks at a faster rate, providing the Russians with the opportunity to overwhelm their enemy with greater numbers.SpanishThe Spanish have a strong military, with both hand infantry and cavalry. Flexibility in early shipments from the Home City give the Spanish the option to attack early or set up for a strong, late economy. Spanish Home City improvements benefit soldiers, buildings and naval units.&nbsp;CombatAge of Empires IIIgives players an amazing amount of control over their side of the battlefield.More to command -- Not only are you in command of large and diverse armies of infantry, cavalry and artillery, but also Native American warriors, mercenaries and tall ships.Multiple formations -- You can assign different formations to your army for different strengths and weaknesses, or have the game automatically choose the most appropriate formation. Examples include:Volley -- ranged infantry, like musketeers, take turns firing at enemies ahead of them.Charge -- your soldiers walk, then run into combat. Cavalry wield sabers, and musketeers fix bayonets. This formation does tremendous damage but makes your soldiers more prone to injury.Bombard -- your soldiers protect the cannons, while the cannons shell enemy ranks. Available only when you have artillery in your army.Battles are easier to follow -- You can still command individual units. But when the units fight in formation, you'll be able to tell exactly who is winning the fight.Real-time physics -- Infantry struck by cannon fire will be thrown like rag dolls, perhaps even over a cliff and into the water. Cannonballs bounce and ricochet.Detailed destructions -- Shingles, shutters and whole towers may fly off a building and interact with the terrain, such as crashing into nearby water. This next generation effect is done on the fly so that each building always has a unique destruction, no matter how many times you see it.Unique animations -- With hundreds of unique combat animations, you'll never see the same battle twice.","reviewerName":"JD","summary":"A successful installment in the Age of Empires Saga","reviewText":"When I sat down with Age of Empires 3 I was hoping for a little more - something new and refreshingly different (ala the Lord of the Rings RTS for example).  There is a new feature, the Home City.  The rest of Age of Empires 3 is the same as the previous games at heart, with some new makeup and some new units.  Don't get me wrong, this new Age of Empires installment is fun and just as addictive as its predecessors, but also feels tired at the same time.  If you still enjoy the previous Age of Empires games, you will likely enjoy this one equally.It has been some time since I played the previous Age of Empires 2 but I remembered a simple, relatively clean interface.  In Age of Empires 3 I was a little taken aback by the clutter of information, and juggling Home City shipments (and Deck Building) with what was happening on screen requires a lot of micro-management.This new installment has some great civilizations and in this regard, the units are new and refreshing.  In an Age of exploration and the shift from archeic weapons to gunpowder, you have a variety of new units, and a few units that are unique to each civilization to help set them apart.  In addition each civilization has its own unique advantages (and disadvantages) that set it apart from the rest.  This is primarily done via a new feature:  the Home City and the shipments you are allowed to send from it.  I liked the idea of the Home City, but wasn't overly impressed with some aspects of its implementation.The new units are fun and consist of both modern (for the period) and archeic units giving you some flexibility in what you want to field - however don't expect their power to be equal.  The cannon physics are really well done, you can track cannon balls throughout their flight and watch the havoc they bestow upon enemy buildings (which now fall apart in peices instead of as a whole) or the holes they punch in rows of infantry.  The charachter animations on most units are really well done, and occasionally you will see them adjust their weapons for long range of short range combat (they throw burning items at enemy buildings instead of firing their highly ineffective muskets).  I beleive that musketeers can also fix bayonets to make them more effective at close range, although I didn't notice a signifigant difference, mine continued to fire their muskets regardless of the range of the enemy.There is another new feature in Age of Empires 3 in the form of an Explorer.  He is a powerful unit you can use to explore the map (although any unit can still do his job).  The Explorer can take damage, and fall in battle, but doesn't die.  He can be rescued and revived.  The Explorer has the special ability to deal with treasure guardians in one shot, but a hardy group of soldiers can also take down the treasure guardians without too much difficulty.  The Explorer can retreive treasure found on the map and can also build Trading Posts (settlers can build them as well) - this is how you interact with the Native Americans.  Building a Trading Post near a Native American outpost forges an alliance with them and you are then allowed to train Native American warriors which are useful because they don't count against your population limit - but they do have a population limit of their own (15 seems to be the norm).  In a bizarre twist, the Native Americans are not hostile to these new invaders unless they are allied with one of your enemy players - intersting.In summation, I did enjoy trying out Age of Empires 3.  My initial impression was that the civilizations and corrosponding diversity in units and Home City shipments helped add some variety to the Age of Empires format, but also meant more added juggling.  Even with the new ability to zoom in and out a little, I still found it difficult at times to juggle my units.  In combat, my nicely organized ranks merged into one wave of units that were impossible to divide up and thus made tactics difficult.  You can assign numbers (via Ctl+#) to a group of units to help this, but I didn't find anyway to assign formations to the units (you could do this in Age of Empires 2).  When left idle long enough - seeemed to take a long time - my units did auto-arrange themselves into formation, but didn't maintain that formation during attacks.  I wish they would have borrowed a little from another RTS game that allows you to train units in groups that are then treated as one unit.  This would have made Cavalry and Infantry units that much easier to manage, especially in large numbers.  In addition, in that same RTS game you can assign different unit types to merge together and form a new formation of units that is again treated as one unit.  This greatly simplifies training units and then moving them about the map and maintaining formations for attacks.I do look forward to spending a lot more time with Age of Empires 3 as I'm sure there is a lot that I haven't noted in my initial observations.  I think the game is true to its heritage and I think that Age of Empires fans will flock to this new installment.  However, I don't think that Age of Empires 3 delivers enough new variety in either design or implementation to steal away the fans of other RTS games that are working to reinvent and revitalize the genre.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2005"}

{"product_name":"B00003E4EB","description":"Nintendo first dabbled in video games during the industry's early years of the mid-'70s. Generations of successful gaming console releases through the years led to the much-hyped 1996 launch of Nintendo 64, a system that represented a giant evolutionary leap in video game technology. Within the first three days of launch, hundreds of thousands of gamers hunkered down withMario 64, considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever created. Even today, the system's excellent design continues to host an ever-expanding library of breakthrough games.Nintendo 64's popularity among younger gamers is no surprise. Well-respected games featuring such long-lived and much-loved personalities as Mario (of arcade classicDonkey Kongfame), Zelda, andBanjo-Kazooieare easy to learn and offer enormous replay value. But times are a' changin' and the system's ever-growing library of titles has expanded into every genre of games imaginable, including games better suited for older gamers. In fact, some of the most acclaimed--in some cases, groundbreaking--games available on any platform today are packed onto N64's old-school cartridges.Under the system's hood, its appeal to the young certainly didn't produce a less mature gaming machine. On the contrary, the 64-bit system boasts impressive graphics, stereo sound, and numerous accessory enhancements, including a high-resolution pack that boosts graphics to awe-inspiring resolutions.Start your library withGoldeneye 007,Mario 64,Banjo-Kazooie,Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time, andStar Wars: Episode One Racer--these titles represent a decent start to any N64 cartridge library.With the recent launch of Sega's Dreamcast system, Nintendo 64 is being left behind as the leader in video game technology. And with newer game systems featuring CD-based games, the system's expensive cartridge format is proving itself an archaic and unconventional storage format. But, at a sub-$110 recommended retail price for a console with two controllers, innovative accessory enhancements and a great library of games keep the system's rabid fan base satisfied, if not eager for Nintendo's next evolutionary step.--Eric Twelker","reviewerName":"xboxfan2001","summary":"Nintendo 64: One of the Best Systems Ever Made, Now Discontinued","reviewText":"The Nintendo 64 had a small, yet a great library of games, including the best-selling The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time.This console had the best-looking kiosk in retail stores.But when the Gamecube came out in 2001, that, unfortunately, marked the end of the Nintendo 64. Nintendo published very few games for this system after the Gamecube came out.The last game that was published for this system was Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3, which, if you're lucky, you can still find that game new today at retailers.I hate it when video game companies discontinue consoles because they released a new one. Look at computer manufacturers like Dell. Sure they make new computers, but you can still buy older models from them (not too old like a 486 computer, though... =D).  Unfortunately, video game companies, even today, have failed to recognize this.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2005"}
{"product_name":"B000088KH9","description":"Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis the third in the successful mission-based stealth series that first appeared on the PlayStation in 1998; few changes have been made to the basic format. Players can once again choose to be either Rikimaru, the silent sword-wielding assassin, or Ayama, the acrobatic younger ninja. Both characters pass through the same game world, but each has slightly different goals that take them on different routes. A third character can be unlocked later on.During the first mission, you're required to choose a number of weapons to aid you in your immediate tasks. Throughout the game, more and more weapons--from melee to ranged weapons--are added to your arsenal depending on your performance during each level; your chosen weapons dictate how you approach the mission goals. The silent approach is always encouraged, and there's a variety of graphically satisfying stealth kills that will only work if you remain elusive and strike unexpectedly and silently.Aside from the stealth kills, the game is a mixed bag in terms of its graphics. Light shimmers off your sword menacingly, but the environments are bland and repetitive, and the game fails to maximize on differences between light and dark areas in ways that might have added to the experience. Also, the stealth dynamic is made less challenging by the shortsightedness and slow reactions of the enemy guards and the iffy AI. Since guards give up searching for you within seconds and are unable to follow you through doors, this potentially atmospheric and tactical stealth game is actually just a hack-and-slash arcade romp. Multiplayer options are included, though, so if you feel the need for a more realistic opponent, you may want to call a friend.Tenchu: Wrath of Heavenis still an enjoyable experience despite its flaws. It&#x92;s just a shame that, after doing so much to establish and define the stealth-game genre, it fails to raise the bar or introduce any novel elements. The game feels more like an update of the first Tenchu, and while this is no bad thing, fans will probably be expecting more.--Chris Ryan, Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"OverTheMoon","summary":"This is Ninja","reviewText":"Tenchu 2 was once claimed to be the goriest game of all time. In many ways it lived up to the hype with its stealth kills. Tenchu 3 turns up the graphics, gameplay and stealth kills by a factor of 10 and then some more. Hopping across roof tops with your ninja blade looking for the enemy to perform a drop down standing on shoulders head through jaw thrust or a heart pull just makes this game a lot beyond want you have seen on the PS2 before. By the time the credits roll you would have been through a Ninja experience like-no-other. I can't believe how fierce this was to play. There is nothing, and I mean nothing, out there that plays quite like this. Imagine Solid Snake in MGSIII but with ninja skills. The game is as good as that.Note: I am very surprised by the 15 cert on the game. It looks like whoever reviewed this game for content advisory probably didn't perform all the moves correctly. This should be 18 cert for good reason. There are murders moves in the game that would rank up there with \"Manhunt\".","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2006"}

If you were to buy the premium content on xbox live, you would have spent $50 or 4000 microsoft points. But on amazon I paid $49 for both the premium download code, as well as a free copy of bf3, which I will MAKE MORE MONEY when selling to my friends. Heck yeah.this game is the most realistic and diverse first person shooter I have yet to see: bullet drop, a time-period before bullet penetration, many attachments, blinding and lighting up via flashlight, as well as blinding via lasers, spotting enemies for other teammates to see enemies/enemy vehicles on their mini-map, suppressors aren't actually too quiet, the blur (suppression effect) is taken into account, showing you are being fired at, the ability to be healed by the medic class, the diverse 4 classes that define battlefield: medic (assault), recon (sniper), engineer(rockets/vehicle repair stuff), and support (LMGs, mortars, tagging devices, etc), and the way each class is beneficial during different times and places, like open places, close quarters, or near vehicles. This game really is amazing.The single player is okay, and exciting but is not TOO intriguing for those who obsess over a perfect Halo campaign.the multiplayer is addictive and highly competitive, but on certain maps the enemy snipes where you spawn, especially smaller, open maps.The premium is very worth it, giving you first priority when waiting for a server to open up, giving you a head start with a few good weapons, it gives you camos for guns and your player you wouldn't normally get, and the dlc is entirely worth it.with premium you get additional content like assignments to unloke newer weapons you wouldn't normally be able to unlock. The XBOW and FAMAS are good examples of weapons only premium members can really aquire.overall the DLC is great, and exciting.BATTLEFIELD REQUIRES HIGHER INTELLIGENCE THAN CALL OF DUTY. There are many more complications and realistic factors like bullet drop, destroying buildings, vehicles -land, air, and some seacraft, many attachments that get complicated like flashlights and lasers blinding you, taking fire blurs your screen more,  and more dedicated players who like to win. Younger kids would only make the battlefield experience worse. even though it ruined COD, it took the focus off of Halo and Battlefield, giving players like me a chance to gain some real competition.

(I didn't really see this in my play through but some people have told me it happens so I am letting you know here)- Losing that cool sword: you have the ability to disarm enemies and kill them with their own weapons now (this never gets old) - BUT - you also drop you own original sword in the process making you having to dig among the bodies to find it again and hope it's not lost. ::UPDATE:: I put this wrong it seems, you never lose your weapons when doing a disarm attack (it yes it never gets old); you only seem to lose your weapon when a stronger enemy (usually a knight in a suit of armor) knocks it outta your hand, and this is still a bit rare. Then you would have to find your weapon though or pick up a new one later.- Too much Money? When you first start the game money is a bit hard to come by and weapons/armor are pretty expensive, while this can be a bit frustrating at first it builds gameplay and gives you goals outside of the missions to work towards. Now after you play for few hours and missions give you better pay and you fully upgrade your villa/town (this will automatically give you tons of free money; sorta like owning property in Fable 2 or GTA: Vice City) money becomes a non issue. Then getting paid at the end of missions seems pointless as well as doing Templar Secret location missions, which while fun, the entire point is to find a treasure room for yet more now pointless money. Anyways a few hours into the game and the in-game economy is broken to the point were you feel they should have done like Assassins Creed 1 and never had in-game money and just give you all your weapons/items based on mission progress.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A Stealth/action game set during the late 15th century and early 16th Italian Renaissance. You play as a man who becomes an Assassin in order to carry out revenge of his family.- You spend more time in the Animus and less time as Desmond over all.- The control is broken down mainly into two areas of gameplay there is a passive action and an aggressive action to almost everything you can do in the game. For example you can lightly tap people to move out of your way while walking down crowed the street (hold the B button to do this) or shove people as you run down that same street (hold the R button and the B button to do this). This duality applies to all your actions and it becomes necessary because during the game you must be able to move freely between these two states (passive and aggressive) to run and then hide from people the out to get you as well as to sneak up on and kill your victims.- You can now hire help like as body guards to protect with you might or street-walkers to use their bodies to distract armed guards.- Lot of what you will be doing is climbing and jumping from buildings this plays similar to the Prince of Persia games also made by ubisoft (the sands of time series). Although in this game the controls are more streamlined and user friendly as you can climb way more effectively as well as more realistically (even more then the first game).- In the first game most of the gameplay is not so much assassinating people but gathering Intel on your targets. This game retains some of that but expands on the concept so much you'll never think you're doing busy work (like the first) and you have a lot more big kill targets as well.- Combat has been refined by adding things like hammers, clubs, smoke bombs, and the hidden (now dual) assassin blades of course, plus you can steal enemies' weapons and use it against them too. The combat has a bit more over all intelligent flow from the first game, although it builds on that idea.- Mix up you clothing colors by buy buying dyes for you outfit (in colors like red, green, and black) as well as unlocking new capes for your character. Also buy things like health potions, poisons, new weapons, new armor, and even treasure maps and famous paintings for your villa.- You even get a villa (which is basically works like a small personal town) which you can upgrade by renting out space to local store owners and then getting goods (the main house seems to be the only place you can swap weapons and armor apparently).GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Assassins Creed (360/PS3/PC)- Grand Theft Auto 4 (360/PS3)- HitMan: Blood Money (360)- Prince of Persia (Xbox/PS2)- Metal Gear Solid 4 (PS3)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- Ezio the star of Assassins Creed 2 is related to Altar of the first game and Desmond is related to both of them- Assassin's Creed: Lineage, a small set of mini movies (with real actors and CG effects) telling the story leading up to Assassins Creed 2 about Ezio's father (who was also an Assassin). These movies are made by Ubisoft and are found on the internet for free - so go see them.- Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines (starting Altar of the first game) is a PSP game with Connectivity with the PS3 version of this game that can unlock six exclusive and unique weapons in Assassins Creed 2.- The game skips chapters 12 and 13 - These chapters come in as two downloads for this game. One called The Battle of Forl&igrave; and the other called Bonfire of the Vanities. There is also a version of the download Bonfire of the Vanities which comes with the three bonus missions (more Templar Secret locations) previously only found on the limited edition version of Assassins Creed 2.- At the start screen of Assassin Creed 2 (and also in Splinter Cell: Conviction) you'll see an option of something called Uplay. Uplay is a systems set up by Ubisoft to give players who unlock achievements/trophies in this game bounces for playing Assassins Creed 2. Some things you can unlock in Assassins Creed 2 are a theme for your Xbox 360 or PS3, more throwing knifes for your character, or even unlocking Altar's assassins robes from Assassins Creed 1 (which is really cool), and even a new secret assassins tomb under your villa/town.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

You play as three different space men who are venturing into the solar system to find food and sustenance for their home planet. This is your main goal for the game. Each day you need to find fruit to bring back to your ship which then turns into juice. Depending on how many people are in your party on that day one juice will be consumed per person. This is where things get frustrating. When you're on the ground you go around collecting tokens which are used in the Pikmin Onions to create Pikmin. The Pikmin must carry these to the Onion and some tokens require a certain amount of Pikmin. If you alot more than the required amount the token will get carried faster. You can also bring enemy carcasses to the Onion to convert to Pikmin as well which is a neat idea. Of course you will lose Pikmin if they get caught up in water (except blue Pikmin) or killed by enemies. That's not even the frustrating part. You get about 10 minutes for the entire day to explore the area, gather Pikmin, and find fruit. Two days would go by where I get caught up on a boss, need to gather more Pikmin because I'm low, or just figure out where the fruit is.This sounds frustrating because it really is. I wish the day cycle wasn't here, it makes thing annoying. I wound up losing 100 Pikmin because they were carrying a boss carcass and fruit back to the ship and I missed getting them in the safe zone by 1 second. So I spent 2 days gathering more Pikmin and another 1 day to find a fruit. In the mean time I consumed 3 juices which left me with one. If I hadn't found a fruit on that third day I would have had a game over. Super frustrating and that's honestly not much fun.Other than this major frustration the game is super enjoyable. The game is paced really well and I felt I was blazing through areas at a brisk pace. The game keeps you on your toes with the inventive enemy designs and bosses. The variety of Pikmin is nice since they are based on elements. Rock Pikmin can smash through crystal and glass and do massive damage to enemies. Yellow Pikmin can electrocute, Red Pikmin are your base Pikmin and are resistant to fire and are great fighters. Blue Pikmin can swim but aren't good fighters. You can swap around these Pikmin and order them around with the right analog stick. I just found that micromanaging them got annoying because they can get lost and stuck in places if you leave them behind so I lost many Pikmin from that, some times I just down right lost them somewhere and had to leave them behind.The Battle Mode is really fun. Bingo Battle puts two players against each other in an effort to gather four cards in a row. You have to collect fruit, defeat enemies, and various other objectives. There's no online multiplayer which is a crying shame, but two players on the couch is better than nothing. This mode can be really addictive and the Mission Mode will keep you coming back after the story mode is complete.The game actually is one of the best looking Wii U games out there. It really shows the power of the Wii U with depth of field, high resolution textures, and some great lighting effects. There are some ugly textures like the dirt. It looks like Wii textures, maybe this was a rush job from Nintendo, I don't know. The previous complaint about the micromanaging and the day limit is too short. No online multiplayer is a bummer, but overall this is a really nice package and any Wii U owner should check this game out.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-09-2014"}

It is a nice incremental improvement to the motion controls.  In some cases it will fix everything that it wouldn't recongize before.  In other cases the it is a subtle to moderate incremental improvement.  The bottom line is you probably bought a Wii for motion control, and you'll have to have this for future games which will probably all support motion control.  It is easy to attach, and comes with a new extended jacket.You get one for free with Wii Sports Resort, but to play with others, you'll need more attachments for the rest of your remotes and this is the way to get the others unless you buy another game that packed it in.  As you'll probably have to buy this anyway the future of your Wii experience, at least the price seems reasonable for what you get.  Of course buy one packed in with Wii Sports Resort (or one of the other games) first, which makes it a good deal for the game + this.  Think of any other games that pack this in that you really want so you don't buy this separately then buy a game that packs it in soon after and have an unecessary extra.Using it does give you noticible, incrementally better control, for the games that use it.  But it has absolutely no affect on existing games.  You can leave it attached for existing games.  The inch or two of added length to the remote doesn't seem noticeable or bothersome.It is slightly more work to change batteries though since you have to detach it within the sleeve, stretch slightly to pull apart, bend and pull the strap through a new slit in the back.  When putting back together, you have to feed the strap through a new slit in the extended sleeve and re-attach.  I find it easy, just a little more involved.  I wish there was a flap on the back of the remote to easily change batteries.  The strap remains attached where it is, and doesn't move to the end of the new attachment.  The new attachment is not designed to take any pressure or torque.One big warning though is for rechargeable battery systems.  If you previously set your remote in a charger, this attachment will stop  that from fitting as it did before and might not be usable.  Although, you'll have to buy this anyway for the future of your Wii experience.  I guess you could always detach it for charging.  For those who just use rechargeable AA batteries, it is no different than before.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2009"}

It is a welcome change compared to the previous editions of The Sims. I have been playing it for two days now, and here are some of the main things I have noticed so far:THE GOOD*Everything is customizable, from the highlights in your sim's hair to the pattern on your sim's couch.*The sims can now be as skinny or fat as you want. In The Sims 2 there was only 3 basic weight categories.*Personalities are now based on a trait choosing system instead of adding and subtracting lines. There are a lot of traits to choose from too.*Life goals can be chosen from a selection based on the traits you chose. Some of the interactions with other sims are also based on those traits and so are your sim's wants/wishes.*Wants/wishes are more reasonable and you have the option to do them or not by promising or canceling them.*Some of the good things from the previous version have come back, like the young adult phase of life and the ability to own a car.*No more pesky load screens! This is a huge advantage. Now, if you want to go somewhere you just go. Want to visit a neighbor? Just walk over and knock on their door.*The town itself has more things to do, like classes, performances and events.*Friendships can be built at work. This makes it a whole hell of a lot easier to make friends.*As relationships between sims grow, they learn things about each other and each other's traits.*The game play is not so needs based. You don't have to interrupt activities to take care of the basic needs as often.*You have the option to turn story mode on or off, when it is on the whole town ages with your sim. You can also decide how long, in sim days your sim's lifespan is going to be (in the options menu).THE BAD*There are no pets, and no seasons. I was hoping there would be. I guess EA is making sure we spend an extra few bucks on expansions.*The graphics don't live up to all the hype. They are about the same as they were in The Sims 2.*When I speed up the in game time, it still moves very slow. Maybe it's just my computer, or maybe not.THE IN-BETWEEN*Seems like the player can only focus on one family. If you want to start a new family you have to start a new saved game.*More integrated with The Sims 3 online. I don't care too much about this but I am sure that there are others that are thrilled.OVERVIEWThe good outweighs the bad. I really don't understand all the negative reviews. The removal of load screens is a big, huge plus. It helps the game play immensely, just makes everything so much easier. The sims are more social when they are able to walk around and go wherever they want. And the game is more fun because you don't have to sit and wait forever for every little thing.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2009"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","reviewerName":"Marshall David WahlstromHelgren","summary":"Mario Kart Double Dash","reviewText":"I love this game, just like Mario Kart 64 for Nintendo 64 of course there's various different challenges and the course and karts are different but the gameplay is much of the same. But theres lots of added twists for example you switch drivers with the Z button, when you get hit by an item the person in back of the vehicle can fall off and be dragged for a few seconds and eventually get back up onto the vehicle, its fun to play solo but its more fun to play with another person or more people up to four players which is pretty sweet. The only negative I would give is that if you fall on a banana peel you can't hit the B and Z button and then get a quick note bubble so thats the only down fall of this game where as in the Nintendo 64 that was not the case. It's a game for the whole family to play especially kids and parents its very awesome to play on the 2006 model Wii (that model Wii is backwards compatible and will play Gamecube games. The 2011 model can only play Wii games and DVD's.) However I recommend that this game be played on the original system which is Nintendo Gamecube, for which it is originally intended.

Soul Calibur used to give fans some lovely extras, but recently the games haven't really had as much (except the content for purchase...), same with Street Fighter and others.  So I was very happy with the amount of content to unlock!There are several modes.  At first, many characters, and most additional costumes are locked on the VS mode, so you can pick from a handful of players.  After acquiring PP points on the story mode, you can purchase and unlock new characters and costumes, stages, music, and other content.  Wow!I have been playing Final Fantasy since I was a wee one, back when the first game came out in 1988 (I was 9), and I was hooked.  I have since played through every numbered Final Fantasy title (except 11, which I played but didn't really 'finish').  So seeing a lot of the characters from previous games was a treat.  I listed the characters below and then a few pros and cons.  I must say that this is a wonderful 2d/3d fighting game and a stunning release on the PSP.  The overworld area on story mode is large and interesting.  The graphics are amazing for a handheld, the voice acting well done (and there is a lot of it), and the controls fluid.  One note:  thank goodness you can change the character movement from the analog stick to the D-pad.  I hated trying to control the character with the joke of an analog stick the PSP has.Characters:FF1: Warrior of Light / GarlandFF2: Firion / The EmperorFF3: Onion Knight / Cloud of DarknessFF4: Cecil, Kain / GolbezFF5: Bartz / ExdeathFF6: Terra / KefkaFF7: Cloud / Tifa / SephirothFF8: Squall / Laguna / UltimiciaFF9: Zidane / KujaFF10: Tidus / Yuna / JechtFF11: Shantotto (yeah.....)FF12: Vaan / GabranthFF13: LightningAnd there are three hidden characters including Gilgamesh (you know he HAD to show up somewhere!)Notable characters I think could have been exciting (not griping): Auron (FF10), Seymour (FF10), Cid (any! though Cid from FF12 I think would have been a better villain than Gabranth), Siegfried (FF6 and others), Seifer (FF8), and Celes (FF6... this one really hurt).  But I think they did great in keeping it to mostly two from each release, with a couple of extra characters from the more notable releases (4, 7, 10).Pros:+ Ingenious combat system with a kind of 'deathblow' setup+ Great references to previous FF titles+ Lots of minor FF characters make cameos+ Good challenge on higher difficulty+ Lots of content to unlock+ Great music from previous games all remastered to the PSP midi format+ Stages from previous FF titles+ Good variety of characters each with their own attacksCons:- Bottomless stages- Super jumping / flying characters (my only big beef!)- Weird 'gate combat' format in story mode - would have liked 'optional' overworld battles.- Leveling doesn't really seem to make a big difference.Overall the cons are minor, except the super flying aspect of many battles.  I would have liked a 'flatter' style like Soul Calibur as opposed to the multi level stages with characters that can do huge, mega jumps.  It's my only problem, but it's one that is more of a preference.  I understand it would have drastically changed the gameplay.Otherwise this is one of the 5 must own PSP titles, and the only Final Fantasy franchise game that I would call a MUST own on the PSP.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"Lucas Black","summary":"It's Really Good!  (I couldn't think of a pun)","reviewText":"I've been a fan of The Legend of Zelda series since 1999.  Much later than some whom have been there since the beginning, but still a good long stretch of 14 years.  I purposefully avoided as much information as possible about this game except for a single early video of the Eastern Palace, and I'm glad I did.  With my new Zelda-edition 3DS XL, I was immediately slapped in the face by the bright, vibrant colors of LBW.  The 3D effect is used wonderfully to make it feel as if you're looking through a window at the Kingdom of Hyrule.  And I'm really glad I upgraded from the standard 3DS to the XL.  It was the perfect time.The game starts off simply enough, giving you a choice between two dungeons.  And then you get a choice between seven that you can do in almost any order.  I thought this was an excellent move to stray from the usual of: Get an item - get into the dungeon locked by its use - get an item in that dungeon - go to the next one unlocked by that item.  It was a system of long hallways with locked doors at the end of each.  That's all gone, and the items are all freely available from the start.  Just save up some rupees and buy as many as you feel you want.The various items greatly help in the way you can deal with enemy encounters, offering things like damage at range, damage to airborne enemies, flying ones, ones below or to either side.  You'll find you can deal with big shielded enemies by yanking the shield away with your Hookshot, or raising them up and roasting them with a pillar of fire, or dropping a bomb and using your own shield to keep them hovering on it to get caught in the blast.  Every encounter becomes a mini puzzle in itself rather than the Ocarina of Time style of Z Target, block with shield, hit with sword.Speaking of puzzles, LBW excels in not having strictly themed dungeons.  Most require a combination of skills rather than just using the dungeon's item.  It's more about thinking and overall skills and sometimes there's more than one way to do a puzzle.  The Desert Palace with the Sand Rod is an exception, but in general the areas seem more inventive and with a nice, large scale to them.  You feel like you're in a big place, changing parts of the level itself rather than finding a key to open a door to open another door.The dungeons are the main course of any Zelda game, but I found the sidequests enjoyable too.  My favorite is the search for the lost Maiamais, baby pink squids in shells hidden all over Hyrule.  Gold Skulltullas and Heart Pieces are nice, but there's just something rewarding about bringing the little guys back to their giant pink squid mom for her to upgrade one of your items, plus that adorable song in her cave.Speaking of music, LBW pretty much perfected it.  Ocarina of Time's soundtrack will be hitting me with joy and nostalgia forever, and Majora's Mask has an excellent and moody score, but if we're talking overall quality, it's got to be Link Between Worlds.  Some may say Twilight Princess did it better, but honestly I didn't really get into any of that.If there's anything negative to say, several dungeons feel very short.  I'd often find myself at the boss door with the key asking myself, &#34;Really?  Already?&#34;  But I guess that could be a case of time flies when you're having fun.  The bosses were also very easy.  I think only ONE was able to do me in.  For sure they were all enjoyable to fight, but a couple were just plain embarrassing themselves.  The wall merging trick made one particular boss a case of merge into wall, pop out, hit with sword, repeat.  You could literally go the fight without taking more than a few steps.  I wasn't asking for a series of grueling, punishing affairs, but more challenge would have been a good thing.  I never even needed to use any fairies (and also never found the net, so that could be a reason.)I could go on for a long time, but it's time to wrap this up.  If you're already a Zelda fan, you probably already have this or are just browsing reviews before ordering it.  To you guys: yeah, it's extremely fun and there's basically nothing here I'm dissatisfied with.  It exceeded every expectation.  To newcomers to the franchise: this might be the most condensed, pure essence of Zelda.  In fact, this might be the ideal first Zelda for a person.  Not too hard, smart and fun puzzles and enemies, excellent soundtrack and graphics.  The story is even better than usual!  Not terribly deep but a cut above the rest.Five out of five stars, no contest.  This isn't a 4.5 or a 4.9, it's a 5.0.  Buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-01-2013"}

I thought this game would make a GREAT movie!!!  Then, I thought, that the game itself surpasses any game that would be made.  Given that most Game-To-Movies are terrible.Incredible graphics.  You have got to play this game.  Definitely NOT FOR KIDS!!!!  And I don't mean because of graphics.  When you are in the room of Aphrodite, it's really way over the top and didn't need to be in the story.  I kind of wish that part wasn't in there.  But, it appeals to all these hormonal teenagers and um' lonely male adults....anyway the plot of the game is simple.  Kill Zeus.  Which is funny to me how the Greek gods are as mortal as...well mortals.  But, that's what makes them fantasy and not real.  So, anyway, Kratos the character is going after Zeus and kills main bosses along the way.  But, no spoilers here.  What is cool is that when you defeat each boss, you acquire their weapons.Graphics, Sound, gameplay, you couldn't ask for a better gaming experience.In fact the voice talents are amazing.  Adrienne Barbeau, Clancy Brown, Elijah Woods, and others.What a game, what a game.  If you have never played God Of War III on PS3, you have got to rent it or buy.  It is incredible.  I know that there are the previous versions I and II for the PS2, but I'm afraid to play those because I'm afraid it will not live up to what the PS3 delivered.  I heard that they are coming out with a new God of War!!!So, I highly recommend this game.  You will be mesmerized for hours on end!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2010"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J4NE","description":"","reviewerName":"Happy r/c","summary":"I have the SONY PS3 but the XBox's Kinect is WAY BETTER than Sony's MOVE","reviewText":"After trying Microsoft's Kinect with the River Rush game, I hate to admit it but SONY screwed up BIG TIME because Kinect is WAY BETTER than Sony's MOVE controller -- underline controller.SONY's included game looks cheap like the WII whereas Microsoft's XBOX's Kinect includes a game that is XBOX/PS3 quality.It's soooo amazing that the Kinect can track my limbs as I surfed the river!  In contrast, when I played SONY's ping pong, it was NOTHING like my real ping pong table at home (if I swung that hard in real life, the ball would not land on the table, it would be on the neighbor's roof!) -- I was very disappointed.  Sony MOVE also doesn't track my legs unlike Kinect which tracked my leg kicking a ball.  Kinect also saw the difference between my bicep and forearm movements.With the Kinect, I don't have to worry about the kids breaking the controllers, recharging batteries, or finding the damn controllers when the kids don't put back where I can find them!For a fighting game for adults, you gotta check out youtube's MMA title called \"FIGHTERS UNCAGED for Xbox 360\" which not only detects your punches but also detects your kicks (which SONY MOVE can't).  Now that's a workout for me to get off my butt!I hope SONY corrects its serious mistake with the MOVE and buy the Kinect technology.  Pretty sad that SONY isn't on the cutting edge of innovative products anymore.  I love Sony products, I only buy SONY TVs, clock radios, boom boxes, portable DVD players.  In the sound department, I usually buy other brands though like Denon, Onkyo, Yamaha, Harmon Kardon.Maybe SONY and Microsoft can make a deal: I'll give you blu-ray if you give me Kinect then it'll be a win-win for consumers and game makers!For fitness, I bought EA Sports Active 2 for SONY PS3 which is a better motion controller than the MOVE for tracking your body because it allows your hands to be free and it tracks your leg and it is also a heart rate monitor.  I hope future games will use the motion controller in EA Sports Active rather than the MOVE to track whole body like Microsoft Xbox Kinect.-----------------SIDE NOTE: I wish Sony would make more family friendly games instead of mostly violent games for hardcore gamers like 1st-person bloody shootouts and driving games.  I wish Sony made a version of Microsoft's Kinect Adventure (river rush) game -- that's an awesome game for the family.  Maybe some fun educational games too.If Sony doesn't add family-oriented games and Sony PS3 dies, at least I still have a blu-ray player.Look at how many family games there are for Xbox: [...]I think Sony targets core gamers. However, core gamers (not me) don't really want a motion controller.  In contrast, Microsoft Kinect is targeting the mainstream audience (my family and I). I experienced the Microsoft Kinect at a kid's Jump/bounce kind of place and let me tell you, this kind of exposure is going to kill SONY MOVE because moms/dads spread the word like wildfire!  How did you think the Wii got to be #1 with families?I want to exercise more but my treadmill/spinner are boring so I would buy the Kinect and I think City Parks&Rec; Depts would too.  Additionally, I can see how corporations can buy this inexpensive video-conferencing device (it also follows subjects around the room automatically and resizes frames when more people enter the frame).  In all, SONY PS3 may stay around but this does not look good for SONY PS3 MOVE's future.  So, I've just mentioned 2 new markets that Kinect can open whereas SONY MOVE cannot.  1/14/2011 update: At Target I saw a few games available on both XBox and PS3 and the PS3 versions were about $10 cheaper so in these cases, I would still buy the PS3 version.Everytime I go to the store to buy a new game, I don't see any new Amazon highly-rated family games and am disappointed.  Maybe I have to bite the bullet and buy a Microsoft XBox 360 after all in order to get the family, sports, and exercise games for the whole family to enjoy but I haven't decided until now after I've experienced the Kinect.  If I do buy the Xbox, any new games that are available on both PS3 and Xbox platforms, I'll probably buy Xbox versions because there's a higher chance that Xbox gaming will be around longer than the PS3, which also makes my trade-ins more valuable.  1/14TO SONY (if you're reading this), I am VERY interested in motion gaming but with family games, not inappropriate 1st-person-shoot-bloody-gory games for my kids or me.  Make more family-oriented games because I will buy.  I own the following and I highly recommend these family games:- GRAN TURISMO 5- EA Sports Active 2 (with motion devices)- TEST DRIVE UNLIMITED 2- NCAA Football 11- MADDEN 10 FOOTBALL- VANCOUVER 2010- FIFA SOCCER 10- LITTLE BIG PLANET- GRID- G-FORCE- CARS- VIRTUAL TENNIS 3- SURF'S UP- WAKEBOARD (ONLINE PURCHASE)- TOY STORY 3- BLADESTORM- MONSTERS VS ALIENS- RAPALA FISHING FRENZY 2009- PINBALL HALL OF FAME - THE WILLIAMS COLLECTION- NBA 2K10- MLB 10 THE SHOW- BLAZING ANGELS 2 (flying game)FOR ADULTS:- 007 QUANTUM OF SOLACE- MOTOR STORM PACIFIC RIFT=========================================6/1/2011 update: I bought the XBox 250GB with Kinect and we love it!  I also bought 10 awesome kinect games.  We now only turn on the Sony PS3 for blu-ray movies (I only have 2) or scratched DVDs or to play Sony game exclusives like \"MLB 10 The Show\" and what we already own like \"EA Sports college and NFL football games\".","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-24-2010"}

After reading some reviews I bought a mounting clip for the eye and a second move controller. While all games can be played with one controller, two work better with Gladiator, Archery and Volley Ball.Family favorites are Gladiator (get ready to move), Frisby Golf and Bocce.  I did not care for Volleyball because you have to learn a whole bunch of different moves pushing different combinations of buttons and I just don't care that much about playing volleyball. Something else I thought could be improved on is the characters which I thought were \"flat\".  The same characters are used through out all the games and the personalities do not change...it is the same aha over and over again.  In Gladiator you play for bronze, silver and gold cup.  The only difference is the difficulty level, so basically you are just working on improving your technique.Most of the time the move controllers are very accurate but we have experienced some issues.  One could be the distance between the TV (eye) and the coffe table. Even though we move the table as far back as possible and my son and I do not seem to have much of an issue, my much taller husband has been frustrated at time.  We have been playing Bocce against each other and he will through the ball at 80% strength to go far and it will just drop and roll a few inches ruining his turn.Overall I think it is a good starter game...however, I am hoping to get something more involved, more change in scenery, more in depth characters, something that does not bore me as easily in future move games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-06-2011"}

S.","summary":"Almost another Silent Hill masterpiece.","reviewText":"Summary:I love this series, and this game is no exception.  I had a great time exploring this classic, unique psychological horror experience.  It has loads of benefits working for it, but there are some production quality issues that just keep this addition to the Silent Hill series below par to the rest.Why I love this game:1. Visuals:  Great graphics.  Very appealing and unique style, especially for the psychological horror genre.  Enemies are very realistic and creepy; fun to look at and fun to bash in.  :)2. Music:  Perfect.  Memorable tones accompany the story progression, infusing it with emotional impact.  Eerie tracks keep you on your toes during combat situations.3. Sounds:  Great.  Sounds match the enemies.  Ambience works great to pull the game world together.4. Difficulty:  Balanced for the player's enjoyment.  Plentiful weaponry and healing items counterbalance the more difficult aspects of the combat such as gripping enemies.5. Story:  Great psychological horror thrill.  Most of the gameplay is tied into the grand story in the game.  Story progression is slow enough to spark curiosity, but fast enough to retain interest.  Being a prequel, this game is very much tied into the future of the Silent Hill series.Why I hate this game:1. Controls:  Generally fine, but there are three serious hang-ups: (a) slow button response, (b) difficult to perform 'finishers,' and (c) investigation/attack button overlap.(1a) The slow button response I found to be really annoying.  When you press the PS2 triangle button to open map or the X button to investigate the game world, there is often a very slow game response.  This causes me to push a button twice, wondering if I had pressed it at all.  Double pressing causes me to instantly open and close a screen I wanted or to skip investigating an item I just picked up.(1b) The 'finishers' are when your character kills your opponent with a final blow while they are knocked out on the ground.  The major problem for this is activating it.  On some enemies, it is very hard to position your character to activate the 'finisher.'  This can be very very annoying when you miss the 'finisher' and have to knock out your enemy all over again.(1c) Investigation, attack, and 'finishers' are all performed with the same button - the X button.  This causes you to investigate when you want to attack if you're too close to an object of interest (any object that prompts text when you investigate it).  And trying to perform 'finishers' near doors can cause one to exit the room by accidently investigating the door.2. Shadows:  Shadows tear frequently.  By this I mean the should-be solid shadows have broken lines across them sometimes.  Very visually unappealing and very unrealistic.3. Soundtrack:  Music and ambience randomly stops.  For no apparent reason, the soundtrack in the game just randomly ends.  This is a serious disservice to the wonderful soundtrack and the player.  I don't think I've heard a track completely through in this game.  It just seems like bad production quality.4. Bugged:  There is a glitch when you reload a gun from the menu screen.  The graphic of the gun changes to a handgun when reloaded, and the gun selection cursor is changed to the first gun on the list.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-21-2008"}
{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

Fox \"billfy\"","summary":"Great Graphics, poor visability.","reviewText":"The graphics for the Game Boy Advance are outstanding, and there are a lot of really good games for it too, but I do have a few problems with it.The major thing that really annoys me is the lack of backlighting.  Why haven't the people at Nintendo figured that one out yet?  I know it would probably add about 50 to 100% to the price, but the system is cheap right now, and I would be more than happy to pay the extra money to be able to see what I am doing.  And don't tell me to buy a Worm Light, they aren't the solution.My Second complaint is the configuration.  I know The GBA was designed with child sized hands in mind, and not for me, but that still doesn't exuse the fact that it is somewhat uncomfortable to try and play a game for any period of time (especially when you have to hole it at a certain angle to be able to see anything).The Third and final complaint is that there are not enough buttons.  A lot of the games for GBA are adapted versions of old Super Nintendo games, but that is just it, they have to be adapted because there are not enough buttons on the GBA.  There is plenty of empty space to fit at least 2 more buttons, but for some reason they are just not there.All in all, GBA is a great system, with amazing games and graphics.  So until Sony comes out with their own handheld (yeah right) with Final Fantasy X on it (in your dreams), I guess we'll just have to settle for GBA.  Maybe that's what they need is a little competition, they haven't had any since Sega's virtual flop that didn't last more than a year, and is impossible to find anymore.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2001"}

I haven't played the others.","reviewText":"Journey is an amazing game it's really more of a cohesive experience that a videogame but it really is fun. In this review I will not speak of the other games included in this bundle but they've both received great reviews. So this bundle is a good price at the time of writing this Journey was $14.99 on PlayStation network.Journey is the perfect game to introduce somebody to gaming the object is simple you walk and fly your unknown character across an amazing landscape. I think Journey would be a great game if you want to get young child into gaming. Now some of the mechanics might be lost in a young child but the moving and jumping and flying should be relatively easy for them to pick up. In this game is basically violence free minus a few points where you might be afraid (actually I got afraid a little) but it might be a little scary for young child I was a journey to be played by any child 5 years plus.As a disabled gamer I'm very interested in the options menus to see if you can remap the buttons journey has 0% remapping your stuck with one layout. Now I did get the developer to add more buttons that you can use (showing them a video of me playing with my face and having to reach across the controller to hit the X button instead of just having fly be L1 convince them to add more buttons.) And you cannot turn off the 6 axis function even though I can move the controller freely and have to hold my face this wasn't really an issue. But just be warned this game uses 2 buttons and you can assign which controller buttons you want to do that.Another thing is the multiplayer it has multiplayer kind of? As you journey through the world you meet other players that are automatically matched as you play you don't know who they are or where they're from and you can only \"chirp\" at them by pressing a button but it's kind of cute and interesting. One cool thing when you finish the game you to see a list of the gamer tags of the players that you played with totally awesome.PRO TIP:You can tell if you're playing with an advanced player by the length of their robe when you start out you have a red robe with the yellow fringe but as you play more the yellow fringe grows longer.So I recommend this game wholeheartedly if you're only visiting Journey by it straight off the PSN network I don't like having/can't because of my disability swap disks.Thanks for reading and I hope you thoroughly enjoy your journey.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B002I096AA","description":"","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Nintendo scores again","reviewText":"Generally speaking, I'm not much into console games. I did, however, buy a Gameboy Advance back in the day, as well as a DS Lite when that came out. I've noticed in the process that the first generation of Nintendo handhelds is usually quickly phased out in favor of a much improved follow-up, and as such was thinking of holding out on 3DS version 1.0 Curiosity got the better of me, however, and after seeing some demos of the device I just had to check it out.Right out of the box, the 3DS has a sleek, futuristic look to it while at the same time retaining a solid feel. The added thumb-stick is the most noticeable difference between it and non-3D DS models, at least until you turn it on. That's when you'll see that the startup software is completely different. There's an applications and settings list where you can access the built-in games (AR Games and Face Raiders, both of which are rather amusing) plus the Mii Maker, settings, and online features. On startup you'll also get a quick 3-D calibration/orientation which shows off the main draw of this device: the autostereoscopic 3D screen.Since this is the most important feature, it deserves a bit of extra description. You can control the 3-D depth via a physical slider on the edge of the screen, and different people will find they can tolerate different levels of it. My vision prescription is uneven (my left eye sees significantly better than my right) and so I was a bit concerned whether I'd be able to stand this- sometimes movies with 3-D glasses give me a mild headache after a while. While I will say that the 3DS does impose a bit more eyestrain than its 2-D brethren, you'll probably run out of battery power before it really bothers you. In order for you not to see double, however, you have to hold it in pretty much the exact same position while playing. This position is about 2 feet from your face and directly in front of your eyes. Fortunately the unit isn't any heavier than the old DS Lite, so it's not uncomfortable to hold it like this.The sound and picture quality both seem substantially improved from my old DS Lite, though it probably is less of a step up from the DSi or XL. Playing old games, it can actually be a bit hard to read some smaller text because the screen resolution is much higher and the software may not be able to scale it up properly. On that note, the 3DS can play DS games but not GBA/GB games. This is something to bear in mind if you have a lot of those. On the other hand, it does have an SD card slot, and I imagine Nintendo will be selling quite a few of those older titles on its store if you really want to keep them. The 3DS can take pictures, including 3-D photos, but the resolution of its cameras is somewhat mediocre. It won't be replacing your digital cam anytime soon, but it's a fun feature and is used in some games. You can also use the 3DS as a rather large music player. As of now there's no movies available for it, but this will almost certainly will be remedied in the future.It is, of course, the games that really sell the console. Right now the 3DS lineup is a pretty short list, but I'm pleased to say it's also a solid one. I've picked up 3 titles so far, and all of them haven't disappointed- the 3-D is not merely tacked on, but a real part of the game and definitely a new dimension in portable gaming. While the 3DS isn't going to knock your socks off with incredible effects, it is a lot of fun to play with. In many respects, the fact that only one person can effectively view it at a time is a bit of a pain, since people will keep bugging you to see it work.I do have a few complaints about the 3DS, most notably related to the controls and battery life. Right off, I noticed that the D-Pad and buttons were a bit sticky- requiring significantly more pressure to activate than my old DS Lite. It's even a bit more rigid than the GBA SP, and sometimes the D-Pad actually gets stuck. As a sidenote the thumbtack is pretty under-utilized in most current games. In many cases (including all old DS titles) it simply acts as an alternate D-Pad. Additionally, the battery life of this unit is significantly lower than that of any previous incarnation. With 3-D on and average brightness, it gets about half the play time of my DS Lite and about 1/3 that of my ancient GBA SP. It's not crazy short like the Game Gear (remember that?) but let's just say that getting a car charger was high on my list of priorities. In many respects, I think the included docking station is a nod to the fact that you need to charge this unit a lot more frequently than any previous one. I imagine the controls will get a bit less sticky with time, and if you need the longevity you can dial down the brightness and turn off 3-D. Neither of these issues is enough to discourage me from recommending it.Bottom line: the 3DS is as good as it was hyped up to be. Its feature set is formidable, the 3D both effective and fun, and the launch titles are great. Seeing this system makes it clear why Nintendo has dominated the handheld games market, and with it they will likely continue to do so.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000KLNLV4","reviewerName":"Richard Baker \"BinaryMessiah\"","summary":"A fun weekend rental","reviewText":"The Good: Using the glaive never gets old, awesome graphics, satisfying finishersThe Bad: Spotty story, lame multiplayer, gets repetitive after awhileI was so excited for Dark Sector after hearing about it years ago. I finally get to play it and I wonder what took so damn long. The story is about something along the lines of a government experiment in Russia to make money and something like that, and you're a guinea pig in the experiment...and yeah. The story is almost non existent, but who cares?! It's all about the gameplay. The graphics and audio are astounding so don't worry. The game plays, feels, and looks like a mix of Resident Evil 4 and Gears of War. You have the over-the-shoulder view point like RE4, and the hold-down-A-button-and-run-with-the-camera-up-your-ass move like in GoW.The game is based around the glaive that Hayden gets in the game. You can slice enemies up (which looks killer) by slicing off heads, chopping off arms and watching enemies clutch their stump and scream, slice them in half etc. The game slowly introduces things for your glaive throughout the game. You can charge your glaive with elements like electricity, ice, and fire and go figure on what those do. You can also do \"Aftertouch\" (was that stolen from Burnout?) which lets you control the glaive in slow motion. You can also shoot things, but the gunplay is kind of weak.You can upgrade your weapons adding things to them such as extra firepower, higher accuracy, and stopping power through suitcases that you pick up throughout the game. The multiplayer is really bad though. The game is always lagging and cutting out, and it's just boring. You have to types Infection and something else (yeah it's so dull I forgot what I was playing) and it's just boring. Dark Sector is an awesome rental and will fill 8-9 hours of your weekend up with gory fun.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2012"}

Choose one of four teams&#151;each bringing unique variances in gameplay, tactics and strategies. Massive environments, challenging missions and strategic team formations highlight this latest evolution in the Sonic universe!","reviewerName":"&#308;&#308;","summary":"Fun game!","reviewText":"\"Sonic Heroes\" is a pretty good game with multiple stories to follow with just a few flaws.  There are four different stories, so I am going to break each of them down before going into the other aspects of the game.STORY-Team Sonic:Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails have received a note from Dr. Eggman saying that he is about to take over the world, so they set out to stop him.  This team is focused more on speed.Team Dark:Rouge, Shadow, and Omega are out to destroy Dr. Eggman, for he imprisoned Shadow and Omega and left them there, not intending to come back.  Shadow has amnesia in this game, so part of it is focused on him recovering from that, as well.  This is a little bit more violent and teen-focused story, and it has a lot more enemies to defeat than in the other team battles.Team Rose:Amy, Cream, and Big are the cutest team around, and that's a great thing for younger players and for female gamers.  Their missions are a bit shorter and easier, and they have a very \"cute\" style of defeating enemies.  Their main goal is to find Sonic, Froggy, and Chocola.Team Chaotix:Vector, Espio, and Charmy may be newer characters, but they have really unique levels.  They run a detective agency, and they have received a mysterious business proposition that requires them to complete missions that aren't about getting to the finish line, as the other team's missions are.  Their missions have an adventure feel to them as they might have to find hidden objects, or get a certain amount of coins.GAMEPLAY-The game is composed of various stages which usually require the teams to get to the finish line or defeat an enemy (with the exception of Team Chaotix).  Along the way, all teams can collect coins and other items to help them.  There are save points along the way that allow teams to come back to them if they ever die.  There are also level-ups that let the teams abilities grow.  Each team is made of three components:a speed character, a power character, and a fly character.  Each of them has special abilities unique to them.  Also along the way are monsters and robots that you can either run past or defeat.  However, if they hit you, you lost all coins, and if they hit when you have no coins, you die.  As you are going along, you will build up your \"Team Blast\" meter.  When filled, the team combines to make a powerful attack sure to stop monsters in their tracks (and probably blow them up, too!).GRAPHICS-The graphics are on the most part good, but occasionally, you would see the ocean or forest and think that it just looked bad.  But, mostly, the graphics are very nice and pleasant to watch.  Sometimes, however, the camera would swing out of focus forcing the player to stop for a second or two.SOUND-The voice acting is pretty good in the game, and so are the background sounds.  But what really shines is the music.  The music is upbeat and nicely done.FUN-The game really is fun for all.  If you want to blow up monsters, have a casual fighting game, or have a unique adventure game, this game has it to offer to you.LENGTH-It will take a while to complete all stories, and once you do, a new story unlocks.  Also, there are side quests to so such as collecting all chaos emeralds or solving alternate missions on the same levels.  Also, if you get all A's on all levels, I think something else unlocks, but I've never done that, so I'm not sure.  But just the fact that there are four stories to complete, makes the game last a while!All in all, this is a really fun game, and it is great for all to play.  Sometimes the camera would get a little funky, but it wasn't that bad.  Also, all of the bonus missions make this game last a long time, and the different stories add to the replay value.  A great addition to the sonic series!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2010"}

If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"clifford goldenberg","summary":"10 stars not 5 stars","reviewText":"In my opinion,Rogue Leader is the best GameCube launch title by far.I can't remember the last game that got my heart pumping like this one.My hands were even shaking after some missions,I guess it's the combination of classic Star Wars scenarios you go through all three movies here and an incredibly well designed,beautiful game.And it ain't no cakewalk,either.If your skills aren't up to snuff in any of the missions at least all but one exceptionally easy run near the end,anyway you'll definitely find yourself floating home.But despite the difficulty,it's almost impossible to put Rogue Leader down,and that's the sign of a truly great game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2001"}

{"product_name":"B004DI5H26","description":"","reviewerName":"pastapadre","summary":"Authenticity supreme but has some long-running issues","reviewText":"SCEA's MLB series has arguably been the most consistent sports franchise this generation. There is a reason why baseball gamers have flocked to it, and it isn't just because the competition has struggled so mightily. For MLB 11: The Show the introduction of new analog controls represented the most significant shift for the somewhat risk-adverse series in years.STRENGTHS-ANALOG PITCHINGOf the new analog controls it is the pitching that is far and away the best. There is quite a bit of control given to the user in both location and velocity that can be determined based on the movement of the stick. It is more fun than the just pressing buttons on the meter while not going as far as to make each pitch a \"process\" to complete with the stick.-ROAD TO THE SHOWCheck out full detailed impressions of Road to the Show. The performance based system is an immense improvement over the goal based system of previous years. That on its own makes the mode much more enjoyable and worth spending time with, despite the nagging issues of slow load times and out-of-place commentary.-VISUALSThe graphics are simply stunning, with amazing stadium lighting, well represented player faces, and improved player models. The authentic broadcast cameras look great and add an additional challenge to pitching. The one glaring flaw comes with the lack of collision detection which just stands out more and more in such a detail-oriented game as the rest of the visuals advance.-GAMEPLAY AND AUTHENTICITYOnce again this is the area that The Show always nails and why it is so popular with hardcore baseball fans and not just fans of baseball gaming. Though MLB 11 just builds on what was already present that doesn't change the fact that it represents the sport beautifully. The gameplay experience is realistic and reliable and the flow of the games just feels right.WEAKNESSES-ONLINE PLAYThough marginally improved online remains a weakness of the series. Connections are completely hit or miss resulting in either smooth games or ones that are crippled by lag. Regardless pitchers have a distinct advantage over batters. Just check out the leaderboard where even the top players hit under .200 and average 17+ strikeouts a game. The insistence of guess pitch being on in quick matches and league participation being prevented for two weeks after buying the game remain head-scratchers. Some very welcome options were added this year but until the performance is ironed out and better design decisions are made the online play for the series will not meet today's standards.-ANALOG FIELDING/THROWINGWhile the analog based pitching system is a complete success, and the analog hitting more polarizing, the analog throwing system is where the changes to controls falls short. Errors are frequent and in many cases the outcomes don't make much sense. Safe throws can go off line inexplicably or display as though they were risky throws and there is really no explanation of why it happens or how to handle the system efficiently.-AUDIOThe commentary has quickly become very tired and bringing in Eric Karros for Rex Hudler was replacing one bad contributor with another. While baseball game soundtracks are typically my favorite of all the sports the soundtrack for MLB 11 is one of the worst in recent memory.-LOAD TIMESHaving plagued the series for this entire generation the slow loading times can be frustrating. This is no more evident than in Road to the Show mode where just as much time could spent loading as in-game playing. It could be that the mostly static loading screens make the waits feel even worse than they are.SUMMARYMLB 11: The Show is one of the few sports games these days that consumers can feel confident they know what they are getting when they buy it. The game will accurately represent the sport, have top notch visuals, and provide a full feature set. Unfortunately where the series has struggled has been consistent as well. The analog controls at the very least breathed some new life into the series, and going forward it will do well to improve on overall presentation and online performance.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00005AV8W","description":"A dark shadow is spreading over the N64. Count Dracula has once again weakened the seals of his tomb, and the Belmont family is getting anxious.In the latest crusade against the forces of evil, players can choose between two brave vampire-slaying characters. Young Reinhardt Schneider, like his predecessors in the celebrated vampire-hunting Belmont family, will rely primarily on his whip. The other character is Carrie Fernandez, a young woman skilled in the ways of magic and spell-casting. Both are on the hunt for the dreaded Dracula and his devoted legions of vampires. You play a game all the way through with the character you've chosen, concluding with his or her own ending. Each character has an individual route to travel, and to see all of the areas you will have to complete the game using both characters.The passage of time and, especially, the fall of night, play a prominent role in the game. Players will have to search castles filled with dark corners, winding staircases, and other gloomy places. Daytime is the right time for exploring, but be on the lookout for vampires lurking in the shadows.Once the sun goes down, though, you should exercise extreme caution. When night falls, more creatures come out to play, and they become more aggressive as well. Some tasks are impossible to perform unless it is the correct time of day. A clock will allow players to calculate the time and plan their explorations accordingly.Konami has planted many cinematic sequences throughout the game. These scenes are surprisingly creepy, and may make you decide not to pick up your controller at night. Enemy characters are designed to terrify, ranging from the traditional horde of skeletons to half-woman, half-spider mutants. There are some gruesome bosses lurking in the darkness, as well. You will have to defeat Dracula in three different time periods, but don't expect the passage of time to improve his disposition.Reinhardt and Carrie will both have analog control, with different animation sequences for walking, jogging, and running. Reinhardt's whip works on a targeting system. When gruesome enemies are threatening, a green crosshair appears on the screen. If an enemy crawls, slithers, or slides within range of the whip, the target lets you know by turning red. The target automatically hovers over nearby enemies, so once it turns red you are guaranteed of a successful strike.Castlevaniahas 28 different areas to explore and four different special items at your disposal to fight the forces of evil. An eerie soundtrack tops off the package, creating a satisfying game that takes you on a unique adventure through spooky surroundings.","reviewerName":"E. Batica","summary":"Castlevania, still cool","reviewText":"Castlevania is what some of us gamers call an \"Addict Game\" because this game always had a grip on you in some sort of way. Some it's the gameplay, others it's the difficulty factor and for some it's just that this game was a classic and no Nintendo collection was complete without it.What got me hooked to this game was the difficulty of this game. There were no cheats and no passwords. None of that baby stuff. This game seriously took skill to win at. If you didn't have the skill to match this game's often \"cheap and cheater tactics\", you couldn't do it.I will say that this game was not impossible. I did beat this game a few times so that proves it. But even after that, I hit Reset and did it all over again. To this day, I still believe that many games after this took it's concept of Strategy to Win. After all, let's say it... defeating most of the standard enemies was not all that tough but when it came to the bosses and the board itself, then you really had to think.Again, if you have this one, you're Golden.

But, if you type in \"world war 2 video games\" you get a whopping 48 million results. What should this tell you? That the video game market is FLOODED with World War 2 games. So why should you or should you not pick this one? Well, let's start with the good.THE GOOD:Call of Duty has a user interface that is solid as tank steel! Your controls are pretty much the same as in most FPS's, actually a bit better, because I never had to remap any of my controls. The default controls were perfect right out of the box.Next is the save game system. The game saves automatically after every single major firefight and event in the game. You will probably NEVER have to go to the main menu mid-game, click Save, and type in a name for your saved game. The save points are on average about every 5 minutes or so, depending on the situation. But even BETTER, is when you quit the game and come back to it, you just simply press the \"Resume Game\" button on the main menu and you're back in action, right where you left off! Just 1 mouse click after loading the game!!!You get to play the game as the Americans, British, and the Russians. As a result, you fight all over the European theater, not just around Germany. The Russian levels are clearly inspired from \"Enemy at the Gates\" and the game does an outstanding job of recreating that environment.As for weapons, no matter what nationality you're playing as, you have grenades, a small pistol, a rifle and a machine gun. There are other weapons that are lying around, like anti-tank weapons and heavy machine guns or flak guns. Even tanks, in some later levels. The weapon variety is very balanced.There are some really huge firefights in this game, which means you get to kill as many Nazis as you can possibly dream of, but at the same time, expect to die ALOT!I had no clipping problems (something that DID happen to me often in Medal of Honor on my PS2). Like I say, this game is well put-together.Least of importance to me: Graphics. But the graphics are certainly very good.THE BAD:The major problem I see with this game is that it is not consistent. At times I get the feeling that this game is really trying to be a serious, realistic WWII game. BUT, at the same time, there are moments where this game just feels too much like I'm playing an arcade game.For example, the weapons, the enemies, the environments, the Germans shouting in German things like: \"Ich wiederhole, wir werden angegriffen!\", is all very convincing and realistic.But then there's the unrealistic side. You can't open doors (I'm still debating if this was a good game-concept idea or not, but in US Army urban warfare, they taught us to NEVER ignore a closed door. No, you go through EVERY door and EVERY room until the whole house is CLEAR.). You can't even climb objects you would think you should be able to climb. Once I tried jumping a small wooden fence. Nope. Had to use the gate. Oh please. I know I conquered obstacles tougher than that in Basic Training.Perhaps worst of all, is the inconsistency with objects. Even something as simple as a lightbulb, spotlight, or chattering radio, you are unable to destroy. So for those that love to blow out lightbulbs and play with in-game physics, this game is probably not for you.But then, there is the level where you can command a tank. And, wonder of wonders, sometimes if you shoot at a building, a huge chunk of wall will come off. Very rewarding, I must say, but, again, it'd be nice if all levels were this destructable by you and not just this one.Another object inconsistency experience: On the bridge map, I'm able to use the flak gun to take out a tank. The next level is an exact continuation of the next, same map and all, but for some reason, the flak gun doesn't work. Then on the next level, same map, the flak gun is suddenly interactive again.If you end a mission with an MP44 and a Kar98, you will start the next mission, which is a seamless continuation of the previous, with some default weapons and your trophy weapons from the previous level are . . . gone . . . MIA.Fixed weapons have infinite ammo and don't even overheat.You can beat Single player in about 10 hours, which is really short. I'm not rating this game on its multiplayer aspect because I haven't tried that yet.OVERALL:Yeah, I know. I make this game sound bad. But really, it IS a solid game, I'm just afraid that it doesn't push the FPS genre in any new directions, it doesn't do anything innovative. Please don't say that the \"blurry muted confusion state\" after a bomb goes off near you is revolutionary. It was done first in Medal of Honor. Nothing new. The only real new thing in this game is that you get to play a realistic Russian campaign. One thing I would love to see in a FPS is weapons that jam/malfunction. How's THAT for realism and innovation! Or a FPS that takes place in World War ONE!If you want a realistic, more open-ended FPS, try Operation Flashpoint. If you want innovation try Half-Life.

{"product_name":"B000HKP88C","reviewerName":"Dr. D","summary":"Horribly Frustrating....DON'T BUY!","reviewText":"I can't believe how many hours of my life I literally wasted playing this game.  60% of the game is based on completing the main storyline missions, and I got up to 51%.  The mission \"Paper Trail\" is THE most ridiculous mission ever in GTA history.  In that mission, you are supposed to take a helicopter and shoot down a target helicopter miles away with Little Jacob in the passenger seat.I can't tell you how many times I tried doing this mission, to the point where I'm about to write an official letter to Rockstar Games.  GTA MUST have a difficulty setting adjustment!!!!  No excuses.  How can you make a game with ridiculously frustrating missions towards the end of the main storyline without any difficulty adjustment whatsoever?  This is mindless and idiotic, to say the very least.I've had a lot of difficulty with some previous missions, and luckily, I got through those, but \"Paper Trail\" really puts the icing on the cake.  The other 40% of the game consists of side missions, which are worthless, in my opinion.  That's an even bigger waste of time!  And if you're one of those trophy-hunting nuts who needs to have every trophy in this game, then you've got no life at all.  Save your efforts on another game, not this one.As a result of all this, I'm happy to say that GTA 4 is now collecting dust on my shelf.  Early on in the game, I was heavily thinking about purchasing Episodes from Liberty City, but that's definitely not happening.  It gives me great pleasure that Rockstar Games will not be making $20 to $30 off me!I'm very glad that I got this game for free through Amazon promotional credits I've saved up, because I tell ya....I would not have spent any sort of currency on this title!!!  I haven't played Red Dead Redemption yet (which is on my shelf in the shrink wrap), but if it gives me the same amount of frustration, I will NEVER purchase a game featuring the \"golden R\" ever again.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-18-2011"}

It isn't scary in the least. There were some parts that seemed creepy, like those weird zombies that explode, but that is about it. There are some jump moments, but they are poorly done. I didn't jump because frankly I thought they were a little retarded. Certain zombies will pop out of places, and they will do it really fast, which is just stupid. How did that zombie just learn to move 8 million times faster? Then you get to meet those weird bug like creatures that are just plain stupid.The game feels good for the most part, if you go into it expecting little to no scares. I just go in and kill mostly everything with my shotgun, which is fun. As for puzzles... Unlike Resident Evil 2, this one seems to be a little more straight-forward. If you pick up a key, expect to use that key very soon. If you find some sort of weird device, go use that immediately. The switching system is relatively flawless. The only gripe with that is, you can either choose to have your partner waste bullets, or hold their fire. For some reason, they love shooting crows and such. But other than that, I'd say the game is fine.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2005"}

Essentially it was the game that made me aware that there was more to Square than Final Fantasy and made me a fan of all their work. That game was Secret of Mana. What I didn't know then was that it was actually the sequel to a GameBoy title Final Fantasy Adventure. The name change from Sword of Mana to Final Fantasy Adventure seemed to be solely to ensure strong sales. I never played the original but loved Secret of Mana so much that when Square announced that Sword of Mana would be remade with an unchanged title I was excited. Mainly because Secret of Mana was something of an amazing game, a perfect ten in every way for its era, and the follow-up, Legend of Mana... well... let's pretend we never suffered through that disaster. I had high hopes for Sword of Mana. Game play wise it plays a lot like Secret of Mana, thankfully, and it has an intriguing (albeit somewhat childish) storyline. I love the story behind the game, though it's disappointing that Square-Enix opted to rename the Shadow Knight &quot;Dark Lord&quot;. Its kind of hard to identify with the villain when they delve into his history and why he's doing what he's doing when he has such a sill name that screams &quot;bad guy&quot;... Even Dark Knight would have been a better name. This game also does what Legend of Mana didn't in that you can see where it ties to its sequel Secret of Mana. It's a blast to play.This game contains some of the best graphics I've seen for the GBA as well, although there are times where the frames rate seems to stutter a bit, but it doesn't hinder game play. The music isn't as memorable as other square efforts but it's not bad either. All in all this game makes me yearn for a remake of Secret of Mana for GBA... and lets also hope that we'll see the never domestically released Mana 3 for the system as well. With Square Enix fully supporting the GBA this system is set to rock the handheld market (which is already dominated by Nintendo anyway). But it is so nice to have Square back.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2004"}

Fallout 3 will always be in my mind as one of the greatest games of all time.  I sunk hours and hours into the game and its dlc.  I was so excited to hear about New Vegas.  More Fallout? Count me in.As I began playing it I felt right at home.  The game played just how I remembered it should.  I enjoyed the thought of exploring and new location and tackling more awesome quests.  I loved the new additions to the game as well like the greatly improved buddy system and the variety of ammo types you can put in your weapons.Unfortunately, how it's so familiar to its predecessor is also its greatest weakness. It felt too much like a giant expansion pack for me.  After playing the game for quite a few hours I started feeling like I had played the game before.  The game still looks the same.  Thats not a bad thing at all until you start running into the same glitches and bugs that the 3rd had.  There is still very stiff animations, slowdown, game lock ups and whatnot.  There werent any quest breaking bugs that occurred in my playthrough but the game just locking up on me made me too paranoid about saving the game and keeping a ton of them.  I guess I was just a little disappointed that nothing was really done to correct these issues or improve the visuals overall.Other than that, however, the game is still a joy to play.  The story is great and the quests are fun.  The improved buddy system I mentioned is probably my favorite addition to fallout.  Your companion is usually very competent when it comes to slaying your enemies and the best part is is that you reap the xp rewards whenever your companion kills something.  It makes it very much worthwhile to tag along with someone else and if you happen to find a dog in the world you can have the dog and your companion as well.  Theres a lot of killing to go around.The bottom line is if you enjoyed playing fallout 3 then definitely give this one a shot.  You'll have a great time with this one if you can still look past the abundant unfixed technical flaws from fallout 3.  If you didn't like fallout 3 then, first off, shame on you and this one will not convert you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0028ZNX68","reviewerName":"Raven A. Wind","summary":"A fun party game, even if it does cause hand cramps!","reviewText":"Disclaimer: This is not a review of the finished game, but a review of the demo version and the included turntable controller for the Xbox 360. The primary differences are that the demo controller is wired, and the demo game has only four different mixes (made up of ten different songs) to try out on each of the difficulty levels.First, the DJ Hero turntable controller is pretty cool. The turntable portion feels like a vinyl record, with plastic grooves cut into it, and the three buttons on it which work pretty much like you'd expect, in a manner similar to that of Guitar Hero, except that instead of strumming, you have the turntable for scratching. It moves freely, and works in any position. You can even set it up for left-handed play by just popping it apart and reversing the controls; A nice feature for all those lefties out there!The fade slider switch is also smooth and feels pretty sturdy. I'd have liked the center position to have a bit more \"click\" to it, as it's pretty easy to fly past center when you need it in the heat of the game. It does hold up to repeated play, though, and doesn't feel flimsy or cheap. You kinda want that in a party game controller.I was pleased to see the Euphoria button (Star power, basically) is big, round, easy to push, and lights up when you have the required stars to use it. It even flashes. Pretty cool stuff. I like it when buttons on the controller are interactive and give cues.The effects knob is also sturdy and easy to use. Spin it to switch effects like sirens, whistles, horns, etc. for your mixes.Finally, rounding out the controller is the recessed standard game console controls. In this case, that's Start, Back, A, B, X, Y, D-pad, and the Xbox center button, as well as what appears to be a headphone or mic jack. All buttons work great for controlling the game in menus, etc., but I wouldn't consider using them to play any other games. You won't be rocking out on Street Fighter II with this embedded d-pad.Now, as noted earlier, the controller for the demo version is wired. The final product hitting stores apparently will be wireless, and has space for some AA batteries. The wired version I'm using needs no batteries, and has great response, so I really can't offer any insight as to how accurate the game is with a wireless connection. However, I'm sure they made it pretty quick and accurate, as timing is what the game's about.The demo disc gave me a taste of the game, and to be honest, I'm a little disappointed with it. Oh, don't get me wrong! The GAME is pretty cool, but the demo disc is too short! How good, exactly, is the game, you ask? Well, from my short four-song peek into it, it's pretty fun. The game works just like any other timing-based \"Hero\" game. You press the buttons on the turntable when the part comes up on your screen. Sometimes, you scratch the record at the same time, and sometimes, you use the fader switch to change which record is playing in the mix. It all comes together very nicely, and the mixes are interesting. I'm sure this will be a hit at parties.The negative point of the game are that it really can cause some finger cramps. After a little while using my ring finger to scratch the record and press the button, it got a bit sore. The reason for this, I figure, is that the buttons are smooth and a bit slippery, and I found myself really needing to press hard to avoid my finger sliding off. I would have preferred they skipped the \"authentic\" vinyl feel on the buttons, and instead put some sort of rubber grip on them. I know that I'll be shopping for some finger-pads to stick to my DJ Hero controller if I plan to play it much.My only other complaint about the game itself is that I'm not a kid; I'm in my late 30s and a lot of the music doesn't impress me. I dig that that used some older tracks, but then become a bit annoyed when the cool Rick James music gives way to Gwen Stefani's inane garbage (I'm not a fan). Perhaps I'm more of a Guitar Hero guy, but I really can't picture getting into anything mixed with the Black Eyed Peas' songs, because I'm not very interested in cheap pop music. The music list is definitely aimed younger, and that takes away from a more universal appeal in my opinion.At least they picked some cool songs to mix with the lame ones, though.A final gripe, and one not related to my review score or the product itself, is that the demo kit leaves me in a bit of a jam. You see, now I have a DJ Hero controller and a demo disc I've played to death, but from what I've seen Activision isn't yet selling a version of DJ Hero without the turntable bundled in. They could have considered that people would get turntables outside of the bundle, and offered an option to purchase the game alone.My final assessment is that this is a fun rhythm game with a truly unique control scheme. I can see it being very popular with the dance music crowd, and the ability to hook up a Guitar Hero controller and play along means that the rockers can join in if they feel like it. I look forward to seeing what downloadable mixes they offer for this game; It has unlimited potential to provide new challenges if they're just creative with the mixes. The game & controller earn four stars from me, having lost a star because of the turntable's slippery surface providing me with a lovely cramp. Your mileage may vary.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-20-2009"}

{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"Mode7","summary":"No game in the past 5 years deserves a perfect score more...","reviewText":"From the very beginning this game will hook you in with its new formula of survival horror. Some say its more Action/Horror but I guarantee that you are trying to survive horros like: legions of villagers, gigantic bosses, monks, chainsaw wielding freaks, prisoners with claws that make Wolverine's seem imputent, and much much more than I will spoil here.The tosses out the old and brings in a new age of Survival Horror, the series has needed an overhaul for years! Purists will always whine about any change made, they would rather see a franchise run itself into the ground by repeating the same formula with a new coat of paint. But to re-invision a franchise and make it better is what keep players interested in buiying the games. CAPCOM is understandably excited about this game, and GameCube owners over the age of 17 should defintely buy it if they like gore, guns, and a challenge.In a way I find myself reminded of old-school CAPCOM action games, because the game is obviously a game for once instead of trying to mimic a too realistic model that isn't as fun to play. For instance there is this demon guy you can buy weapons and upgrades from found in different locations throughout the game. When you kill things, they leave behind ammo, heal items, or sell items. The end of each chapter sees a screen totalling your kills, hit percentage, and other stats that you can try to perfect. This is what gaming is all about people! It boils down to one of the best games ever made, and if you don't have a Cube (too bad) it will eventually be out for PS2 this fall/winter.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-25-2005"}

{"product_name":"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"Crayonmuffin","summary":"For GAMING use review","reviewText":"I received this as a Christmas present and have been using it now for a week of heavy use. I game A LOT. All kinds of games, all kinds of features needed in a mouse. We're talking gaming here. If you're looking at this most for multi purpose things including some side gaming, it'll be fine. But a few minor annoyances to point out.It's expensive. Getting it on sale softens the blow a bit but still. Worth the money? Maybe. It's built very solid with excellent materials. Looking at tear down videos, it uses high quality metal switches for it's primary buttons so they should last a long time but people have reported that similar switches start to go haywire after 6 months or so. I can't attest to this yet. The material on the sides is nice and rough for gripping it properly. The material on the top is fingerprint and oil resistant so if you get sweaty hands like I do when gaming for long periods then your hand won't stick to this mouse and it shouldn't need cleaned because of it.The wired/wireless options and stiff cable. This is HIGHLY subjective. I prefer to use only wired mice to prevent any mishaps while gaming or just using it period. I typically stay away from any wireless mice for that reason. The wireless with this one is insanely good however. So much so that you will probably forget that you're using a wireless mouse. Again I would prefer a mouse that is always connected and powered. But if wireless is something you want, then I can say that it works very well. THE CABLE THOUGH. The USB cable included for charging(or using wired mode) is absolutely horrid. For people that need to move the mouse fast and with precision, this cable will ruin you. Playing slow games that don't require faster movement should be fine. But if you insist on running this in wired mode you should replace the cable with a USB to Micro USB braided cable. Very cheap online.No weight customization. Common complaint. Some people don't care, I do. For this price point there should be weight customization. Not a huge deal though.The buttons. The buttons on the left side of the mouse where your thumb rests are very nice and easy to use if you wish with any grip style. The three buttons near where the index finger rests are slightly awkward however and take some getting used to if you want to use them at all. For MMOs this mouse should be fine for most users but if you insist on having a ton of things macro'd I'd look into a Naga or G600.Bottom line is it's a very nice mouse overall. I'm a bit OCD about certain features so I may have it returned for something else. If you're going for MMO heavy features, like I said a Naga 2014 edition or G600 are both very good choices for and insane amount of buttons. If you just need a few, this one will work fine. If you only need something for shooters or strategy games, I would look into something like the G400s or Steelseries Sensei(original or RAW). Both of those have superior sensors but lack of buttons and no wireless, which serious gamers don't care about.There are cheaper alternatives, and better ones. Overall good though.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-02-2014"}

It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Debra M.

Daneker","summary":"Excellent game, shoddy presentation","reviewText":"I first played Fable on the PC, not wanting any other X-Box game nor being able to afford a 360. I really enjoyed the PC version, but the mouse / keyboard combo was hard to get used to and master so when I finally got a 360 and Fable 2 (a vastly inferior game) I decided for under $10.00 to get this for XBOX, but, alas, it's not what I exepected.For one, the box claimes it's HDTV 480p, this, is a lie. Halo 2 is 480p for HDTV and it's stunning and 16:9 widescreen, just a beautitful presentation. This is 4:3 and the definition is definately 480i. The picture on my 42\" Sony is less than sharp and it's not the TV, the 480p 16:9 games for PS2 & Wii look great. I have the 360 through HDMI for optimum picture too. Also, it says DD, but I only get 2.1 not surround, though I can force DD 5.1 and get a surround-like sound.I really had hopes that this would look as good as Halo 2 since this is the third release of the game and it says \"HDTV 480p\" on the back, but it's not.Shame, the PC version is stunning, vibrant, crystal clear. I put it on the same TV through my computer's DVI output and it looks great, but really, the X-Box (or 360) should be the best way to  veiw / hear this game, and it's not. The really dropped the ball.Regardless, this game is 10x better than Fable 2. It's definately a must have for the Zelda action-RPG crowd. But, if you can, go for the PC version, it's vastly superior.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2009"}

Beautiful graphics and interesting gameplay. Brings a lot of new ideas to the genre, but barely develops them or makes them matter.THE LONG: Spending years in development, this game was touted as going to be the \"best RPG ever\". It is quite, quite NOT. It's a very fun game, and there's not a lot like it, as it brings a lot of new ideas into the genre. But a great deal of what it brings are ideas that wind up pretty shallow, and which don't affect the gameplay very much.Your quest is that of a young boy, whose village is burned to the ground and who joins the \"Hero Guild\" to build his skills for the inevitable day of revenge. The game was touted as giving you complete control of your destiny, with the choice of good and evil affecting everything you do. Well, you don't have much control over your destiny, and the choice of good and evil doesn't affect much of your eventual outcome. Like a lot of the features I read about pending release, these are interesting ideas that wound up being pretty shallow gameplay alterations and nothing that greatly changed the flow of the game.It's not all bad though by any means. Fable is plain fun, and it's worth playing through a couple times to see what can be done. The graphics are very pretty, and the dialogue is some of the funniest stuff I've seen in a game lately. It's fun and unique, just not as deep as I expected.For example, wandering in the game is extremely linear. The game is broken up into \"areas\" that take a couple minutes to wander around in, and then you walk through the gate into the next area (which takes a few seconds to load). There's no wandering off the beaten path into the woods except for the few instances where a hidden path is programmed. It's very linear, and allows for very little exploration.The whole \"destiny/choice\" thing that was the basis of the gameplay isn't very deep either. There are the basics, such as whether or not you choose to break windows and punch townspeople. And then there are the specific choices of whether you stop a bully from hitting a kid, or join him and hit the kid yourself. This is basically how you structure your character to be good or evil in this game. It should also be noted that becoming fully evil takes maybe a half hour of doing very bad things, yet you can completely turn around and become holy in maybe twice that time. It just isn't that deep.Destiny isn't much in your hands either. There's a specific plot that must be followed to finish the game, and the only variances along the way are whether you take the obvious evil or good path during individual quests (ward off bandits or join them, for example). It's fun, it's just that this stuff comes off as undeveloped and diversionary more than some great buffet of life-altering choices.Lastly, the game is pretty short. You can play through and finish it in around 15-30 hours, and that's considering a lot of screwing around. In a game broken up into linear areas that you walk through one by one, there's not much room for messing around. Aside from the main quests there are \"quest cards\" that you can accept at the guild, and take those on for cash and renown. You can boast about these quests and offer to do them with more skill than required (such as doing them in your underwear) which is one of the parts of the game that's still shallow yet does affect gameplay a little bit. Outside of this though, the only other stuff you can do as far as adventuring is to break the riddle of about a dozen talking doors who each have a somewhat special item within. Other than that, you'll be doing the story stuff or those quest cards (which your guildmaster incessantly pesters you about, along with everything else).But then here's where some of the positive stuff comes in: You can mold at least some of your character for amusing results. Your stat menu keeps track of a lot of stuff- how much you've had to drink, how many times you've had sex, what your sexual orientation is (you can shack up with men) and so on. It is interesting to have relationships and get into drinking contests and so forth. But like the rest of the game, this stuff hints at potential that was pretty undeveloped. There are only ever half a dozen different types of people to marry, they all say the same things, and marrying them doesn't really change much. It \"feels\" cool to do this stuff, but it doesn't really affect the game one way or another. In other words, like a lot in this game, you can skip it entirely and it wouldn't matter. Sure you'd be depriving yourself of some of the fun, but that's all it is, fun. It doesn't really add anything to your overall game besides a more \"fleshed out\" feeling.Fighting is cool at least. The system is much more solid than Morrowind for example (however that game gets almost everything else right). The combat has the right \"feel\" to it, while your character is swinging his sword, throwing off lightning, or shooting with a bow. There's lots of combat, and it's satisfying. Choosing your spells can be awkward, but the action itself feels right. You can switch between your three attack styles anytime, and fighting with any of them earns points to level-up those skills in a multitude of ways. Use more magic to unlockmore spells, use your bow to become more quick and sneaky, etc. It's this kind of stuff that makes the gameplay more thorough and involved, and this is what I would have liked to see more of.Lastly, the other positive stuff is interacting with people. As mentioned, everyone in this game is somewhat amusing with their cockney british accents and goofy dialogue. Throughout the game you win certain expressions and interactions, and can use them to mess around with townspeople. Become evil for example, and win the \"Vulgar (pelvic) Thrust\", which you can use to horribly disturb innocent children. Or you can earn the middle finger, which you can use to express disgust at a particular shopkeeper's prices. Being good earns you stuff more suited to wooing partners, such as manly poses and flirtations. But then along creeps another problem with the game- these interactions are amusing and provoke equally amusing reactions from people. But like everything else, it's pretty shallow. Nothing is actually accomplished by doing this, save for the romantic efforts. Give a finger, fart at your wife, it doesn't matter. They'll express their distaste and move on. Nothing changes. It's fun, but ultimately superfluous.Basically, that's it. The game touted freedom and choice, but restricts you to a linear quest and gives you very basic choices which don't affect much around you. The designers talked about letting you mold your character, yet took out the female option and gave you stuff to do that affects your stat screen and not much else. The biggest issue is the fact that, pure and simple, so much effort was spent making the game funny and pretty and unique that the game wound up being not very deep as a result.So why after all these complaints do I say it's such a fun and good game? because it actually is. While not really a \"faulty\" game, it's definitely a disappointing game. But that's only if you had any expectations. If not, then the game's solid engine and glitchless presentation is great when coupled with these little diversions that make it unique. As much of a letdown from the hype that it is, at the end of the day it IS enjoyable to screw around with the various options and character interactions. Once finished, you will remember Fable as a fun experience not similar to really any other RPG. But you'll still be left feeling that the game was loaded with superficial glamours and wasn't really long or deep. If you want a complex, free-roaming, epic triple-digit time questing and role-playing, then Morrowind is still the best bet for the Xbox (or any system, really). But if you want a lighter, funnier, and more glamorous (and MUCH shorter) role playing game, then Fable might be your thing. As another reviewer pointed out, he liked it because he had no expectations. Fun game, but not nearly as deep as you may have heard- so go into it not expecting anything revolutionary and you'll probably have a good time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2005"}

Smith \"otherthani\"","summary":"I Feel The Need...","reviewText":"Need for Speed: UndercoverI was extremely hesitant on purchasing this title with my great disappointment with their franchise and the \"Pro-Street\" title in the series. After some research, I found that the franchise went back to what they were good at and created an enjoyable experience for anyone looking for an arcade racing game.What makes this game so enjoyable is the variety of events. Story Races (to move the story forward), Circuit races (laps), checkpoint races (beat the clock), take the lead (stay ahead of other driver for specific period of time), damage to state (destroy police cars and enviornment), outrun (lose the cops).... just to name a few.If you are expecting true physics and accuracy in handling of a vehicle, this game is not for you. Thats not what NFS is about. As a matter a fact, its not entirely about racing. A huge draw of this game is messing with the police, causing damage and getting away.There is an open enviornment here, however, there is not much point to it, unless you want to cruise around or increase your wanted level outside of a race/mission. As a mattar of fact, you could complete the entire game without doing free roam a single time. A click of the button will pull up the map and you can simply click on the next event you would like to play (this is an improvement over the last burnout, where you had to drive to every single event, however this game should not be compared to burnout as it is a different experience altogether.There is also a story line... somewhere... in the background, but it will be easy to forget while playing. The only time you'll remember youre in a story is when the cut scenes come up.The vehicles themselves are a big part of the game and in certain races/missions you will win pink slips when you win races. When racing (outside of the storyline) you also have the chance to improve the overall specs on all the vehicles in your garage by \"dominating\" the race which is usually figured out by the time it takes you to complete it. You also earn money which allows you to go to your garage and add improvements to specific vehicles including horsepower, torque, handling, grip and even paint and decals.The graphics are ok and at times the game will \"hang\" for a second in the middle of a race which generally isnt detrimental, but can be distracting.I struggle between a 3 star rating and a 4 star rating for this game, as its not necissarily a ground breaking game or something you MUST BUY NOW. However the game is quite addictive which steers me more towards a 4 star.Ultimatly the choice is yours and I hope this review helps with your decision.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-22-2008"}

After the orb he has.I will not spoil the story anymore except to say that the Count of Castle Brennenberg in Prussia offersDaniel help and the rest of the story unfolds in the game through notes, journals, memos, flashbacks, etc.The game is played from a first person perspective, and is very dark, as it takes place in a castle at night timeand their is no electricity, only certain areas and rooms with pre-lit candles, torches and lanterns.The game has puzzles you must solve, though they are not that hard and most people can eventually solve themby using their heads.The game is indeed very tense, unnerving and scary, however monsters don't appear until the middle of the game.Some other points to keep in mind:Amnesia is a true survival horror game, no weapons similar to Silent Hill: Shattered Memories (I think).You cannot kill enemies/monsters, only hide from them in the dark or try and run from them and lose them.Lot's of exploration, this is not an action game but an adventure one.There are horrors/monsters in this game.The setting is scary, moody and tense as are the levels in the castle you'll be exploring.Great physics engine, your character can carry certain items like boxes and chairsand even stack them up or use them to block or stun monsters.Monsters can run fast and kill you in one or two swipes.You have a handheld lantern you eventually find, but it requires oil every so often to keep lit.In dark areas, you also have tinderboxes that can be used to light candles, fireplaces, torches,other lanterns, etc.Levels/rooms/areas are well designed and decorated even.Graphics are nice and detailed though very dark most of the time unless you are in a lighted areaor have oil for your lantern. Might have to turn up the brightness and gamma of the game and yourmonitor to boot.Sound and sound effects are great, scary and downright tense plus creepy too. Love the drum beats!Controls are good as is inventory management of items found and keeping track of notes, etc.Memo's sometimes give you hints of what to do next or what to do in general.Custom story's add life to the game, created by other users (Don't forget to download fromFractional Games the Justine expansion pack and also The Things in the Night from Doom2299,Markiplier on youtube also did an awesome 28 part video series of this custom story).Great story and characters in general (Look on Amnesia Wikia though spoilers abound btw).Does indeed remind me of certain horror movies and game (i.e. Hellrasier, Resident Evil, Silent Hill,and a few others, horror books included).All in all I give this game 5/5 stars for being somewhat original and it does indeed remind mea bit of Silent Hill plus Resident Evil and a few other games. I recommend strongly it.p.s. Play it at night, alone, in the dark with headphones on.For more info look on Amnesia: The Dark Descent TV Tropes page, GameFAQ'd andAmnesia:TDD Wikia as well as for reviews of this game from not only here but PC Gamer,IGN, GameSpot, etc.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2014"}

The AI regroup than -nothing they stand around.I found that I had to move ahead and get them moving and the leader says follow me.This happen to me twice on one play through where the game action completely stops until an action is done.This should never happen in a game. The action should keep flowing.If something needs doing than it's the game's job to point the player to the objective.This happens through out the game where the AI will stand there and the game play --stops.This takes me out of the experience.EX: There are levels that if your buddy dies by walking into the enemy, you fail and have to redo the level from the check point.There's limited ammo, weapons on the floor are not identified other than their shapes.No waypoints or maps means lots of backtracking to figure out what the game needs you to do.A couple time, I had to go to online video walkthroughs to see what was missed or as often the case, for me to discover.This brings me to the saves and check points.The time between checkpoints are to long and far between.I have to sit through cut scenes over and over because and I can't save after a long task.These comments are all related to my first \"casual\" level of play on single player campaign, which all that matters since online multiplayer lasts only as long as there's an available server to play on.I added a star because of it's age. Would have given it a 3-star.If the game had come out today, it wouldn't be so highly rated.It was heavily hyped by Microsoft and reviews were glowing with only a couple critics charging it had a flat story line and not innovating.It does have potential and may continue to play the series to see what happens.Games like GOW where the boss is a bullet sponge that requires the player to die over and over again before succeeding is the main reason gamers swear like they do. After ending the game, I didn't have a degree of satisfaction, I would have after playing titles like Mass Effect or Skyrim.I do notice that many have given the game 5-stars but admitted to not finishing the game or losing interest.A 5-star game would keep a player's interest to the end despite any bugs or crashes.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

{"product_name":"B004S5PBM0","description":"","reviewerName":"D. R. Jeanclerc \"Reader, Listener & Obsessive...","summary":"The Next Step in Music Games? Or a Legitimate Teaching Tool? Kinda Both, Kinda Neither.","reviewText":"At a time when most gamers believe that the music genre has already peaked (and waned), Ubisoft enters the fray promising the next step in the genre's evolution.  \"Rocksmith\" does so by allowing players to interface using a genuine six-string - electric or acoustic, right- or left-handed - any guitar provided it has a pickup and a 1/4\" jack.  The game comes with a 1/4\"-to-USB cable that permits direct connection to your console.  I have enjoyed the music game genre and decided to try this game in order to finally learn how to actually play guitar (I already can read music and play other instruments).  A few months in, I can say that while \"Rocksmith\" hasn't exactly taught me to play guitar, it definitely provided me with fun incentive to keep trying to teach myself.SETUPWhile doing some research on guitars, I found a lot of Internet chatter about Rocksmith that gave me concern, specifically about audio lag occurring in the most common home theater setups.  The game itself even includes a reference card recommending that you use separate connections for audio and video between your console and TV instead of the typical single HDMI cable that most people utilize.  I was dreading the possibility that the game wouldn't be playable with my current setup and I wasn't interested in recabling things just to play this game.  However, I was relieved to find that Rocksmith worked just fine out of the box with my setup with no additional tweaks or weird workarounds required (I have my console connected to my receiver and then to my TV both by HDMI cables alone).The included guitar cable worked as promised, although the short length and stiff feel will limit most guitar god flailing.  The cable does have a breakaway safeguard to prevent you from dragging your PS3 onto the floor in case you wander too far.PRESENTATIONThe on-screen demeanor of \"Rocksmith\" definitely sets itself apart from prior music games, although some players will find that this signals a lack of fun factor.  The entire perspective is first-person, so aside from the tabulature elements, the screen is just a performance club/arena background with some basic crowd members staring out at you.  You never see yourself so there's no customization aspects such as outfitting yourself with an outrageous rock star look.  All in all, these decisions were probably necessary to avoid over-cluttering the screen.  Ideally, this first-person perspective could be matched with Kinect to pick up your movements with the guitar - Ubisoft should put this on the list of Rocksmith II upgrades.Gameplay will be very familiar to anyone who has played Guitar Hero or Rock Band, with a stream of notes waterfalling top-to-bottom.  However, the addition of the horizontal fretboard makes the familiar suddenly convoluted and confusing.  The biggest problem is the three-dimensional look that Ubisoft opted to use - it makes the intersection of the strings and fretboard visually contradictory to what your ears are hearing.  Also, some basic elements of playing guitar like open strings and chords (I told you they were basic) are really confusing on-screen.  There should be a pause function when chords first start appearing, because they can be an eyeful.  Once you begin memorizing tracks and get accustomed to playing by ear, gameplay becomes much more enjoyable.  This is a pretty serious indictment of the interface.On the plus side, the setup and usage of the game left-handed is seamless.  So for all the southpaws who have been told to settle for holding their guitar upside-down because they wouldn't be able to find a teacher or even tabulature, \"Rocksmith\" gives you hope (aside from the ridiculous markup on left-handed guitars, but that's another story).A minor annoyance is that you need to keep a PS3 controller handy for all navigation (and there's a lot of button pressing in this regard).  Honestly, the game is smart enough to tell what strings you're picking - why not go with a scheme like \"E for OK, A for Cancel\"?GAMEPLAYThe fundamental identity of any music game is its setlist.  \"Rocksmith\" does a good job of mixing classic rock with more contemporary tracks, generally keeping the entire menu on the immediately-recognizable side.  But by the time you complete the game, it feels a little brief overall.  They have already released a small number of downloadable add-on tracks; hopefully, this level of ongoing support will continue.One of the best-implemented innovations in \"Rocksmith\" is its variable difficulty that shifts up and down on-the-fly based on your performance. If you get a good string of notes going, the game starts moving you closer toward actually playing the song's full tabulature; however, hit some clunkers and it smoothly drops you back to a more comfortable skill level.Beyond the career path, \"Rocksmith\" provides a palette of preset pedal effects to use, so you can also use the game to simply play your own selections with a whole host of tonal options through your home theater sound system.  There are also a number of timing and/or accuracy minigames in the \"Guitarcade\", many of which are enjoyable ways to work on your fretwork.There it multiplayer, but not online.  Note that the other player would have to have their own special cable to connect to the console.CONCLUSIONUltimately, you're not learning to play music - rather, you're playing a Guitar Hero/Rock Band-style game with a controller that some will find more trouble than it's worth.  You never have to tune a plastic guitar, the strings don't break, and they generally cost a lot less.  To go through the expense and work of getting set up to play this game and still not learn to truly play guitar is a potential letdown.  However, if you are already knowledgeable about music and are looking for a way to self-teach guitar through immersion, then \"Rocksmith\" might be the option for you.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000MK694E","description":"Take2 Games BioShock 21962 PC Games","reviewerName":"Terry Mesnard","summary":"Would you kindly play this game?","reviewText":"How's this for a story?  A man becomes annoyed with the current world, a world where the great are taken for granted and told that their toils are either for the people, for God or for the government.  In response, he creates a fantastic environment, free from all of these turmoils.  A place where all the great men and women of the world can create their own inventions without fear of consequence.  In this place, men and women could do what they wanted.If this sounds like Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged, you'd be correct.  However, in this particular case, it's also the background story behind Rapture, the under-water city that takes centerplace in Bioshock.  Many words have been bandied about about video games and their ability (or inability) to become art; you have folks like Roger Ebert saying the medium as a whole can never attain that goal.  My personal thought that was that, as a medium, games haven't made enough strides toward that lofty goal.  But Bioshock certainly takes a huge step forward.Andrew Ryan is a visionary the likes of which his namesake Ayn Rand would possibly write about in Atlas Shrugged.  He exemplifies the qualities of a Randian hero and showcases Rand's philosophy of objectivism.  He created the city of Rapture and filled it, much like John Galt in Atlas Shrugged, with the visionaries of his land.  Rapture soon was a thriving city that emphasized science and growth and the importance of the individual.  They dabbled in creating plasmids that changed a person's DNA, enabling them to do feats the likes of which had never been seen before.Then something happened.Flying over the Atlantic sea, you are Jack, a person who was destined for greatness, if you ask his parents, and whose plane is now crashing into the sea.  Jack is apparently the only survivor of the plane wreck and swims to a lone building, a light house it seems, that beckons him onward.  Eventually, he goes into a blathysphere and enters into the world of Rapture.  But this isn't the Rapture originally envisioned in the pre-recorded film he watches as he journeys into the city.  It is a city comprised of deadly machines, once-human monstrosities named Splicers who are insane and, of course, the Big Daddies and Little Sisters.Bioshock concerns itself with the gray area between right and wrong.  This dichotomy between right and right is what fuels everything in Rapture.  Roaming the landscape, the Little Sisters are twisted abominations of little girls who locate corpses (which they call \"Angels\") and harvest Adam from them with a long needle.  More grotesque is that bottle at the other end of the needle that the Little Sisters drink from.  Dutifully following them are the Big Daddies, giant brutes in ancient diving gear.  These...things...are at the heart of the story and Jack's survival depends on them and whether he can harvest the Little Sisters or set them free.The conscience of the gamer is represented in two mysterious figures, Atlas (another allusion to Rand) and Dr. Tenenbaum.  Atlas seemingly wants Jack to save his family and explains that the Little Sisters are anything but the human girls they appear.  He nudges Jack to put them out of their misery and take the Adam they harvest so he can survive and save Atlas and his family.  On the other shoulder perches Tenenbaum, another mysterious individual who created the Little Sisters and seems to want to do anything possible to save them.  They are the obvious angel and devil sitting on Jack's shoulder, but the question is...which one is the angel?To go into further detail would be to spoil this amazing story.  Along the route, twists and turns abound with moral, ethical and philosophical questions aplenty. What's interesting is the way Bioshock presents a stark opposition to Ayn Rand's philosophy of Objectivism.  Rand's heroes always contain the same qualities that Andrew Ryan exemplifies.  But here, the artists behind Bioshock seem to be questioning these qualities by presenting a situation so familiar to Atlas Shrugged, and yet, so far removed.It is literate, thoughtful, disturbing and moving.  Even if the gameplay didn't live up to the story, Bioshock would be worthy just for this reason.Luckily, that's not the case.  For the gun hungry, sure, Rapture is filled with guns aplenty and even presents opportunities for you to craft your own upgrades.  But that is just scratching the surface.  Everything goes back to the story.  Plasmids are located across the ruined debris of Rapture and contain the keys to recreating your DNA.  Some early examples of Plasmids are the ability to shoot electricity from your hands to being able to set things on fire to telekinesis.But these plasmids aren't only used for fighting.  Minor puzzle-solving crops up, some of which require plasmids in the same way as gear in Legend of Zelda.  The biggest puzzle is how to take down the game's variety of enemies.  While you can definitely charge in, guns blazing and sometimes survive, cases will present themselves where such tactics will end with you on the bad end of the Big Daddies' drill.  Instead, you can create your own traps and war zones.  Using plasmids, the environment and, of course, your weapons, you can create elaborate traps that will bring a smile to your face.A lot of games coming out right now that use the Unreal 3 engine don't look as spectacular as they could.  In particular, character models tend to look shiny and/or completely ugly.  This is not the case with Bioshock.  Everything comes together, from the disturbing scenery, the art deco architecture to the the insane creatures and characters populating the world.Shadows and lighting also create a sense of atmosphere that drips heavily, much like the water pouring down the walls.  It's stunning.  The only complaint (and it is minor) is that the frozen portions you can melt don't look very convincing.  When things melt, they don't leave anything behind.  The only reason it sticks out is that the rest of the game is absolutely beautiful and amazingly crafted.None of this would be as effective, though, without superior sound.  And Bioshock has that (mostly) in spades.  The voice work is stunning throughout and the actors provide a great sense of dread.  The audio diaries do an exemplary job of providing the backstory, but also work the best in crafting dread and terror.  Some of the most disturbing things occur listening to them.  Unfortunately, sometimes the characters' lines are repeated too often, ruining the disturbing nature of their dialogue.Musically, the game is also amazing.  It flits into the picture at key moments, increasing the tension before it will flow away.  You might not even notice it's there, but that's why it's so good.You know, the funny thing about hype is how people react to it.  Game journalists can go blue in the face trying to get people interested in forgotten gems such as Psychonauts, Beyond Good & Evil and Stranger's Wrath, and since they weren't financially successful they become these gems.  When a game sells incredibly well and is hyped to the max (both of which fit Bioshock), people say \"over-rated.\"Ignore the hype machine.  I know you're tired of hearing about it.  But give Bioshock a try, if you haven't yet.  Download the demo for your PC or try it on Xbox Live.  It is a game that's definitely worth everything that's been said about it and more.It is art.  And no words by ignorant movie critics will change that.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2008"}
{"product_name":"B002I090AG","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason the rational Sony fan \"Dark Overlord of...","summary":"A great buy even if you do not like 3D!","reviewText":"I just picked up my Aqua Blue 3DS and I am very pleased. The 3DS is not perfect by any means but I do think that it is a fine system so far. As I write this some features like Netflix are not available so I may come back and update this review when I can test these features out for myself.The system feels comfortable to hold in my hands. The size isn't too far off from the DSi. The color has a sort of metallic look to it that is very classy though I do wish that Nintendo had given us more colors to choose from. There will undoubtedly be more colors to choose from in the future though. The color isn't exactly an aqua blue, it is more of a bluish-green.The question that most of you probably have is whether or not the 3D effect works. Yes, it does but it will take some getting used to. Keep in mind that the 3D visuals depend on the system's camera to track your head and so you will need to look at the system from a specific point for the best results in 3D. It isn't that hard to keep your head in that spot but you may need some time to get used to this. The 3DS provides a glimpse into an actual game world so you are not just looking at 3D graphics, you can actually move the system and your view changes accordingly. For example, your character in the game may step into an in-game room and you can physically move your 3DS to the right and your view will shift as you move the system. It's a lot of fun and one of the included mini games will actually have you moving around your desk or kitchen table in order to look into a hole from the right angle.At first your eyes might feel a little buggy after playing with the 3D effects. That is normal but you should get used to it after a few plays. You can also adjust the intensity of the 3D effect with a little slider on the right side of the system and you can even do this in the middle of the game. I personally like the 3D effect to be a little under half power. That gives a nice bit of depth but the effect isn't overpowering. If you do not care for the 3D effects then you can simply turn that feature off and you still have a powerful little handheld system. This is good for people who do not enjoy 3D movies as they will still be able to play games on this system.In addition to the new 3DS games the system can play the older DS and DSi games already out there. In a couple of months Nintendo will be revealing an online shop where you can buy and download some of the original Gameboy and Gameboy Color games optimized for the 3D screen. This effectively means that the 3DS already has a library of thousands of games even before we get into the 3DS games. The 3DS does have some flash memory for storing downloaded games but you will probably want to use the SD memory card slot and store your games on your memory card.The 3DS does come with a 2GB SD card for saves and there are some applications already on it so you will have something to play right out of the box. There is a game where you can take pictures of yourself, your spouse, your pets or almost anything and attach the photos to flying enemies which you must then defeat. There is also a game that uses special paper cards. You put one of these cards on the table and look at it through the 3DS. You will see fun things happen like a hole open up in your table where a creature comes out and attack you or you can try another card to see characters pop up. Here is a tip, try downloading these cards from Nintendo's website and print them out on large sheets of paper. The size of the characters that come out are proportional to the size of the paper. A group of people in Japan strung together a massive square and made an avatar the size of a building!Did you know that you can set your 3DS to sleep mode and it will communicate with other 3DS systems? Let's say that you are on your lunch break from work and you head to the deli with your 3Ds in your messenger bag. The system will find other systems and communicate with them. If you have a game such as Street Fighter 4 there will even be a mini-battle and if you win you will win rewards.  The 3DS also has a pedometer so if you walk with it the system will track your footsteps and reward you with virtual coins you can use in certain applications.Is the 3DS worth $249? I think so because of all the existing games that can be played on it and Nintendo handhelds are always very well supported with a healthy game library. It will very likely be at least two years before Nintendo updates the 3DS hardware and I certainly do not want to wait that long to play these games. Even if 3D video games are just a fad the 3DS will still play great games in regular 2D graphics and I anticipate that this system will have a great run just like its predecessors.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-27-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000FRU1UM","reviewerName":"Sir Edmund Hillary \"Tenzing Norgay\"","summary":"Not The Greatest in the Franchise","reviewText":"I want to start off by saying that I am a huge GTA fan, but could not give GTA IV a 5. If Amazon would let me rate it a 4.5 I would. However, as it stands, the title is closer to a 4 than a 5 star rating. It is far from the perfect game all the developer-lap-dog review sites gave it. San Andreas to me still reigns as the most fun sandbox game of all time.Everyone has already heard how great this game is and how it is the first true real next-gen game. This is only the case for a few attributes. There are some \"old-gen\" functionalities that could have been dramatically tranformed to next-gen, but were not.Graphics - For the scale of what was accomplished, the graphics are high quality. However, pop-is just as bad, if not worse than San Andreas - at least on the XBOX 360. This can be forgiven as the game does exhibit groundbreaking detail.Sound - Voice acting and environment sounds are truly second to none. However, the sound tracks are not up to GTA standards. In fact, San Andreas and even the PSP's Vice City Stories track lists are superior to the one in IV.Game-play - The shooting and driving mechanics are superb. I like the fact that vehicle controls are less \"arcadey\". Shooting functionality is visceral and satisfying. However, I cannot believe Rockstar made virtually no improvement to the game-saving mechanic. Yes, you can redo a mission if you fail it, but it still brings the player to the beginning of the mission sans the cut scene. Also, it will strip you of your armor if you lost it and any ammo utilized, as well as money spent on a hospital visit if you died. Therefore, most people will just redo the mission from the very beginning just like we did 7 years ago in GTA III. That is quite lame, very \"old-gen\", and definitely takes away from overall game quality. It is like having a Ferrari Enzo, but have a govenor keeping under 55mph. That's I felt at times playing this game.Fun -As far pure fun, San Andreas is just so much better. Parachuting, stunting in the mountains with various off-road vehicles, the absurd and funny missions, various airplanes to fly, and that netherworld feel that is omnipresent in every GTA game sans IV makes it the best. CJ was also a tougher and more enjoyable protagonist (or antagonist depending on your opinion) to play than Niko Belic. I will say that Niko is more likeable than Tommy Vercetti or No Name.Conclusion - There is no denying the GTA IV is an epic production. It should be purchased and played to completion. You will enjoy a mostly positive game-playing experience. However, San Andreas remains Rockstar's finest opus and one of the greatest games ever produced. In the future GTA V could be a true perfect 10 if they refine the GTA IV engine, significantly improve the save mechanic, and bring back the awesome sound tracks.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-02-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SYLRK","description":"","reviewerName":"andy","summary":"Brilliant, at times, but far too often feels like work","reviewText":"One of the most frustrating games I've played. When it works it is brilliant and exhilarating; far too often, though, it feels simply like work. A chore.This is largely due to the fact that most side missions serve no purpose other than time filler (sea missions being the exception and the true high point of the game), and to the variable glitchy, twitchy controls--seems that at key moments the designers decided to slightly alter the control command for no apparent reason, and you end up failing full synchronization. Or in a final boss battle when suddenly you have to learn an entirely new control command scheme to succeed.At any rate, when i finished this game it was with no sense of joy or accomplishment--  just a grim determination to finish something I started. In other words, work.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2013"}

That's all the positive things I can say about this game.The battle system is kinda like \"Trails in the Sky\", but much slower and simpler.The frequent switch between \"Enemy Phase\" and \"Ally Phase\" is very annoying.Some mechanics are frustrating.  In \"Trails in the Sky\", you just click on an enemy.  The character will move close to an enemy and attack.

{"product_name":"B000059Z7G","description":"When longtime Sega mascot Sonic the Hedgehog made his debut on the Dreamcast console inSonic Adventure, gamers were stunned. Sega had not only used the game to show off the tremendous possibilities of the then-new hardware, but they had reinvigorated the platform-style arcade adventure genre with massive, intricate levels, gleefully distracting minigames, and even a new kind of virtual pet, called a Chao, that could be combined with other pets, traded with friends, and even exchanged over the Internet.Sonic Adventure 2ups the ante of its predecessor with all-new puzzles and levels, and even faster action reminiscent of the early Genesis-era games. Knuckles and Tails are back, as are the Chao pets (who can now talk!).","reviewerName":"ffootballguru27","summary":"The Best Sonic game ever!","reviewText":"With my purchase of my Dreamcast I also bought the game Sonic Adventure. I have to say Sonic Adventure 2 is a huge improvement over Sonic Adventure and doesn't have as many flaws.Sonic is mistaken for an evil Hedgehog named Shadow who has been spreading danger across the world. The military and all police units are after Sonic and you need to escape Sonic from them and avoid them in many of the levels.There are many fun modes you can play in: Story Mode, Kart Mode and Chao Raising Mode. Story mode is the main game. You can choose to play as the Hero's (Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles) or the Dark villains (Shadow, Rogue and Dr. Robotnik).Kart mode is just like Mario Kart games for the Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64. You unlock Kart racing after you complete the first 9 stages. You can play in one player or two player and race as Sonic, Knuckles, Tails, Amy, Shadow or Rogue in 3 different courses.Raising a Chao can be frustrating sometimes, but it is also fun. You teach your Chao to do new things while being nice to it, but trying not to spoil it. This mode gets old after a while though.The levels in this game are amazing. Each level includes different missions that get more challenging as you get deeper in to the game. The graphics are very realistic and when the spins and jumps Sonic does look very smooth. The gameplay is a lot better than Sonic Adventure.Sonic also has new abilities to grind on rails, and swing form vines and bars. And there is also a newer helper Chao named OmoChao who gives you hints in each level.Sonic Adventure 2 is loaded with secrets to unlock. If you get All 'A' rankings in each of the levels many great secrets are unlocked. Also, getting all 180 emblems is very rewarding. There are many other secrets to unlock as well.There are only two minor flaws in this game. The camera angles don't always show the direction you want to see and you can't play just as one character like you could in SA1.Overall this is my favorite Sonic game ever and the best Dreamcast game that I have ever played. Sadly, it is the last Sonic game to be on a Sega console.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-19-2002"}

{"product_name":"B0050SYV70","description":"","reviewerName":"JSiph","summary":"All the Tatau will be yours.","reviewText":"Story:- Far Cry 3 is an open-world survival first-person shooter with the options for stealth or straightforward combat. Stealth rewards more than the straightforward approach. The story is about a group of college age adults that are vacationing on Rook Island and when they go skydiving, they land in pirate(powered by a drug lord) territory. Everyone gets captured, split up, and held across the vast island. Jason Brody (the protagonist or you) and his brother breakout using your brother's military skills. The drug lord's pirate leader kills your brother and begs you to run (he's crazy, but he's one of my favorite villains) as his pirates chase you into the jungle. Pirates aren't the only thing you have to look out for, the wildlife has pretty much every dangerous exotic animal on it, and they want you dead just as much as the next pirate.- The story is very immersive and the atmosphere creates actual panic in me (especially during the kill 3 tigers with the bow and arrow mission) as you can't escape danger and running into wild creatures or pirates.Pros:- Excellent gameplay and story, it feels like you are playing Call of Duty on live when you are liberating outposts. The story also has it's twists- Has a variety of types of missions, so you can choose if you want to hunt something, save your friends, race medicine to a friend, etc.- The leveling system for unlocking combat techniques or passive perks is executed nicely- This being a Ubisoft game, it takes some ideals from the Assassin's Creed series, such as the enemy alert system (so you know if you have been seen) and the stealth combat.- The characters are very memorable and realistic (Vaas, the main villain's right hand man, is one of the best villains ever)- The atmosphere and environment are quite unique.- The graphics are super realistic, the main characters were modeled after actual people and it's hard to tell the difference. Normally, I don't comment about the graphics unless they are unique in their own way because it's a video game, not a movie. The graphics are seriously out of this world and makes the game a beautifully dangerous place.Cons:- It's such a massive game that after a while, it can get rather repetitive(should you find yourself in this predicament, take a break and play a different game for a while and start back up again. The controls are the same as most FPS, so it is easy to pick back up).- I felt that they could have done more with the upgrading the rucksacks, but I can understand that it is more realistic to have reasonable limit on what you can carry.- Insane amount of collectibles, don't even bother. (I don't mind collectibles if they are used to progress further in the game, like in Banjo Kazooie. These don't offer anything except for the Lost Letters, for those who wish to learn about the island during WWII, and a measly sum of Gamer Points.)Other:- I got 750G on one playthrough on hard. I even bother with the collectible achievements because playing the game was so much more fun. I believe 160G that I didn't get were a part of the Co-Op story which I didn't do.- The DLC missions don't offer much except for the Monkey See, Monkey Boom missions. You meet an interesting character (he's worth it though).Buy this game if you:- Like Call of Duty games.- Want a truly unique and beautiful experience.- Enjoy fast paced action.Don't buy this game if:- It is over $50 (I doubt it will ever get back up over $50, with this still being sold in retail stores towards the end of Xbox 360, but should it go back up there in 10 years... Buy it, you won't regret it).I can't really think of a reason why you shouldn't buy it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-03-2013"}

Be advised this game is not for children or hyper religious types as there is lots of cursing and the Lord God's name is taken in vain about once in every ten seconds sometimes more.  The controls are a bit unresponsive but still far better than many games at this price point.  That said for adults the game is awesome.  The cut scenes tend to be longish and sometimes come one right after another.  The cut scenes do help tell the story but they also place you in tactical situations upon ending.  You are NOT a LONEWOLF in Spec Ops: The Line you are in command of two rather gung-ho operatives who take risks I would not.  I tend toward conservative tactics and the game assumes everyone is willing to run into fire and do truly heroic things.  If you use conservative tactics you will find yourself having to rescue your team mates because; they take so many risks.  The speedy knife killers were the most fun since it felt like they were on crack since they ran up to you really fast and tried to slit your throat unexpectedly.  Spec Ops: The Line has some of the best explosion scenes ever.  Spec Ops: The Line tries to be an open world sandbox game but in reality it is a lite procedural game with sandbox shooter micro-environments that you are hearded through.  I found shooting a gattling gun from a helicopter in this game to be extreme fun.  The Dubai cityscape was very nice and the inside of many of these buildings were expertly done.  A nice thing about Spec Ops: The Line is like Mass Effect 3 your decisions in many ways shape the unfolding of the story line.  You get different trophies depending on decisions you make in game.  The Spec Ops: The Line story does not change too much based on your decisions but it does change.The characters are rather fully fleshed out, colorful and larger than life.  Spec Ops: The Line game itself is not exactly easy to play but; I can't exactly say it was hard to play on the easiest mode.  There is one boss battle near the end of the game where you must storm a heavily defended fortress that gave me good bit of trouble but, that just made my eventual victory much sweeter.  Best of all Spec Ops: The Line never ever glitched on my PS3 system and I played through it twice.  there was no lag or screen painting issues.  There were no screen artifact or positioning issues.  While they are too gung-ho you get to really end up liking your squad mates.  I tend to be hard on video games as a guy with cerebral palsy but there is almost nothing to hate about Spec Ops: The Line and I won't make up issues where none exist.  I completely enjoyed Spec Ops: The Line from chapter one till the end.  Spec Ops: The Line was what a good video game should be it was fun from first shot till last.  If all video games were good as Spec Ops: The Line, I'd have a lot less money to spend on other things! LOL!  My only gripe about Spec Ops: The Line is it was too darned short.  If this game were three times longer with download content I would have gladly paid more to buy it!  I guess liking this game is politically incorrect but, hell I like it anyway and won't lie about it!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-04-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0000DJX7I","description":"Praised for brilliant scripts and open-ended gameplay, vilified for unapologetic violence and mature themes,Grand Theft Autohas deservedly become one of the most popular game franchises in history. This double pack contains the full versions of bothGrand Theft Auto IIIandGrand Theft Auto III: Vice City, enhanced for Xbox. Xbox gamers can rejoice that the grand king of video games--The Sopranoswith a gamepad--is finally available on the big black box.Grand Theft AutoWithGrand Theft Auto IIIRockstar proves that not all developers are concerned with toning down the violence in their games. This sequel is even more bloody, violent, and sadistic than its popular predecessors, offering up an enormous 3-D city in which nearly any criminal act is possible. Players are free to steal cars, beat up the local population for their money (or weapons), make time with prostitutes, or simply roam to their heart's content. Those seeking more structure can embark on dozens of missions driven by a genuinely interesting crime-story plot or steal cars that let them play minigames. Nab a cop car and you can go on vigilante missions. Grab a cab and you can play a deadly version ofCrazy Taxi. Take a fire truck and you can earn money putting out fires. The minigames are a good way to unwind after a particularly difficult mission. With so much to do, the game just never gets boring.As you'd expect, there are consequences for criminality. As your random acts of mayhem mount up the police start hounding you, eventually calling in SWAT trucks, the FBI, and even the army if you continue down the path of destruction. Shaking these pursuers is easily the most fun part of the game, especially when a bunch of friends are packed in the room to witness your narrow escapes.Grand Theft Auto IIIis fine-tuned to near perfection in every category. All the vehicles, from slick sports cars to lumbering dump trucks, handle exactly as you'd expect and smash apart realistically when abused. The three islands in the game are rendered in terrific detail considering their size, and are packed with traffic, pedestrians, and hidden jumps. The audio is equally amazing. Pedestrians talk, cops scream at you, and you can tune in nine different radio stations whenever you are in a car. It all adds up to a monumental achievement: the rare console game for adults that manages to get everything right.--T. Byrl BakerGrand Theft Auto III: Vice CityHow big is this game? Even publicists for other games end up talking aboutVice Citywhen they call our office, babbling in the same helplessly intoxicated way that afflicts everyone who plays it. The achievement ofVice City(which, as everyone knows by now, is set in the 1980s and offers an all-new, Miami Vice-inspired story) is not only that it manages to live up to an absurd level of expectation, but that it takes the game places that fans of its predecessorGrand Theft Auto IIInever dreamed of, and that it achieves this astonishing level of innovation without losing anything that madeGTA3the bestselling PS2 game of all time.After a brilliant homage to the era of the Commodore 64 in the opening credits, the first thing you'll notice is the improved graphics, which are smoother and more detailed, and--with effects like neon lights reflected on rain-slick streets, and intense Florida sunlight--have a lush, tropical look that immediately gives you a strong sense of place. The architecture is more fabulous by tenfold, with art deco buildings, high-rise hotels, and believably seedy back alleys. The control scheme is essentially the same as inGTA3, but the cars handle much better, and in pedestrian mode there is a new crouch move. You will have access to fast, great-handling cars right away, as opposed toGTA3which made you unlock the second island before you could get your hands on any respectable wheels. This game has such riches to offer that there is no need to be chintzy with the vehicles.Cops are more vigilant this time--minor offenses like whacking innocent bystanders will more often than not get you a two-star wanted level--and are harder to elude (though they still can't seem to climb stairs or negotiate sharp turns). So while free-roaming exploration is as fun as ever, there is more incentive to perform the missions instead of randomly raising hell. Not that that's a bad thing: even lazy criminals like myself (inGTA3, I would rather toss hand grenades into traffic than follow orders from some rude Mafia boss) will be quickly caught up in the vivid characters and hilarious, fascinating story, in which you play an acid-washed-jeans-wearing thug named Tommy Vercetti. Where inGTA3missions were blocky, schematic affairs only nominally connected to the story, this time tasks move the story briskly along and deftly blend cinematics and game action. For example, there is a scene of a character throwing Tommy a gun, at which point you are suddenly thrown back into the action and must make an instant decision about whom to trust and what to do.There are more, and more detailed, indoor environments, including a hotel, police station, and mall (a slight downside to this is that some of the more elaborate indoor environments require load times). The layout of the city, with tons of backyards, narrow alleys, and fire escapes, encourages creativity when eluding pursuit, as does greater access to rooftops. Get your motorcycle up the fire escape and a whole new world of action is possible, including... well, use your imagination.This overview barely scratches the surface of theVice Cityexperience, its colorful explosion of music, clothes, combat, and brilliant voice acting, not to mention the plot twist midway through the game that changes the very nature of the game itself. Though it was the outrageous, amoral violence that got all the press, the essential genius ofGTA3was its intoxicating blend of script and open-ended action. InVice Citythis is--to use a clich&#xE9; that is for once apropos--taken to a whole new level.--David StoeszPros:Open-ended gameplay; player can chose to be relatively law-abiding or engage in wanton virtual destructionVaried missionsBrilliant scripts with Hollywood voice actingRocking sound track (also available in our Music store)Xbox-enhanced graphicsCons:As theThe Sopranosof games,GTA 3draws unwanted attention from overzealous legislatorsNo multiplayer","reviewerName":"Squee!! \"The world is very dark\"","summary":"GRAND GAME!!!!!!!!","reviewText":"Me and my cousin and my friend rented Vice City from Blockbuster, and it was AWESOME! The graphics are by far the best for PS2 and the sound is perfect, same as the music (which fits right into the 80's theme of the game). You drive around in other people's cars, which you can take right off a parking lot or you can go into traffic and throw someone out of their car and drive it. There are also BIKES that you can ride on, although they are a little bit harder to control than the cars. The cars are very detailed and accurate. They are just plain awesome, and you never get bored of driving around different cars and bikes. There are tons of cheats like all weapons, spawn a rhino tank, have civilians fight each other, change your character, drive on water, lower your wanted level, and much much more. There are a good variety of weapons to choose from, like a sword and a shotgun and a sniper, pistol, rocket launcher, and others. When you kill someone you might get some money, or you can help the community by driving an ambulance to the hospital to earn some extra cash. The violence is a little shocking at first, but you will be desensitized by the first hour or so. This game is definitely not for the toddlers or even anyone under 13, because among the violence there is language, cop killing, and other stuff. When you get the cops really mad they might send helicopters or the FBI or even the army after you. The gameplay never gets boring (me and my cousin played it for five hours straight without even knowing that we were playing that long) and the game successfully places you in the shoes of a dirty criminal. The only thing wrong that I noticed is the texture of the land, but that wasn't so bad because you don't really notice it.Overall wonderful fun game, but not for the little children.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-29-2004"}

This is definately a great system to own, if you do not already own a PS3 of course. Not only is it a great next gen revolutionized gaming device, it is also a Blu-Ray Player to boot. So, for 299.99, you get a game player and if that's not your thing you get a Blu-Ray player than can go live and always get the latest firmware for future Blu-Ray Releases.Pros: Slimmer, Lighter, all the stuff they mentioned. It is quieter, uses less energy and places well in your already prevelant entertainment system area. Its sleek design makes it fit in well asthestically and just adds to the overall experience.Cons: Still not backwards compatible, still just 2 usb ports and now you have to buy a stand in order to stand the unit up verically.Overall: A great product with a new low price and sleek design that is well worth its wait in gold.Misc: Sony has a propensity to release consoles and then couples years later release the slimmer, thinner version.

This is one hell of a firefight. If you are a fan of tight controls combat, where it the victory is purely based on skills and survivability this is the one for you. Great game that would still hold its value if it was a full console release. Every level ratchets up the combat a notch with new enemies, weapons unlock. It never feels the same. But the level design is where it shines, no convoluted levels or floods of re spawning enemies.  It is great for replaying and get better scores, your score is the money that you can use to unlock more fancier weapons.  It also encourages different play styles and load outs every time you re-try the levels.The developer has been great with support and fixes. Now that they have announced that MP will have bots and will extend the life of the game by a lot. It is simply a awesome game that every one should try. Great graphics, well designed levels, good re-playbality... great work CG Cambridge.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0000657SP","description":"Resident Evil, the game that is often credited with starting the survival-horror genre, is being reinvented for the GameCube. For those unfamiliar with the series, a mysterious corporation has secretly been performing ungodly biotech experiments in the sleepy little town of Raccoon City. When reports of gory attacks come in from nearby areas, two crack military squads are sent to investigate. Players take the role of either sharpshooter Chris Redfield or demolitions expert Jill Valentine to track down the source of the town's problems--specifically, something in a decaying mansion that's mutating animals into grotesque killers and turning humans into bloodthirsty zombies. Supplies and ammunition are scarce, so players have to know when to fight, when to run, and how to keep their wits about them. Players can't afford to waste their shots and expect their characters to survive.The story is being retrofitted with motion-captured animation, next-generation graphics, real-time lighting and shadow effects, new areas, and newly rendered in-game video segments to create an even more cinematic experience. Also, a redesigned combat system lets players attack and defend themselves with a variety of items found in the environment.","reviewerName":"Jobe","summary":"Best Game on Gamecube","reviewText":"It's like the consecutive re-releases of the Star Wars trilogy. First they came to video, digitally re-mastered, then they came to theatres as special editions, which is basically what you could call Resident Evil for Gamecube, a special edition on a much grander scale. Here, much more useful than the too soon release of Resident Evil: Directors Cut for the Playstation that fell victim to the all too familiar \"too soon-too little\" that we've seen with multiple sequels and others alike only offering bland costumes and a few minor dull additions; we have a new game to play with, above the minor additions of Code Veronica X and others.Now before we begin I still stand by my statement that Resident Evil is now just a marketing franchise that has lost its roots, lost its scares, and nearly lost everything that made it once a brilliant series (As I mentioned in my Silent Hill 2 review). All of the sequels are in many ways very entertaining and definitely worth a look for all gamers (Resident Evil: Nemesis became my surprise game of 1999). But standing alone, none of them matched the original, despite its dated graphics shallow replay, it still is one of the five best Playstation games ever.And why may you ask? It would be my same comparisons used in Silent Hill 2. It's all about the setting, neither the police station, city streets or island can compare to the eeriness of the infamous mansion, its seclusion in the dark misty woods, its many secrets and hidden rooms where unknown horrors lurk. So yes, in the end it may seem like Resident Evil for Gamecube may seem like nothing more than a quick buck idea cooked up during a board meeting at Capcom. But Resident Evil proves not only the great standing stature of the originals setting and characters but even surpasses the fabled prodigy by adding a few tricks of its own to an already great game.To start things off, all of the old puzzles have been changed, outraged to some perhaps since it most likely will require some to look up a strategy guide to solve half of the puzzles, some of which are quite the mindbender. An easy moves no doubt, but adds immensely to the new feel of Resident Evil being no puzzle here will be solved easily. Also thrown in for good measures is dozens of side areas previously unseen, most notable is the Guest House that lies on a forest path from the mansion where a new monster lies, I won't give away what it is, but it provides that nervousness that Nemesis created knowing it could pop up any moment. As for the veteran creatures, the usual Resident Evil line-up is here, the zombies return but with a few new additions. Zombies now must be incapacitated by either burning their bodies or blowing their heads off completely. If players fail to dispose of them they eventually will come back to life and move as fast as hunters and also attack relentlessly and require even more bullets to bring down once more. Asides from the zombies, all the old trouble-makers are here dogs, spiders, hunters, Plant 42, and of course the Tyrant.Defence Items are now available now from daggers to tazer's, if characters are being attacked by zombies they can be thrown off by jamming a knife into their heads or for Chris shoving a flash grenade in their mouths then shooting it completely wiping an enemy out, giving players a moment to regain themselves and get their distance. The differences though subtle to some, are a must for long time fans of Resident Evil. For those looking for a reason to own a Gamecube and those Resident Evil fans who always drool for more, this is your golden ticket.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2002"}

It is being critizied because it is shorter than the original, but that seems to be the norm now. I think it improves on the original in almost every way: graphics, AI, stealth sequences, action sequences, and skill points. It just isn't as revolutionary as the original, so it doesn't get 5 stars.It also has a few other problems that keep it from getting 5 stars:1. there are some parts where going in guns blazing is your only option, this wouldn't be such a problem if you didn't have skill points. But it is really hard to take on a hoard of ninjas when you have put all your skill points into stealth, it also seems that you HAVE to put some points in your armor skill and health skill to even beat the game.2.The siberia mission: it wasn't bad, it just wasn't excellent, it got better as you get to the end of it3. respawning guards, this doesn't seem much of a big deal to me as it did to the people in the forum.

{"product_name":"B00006418I","description":"Wouldn't it be nice to play games without a cord stretching across your  living-room floor, especially if you have little kids or large dogs in your  household? Nintendo's Wave Bird isn't the first wireless controller ever brought  to market, but it's a whole lot better than what came before. You may remember a  brief fad a few years ago with spotty infrared devices. These units failed  because they were a lot heavier than standard controllers, and also because they  required a direct line of sight between the controller and the infrared  receiver. The Wave Bird is much lighter (it weighs a bit more than a regular  controller) and uses radio frequency signals for reliable game control at  distances of up to 20 feet. Unless your playing on a stadium-size TV screen,  that should be more than enough. The unit will last for about 100 hours of use  on just two AA batteries and has 16 channel frequencies, so you'll easily be  able to hook up four controllers without interference.","reviewerName":"Carlos Santiago","summary":"Excellent control, one tiny flaw","reviewText":"This controller is definitely worth the price.  It frees up a lot of space by eliminating those long, easy twisting and tangling control cables, it's light, and it handles great.The controller includes a small base that connects to any of the four GameCube ports.  It also includes two AA batteries that go in the wireless controller.There's a small rotating dial with 16 channels on both the controller and the base for purposes of identifying the device in use.  If you have more than one controller, the dial must be set to a different channel on each controller and base to avoid interference.  Practical jokes can be made by setting two controllers on the same channel (picture someone else hiding in the room and controlling your Mario while you are fighting Bowser, fun eh?) but I don't want to give any ideas.The maximum signal range is about 20 feet.  You don't need to point the controller to the base like with a remote control.  You can play and twist and jump with the control at any angle you wish as long as it is within range.The only small flaw I found was the lack of a rumble feature by design.  You just won't have that feature because Nintendo wants to save precious battery life.  Me, I would have included a rumble feature.  Current batteries last longer and are cheaper, and watching the pace at which technology evolves, we may have better batteries any time.Try it out and I know you'll soon put away the original controller.Recommended.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2003"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Matthew Wiltshire","summary":"Horrible overcompensating AI, tapering story, and tedious sandbox elements destroy what seemed like a promising game","reviewText":"I really tried to like this game. At the beginning, this game looked so promising and amazingly good. I am generally easy to please, but there were too many fundamental flaws that bothered me significantly.The most egregious flaw is the terribly overcompensating poor AI. I could snipe a guard from 200m away and it barely misses the enemy yet fifteen enemies in an entire compound know EXACTLY where I am immediately after the miss (with a silencer no less!). I&#8217;ve played plenty of stealth games before, but the mechanics in this one are one of the worst because it significantly hampers the stealth aspects.Farcy 3 is mostly a sandbox game. It is fun at first, but many elements like finding relics are tacked on. Overtaking enemy compounds are wildly fun at first, but quickly become tedious.The game is kind of split into two parts. The meat of the story is in the first half. I found no reason to play the second half as the story tapers off significantly, and the difficulty skyrockets to laughable heights. This left me very little reason to keep going.Everything about the weapons is top notch. Their looks, feel, and use are one of the best of any shooter. This was one of the best aspects of the game.Although somewhat unimportant, another head-scratcher was the wild animals that deplete your health way too easily. Getting attacked by a komodo dragon is worse than getting a point black bullet by an AK47. Additionally, falling from very short heights took away a lot of health.The game seems like the graphics should be good. They are very pretty if not moving. I  had an insanely bad framerate/screen tearing problem that was far and away the worst of any PS3 game I&#8217;ve played this gen. It was almost unplayable.The game is mostly good, but the bad parts are really bad in my opinion. The premise was amazing, but the execution was mediocre.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-13-2014"}
{"product_name":"B00064MUIA","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Nintendo's DS: A two-sided, two-screened innovator","reviewText":"The Nintendo DS is one of the most unique little pieces of hardware I've ever seen, held, or played with. Nintendo went the right way in terms of innovation with their newest handheld. It's easy to hold, easy to play with, and easy to have fun with. The essential change in gameplay and design is the insertion of touch-screen and stylus control as well as a second normal screen.The two screens have high-resolution graphics for crisp, clear gameplay. The DS can play both DS-only games as well as Game Boy Advance titles. The high-res screen works wonders on the sprites and pixels of Game Boy Advance titles. DS games themselves look great, and even the ugliest of titles (like Madden NFL 2006) look like early Playstation or Nintendo 64 games. Alongside the pretty graphics are improved stereo-sound speakers and impressive wireless capabilities.The games for the Nintendo DS started out relatively slowly, and until the end of this summer, there were only a few games worth buying. Super Mario 64 DS, Feel the Magic XX/XY, and Warioware Touched were a few examples. It wasn't until I played games like Kirby: Canvas Curse, Meteos, Nintendogs, Advance Wars: Dual Strike, Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow, and Mario Kart DS came out that the DS overpowered the PSP in my eyes. In terms of games and the way they're played, the DS outplays and outlasts the PSP in every way besides visuals and audio quality, which is superior on the Sony handheld.Overall, the Nintendo DS gives players a much more interesting experience than ever before. I don't like comparing the Nintendo DS to the Sony PSP because I enjoy playing both, but it seems to be a necessary trend to do so. In conclusion, the Nintendo DS gives gamers a much more hands-on approach to gaming and for that I'd say that it is almost as good as the PSP, if not better.I work at a Gamestop store and when anyone asks me for a recommendation, I basically say that the DS is a new way to play old favorites and innovative new technologies while the PSP is one of the coolest gadgets ever created. You can find a fun time with both, but the DS just gives you a different method of doing so.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2005"}

Decent remake of a classic game,","reviewText":"DKC for the SNES was the first game I ever played, and it has always been one of my favorites. Released in 1994, it breathed new light into the SNES console with its breathtaking graphics and fun gameplay. It was remade for the GBC later on, and now it's for the GBA. How does it compare to the SNES?If you're reading this review, I assume that you've played it for the SNES already, so I'll talk more about the differences between the GBA and SNES version. All the levels are intact, but some levels on worlds have been swapped. Not only that, but the maps are different (as well as in 2 and 3, which I dislike. Also the bosses have a few differences as well. For instance, Queen B shields herself with Zingers after being hit, and now to defeat Dumb Drum, you have to throw TNT barrels at him as well as killing the enemies he makes. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Also the graphics, sounds, and music are super inferior to the SNES version, even though GBA is supposed to be a better system.They have also added minigames and such. Instead of saving, (which you can do anytime, which I don't like) Candy's is used to play a rhythm game. Funky's, besides being able to  visit previous worlds, is also used for a fishing game. Also when you beat the game, you can play Hero Mode, where you play as Diddy. There are also pictures to collect as well, but they are kind of pointless.Overall, it's an okay remake, but instead of putting all this extra crap into this game, Rare should have made the graphics and sound a whole lot better, because it doesn't feel like the original DKC.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2009"}

I've accepted the limited library at launch is iffy but with Ryse, Peggle 2, Dead Rising, PowerGolf, and that Max game that you can download from the store, I think I'll have plenty of play till the Spring and so will you. Games will pop up weekly in the store, so consider that too if you think there truly is nothing to play.I'm liking the launch apps that you can download with XBOX1 already.  My favorite download so far is Peggle 2. One of the most addicting games I've ever played, and it's only on XBOX One!  The golf game you can download is a tribute or shall I say reminiscent of Hot Shots Golf and was actually very impressed how fun it was. So don't think there aren't nice exclusives on this thing! Ryse and Dead Rising IMO are must have buys too. Was very nice to see my youtube there and interested in the things that can be done with the kinect video and skype. Netflix, a nice music app and the movie app that was on the 360 is also intact. I have not tried these yet.Doesn't seem to just be a focus on games like the PS4 clearly wants, but it's a good 2nd system for me for sure. I really like the controllers and Microsoft has PS4's dual shock # for comfort, I could go to bed with these things! haha. I recommend getting the rechargable battery for 24 bucks or so and you'll save money on batteries over the years.  I love the XBOX1 dashboard. It's streamlined, and I love the things you can do with your voice. The ease of navigation is streamlined so much too, I like what they did. I'm interested in what the next wave of games can do, both in gameplay, depth and of course graphics. I think both systems probably haven't been pushed even close to their limits yet. My only downer as with the ps4, I can't play my old games on the XBOX1.  I got 8 years of a library from my 360 built up and I can't play a single game on it. Not to mention all my games I downloaded on XBOX Live. That would had been the supreme icing on the cake, and would have def had this system on launch. But if you're like me and need your old games, just hold on to your 360 a bit longer. Spring looks to have a very nice lineup games coming if you're wanting to wait a bit.Nonetheless, looking forward to the future of this system's offerings.Beloved franchises I want to see pushed are games from the Elder Scrolls, maybe a new next gen Red Dead redemption and a truly deep exclusive first person shooter that really is out to really show us true next gen gameplay.

You have never felt the need to leave your village and the rumors of returning dragons and marauding monsters rarely trouble your ears or your dreams.One day you are going about your daily routine when you see the sky darken and the ground is shaken by explosions and the landing of a massive beast on the beach.  You see Quina fall and without thinking you rush in and urge her onto safety. With the raging dragon raining destruction down on the only home you have ever known you decide that any action is better than nothing.

With your fading vision you see the dragon lumbering toward you for what you assume is the final blow.  Instead the dragon reaches down with its claw and you feel like your chest is on fire as you see what appears to be your heart floating out of your body and into the creature's mouth.Sometime later you awake in your home.  You could believe it was all a dream except for the massive scar that is on your chest and the strange vision you had of the dragon challenging the Arisen, you, to find him and defeat him if you can.Your quest begins with only questions.  Why were you chosen to challenge the dragon? What are the Arisen?  If you are a savior, why does the king treat you more like a villain? What will it take to be free of the dragons curse?You will find answers to these questions and more during your journey.

If you beat the game you'll get why this is interesting.Also it is easy to miss bits of the story if you are not paying attention. My best suggestion is to talk to everyone and check the message boards to make sure that your not missing out on any extra story missions. This is especially true of escort missions as they seem to pop up randomly and disappear after moderate amount of time.  If you miss enough or do not do enough missions the story may seem to be a little thin and the end game may seem a little vague as the game fills in come choices for you here and there.The story in the expansion is self contained and is somewhat interesting. By the time I got to that section I was ready to move on to another game so I did not finish it.  I can say that it ties into the ending of the main game as it asks the question of what would happen if a Arisen asked for what it would take to end the cycle and was given the power to do so... except that would have meant destroying what he cared for the most.Graphics:To me they looked good. Apparently by installing the Dark Arisen content you get access to the HD texture pack which makes everything look a lot better.  The game overall looks good and there are a lot of details in the characters and the environments.  While not up to Skyrim or Call of Duty standards, they do the job.Game Play:This part is a little tricky. The game works well enough, it just does not always explain things very well.  So if you don't mind playing around to figure out how exactly it all works then it wont be a problem. If on the other hand you like everything explained then you may get frustrated.This version of the game addresses a couple of major complaints with the original.  There is now a version of fast travel in the game where you can set your own fast travel points. Unfortunately there is still a lot walking around to get from a to b as you are not given very many warp crystals to place, not to mention the fact that you actually have to walk to where your going to begin with. This isnt as much of a problem as the game goes on though. The next issue that was improved was the save system as the auto save was made more frequent and an ability to save from the pause screen was added by hitting the back button. This does save time as there is not as much menu digging.There is also a Dark Souls like multi-player function in this game in the form of pawns that your character can summon.  I can't really say much about it as I was playing this game way after its release, but is is kind of neat as you can summon up to two characters that other players have created and have them fight with you. When you rest your pawn information is sent to the server for others to use, if they chose your pawn to fight they can chose to send it back with a gift if they like the character you created Or if you don't want to use the online functionality the game creates random pawns that you can summon as well.Conclusion:This is a huge game that does have a lot to offer and if you like wandering around, finding secrets, and taking down giant monster's Ico style then this might be a game to check out.  Just make sure you pick up the Dark Arisen because it does smooth over a lot of the rough edges from the original. m.a.c","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-12-2014"}

Hears why. Imagine being surrounded by four guards, and they are closing in.  In most games you'd be screwed in a position like this, but not in Enter the Matrix.  One guard comes in to grab you but with a front kick and an upper cut you easily take him out.  Two other guards charge in, but you take down one with a flurry of punches, and you grab the other guard and throw him into a wall, knocking him out.  The last guard runs in quickly and try's to kick you but you run up the adjacent wall land behind him a crack his Neck with one stroke.  Oh yeha and you did all this with only using three buttons.  Now do you see why I am hooked?  But sadly there is a bad part.  First off the graphics Suck. They're not as bad as an N64 game but they come close at times. Second off there is a friggin save screen about every two minutes, if you are lucky maybe five minutes. Last off the game does not have the best replay value; sure the fighting kicks ass, and it is addicting, but the story is farley boring, and you may not want to sit through it again.  One other thing I'm wondering about is why are there so many guns.  There are four different types of pistols yet they all do the same thing.  But in a happier note, Enter the Matrix is a good game, being able to play as two Characters (Niobe, Ghost) is cool and the driving parts our ok but you may want to rent this game first.  The game is very addicting for the first couple of days but after that it will become an average game in your gaming library.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-20-2003"}

I played it for a couple of days and put it up until just last month. I decided to play it again and I am hooked. I just didn't give it much time to catch my interest but I can honestly say that I am sorry I didn't. This is the deepest game I have ever played. I have 35 hours into it and it is going on strong. I had read that there is about 400 hours of gameplay if you play all the side quests, and if you have Live, there is a good deal of downloadable content to add even more game time. I can honestly say that this is one game that warrants buying the game guide to help you through. The graphics are simply beautiful. I can see why this took over 5 years to create. There is such a variety of landscapes to see. You will travel through the forests, through ruins, town and villages. You will go underground in caverns, catacombs and tunnels. You will fight everything from bandits, thugs, warriors to ghosts, skeletons, trolls, vampires and a variety of wildlife such as bears, wolves, lions. You can go on many side quests and enter guilds. You also travel to Oblivion, which is like traveling to hell. I am only touching the surface here. There is simply too much to try to describe here in this summary. You have to put thought into everything you do but not so much that it drags the game down with too much responsibility. I still have a long ways to go before I complete the game but just what I have done has been a lot of fun. It is probably the closest game I have ever played that can pull me to that world, much like reading a good book and getting yourself lost in it. There is really too much game here for a rental. It may honestly take many months to beat this game. Enjoy it and remember that the further you get into the game, the more fun it becomes. Enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2006"}

I have always complained bitterly that they bought the NFL and ESPN licences and never used them properly. If yo don't believe me, then check my past Madden reviews. After almost 5 iterations on the 360, EA finally sees the light and has produced a good quality game.Control - You play one Madden, you have played them all nothing new here.Graphics - Stadiums are rendered nicely as always with great lighting...a little more attention has been paid to the helmet reflections, however most of the faces on the players look busted as always.Sound - a big improvement on the overall crowd sound as now you can hear individual voices call out during the game....something 2K series  has done for years.  On the other hand the commentary from Hammond and Collinsworth still sounds (and uses lines) from last year with some of the phrases that repeats  (especially the one about the WRs catching the balls in pitch black) but again, I will take this over ESPN radio any day!Presentation- Kind of a mixed bag but I am liking it more than I hate it. While EA finally gave you a feel like you are watching the game with all of the nice cutaways to the crowd and facts...a few things still needed to be fixed in order for this to be the complete game that 2K5 is.- Halftime show improvements  - Ok ok...yeah we finally got one but how about doing a Chris Berman-esque voice over as the best plays are being replayed...worse yet how about all of the highlights are out of order?- The pregame show - Thank you for putting it in!!! But guess what EA!! Another 2K5 steal that you dropped the ball on! When showing highlights from other games...SHOW.HIGHLIGHTS.FROM.OTHER.GAMES. if a 6 year old game can show you 1 or 2 plays from another game or even from my own, then you guys should be able to do it too!  Also get rid of Alex...I am sure there are more people male or female that can act as if they are in the game better than her!- I do like the fact that the AI is more active in signing players and making sensible signings, nothing like going thru a whole season and seeing the free agency just be static.- Ahhh yeah!! before I forget, the tackling animations look a lot more realistic and so far I have seen 4 5 and 6 man tackles. Slightly glitchy in a few spots but otherwise it's a step forward.- Franchise mode has improved with team actually signing some players that were needed instead of going a whole season with many free agents just sitting static on the FA wire. Also you can't really rob the AI out of trades and draft picks as in earlier versionsSome of the little things that I have seen that makes the game a little more worthwhile:- the chain gang- refs getting run over- refs meeting and confirming the TD- players being carted off after an injury- so far 3 different crowd screens- coaches arguing with refs about penalties- players clowning around on the sidelines.- better crowd reaction to plays** Added **Gameplay- To ME...gameplay hasn't changed all that much as far as AI and skill, you are either good at this game or you suck...just my opinion- There are more varied player animations this time around and thankfully so far not a lot of repeat animations although as perviously mentioned you may get a really funky animation glitch but not so bad as to crash the game- Accuracy of the stats... it depends on how YOU play the game and the time that you set it for.- Is there a lot of gang tackling? NO...every tackle is NOT a gamg tackle but you do tend to see more defenders play towards whomever has the ball. It does look more realistic.- Fight for the Fumble...i have only had it occur exactly 2 times...cheap...and arcadey and I believe actually, you can turn it off.- In game ticker: Nothing makes you play a little harder than seeing how well other teams are doing throughout the course of your game...it's till not here EA...fix this!!!So, really this isn't the year to be skeptical. It's improved a lot over the last 2 iterations but still has a few more steps now to go before it completely makes me forget about 2K5.And actually, when all is said and done, it's really sad when you still can compare a new football game with a game that is 6 years old and last gen.On a larger scale of 1 to 10 I would give this an 8.Addenum: Buying cheats?  EA...bad move...Will I have to buy Michael Vick too?","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-14-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000R0URCE","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"Repetitive, but Fun","reviewText":"When it comes to Star Wars, you could say it has its own genre in the video game market.  There are some games that are good such as Lego Star Wars or Star Wars Battlefront.  There are also some questionable ones like Master of Teras Kasi or the adaptation of The Phantom Menace. Star Wars: The Force Unleashed falls in between.  It is by no means a bad game, but it hardly lives up to the expectations it has set for itself.The Force Unleashed focuses on Vader's apprentice.  On the surface, The Force Unleashed has a good story, complete with production values.  The story itself it well done and well presented with some well done cinematics that, for the most part, have some pretty good voice acting.  It doesn't always sore, it falls flat in some scenes, but it's by no means horrible.  Along those lines, the story is just all around absorbing.  If you're a huge Star Wars fan, you'll more than likely love the storyline here.Once we get to the gameplay, that's where the game begins to hit a low point.  There are many things you can do in The Force Unleashed.  You can grab objects with the force and thrusts them at your enemies (or lift your enemies and throw them at other enemies).  You've also got a force push and force lightning as well.  For the most part, though, you'll more than likely be running around swinging your lightsaber.  Unfortunately, this is where the game gets a little boring.  While you can string together lots of combos and you can go crazy on hordes of enemies at one time, it gets repetitive really fast, and force powers are exciting for only so long.If the game were harder it would probably be easy to overlook the repetitive nature.  You won't find much of a challenge in the game.  Not even from the bosses.  On the other hand, the bosses are some of the most exciting moments in the game.  Fighting some of the games bosses provides a lot of depth that you don't get from fighting normal enemies.  While you'll be able to take them out in virtually the same fashion, there's actually a little bit of strategy involved to defeating them.  Outside of that, however, the game feels like a button mashing affair in many respects.  The game also isn't that long.  At most you can probably knock it out in a day or two.Graphically, The Force Unleashed is a good looking game.  The environments and textures are good looking, as are the cutscenes.  Despite that, some environments are still pretty basic looking.  Smooth textures don't keep some of the areas from being repetitive in design.  There are also a couple of graphical hitches, however.  When you may find environments clipping or you may find that not everything runs that smoothly.  It's a good looking game, but some of those hitches might be bothersome.  Musically, it is no surprise that it sounds phenomenal.  The music score is pulled directly from the movies with a few new tunes added in that sound absolutely brilliant.  It's good stuff.The Force Unleashed is not the best of the Star Wars games, but it's still fairly entertaining and fun.  There are times when you may wish for a bit more variety in the game and for it to be a bit broader, but the storyline is rewarding enough to warrant a play through for die-hard Star Wars fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"GTA V:  Quite simply, the best open world game ever made","reviewText":"After putting a good 20 hours into this game, and playing with all 3 main characters, to include both main quests, side quests, and other random events, I'm ready to put my thoughts down digitally.With a series like GTA, it's amazing to see the evolution, from the original top-down games (GTA1, GTA2) to GTA III, which set the stage and standard initially for open world gaming, followed by the 80's love fest that was GTA: Vice City, their take on LA (GTA: San Andreas), and finally releasing GTA IV on next gen systems.Taking everything they have learned, Rockstar Games/Take Two spared no expense to bring LA to life once again, with this map being bigger than GTA: San Andreas, Red Dead Redemption and GTA IV COMBINED.  But it takes more than space.  The entire game is alive.  Go into the mountains, you see coyotes and elk, and the ambient sounds, while not to Red Dead Redemption levels, is still striking.  Go into the city and it's ALIVE (unlike GTA IV).  Pedestrian language, traffic, the general city noise and conversations all immerse you to the point where you're wondering if you're really in a game and not in LA instead!For the first time ever in the series, GTA V has 3 main characters:  Franklin, Michael and Trevor, all from different backgrounds, all with awesome stories and enough banter/hijinks to make each one fun to play in their own right.  There are things they do better than the other (Franklin, driving, Michael, stealth, Trevor, weapons), BUT they can all be maxed out if you take the time to do so.  Need more stamina?  Run, bike or swim.  Stealth too low?  Crouch and do silent takedowns.  Some of this was introduced as part of GTA:  San Andreas, and GTA V has simply expanded on this concept.The controls are tight, you can adjust the aiming from easy to hard (depending on the challenge you prefer), the cars all feel different, especially when you get up to the sports ones, and this is the best driving GTA in the series.  And you WILL be doing a lot of that, no fast travel.  Still have to drive to those destinations, though the GPS makes that a snap.One of the biggest additions to GTA V is the checkpoint system.  Much the bain and frustration of GTA players are those missions you get 15-20 minutes into, fail, and have to drive 10-15 minutes to get back to the start.  Now, some \"purists\" might not like this, but the fact your progress gets checkpointed (and, for those that REALLY get stuck, the game allows you to advance to the next checkpoint after failing 3 times in a row, which I reached on about 3-4 missions, some because I was being stupid, and others because I couldn't figure out the right path) and that simply put makes the game more accessable.All of the other staples of past GTA's (strip clubs, tattoos, buying property & businesses, etc) also are present in the game.Now, one VERY important word of warning.  This game has pervasive language THROUGHOUT, as well as some over-the-top violence and one scene/mission in particular that will make even adults squirm.  I don't care how mature you think your kids are, DO NOT LET THEM PLAY THIS GAME if they are not 18!!!  This isn't like Vice City where, up to the last mission, you *might* have had 3-4 swear words.  This is, right from the get-go, a full on assault & barrage.  (In fact, I counted 45 swear words in the first 20 minutes of gameplay!).  While I believe LA definitely is not the \"City of Angels\" in this department, it is definitely over the top and might even grate on your nerves after awhile.  When this game says a \"Mature\" rating, it IS a Mature game 100%.  You have been warned!!!I could go on and on with my praise about this game, but it truly is a generation defining game and it has me longing for what GTA VI will be able to do on the next generation consoles.With 100 hours of gameplay, way, WAY too much stuff to do, a great story and great gameplay, it is the best GTA ever, by far, and if you've played any of the others, you have to get this one!UPDATE:  Note that there is no mention of GTA Online, as it will not go live until 1 October.  I can advise the money is SEPARATE meaning if you have $10M in the single player, don't worry, you won't get robbed and be at 0.  Additionally, you're going to have FIVE HUNDRED missions online, as well as team deathmatch/capture the flag modes, a content creator and other DLC that will be coming.  If you add this in, you're talking easily 200 hours of gameplay.  I don't think there's another $60 you can spend that will provide that much bang for the buck IMHO. :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9X9W","description":"","reviewerName":"Phantom","summary":"A step up from its predecessor","reviewText":"My review is based on a comparison of its predecessor and Nintendo.  Why Nintendo? Because they innovated most of the features that are found in today's standard controller.This time around, Sony added a speaker, touch pad, light bar, and an output for headsets.  They're  welcomed additions.  The touch pad functions like a laptops trackpad.  Different games find various ways to use it and I haven't found any that have hindered my gaming experience.  The PS4 is still in its infancy stage so many developers have not implemented the full extent of its use.  Hopefully the future will bring us some great experiences.  The light bar looks fantastic but at the moment it's not a necessity.  It changes color depending on actions you take in various games.  For example, in Tomb Raider; when holding a lit torch, the light bar flickers red and yellow.The controller feels more ergonomic than its predecessor.  The grips are thinner and elongated and it fits perfectly into the palms.  The analog sticks are a bit stiffer and further apart.  This leads to better precision and less likely to unwillingly touch them respectively.  In addition, the shoulder trigger are a vast improvement.The d-pad is comfortable and precise.  I would almost deem it perfect but Nintendo holds the crown.A downside of the controller is battery life.  I don't time my play sessions but I feel that after four hours, I begin to get a notice that my battery is low.I would give it 4.5 stars because of the battery life.  Otherwise, it's a 5.P.S. The controller features a share button that I didn't mention above.  When pressed, it conveniently brings up a page where you can easily share gameplay and screenshots through Twitch, UStream, Facebook, and Twitter.  I didn't include it in my review because it doesn't pertain to gameplay.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-28-2014"}

I was completely wrong.  I really enjoyed this game.  It does start off a little slow and the beginning has a few long video clips with not much action in between.  Once the action really gets going, though, hold on to your seat.  The story is on par with a good action thriller movie with almost seamless transition from the clips to the action.  The plot keeps you guessing as to who is behind the violence.  I'm usually pretty good at picking up on clues and figuring out who the bad guy is but, in this case, I kept changing my mind and ended up being wrong almost until the very end.  This is a shooter so you don't have a lot to do other than shoot the bad guys but there is a large variety of weapons and settings so that you always have to stay on your toes.  I really liked the scenes in which Max is falling, sliding, or in some other way moving, and shooting as he goes.  There is, of course, the bullet cam which is okay if you're into that kind of thing.  This game is rated M and it lives up to every bit of that rating.  There is drug and alcohol use to excess, graphic as well as implied sexual activity, nudity, cursing and graphic violence.  It's not a game you want to buy for a young teenager. If you're an adult who likes action shooter games, I think you'll like this.  I agree with one other review that I saw.  I wouldn't be surprised if this gets Game of the Year.  It's that good.  I would really like to be able to play Max Payne 1 and 2 now but I don't own an Xbox and I don't think they make a 360 version.  Maybe Rockstar will do a Max Payne Retro Version for us newbies.

I had a blast with it and still play it despite the fact that I beat it several times.  The weapons were veryy accurate in terms of practicality and functionality; I was very pleased that Ubi Soft actually got the technical information of the actual weapons and implimented them correctly instead of making a messed-up array of weapons like the RCP-90 in Golden Eye (Great weapon for a great game).The graphics are not bad given the time of RBS3's release.  Nothing special about them, but they arn't lacking soo much that one begins to notice it.  However, the AI is seriously lacking on both the terrorists and your fellow team mates.  When you give Zulu (Attack on your command) commands, they can get stuck in corners walk into the given area and get killed in the process.  It's really annoying to move them out of your way too.  Several times when clearing rooms they'll either jump out in front of me and take a few rounds to the back or they'll stop in the doorway and start shooting like it was a carnival game.The terrorist AI is also lacking.  I could take out someone with a loud .40 S&W; handgun and the nearby terrorist will just scratch his head wondering if it was a firearm or if his stomache just made a noise.  Other times the terrorist will try to roll away to safety and instead roll towards you and shoot you while rolling... it's really weird.What also makes me mad is the fact that you need XBox Live in order to do Co-Op.  I'm sorry, but I don't feel like paying money in order to play Co-Op.  I think it's rediculous and a money-making scheme dreamed by Tom Clancy or Bill Gates.  I was escatic to play Conflict: Desert Storm on Co-Op, why can't other games be the same.Lastly, I hate it when you can only control yourself and not others, much less give individual orders.  It takes away from the controlability from the game, thereby being at the mercy of the AI... and we know how much I love the AI.But nonetheless, I loved playing this game.  My favorite thing to do it use phosphorous on the terrorist and watch them burst into flames.  It's a really fun game, but these small errors really do add up to a big deal.

Players will find familiar names like Glass Joe, King Hippo and trainer Doc Louis. These boxers come to life again in cell-shaded 3-D, complete with hilarious fighting animations and backstories that capture all the fun and flair of the originalPunch-Out!!games.The Wii's Motion SensitivityThe motion-sensitive controls of the Wii console mean that when players throw punches, Little Mac throws punches as well. Additionally, you can control hooks and jabs by combining motion control with control-stick movement. The motion-sensing Wii Remote and Nunchuk controllers turn real-life swings into on-screen punches, so anyone can play. The game can also be played with classic NES-style controls by turning the Wii Remote sideways.CharactersPunch-Out!!features a total of 13 opponents for Little Mac to step into the ring with. 12 of which are returning from previous games in thePunch-Out!!series. Each have their own backstory and patterns of attacks to learn and learn to counter. Just a few of the characters you can expect to see are:Little MacSmall but extremely game, Little Mac is a young, up-and-coming fighter, who with the help of his trainer, ex-champion Doc Lewis, has set his sights on working his way through the ranks.Glass JoeA fearful French fighter due to his extremely weak chin, Glass Joe will crumple to the mat quickly with just a few well-placed shots, making him an easy mark and a good warm-up for the fighters to follow.King HippoKing Hippo is both huge and an immensely powerful fighter, but can be weakened with the right combinations to the head and body, giving you time to go for the knockout if you can survive his onslaught.Von KaiserAn old-timey fighter whose rumored childhood difficulties have left him eager to dish out punishment in the ring, Von Kaiser is a dangerous opponent, but one who will turn tail if you can find his weakness.Special AttacksPlayers can obtain special 'Star Punches,' which allow Little Mac to take more health from his rival in a single punch. Players can now use multiple stars in a single punch for an extra-powerful attack.Controller OptionsPunch-Out!!features multiple controller options. For players looking to take advantage of the Wii's motion control capabilities,Punch-Out!!uses the Wii Remote and Nunchuck controllers to simulate throwing punches. Use the Nunchuck to throw a left punch and the Wii Remote to throw a right punch. Fans of the NES version and core gamers will be excited to see Nintendo has also included the option to playPunch-Out!!using the classic layout from the original NES controller. Use the 1 and 2 buttons along with the cross pad to throw hooks and jabs or to dodge.","reviewerName":"J. Harley","summary":"FUN!! Throwback to the mid-eighties game","reviewText":"Talk about a homage to a favorite game from years past. The only thing missing from this game is Mike Tyson!  Punch out is just flat-out fun.  Not only fun, but good for you, because you will break a sweat playing this game.  The motion-controls add an entirely new dimension to the gameplay.  I haven't tried the balance board yet.  The nunchuck is too much fun to abandon just yet.  The cut-scenes are similar to the previous versions of the game and the opponents are hilarious.  A few favorites return (Bald Bull, Glass Joe, Flamenco Kid...) as well as a few new opponents (Disco Kid). If you've never played Punch Out! before (or even if you have), get ready for some hilarious opponents and combos.  The animations for knockouts, combos, intros, special moves, and post-fight are too funny at times.  There are several game modes.  My favorites is the circuit, although the CPU opponent has a tendency to fight cheap sometimes (unblockable devastating punches or knockouts just before the bell).  Occasional cheap shots aside, it's a ton of fun to work your way up the circuit.  This is a good family-style game.  This is the best boxing game available, not only on Wii, but ANY platform.  The only thing that would have made it perfect is if it had online head-to-head mode.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-08-2010"}

The series captivates with the awesome story line moving from Altair to Ezio Auditore...and the series grew they (Ubisoft) branched out into other assassins expanding the story line...through Desmond Miles who had a link to the assassin's and their lineage through the various historic periods in time.Brotherhood refined a lot of the game play as a single assassin earlier on in the game and as the missions unfold you are introduced to other characters in the game that lend support throughout.

I enjoy the included music very much!We didn't have any issues at all running the game on our system. This is a rather high-end game, letting numerous enemies move and fight on-screen at once. You really do need a current system to play it. I don't find this a bad thing - XBox 360 games don't play on an XBox machine. In fact, we had things happening too quickly at times, and had to scramble to keep up with the events.There are the scripted campaigns, as well as custom battles where you can create teams of factions and see how you do on a given map. You can even choose specific units from different periods, mixing and matching to see \"what if\" scenarios.AI is rather impressive for having so many units making decisions at the same time. Sure, there is the occasional issue where units being bombarded with an arrow assault can't quite figure out where to go to escape it. But I imagine that happens in real life too - if you're under a hail of arrows, it might not be clear which way is safer to run. I do agree that they shouldn't just stand still and wait to die :)Still, as all strategy gamers know, it really doesn't matter what the AI of a strategy game does. That is just a training mode to help you learn the techniques. The real challenge in any strategy game is to take on other human gamers. So once you've mastered the basics, and understand the skills, take your game online and see how you do against other human players!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2007"}

The music, sound and atmosphere are all 5 stars, and very beautiful graphics for the PSP on par with FF7 Crisis Core. It really does a great job of drawing you into the world. My only gripes are the story and combat. The story is a litte light; you will go chunks of the game without a cutscene or anything. So you are wandering around wondering what's going on a lot of the time. The combat is a little clunky and frustrating at times, especially in the beginning when you are trying to get your bearings and are getting mauled by disturbing looking monstrosities. Watch out for the fat fleshy looking crawling things called Carrions, they are the bane of my existence. Overall this game is really fun but not so scary as it is creepy. I have to wonder though at the screenshots that amazon has for this game are on the PS2 or something because the game is not even close to being that bright. It is very dark/gritty and a little grainy at times which is most likely by design. Conserve your supplies and tread carefully, you have been warned!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-07-2012"}

This is almost like a brain-train game for your fingers and ears!The first thing I want to note here is that many reviewers have posted reviews of this game after playing only a game or two. It's fairly obvious in their reviews!! Every game can be tough at first, Once you get the hang of it and get past that \"training session\" area you can truly evaluate a game based on whether it's fun long term or not. It's key in gaming in general to go with reviewers who actually play the full game before reporting on it!So, the basics, Rhythm Nation is much like WarioWare in that it is a collection of generally short (under a minute) mini-games that are all different and all test different parts of your skill set. They are all related to clicking and \"slashing\" quickly. In one game for example fast cars are zooming around a race track. You have to click right in time to take their photo as they go past you.In another game you are a fan for a singing group, clapping your hands in time to the song and doing other cheering moves.They have a good selection of different activities to keep you interested. Each mini-game is short so you can play it in line without worrying about getting sucked in for more than 60 seconds or so. Each game has room for improvement so you can keep replaying it and trying to improve your score.Sometimes you hit a game that you really don't like. This is one of my complaints about the game - it is very linear. You have to unlock game #5 to go on to game #6. If you get stuck on a game you can go into the cafe and skip that game, but still, I would rather you get a \"group\" of games at a time. That way you aren't stuck on just one game before you move onto the next one game.Also, the instructions are often VERY vague. You can be stuck on the practice sessions for a game for 5 minutes or more before you finally figure out what they are trying to get you to do. I very much love the WarioWare \"try it and see\" method of playing, but those are with games that make sense. Some of these games just don't make sense, and a more in depth \"this is how you play\" would really help.Still, nothing beats the pure fun of their end-of-level mash-ups. Say you get 5 different random games in a given level that mix up all sorts of types of gameplay. Then you get to the level ending mash-up. The combine ALL of those games in a random order with a fun theme! All of the games now have a beach theme, or a samurai-western theme. I *love* that. It is hilarious and quite fun.So it's a mixed bag here. It can be frustrating at first. Accept that! Just plow through it and figure out how the game works (or post on a forum and get some help). Once you've figured out the games, it is a LOAD of fun - and very good for your brain. The quick reflexes and out-of-the-box thinking it encourages in your brain will serve you well in many other areas of life!Highly recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2009"}

Even though I am not a huge extreme sports game fan, this is the best one out there.Instead of the usual races and BIG air challenges like in the past SSX games, they have included that and a whole new game mode. It's called Conquer The Mountain, where you select an SSX character and lead their career throughout the game, improving stats, earning medals and all that other fun stuff. This game mode made SSX 3 the game it is today.The good old races return in the three peaks, with \"rival\" races and time races also added. The big air events are when you must score some major points by doing major insane tricks. You could also freeride throughout the courses, picking up these all new collectibles in every course. Pretty fun stuff.As for other stuff, the graphics are pretty good, considering this game came out 2 years ago. Also, they have added a bunch of new tricks to show off and add up those major points in the BIG air challenges. Also new is the radio, which plays music and has the DJ add some other words in between. The usual characters return like Elise, Zoe and Mac to name a few, with of course some new characters added.

This, overall, is a very solid Wipeout game.Everyone mainly looks forward to how far a Wipeout game can push a console. The game looks amazing on the Vita with a great sense of speed. Wipeout is known for a wide variety of event types and 2048 delivers there too. There's time attack, zone events, and a new combat type event. I don't know why this wasn't in any previous Wipeouts, but you just go around destroying as many vehicles are you can and earn points. Zone events return where the car accelerates on its own and you just have to survive. I wish there were more original event types, but what's here works fine and there are a lot of them.The vehicle classes are fun and the speed ramps up pretty quick in this version. B to A has a huge difference, but some fans may turn their nose up at the thought. I preferred this, but don't worry there are plenty of vehicles to unlock and use so you can fine tune your play style just the way you want. There are plenty of unique tracks that look great and are designed well. My major complaint is that there isn't any new weapons. The same quake, rocket, missile, mines etc. are still present and haven't ever changed.Multiplayer is where the most fun is at, but this time there is Wi-Fi so you can play online. A huge complaint I have is that the load times are just absolutely atrocious. There have been patches since release to shorten them, but they are still pretty long and need to be cut down even more. If you can look past these issues than 2048 is the best racer on the Vita right now. The game controls very well thanks to the actual analog stick so PSP fans will notice smoother controls this time around. If you own the PS3 Wipeout you can do Cross-Play which is fun and makes you feel like you got your monies worth.Overall, long time fans may either hate this game or love it depending on how you feel about the series as it stands today. It really needs some renovation with new weapons, event types, and maybe some customization? 2048 is stunning to look at on the Vita, but suffers some seriously long load times in turn.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00012BSJ4","description":"When people ask me what my favorite game of all time is, I always answer the same thing:Metroid. Sure,Super Metroidon SNES took the concept and made it better, andMetroid Fusionwas a fantastic follow-up on the Game Boy Advance, but when push comes to shove the original is where my vote will always go. Then there'sMetroid Prime&#8230;but that's 3D and a story for a different day. This game and this story are all about the glory of 2D gaming.So you can only begin to imagine my excitement when Nintendo's newestMetroidredo appeared on my desk. For those of you that may not know,Zero Missionis a special edition of sorts. It's the originalMetroidwith spruced-up graphics, streamlined level designs and gameplay, plus a whole new chapter.At it's core, it is most definitely the originalMetroid, but as you travel around the world you start to notice differences. Hallways are changed, statues lead you to the next objective, and abilities like Power Grip and Space Jump that never existed in the original iteration pop up in time.Nintendo has been very hush-hush about this title since its announcement, and after playing through the game myself, I must admit I'm a little reluctant to give away too much, but I can give you some interesting facts to whet your whistle. The biggest chunk of new content takes place after you beat Mother Brain (which was where the original ended). Not only is this new zone fairly large (I would say it's bigger than Norfair and Brinstar combined) it incorporates a number of story elements that help tie the whole series together (includingMetroid Prime).In total, the game is still rather short. I beat it in roughly six and a half hours, and I wandered around a lot. But the new content is spectacular, and fans of the series will absolutely adore this special edition. And if you have never experiencedMetroid, then you are in for a treat. My one rip on this title is the fact that the game now holds your hand a little too much, so the title loses some of the wonder and puzzle solving that I loved about the original. But don't let this one setback stop you from picking up one of the greatest titles in the history of gaming.Concept:Update a classic with new graphics and lots of bonus materialGraphics:Crisp 2D sprites jump off your SP or GBA PlayerSound:Fantastic from beginning to endPlayability:Metroid's control set-up is still one of the most simple, yet complex schemes ever created &#8211; brilliantEntertainment:Replaying the original with added content is an 8-bit gamers dream come trueReplay:ModerateRated:9.5 out of 10Editor:Andy McNamaraIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Much like the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings movies, Nintendo has reworked the originalMetroidto feature bonus content that ties into Samus' continuing adventures. I can't even begin to tell you how amazing this new material is. Let's just say that you're in for a big surprise after the Mother Brain fight. A huge surprise! I don't want to ruin the game for you, but I will say that there's a stretch of the game that I played with my jaw on the floor. Better yet, all of the original content has been extensively overhauled. The shape of the terrain has been altered dramatically, and as you progress through this incredible adventure you'll spot subtle changes every step of the way. With the original NES game included as a bonus, you'll get the chance to compare and contrast. Nintendo took one of the best games of all time and made it better. Buy it immediately.Rated:9.75 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Daniel A Moir","summary":"Metroid Uncensored","reviewText":"There's been a much welcome trend in the industry of games lately; remaking old classics. I'm in love with these remakes because many of them have been keeping true to the spirit and design of the original, yet adding a much-needed overhaul to the graphics, and to the sound, etc. The best examples of these remakes so far have been limited to the Nintendo GameCube with Resident Evil, and Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes. Now the GBA gets a taste of remade classics. Granted the GBA has been home to a number of ports of SNES classics, but this isn't just a port with a few added features, its all an all-new game built upon the skeleton of the original Metroid, and while it fails to surpass Metroid 3 (AKA Super Metroid) it comes fairly close in most retrospect. The graphics are amazing, the sound is also amazing, and the game play is stellar, although I do agree that it holds your hand too much to some extent, but this will not prevent getting lost, nor will it ensure you getting 100% items collected. In fact, getting 100% items collected is no easy feat. I have yet to accomplish it, as some of the tricks that must be pulled off to get all the items are either very difficult, or have no obvious solution that can be found for the puzzle. One item that was in Metroid 3 that could have helped with this is the scanner. I was able to get 100% of everything in Super Metroid thanks to that handy device. In addition to the lack of the scanner I also feel that there was room for even more content. They did add some mini-bosses and such, but the game was still far too short for my taste. I would prefer a much longer game. I also didn't like how the role of Mother Brian seemed so downplayed. I won't blow the ending, but the last boss was disappointing. Apart from that Metroid Zero Mission is nearly right up there with Super Metroid in overall greatness for the 2D versions of this game series. I hope that Metroid 2 will be next to undergo such a serious makeover, and that Super Metroid will be ported to the GBA soon as well.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2004"}

They are usually rush jobs meant to cash in on a new release (see: Matrix for a recent example) and, in essence, trick the buyer.  That is most assuredly not the case with Riddick.  This is one of the 10 best XBox games ever, and many are saying that it's oodles better than the actual film!The strength of Chronicles is its immersive, story-driven environment.  I was a bit skeptical about the first person view (First person shooters on consoles tend to be really hard to control due to the absence of a mouse and keyboard combo), but I was surprised by how well it worked here.  In many ways, this game is part Role Playing, part stealth, part shooter and part Adventure.  The environments you explore are really, really well done (atmospheric is the word), and the play of light and shadow is the best this side of Splinter Cell.GRAPHICS: 9/10.  Very, very good.  In my mind, only Morrowind and Splinter Cell surpass this game for overall graphical brilliance.  There are some anti-aliasing problems during some of the cinematics, but gameplay is smooth.CONTROL: 9/10.  There are some annoyances, such as inadvertantly pressing the crouch or shine-vision buttons while fighting, but they are mostly minor.  The control scheme is unobtrusive and once you get the feel of the fighting controls, you'll have a blast.SOUND: 8/10.  I wasn't bowled over by either the music or the sound effects, but everything is in keeping with the dingy, grimy world you are in.  The voice-overs and acting are really well done, though.GAMEPLAY: 9/10.  Awesome.  Everyone says it's too short, but I think that's because the game is so good that you want it to last longer!  The production values are top-notch (you feel like you are watching the real Vin Diesel), and the story is good.  It's not exactly Shakespeare, but it's a suspenseful journey through a very well rendered environment.  There are plot twists and some really scary or tense moments, the level design is for the most part excellent, and the missions themselves are varied and nonrepetitive.  I would have liked a bigger world (GTA 3 and Morrowind have spoiled me) with more side-quests, as well as more weapons, but hey.Overall, this is one that I recommend to just about anyone.

It's got great characters, one hell of a suspense story, and some of the best graphics I've seen on the PS3. I've beaten it twice now and I\"m still finding little clues or hints I didn't catch the first couple times no matter how thorough I thought I was. That being said I still have a problem calling it a good video game.Heavy Rain takes place from the point of view of four different people who're in some way effected by the investigation into the \"Origami\" serial killer. The plot unfolds slowly (much like all good suspense stories) then starts to pick up as the main character's experiences start to spin wildly out of control. The developers who scripted this game did an excellent job and I think this story should stand with the best in crime fiction. There are several places where this story can branch out ( I counted six big ones during the middle chapters) and this gives each run through the game a new experience. I am a bit disappointed the some of the bigger things early on which seem like they should matter don't (shooting a suspect/botching an interview). Then again I'm sure I haven't tried EVERY scenario so maybe they'll come into play later.The graphics used to both animate and detail the people and environments in this game are astounding. Eyes shift, people slouch, rain patters the streets and soaks into clothing.  Police stations and factories have dirt and grime and really do a good job drawing you into Heavy Rain's world. Facial expressions are also very well done in conveying emotions for the characters. There are a couple expressions that are a bit messy (people's jaws drop and lazily hang open whenever anything suprising happens no matter how appropriate). There are some clipping issues too but nothing that will ruin the experience. Also the game did lock up once during Norman's first trip-out scene but it still let me restart from the main menu.The sound in Heavy Rain is also well done. While not all the voice acting is in top form (Norman and especially Ethan slip up the american accent a few too many times) every voice actor is 100 percent in character.  The voice actors for Scott and Madison are especially good. The environmental sound is movie quality and sounds great on any speakers (I especially like how the press conference played out in Norman's second chapter).With all these great things wrapped up into one package I still have a problems with Heavy Rain...mainly the gameplay. Despite the details and little things you can make your characters do, Heavy Rain is NOT a fun game to play. Just to make your character move you have to hold down the R2 button. I HATE the R2 and L2  buttons on the PS3 controller and the continuous use of them throughout this game is very frustrating. The same can be said for the use of the Sixaxis. Also action scenes that see your characters climbing, crawling, jumping etc require the pressing of two or more buttons. None of this feels natural and (in my opinion) actually almost ruins the immersion. I'd prefer the layout of Indigo Prophecy much better. I realize it would've shortened the game and made Heavy Rain more of an interactive Adventure title (Gabriel Knight, Sam N Max, Monkey Island) but it wouldn't be as frustrating.It's really sad when a company puts so much into the game's presentation that they fall flat in the gameplay department. I love good graphics and stories and voice-acting but so many games are putting so much effort into these things that they settle for far too familiar gameplay or they make the gamplay needlessly complicated.Overall Heavy Rain is a great interactive movie/novel but an average video game. It's very much worth owning if you love good mystery/serial killer stories (like I do). Just be prepared to deal with a lot of lousy controls to get to the great things this story has to offer.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2010"}

Accused of the murder of her one-time mentor, Werner Von Croy, Lara becomes a  fugitive. Pursued by the police, she follows the alchemist into a dark world of  blood, betrayal, and vengeance.

Bennett \"Will 'vouge' For Food\"","summary":"Lara Croft Needs New Management","reviewText":"I could not wait to get my hands on this game, \"Angel Of Darkness\" was touted as a next generation in video game history.  Reportedly Ms Croft would be revamped and reinvented...and return to her place as a video game icon; well don't hold your breath.  \"Lara Croft-Tomb Raider:Angel of Darkness\", the oft delayed child of Eidos and Core is hardly worth the wait.  I am a huge Tomb Raider fan, and this game has totally left me with the epihany that Lara Croft is not what she once was.  Graphically I think the game excells, the levels are intricate and hugely detailed, with arcitecture that will just blow you away and wonderful lighting detail to boot.  The story, about a outbreak of murders in Paris and the subsequent chase to find out who is behind all the drama, is the best the series has ever seen.  It's cinematic and daring, and a real departure from the Indiana Jones-esque storys of the previous games (including all those on Nintendo's Game Boy systems).  So where does Ms Croft fall short?  The control.  I can' say it enough--the control is the downfall of this game.  While, with practice, you could manage quite well, but when it comes down to the wire...all bets are out the window.  Lara moves so slowly, and I blame a lot of the sluggish response on Sony's controller specifications as well (which has always proven inferior to other consoles).  Regardless of whose fault it is, \\control issues are what turn many people off from \"Angel of Darkness\".  Many times, when you push up to move forward, Lara's immediate response is delayed a second; adding to that no matter how hard to push the controller, she defaults to walking most the time.  Her slow movement and delayed response make fighting fast moving enemies (especially those that fly) next to impossible.  Core and Eidos also removed her ability to shot and jump at the same time, so fighting an enemy and running away can prove extremely taxing (for her to put her gun away or pick anything up is delayed as well--in fact anything Lara does is slow!!!).  Core claims the delay was due to control issues, and if they are this bad now...I shutter to think how bad they were to start off with.  Another huge issue is the slowdown...which is completely unforgivable.  With the amount of huge, complex, and impressive games on the market; with no slowdown hindering gameplay, I can't get over the fact that this hugely anticipated, major league game is stricken with such consistent and distracting problems.  The level \"Hall of Seasons\" can be made unplayable.  When an enemy pops on the screen--forget about it, the game's framerate drops to levels that make you wonder just what Core has been doing this past 18 months.  So what's my bottom line?  As a huge fan of the series, I like this game (and even have moments of loving it) and am more than dissapointed at the final version of the game.  I don't recommend this game to anyone who disliked Tomb Raider before, and I recommend a trial run before making the purchase.  Core really dropped the ball this time around, and took Lara down with them.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-06-2003"}

Bombs are just also lame and almost useless and hook blade is quite what different as in good. It doesn't make a difference, just feels different. Multiplayer is a complete disaster compared to brotherhood. Characters are not many and good. Also, the maps are wayyy to small.

Read on below to see why.Pros:- Great City and climbing structures ( Way better than any AC series)- More dramatic, action, and stealth from before- Not all missions are lame and boring, more than half is very fun and intriguing.- More ways to customize and more weapons- New styled of killing- Better way of recruiting fellow assassinsCons:- A few lame missions like stalking a merchant to get roses.- Very short campaigns compared to Brotherhood- Multiplayer characters and modes- Harder to earn money- More Expensive RenovationsThankyou for reading and enjoy playing","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2012"}

With over 250 of the baddest racing machines imaginable, an infinite number of ways to customize them, and all the tools you need to tune them to perfection, you'll find yourself behind the wheel of the slickest vehicles on the planet.With Forza Motorsport, you'll be able to own cars from the world's most recognized manufacturers. Get behind the wheel of the Enzo Ferrari, Porsche 911, Ford GT, or the Audi R8, to name a few. The physics model of each car is based upon actual car data, so your driving feels like the real deal. Plus, Forza has taken meticulous steps to design each car's visuals according to exact specifications. Teams of artists have worked to reproduce the surface properties of materials in an ultra-realistic fashion -- the painted metal is shiny with gloss, the glass reflects light, and the car's rubber is rich with texture.You can trick out every car with real-world body parts, such as rims, wings, side skirts, bumpers, and hoods. At the advanced paint shop you can pimp your ride with phatty decals and classy custom paint schemes. But don't stop with looks alone -- Forza also lets you upgrade your car with suspension kits, turbochargers, superchargers, intercoolers, brakes, and racing slicks. It's your car, and Forza gives you the tools to make it your own.And once your ride is ready, you can immerse yourself in 17 different environments that deliver challenging tracks textured with accurate, photo-realistic graphics. Slip on your driving gloves, get behind the wheel, and rev your engine as you ready yourself for the world-famous Nring Nordschleife, the corkscrew turns of Laguna Seca, the urban jungle of New York City, or the lush Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro. Each location has been recreated with detail matching the attention given to the vehicles -- the total package of fast cars and exotic locales makes the racing experience of Forza Motorsport totally awesome.Take your powerful, new creation to cyberspace, and challenge the globe's toughest drivers on Xbox Live. Once you've built your vehicle and mastered all the driving nuances, you'll be ready to burn some serious rubber.","reviewerName":"A. Vegan","summary":"Stylish and Challenging","reviewText":"Forza Motorsport is a stylish and challenging game that is easily one of the best racers on the Xbox, if not the best. There are more than 230 cars from 60 manufacturers and a track list that, if not extensive, at least features a nice mix of tight street courses, real race tracks from all over the world, and challenging fictional environments.  If you don't have the slightest clue about entry points into turns or when to step on the brakes, Forza has a handy \"suggested line\" feature that is one of the slickest innovations in racing games to come along in a long time.Forza places a huge emphasis on every car's individuality through features such as the rarity rating and powerful customization tools, which let you paint your car and/or add a massive number of vinyls and decals, creating, with a little patience, a car that will be unique and unlike any others. That individuality can be further celebrated by pitting your car against other players' cars online. The fun doesn't stop there, however, as Forza also lets you buy and sell cars in online trading sessions with friends and strangers alike. By setting up a \"buy and sell\" session, you can browse the collections of up to eight other players who agree to enter the lobby with you.Forza may well be remembered as a title that, through its mix of challenge and control, introduced an entirely new set of fans to the beauty and power of driving games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-30-2005"}

I really never cared for it to begin with, so for me this game is about the campaign. Really can't speak too much ill of it either.I will say the grenades thrown ratio on insane is really just annoying, but I guess that's to be expected. I have just as much fun on hardcore as I have with previous gears though, and I do like the new weapons, and tweaks. Taking away my pistol slot from an unused d-pad kinda annoys me, and definitely made a difference to me. Same is true of losing marcus, and dom, but all in all it plays like gears. The enemies are smarter, the mechanics are smoother if only slightly, and having insight on halvo bay is worthwhile to me. I'll take gears 2 or 3 over this one though. They somehow managed to make both of those feel epic, this one is definitely lacking in that aspect. The story is very much meh.All that said, while I really feel the story is lacking, I enjoyed the campaign, and really only because of the game play. It's worth a play through at ten bucks. Really, it's all about the lancer. The combat in this series has always been great, and that hasn't changed. If they're going to keep milking this series though, they really need to up the ante with the story, and probably really listen up to the hardcore fans of multiplayer and what they want to see. Those are the people that are going to come to amazon with all their gripes and leave you with an overall 3 star rating on a game most people at least enjoyed. Hope they work that out, cause I'll play gears tangents so long as they're made, as long as they are obviously trying to improve the series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2014"}

Gamers may trigger it whenever they feel like it and it has its one sense of style and adds eye candy to already jaw-dropping graphics as well as it gives you advantage over your foes (which are just plain nasty to deal with because: 1.extremely beefy 2.might shoot through their allies to kill Max 3.very alert). Max can also shootdodge, that is leap sideways in slo-mo and shoot while keeping himself less likely to get hit by enemy bullets, in addition that he can just dodge bullets by jumping sideways. Yes, it took very long to finish this game and it is quite short, but in fact, most people (me too) get so addicted to games like Max Payne that they'll beat it in record time and start whining about its length right after they beat the last level. When it comes to multiplayer, to enlighten people who are guessing why Remedy did not include it, consider the &quot;slo-mo&quot;, because this is what this game is all about. If there was multiplayer, then imagine how you'd play with other human opponents, if one goes into slow motion, then all of them would, resulting horrible experience when some would go into slow motion without triggering it. That means that it could only be limited to 2 human players at once. When it comes to performance, the only necessary requirements for this game to run at optimum are 256 MB RAM and a 64 MB video card (I would recommend NVIDIA's Geforce cards). The game's textures take up lots of memory especially when running at 32-bit texture color depth and at high level of texture quality and sharpness. 1 ghz CPU will be more than enough for this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2001"}

In other words, this is a game that involves little decision making and depends on a storyline to keep you hooked from chapter to chapter.  The storyline is a comic book tale about a cop become a vigilante to combat the evil drug dealers.  The in-between segments are even displayed as comic book panels and the main character, Max Payne, has a load of corny metaphors to go with every chapter.Some of the creative features put into this game stand out at first.  Perhaps the most impressive feature is the bullet time option that allows you to slow down time and gun down your enemies in a dramatic fashion.  If you've seen &quot;The Matrix,&quot; bullet time is the exact same thing in that movie.  It's new and interesting at first but not entertaining enough to keep you captivated throughout the game.No problem solving is required in this game.  The chapters are shoot 'em up segments from one to the next.  Even extra ammunition and health capsules are easy to find as you only need to open up a cabinet, shelf, etc. to find them.  The game allows you to interact with your environment by turning on faucets, blowing up television screens and other aspects that are entertaining at first but really have no point other than to &quot;oooh and awe&quot; you.If you shy away from violence or have kids to watch out for this game is not recommended.  The beginning sequence of the game shows Max Payne examining his murdered infant which I have to say was one of the few moments I thought a PC game overdid the violence in a game.  Some of the sub-bosses are slowed down and zoomed into as they are killed and falling to the ground.  I think critics of media violence often miss the point and are hypocritical but I have to say that this is one game that I could see justifiable reaction to the violence portrayed.An added bonus to this game is an online community that has created mods, skins and other programs to enhance your gaming experience with Max Payne. (Mods are alterations to the game that add extra levels, villains, etc.) I've seen stand-alone games with much more to offer in the mod department but the game does support it.  There is an online demo available that allows you to play the first part of the game.  Keep in mind that most of the game follows the same format as the demo which will allow you to decide if you'd like to purchase the game.  In my opinion, it's a game that is fun for younger players but is boring for the older PC gaming audience.  There are some unique gameplay aspects in Max Payne but not enough to make it worthwhile until the price drops.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2001"}

However he isn't alone as the Elites and the Arbiter (formerly of the Covenant) have joined forces with the humans to help. Anyway, the story gets a little crazy & confusing with the introduction of Guilty Spark (Halo 1), the Flood coming back (H1 & H2), some talking venus flytrap looking thing (which I assume is the leader of the Flood), the death of both Miranda Keyes and Sgt. Johnson, and more. Meh, oh well.Theres almost nothing different between this game and its predecessors. You still run around shooting various weapons which include shotguns, sniper rifles, plasma rifles, handgun, needlers, the assault rifles, and more, while killing the Covenant forces. You will still drive vehicles like the Ghost and Warthog with your fellow marines. The only difference is that you can rip turrets out of the ground, there are some new weapons like the Brute spiker or the gravity hammer, new vehicles like the Hornet (human version of the Banshee flying vehicle) or the Brute chopper, new grenades called the Stick Grenades and Napalm, and the Elites fight side by side with you. Also you get these things called \"equipment\" which are kind of like new grenades but they work differently. There are a bunch of different kinds like the Bubble Shield (which creates this big shield around you and anyone in it and you cna't shoot out of it but you can't be shot at from the outside), the Gravity Lift which is exactly how it sounds, the power drain & regain which either drains your shields or recharges them, and others. However, theres no change in fighting style or anything... you just run, shoot, take cover, pop out and finish the job.The multi-player is, where I assume, Bungie took the most time. Like Halo 2, you can party up with people, create emblems to distinguish you from other people, play different game types like capture the flag or juggernaut, and more. Unlike Halo 2 however, and a nice little addition I may add, is the ability to customize your character - and I don't mean just going from a Spartan to an Elite. You can actually choose different armor types and head types, but you have to meet certain criteria to unlock them. However, the multi-player is a bit bland at times.. I mean all you have to do is empty a clip from the MA5B assault rifle as you run up to them, and if your close enough, just punch them and they die. Meh.Theres this new \"Forge\" feature where you can move objects within a level but I think that its sort of lame so I'm not gonna bother with it. Also, you can watch recent matches and campaign tries in the new theater mode which is cool.There are a few flaws in the title. For one, in multi-player you can be clearly kicking the stuffing out of an opponent only to have him melee you twice and you die. On that same subject, there seems to be a bit of lag in response times from when you hit a button to what happens on screen - the best example of this is if Im hitting B to melee someone, and they melee me first because my character doesn't do anything. Secondly, like I mentioned, the story gets kind of confusing. Thirdly.... the flood... talk!!!!!!!!!! BOOO!!!!! Fourth, the AI can't drive for anything. Finally, the ending.The ending was dumb. Basically you outrun this thing thats blowing up while fighting the Flood and Sentinals (sound familiar like...say.. Halo 1's ending?). Chief and the Arbiter hop into a Pelican and start flying away. While inside, Chief is braced with his back against some sort of object with the doors to the Pelican open showing nothing but space. Cortana says \"Chief, what if we don't make it? It's been an honor serving with you.\" Chief responds, \"Don't worry, we'll make it.\" (Halo 2's trailer anyone?) Anyway, the thing explodes enveloping the screen with white. Next thing you know there are Marines standing at attention listening to a ceremony by the Admiral or whatever about heroes and how everyone who died meant something to the cause... behind the Admiral is a tail end of a Pelican with pictures and stuff on it.. and 117 carved into it. This signifies Master Chief is dead basically. Anyway, the Arbiter comes out of nowhere and he & the Admiral talk while the camera zooms into the \"117\". Then a paragraph on how Bungie thanks all its supporters and fans is shown and the credits roll. Okay.. lame.Overall, Halo 3 is fun but theres nothing really seperating it from its predecessors... in fact, it actually steals bits and pieces from them instead of bringing new ideas to the table. Although the game is exciting at times, and the multiplayer is kind of cool I will only give it 8.0 Spartans out 10.Oh and playing co-op is always fun :)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-15-2008"}

Gameplay is broken down into missions,  each with objectives that must be unerringly completed before  progressing to the next mission. This is not your typical kill-anything-that-moves  game: putting a bullet in the wrong person, not keeping the  right one alive, or perforating a seemingly unimportant inanimate object  can often result in mission failure.WhilePerfect Dark's solo missions play out much like those inGoldenEye 007, the game's fantastic multiplayer options are  another matter entirely. Cooperative and counteroperative simultaneous-play  modes allow for another player to join in on a mission as,  respectively, a teammate or the enemy. However, the real fun here is in  the highly customizable Combat Simulator, a one-to-four-player  simultaneous-play mode that features both free-for-alls and team-based  challenges and can include up to eight Simulants, computer-controlled  combatants of varying behavior.Although Simulants make for decent adversaries or teammates, you'll want  to grab a friend--and an Expansion Pak, as only 35 percent of the game  is available without one--to fully enjoyPerfect Dark.--Joe  HonPros:One of the best first-person shooters on any video game consoleOutstanding multiplayer game with huge replay valueBevy of game options, cheats, and secret featuresExcellent training mode with challenges all of its ownCons:Graphics get ugly when playing with more than two players","reviewerName":"Ella C.

This game combines the graphics of half-life, the weapons of Turok 2, and the gameplay of Goldeneye to make a Perfect, yet a little dark, mix of all the great FPS's into one. Each level in this game, as in half-life, is completlty different from the last, and is archeiteched in a way that is totally conveincible, each one of the alien weapons has a feroicious, pointed look to it, and covered in a brown and red color, as in Turok 2, and the gameplay is almost the exact thing used for goldeneye, with a good lock-on system that slows you down for accuracy instead of being perfectly accurate while runnng franticaly for your life. Level design here is great, and each level has a high point of action to it that you've sworn you saw in a movie but just cant remember which one, for example, In the Area51 level, You walk into a white-walled autopsy room, disquied in you'r doctors uniform. Above you, on a raised platform, you see a bright, tilted surgery light, and below that, a short grey alien. All of a sudden, a guard yells \"Thats not harry, its a Spy\", everyone starts shooting at you, running franticaly behind cover, you return fire, staining the white walls with the red blood of the guards. You run into the autopsy room, take the floating cart the unconsious if not dead alien is on, and push it out of the room with one hand while carefully holding your trusty pistol in the other. As you open the door, two guards let loose with their AK's, as the cart below you bobbles up and down in the fight, you gladly return fire from cover of the cart the alein is on. Continually bobing up and down, the short grey thing remains unconsious as you push it from room to room, surviving each gunfight in the white and now red walled rooms. With such movielike action going on constinly throughout the game, and with such cool-looking guns, and great graphics for the N64, This game stands almost Perfect above the other N64 (I still thing Ocarina of Time stands higher, so dont but this over that, just to let you know)","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-11-2003"}

{"product_name":"B00D6PTMSW","description":"","reviewerName":"Kyle Slayzar","summary":"SQUEEDLY BAMBLY FEEDLY MEEDLY MOWWWWWWW!:  A Review (And Guitar Solo) From a Traditional Music Gaming Fanatic","reviewText":"Been a fan of the music gaming genre since I saw my first Dance Dance Revolution (Naoki FTW) machine at an arcade in 2002 and became even more enthralled when a friend of mine introduced me to the first Guitar Hero when I first attended graduate school in 2006.  I loved pretending that I had some music talent, which I don't unless swiping a credit card to get front-row tickets to Boston counts as &#34;talent,&#34; by jamming away to my favorite tunes by Poison, The Vapors, Queen, and so forth with my buddies when we should've been studying.  Problem was that the genre got flooded with Guitar Hero and Rock Band installments and several other unique attempts from the Nintendo Wii.  Most notably of the over-saturation of the music gaming market was Power Gig: Rise of the Six String, a game that claimed to be able to teach how to play the guitar by using an actual electric guitar.  It was a novel idea being backed heavily by Kid Rock (as if that means anything) and several other relatively well-known artists so I gave that one a try and hated it as it was an expensive version of Guitar Hero with a cheap guitar peripheral and a lackluster track list (John Mayer, nuff' said).After that, I gave up on the genre.  That was 2009.Fast forward to this past year or so where Ubisoft has attempted to revive the genre with the original Rocksmith.  Now, I have not played the original but they must have done well enough to attempt a sequel, hence the 2014 addition since Ubisoft didn't want to adhere to the Grand Theft Auto school of sequel naming by calling it &#34;2&#34; or something starting with the letters &#34;R&#34; and &#34;E,&#34; separated by a colon.  As such, I cannot comment on any improvements from the original but, after playing the 2014 version for a few days with my repurposed Power Gig controller, which actually works with it, I believe that a great game has been made to revive the genre.The first thing that caught my eye on &#34;RS14&#34; is the lack of any story or campaign mode.  Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Power Gig all had some kind of asinine campaign mode with dumb storytelling (although I loved the characters from the first two Guitar Hero games) that most gamers skipped just to get to the song.  RS14 does nothing of the sort.  Come to think of it, upon going through all the menus and gaming modes, this game is nothing but a teaching tool for hopeful guitar fanatics like myself.  This is good as it forces the user to stay focused and learning how to play and not be distracted by gimmicky stories derivative of We Are Spinal Tap or School of Rock.To add onto this, RS14 has not one mode of learning but several.  One of the most annoying elements in any game is if they force you to start at the lowest difficulty setting or a crapton of tutorials that you'd rather skip over.  RS14 allows you to start at a level of your choosing and that will appeal to more intermediate guitar players so they won't have to trudge through the n00bcak3 levels.  There are dozens upon dozens of tutorials at various levels to teach many things I did not know about playing the guitar like slides, bends, and not sucking.However, despite the ease of use and very user-friendly interface, I lack the necessary dexterity to play the guitar but it was still fun to try the other modes.  My personal favorite is the non-stop jamming session that allows you to improv alongside simulated band members.  I think I had more fun attempting Joe Satriani's &#34;Snatch Boogie,&#34; which probably sounded more like Top Gun than actually playing but, then again, I have the musical ability of a sea sponge living at the bottom of the ocean.  Truth be told, I really stink at this and spiraled downward into absurdity by rage quitting once or twice and, after my third rage quit, decided to play something really off the wall that sounded more like something Mister Torgue would play in Borderlands 2 (Which is the reference in the title if anyone actually caught that!) than actual music.However, this didn't defeat the whole purpose of the game as my buddies seemed to have no problem learning the basics while I attempted to figure out how to hold the guitar.  They caught on quick, thanks to the comprehensive and ease of use tutorials and it didn't take long for us to start a sing-a-long when they actually starting playing the track list.Now, the track list is a big of a marvel for two reasons.1:  They include &#34;Peace of Mind&#34; by Boston, which is my favorite band and will always get my two thumbs pointing vertically upward.2:  In an age when almost all of the really good songs, sans anything good by Led Zeppelin, have already been used at least once, it's hard to create a decent track list that isn't overdone or feels like the leftovers *cough*Power Gig*cough*.Good songs from good bands like Def Leppard, The Kinks, Kiss, Queen and, about flipping time, Ratt's Round and Round!  I feel as though Glam Rock has been grossly overlooked as I can't find a game that has done anything by Autograph, Dokken, or Firehouse!  And they don't use obscure songs either but the good stuff.  The track list is half the battle as I won't get into a game unless it's a song I wanna play and, with RS14 being nothing but a tutorial game, I don't have to trudge through the stupid stuff to get to my favorite songs!All in all, RS14 is a refreshing revitalization on the music gaming genre when franchises like Guitar Hero and Rock Band almost drove it into the ground permanently.  I don't see a big revival coming up anytime soon, but this is a darn good start!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00006C2HA","description":"The wait is over. After five years of development, Lead Programmer John Carmack and the id Software team have put together a revolutionary visual experience. AlthoughDoom 3is not perfect, the 3D graphics engine upon which it is built sets a new, jaw-dropping standard that makes this game a must-have. In addition to adding multi-player action via xBox live, or via networked consoles, the Xbox version of Doom 3 also adds a great two-player cooperative mode.Hell on MarsYour character is a low ranking Marine on a routine rotation to the United Aerospace Corporation's (UAC) Mars Research Facility. That's pretty much all the back-story you need.Doom 3is a bit skimpy in the story-line department, but rich plotting and character development have never been the focus of theDoomfranchise. Action is the name of the game here, and we found plenty. After a few minutes of wandering through the facility, listening to rumors about impending catastrophe from the staff (rememberHalf-Life?) it was time to start shooting. We fought our way through dark, lavishly detailed environments until finally doing battle with pure evil in the depths of hell. Although the game offers no opportunities to explore the Martian setting apart from the linear corridors of the research facility, good level design and well crafted sound effects were successful at scaring the living heck out of us all the way through.Fearsome monsters. Dimly-lit environments. The perfect recipe for horror.Creature DiscomfortsGroaning zombies and the sudden leaping attack of an eleven-eyed Imp are just the beginning of the horror and anxiety inDoom 3. Floating Cacodemons attack from above with a mouthful of teeth, ethereal Revenant fire flesh-seeking missiles with deadly accuracy, a swarm of spider-like Trites skitter down the corridor, hungry for blood. Although the enemy AI inDoom 3is less crafty than we would have liked, the incredible variety of enemies--each with a unique style of attack--outweighs this shortcoming somewhat.Guns, Guns, GunsWhile there are many powerful weapons in the game, they are designed to force players to anticipate and plan for firefights. For instance, we liked wielding the chaingun to shred enemies at longer ranges, but the weapon devours ammo and using it on close-range targets was a waste of bullets. We quickly learned to switch to the shotgun or the chainsaw to dispatch foes at close range.One piece of hardware, the flashlight, was a point of both salvation and frustration for us.Doom 3is a dark game and many enemies know how to take advantage of it. You'll find yourself switching back and forth between your weapons and your flashlight often just to see what's lurking ahead. This problem might be easily solved by duct taping the flashlight to your equipped weapon, but, alas, we found no duct tape on Mars.MultiplayerWhile Doom 3 is noHalo 2when it comes to multi-player action, there are some respectable multi-player arenas and modes including death match, team death match, last man standing and tournament. Five maps serve to keep things interesting, and you'll want to look for special tricks in some arenas to give you a leg up on enemies. Cooperative multi-player proved to be a hoot as we teamed up with friends to try to make our way through the levels. The intensity of gameplay ramps up significantly in the cooperative mode, as the levels are designed to be harder. They're also designed to force players to work together, so you'll want to communicate with your partner as much as possible.Looking GoodDoom 3is incredible looking. Every room is exquisitely detailed, from the shimmer of the air near a heat source to the texture of a hamburger sitting on the counter of the company mess hall. Id obviously went all out designing every creature in the game and their realism makes them all the more horrifying. Get ready to jump out of your couch cushions!--Joshua GunnProsStunning display of graphics technologyStrong level design with lots of spookinessGreat cooperative modePlenty of hours of single-player gameplayConsThin storylineNo headlamps or gun-mounted lighting in the 22nd centuryFairly basic multi-player options","reviewerName":"ahw","summary":"Beautiful","reviewText":"The graphics for this game, as you probably already know, are simply amazing.  They are absolutely astounding, breathtaking even.  The beautifully detailed environments and models take me back to the Playstation days when FMVs were used in games like Final Fantasy VII and we all dreamt of days when the graphical quality of those FMVs would be a part of the actual game.Well that day has come.The gameplay of Doom 3 is also pretty decent.  Although the actual control is far from revolutionary (there is nothing more than point-shoot-run-jump), the environment that it is done in is suprebly crafted and well thought out.  Zombies hack at you from around dark corners, demons ambush you from behind and ammo is perfectly distributed throughout the entire game - no using the most powerful gun exclusively once you get it, as ammo is scarce enough to force you to whip out the shotgun once in awhile, but never so scarce that you have to brawl with your fists.The major problem with the game, and with all single-player games, is its lack of replayability.  Most people will probably run through it once (in about 15-20 hours) and quickly grow bored.  The multiplayer portion of the game does not seem nearly as well thoughtout as games such as Unreal Tournament and Counter Strike.Still, it's well worth the price of admission.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-21-2004"}

While there are nearly no changes in the core hardware, like a superior graphics card or cores, the quality of the system seems to have been dramatically overhauled.You've probably heard these words several times within the past few weeks in reviews, but...here goes--The new Xbox 360 S or \"Slim model\" is leaner, quieter, faster, runs cooler, and looks hot as heck with the amazingly well-done glossy finish.  In addition, there are touch buttons for the power and eject buttons.  If you're a definite hard-core gamer who plays several games at a time, the inclusion of a 250 GB HDD is a definite plus!  Download away without space worries and have the 360 turn into Ms. Whisper...definitely unlike the old models which hummed and whistled like it was high on sugar-candy.  You'll never wake up anyone again with this...well, with the exception of the new \"ding\" sounds as heard from the power and eject button.  Personally, I wish there was a way to turn these sounds off, but they're a nice touch.All in all, the new 360 S model fixes almost everything wrong with the original model and packs a great amount of features as well.  Too bad about no blu-ray...as I love the picture quality, but I doubt Microsoft would use that format as it was the main backer of the now-dead HD-DVD format.Amazing system, great library of games, awesome on-line features, and a great controller!Definitely recommended if you want to upgrade your Xbox 360 or if you are a new-comer to the HD consoles.Verdict:  Snag one UP!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-18-2010"}

You won't finish this in one sitting).There were no boring/grind parts I remember, it was just ass kicking after ass kicking after cool cutscene progressing through the story.Ran fairly well on my PC (E6850 + Radeon 6950) at 1920x1200, looked great and enjoyed the heck out of my time in Hong Kong.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-26-2013"}

{"product_name":"B001JKTC9A","reviewerName":"badazzps","summary":"BEST OF THE BEST OF THE BEST","reviewText":"If you get to this review, it means you have read alot of them. The game is not perfect, but it is pretty close. Is it the best game that I've ever played? Yup, it sure is!! Got it on Tuesday and finished it on Thursday. It took me 14 hours, but only because I was trying to collect everything (which I didn't). Maybe 12-13 hours just of regular gameplay. The Uncharted series just became my favorite, bumping down to second place the God of War series (until GOW3 comes out, then we'll see). Let's start with the bad:The initial loading takes longer than most games, but that's it for loading, you get none during gameplay. The AI is not the best, while the enemy takes cover most of the time, they are kind of stupid, especially the guards at the museum. You can stealth attack one of them and the other one who is 20 feet away won't notice anything, but that doesn't bother me. Also, I thought it was cheesy how you can empty two magazines on the last guy in the train and nothing happens to him until you fist fight him. But like I said, no biggie. There's probably a couple more that I can't remember.Good stuff:Graphis, I don't see a difference from Killzone 2 (which were really good), but that's probably because I got a 42\" 720p plasma, and not a 1080p, either that or I'm just getting old. Either way it looks fab. The cutscenes, oh man they are nice, just like a movie, the acting, the voices, the movements, the face expressions, just perfect, and funny alot of times. The storyline is awesome. Best of all is the gameplay. Some puzzles, not too hard. Lots of climbing and jumping. Lots of shooting, some people seem to have a problem with this, I sure don't. It is as smooth as any FPS. Since everyone likes to compare Call of Duty to all the games ever made, then I will say it is as smooth as Call of Duty. I did enjoy the train mission and the truck hopping, and it doesn't get any better action than the part when you are trying to destroy the tank. The game has it all, and good. Unfortunatelly I can't comment on multiplayer because I haven't tried it.Some people are saying that the game is not original, and they keep bringing up Tomb Raider and Indiana Jones. I never played any of those, but now days what game is original? Everything is invented already. Is Call of Duty original? Yea it has somethings different, but most of it is the same, \"clear the building\", \"destroy all 3 artillery\", \"clear the area\", \"plant explosives\", blah blah blah. Don't get me wrong, I'm not picking on COD, I love the game. My point is, hardly anything is original now days, unless you pick up Mirrors Edge.If you haven't played Uncharted 1, I strongly recommend you go and get a copy before you try this one. you can get a used copy for cheap. I know some people said that you can play this one before, but I wouldn't recommend it. Uncharted 2 is better than 1 in every aspect. You probably won't like Uncharted 1 as much as if you played 2 first. Well, actually, you won't like any other game after you play part 2.Here it goes again, if you have a ps3, GET THE GAME!!!If you dont have a ps3, GET ONE, THEN GET UNCHARTED 1, THEN UNCHARTED 2","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-17-2009"}

Bioshock is an early entry into the run up to a holiday game parade that appears to be incredibly strong and it's hard to imagine anything being able to beat it. I can't say I am near to finishing Bioshock yet, but I can say that this title is a must own. All elements come together in an all consuming experience that drags you into a gritty undersea city that has been consumed by madness. In the process of your avatar being thrust into surviving on little to no knowledge of the situation, you are effectively hooked. The design, sound, and pacing of the underwater world of Rapture is amazingly pulled off and serves to create an experience that is substantial and significant. The play mechanics are enjoyable and intuitive... The puzzles are natural and rewarding... The characters are frightening and interesting... Your choices hold significance. The many facets of the Bioshock experience make it a significant achievement as art and interactive entertainment.Bioshock is one of those titles that simply must be experienced in order to understand what can be great about a \"video game.\" It also illustrates why original titles should be cherished and clamored for by the public over the umpteenth sequel to a whithered franchise. The designers are able to push the limits and explore new avenues in Bioshock and it's a complete success.

{"product_name":"B000MKA60W","reviewerName":"S. Bradford \"scottfbradford\"","summary":"Solid game, but little replay value","reviewText":"I generally liked this game.  It has good graphics, good gameplay, big maps, and lots of different weapons and genetic alterations that are also upgradeable.  The failed underwater utopia called \"Rapture\" is creepy and interesting to explore.  I like the fact that ammunition is scarce, which forces you to carefully select the best weapon and gene enhancement to fight a given foe.  Bioshock reminded me a lot of Resident Evil 4, which is one of my favorite games.However, there are a few things I didn't like.  First, the game has some bugs.  One mission involved photographing 3 creatures, but the game did not credit me with one of the photos even though I had taken it.  This left me trapped in a section of the city and I was forced to restart from an earlier checkpoint.  Not a big deal, but cost me about 30 minutes.  There was also some serious framerate stuttering at times and occasionally my gun would automatically fire while I regenerated at a checkpoint.  Second, the game is repetitious.  There are only about 5 or 6 foes and maybe 3 boss battles.  Third:  the game is easy.  I played on medium setting and was able to easily beat the final boss without dying.  I can't remember ever doing that on the first try in any game.  Finally, there is little replay value in the game.  There is only a single player mission and some may want to replay it with a different strategy or a harder difficulty, but not me.  The game is too long and would be boring at this point.  I finished the game in under 2 weeks while playing only a couple of hours at a time.  If I had more free time, I could have finished it in less than a week, which would make it a rental for me.  But I think every 360 owner should try this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-03-2007"}

{"product_name":"B001IK5TJI","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Almost Epic","reviewText":"Being a huge fan of the Baulders Gate, Icewind Dale, and Never Winter Nights Dragon Age was a no brainer for me to get.  My only decision was if I wanted it for the PC or our console which is a PS3.  I pre-ordered it to get some extra goodies and ended up going with the PS3 version so I could play on our big old 52 inch HDTV with Polk surround sound.The character creation screen is very detailed.  In fact anyone can try this on the PC as there is a demo out.  I spent a good deal of time trying to pick the character class I wanted to play and adjusting the stats.  You are given various combinations from the characters background (which dictates where you start), 3 races of Human, Elf, or Dwarf and various classes in Fighter, Rouge, or Mage.  While on the surface that might not seem deep, each type has a lot of depth and tiers you can explore.  Part of the reason they might have condensed classes is because you are limited to only 4 character slots with your main person always taking up one of them.  The hardest part of making up a character here for me was not knowing what characters will come in the future and with what skill sets you might want.While the game is supposed to be a \"dark RPG\" I really did not find it to be so.  Sure, you get some tough questions thrown at you and can do some evil things but most games have that these days.  Its a good game but I really do not understand why they keep calling it 'dark'.Once things get started you will find soon that the game is filled with a lot of dialog and even some well done cut scenes.  For the most part you are given a lot of options in how you interact with others in the game.  Sometimes though it gets frustrating when you have something specific you want to ask but are not given the option.  Each decision you make impacts not only how your party members react and feel about you but also how others in the game will do the same.It is very important to keep your party happy with you as the more they like you the more loyal they will be (less chance of them turning on you or leaving), it gives them some nice perks, and can open up new quest options.  The game is littered with various 'gift' items which help raise their approval, your conversations with them (such as taking the time to talk to them) can if done correctly also increase your approval, and finally your actions and decisions impact their approval.The game play is pretty straight forward on the surface but has depth.  Your 4 characters each have their basic attacks and will use them.  You pick your target and go at it with either a hand weapon, a bow, or magic.  Once you initiate the attack, the computer runs through the motions until you want to make a change.  The depth here is you can set tactics for each character.  The system will allow you to put in a number of variables such 'if bad guy x does this, then you do this' or 'if you have health less than x, then do this'  The combos you can do are massive for all types of situations.  You can then prioritize them to your liking.  So for example my healer hangs back and heals/buffs my front line.  If a player dies she will revive them.  If she is attacked she will use a horror spell on the guy and then continue to heal while my fighter has it set to make his priority anyone that has attacked the healer which sends him after the guy now with 'horror'.  As your characters progress the options here get a lot more robust.The world itself is very detailed.  Each map has had a lot of work put into it.  Most levels are straight forward where you go from point A to B with various stops/detours along the way.  While not as open as some might like, it helps keep things simple so players do not get lost.  The loot stashes are also great in the levels because they glow with glitter and make finding loot rather easy so you do not spend a crazy amount of time looking in things.One of the bad things about the loot however is that there is no place to store it.  So if you pick up something there is no putting it back in a box to get it later if you reach your limit or just dropping it on the floor.  The game forces you to destroy the item.  Also the system for handling your inventory is absurd.  A feather takes up as much space as a full plate mail for example.  With no storage this really becomes an issue and I found myself sinking tons of money into expanding my backpack just so I can hold my basic stuff.Another frustrating part of the game is the limit to 4 players.  5 would have made much more sense for the needs of the team but when you are limited to 4 and your main character always taking up one of those slots it leaves you just 3 positions.  While some characters might have been interesting or fun to use, they never got used because I filled my needs first which kept me to the same characters most of the time.Another low point in the game was the world to explore.  While looking great with lots of detail you could NOT just go out and explore the world and look for bad guys like in Fallout 3 and other similar games.  You could only go to a place of interest and if you have already completed that area and killed everything then those bad guys never come back and your only chance to find a fight is with a random encounter moving from one area to another but even then they are few and far between.  So not only does this take the fun out of exploring the world but it also limits your fun having combat, getting more loot, or leveling up.  The loot is important since some things cost a crazy amount of money and there is no way else you will ever be able to get the good stuff.  It REALLY limits your ability to get the equipment and supplies you need.  Leveling is a similar issue.  With only 4 slots you need to get your guys some variety so they can play multiple roles, especially your mage.  The other bad thing is it reinforces you to not use other players as this would be a great place to take them out for a spin and have some fun.The final issue I have is the game just screams for coop play.  I think this would have been that much better if I could play with friends and then we could work out tactics together.While I have really enjoyed this game and feel for the most part it is great, the few issues I mentioned keep this great game from being epic.  It was worth the purchase for sure and I certainly would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a fun single player RPG.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B002V14VOC","reviewerName":"Nishi","summary":"Great survival experience in a war torn world","reviewText":"I wanted to finally try out his game since I'm a huge fan of post-apocalyptic setting. I had so much fun playing through this game and actually got challenged through parts of it. It's scary, you need to rely on good survival skills and combat isn't always the right answer. For a FPS shooter it's definitely not like the others; it has a great story that kept me captivated and combat that's a ton of fun.Story:After the tutorial the game starts you out in Exhibition and the world has been ravaged by nuclear warfare and is set in a post-apocalyptic world. Everyone is living underground to avoid the mutated creatures and radiation in manmade cities around the giant metro system that was in place before war ravaged the world.Dark Ones started becoming more aggressive and make people go crazy if damaged by them. They are also pushing the underground towns back and attacking them all the time infecting more and more people each time. Something needs to be done, or humanity will be eradicated. Artyom is thrown into this conflict thanks to Hunter's advice and you're sent on a quest to find a way to save Exhibition.The setting is really awesome to be in and you have to constantly be on your guard or die. With radiation, mutated creatures, and other humans fighting against you, the dark setting really fits right into this and makes you feel alone in the Metro's. With the overarching story mixed into this setting really sets up a great story telling experience.Gameplay:I really found the survival aspect to be really refreshing to the FPS genre. As a fan of the classic Resident Evil's, I love the fact I have to be careful with bullets running out or my gas mask failing if I mess up. Parts of the game are actually pretty freaky and had me jump at stuff. Not many games can make me get scared, but this one does a good job at it; especially towards the end of the game.When you press the M button you bring up a journal and a lighter. This is the only way to find out what you have to do and get a waypoint/compass guiding you where you need to be. The lighter is just to light up your journal in dark areas. Another cool thing they added to the game, is allowing you to run and reload at the same time (Which comes in handy when you're outnumbered and need to run away).The loading is really fast (1-3 seconds max if you have a decent pc) and each main loading screen has a paragraph the main character reads to you. That paragraph is usually what's happened so far with a mix of future events to be. Since the game was created from a novel, I think this is a wonderful call back to the original material.Combat:The game actually gets difficult at parts, even on normal. I find this to be a nice change of pace with games that you can just blow through. On top of that since you have to manage your ammo, you have to make sure your shots are on target and not missing.At times your character gets impaired and the controls get a bit wonky, like what would happen if you were doing that specific task. For example, you have to pick up something semi heavy, so your reticule moves slowly and you can't run anymore. I like this little addition for the immersion of the atmosphere and it's pretty cool when these events happen and change gameplay a bit.Exploration:Every now and then you get access to city like hubs that you can barter for weapons, ammo and health packs. NPC's have little side conversations while you're walking around and you can learn a lot about the setting just listening in. One fun thing to do is go around and knocking on people's doors, just to hear all the random little comments they yell at you.You also collect pre-war ammo that is the games main currency. In the hub cities you can purchase guns, ammo, weapons with modifications (Like a silencer) and gas mask filters. You also have an option of trading your normal ammo for pre-war ammo currency.Survival:Gas masks are extremely important in this game. When you start to venture outside and radiated areas you need to put on your mask or die. You slowly use the filters you currently have over time. Only the first few towns allow you to buy filters, so savaging them is going to be the only way you can survive.The PoV changes when you put on the gas mask, as if you are actually wearing it and the corners are a bit blurred like it has degraded over time. If you take damage the mask starts to crack, so if you you're not careful it can break and kill you. That damage stays until you change your mask and you can only change it every now and then.While you are provided with guns as your main firepower source, ammo is pretty scarce and it makes you feel like you have to take time with your shooting. You can't run around spraying and praying, unless you like using your knife all the time when you run out of ammo. The health packs have to be manually used, and it stops what you're doing to heal yourself. Makes trying to heal more strategic; instead of just healing randomly on the fly (Healing over time still happens, but you can't be hit).Soundtrack:Weapon firing noises are extremely well done. All of them sound really diverse and what I would imagine the real life firing noise would be. You can also recognize each weapon that gets fired, so you know what type of guns are being fired near or at your direction. Mods also change the sound to the weapons as well, like the silencer reducing the noise of the gun itself. Enemies can still hear the muffled silenced shot if close though (Which makes sense, if I heard that in real life, I would turn around).Music plays time to time and only really when an important action scene is happening. The loading screen has its own creepy theme but most exploration has no music playing in the background. I love soundtracks in video games but I think having less music fits this game perfectly. It adds to the immersion and listening to everything else is much more important (Breathing, enemies, footsteps etc).Graphics:Since everything is post-apocalyptic you feel a sense of doom where ever you travel. As you progress through the game the settings actually change and have different looks to them. Even though you are going though the metro most of the game, the different environmental effect makes them feel fresh and new.They did an amazing job with the outside landscape and the feeling of utter devastation. The nuclear winter makes Moscow look even more eerie with the nuclear wasteland. The buildings outside are really creepy, and I found myself looking all around making sure nothing would jump out of the shadows.IMO, this is the best game to capture the lighting effects and shadows. Different types of light source give a range of Illumination. So your flashlight is bright if you're fully charged or a really weak light if it's out of juice. All the lights in the game can be shot out, which allows you to sneak through the shadows to kill enemies with stealth.Verdict:This game is so worth the asking price: especially since it's really cheap now. It was cool trying to survive in this wilderness, the story was unpredictable and the combat was really rewarding when you stealth kill enemies. This game is more linear than the Fallout games but I still recommend this to fans of those games, since I loved the Fallout games and I loved this game as well. With all the crappy FPS games coming out these days, this is a fresh breath of air.~ Written: 07-12Positive:* Fast loading* An fps that actually requires survival* Most exploration has no music playing in the back which adds to the immersion* Amazing immersion and you feel quite alone* Everything feels dangerous wherever you go and you can easily get freaked out* Amazing atmosphere that feels devastated* Weapon sounds are unique and enemies react to themNegative:* Glitchy at times* Only relies on auto saving, no manually saving the game","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2012"}

Slightly different feel in the hands than the original (smoother texture for one) in a good way, appropriate shape.  Works  from many, many feet accurately (I tried).  There is absolutely no problem with this controller, I don't worry when I play, which is the way it's supposed to be...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-11-2008"}

{"product_name":"B000R37S00","description":"The legendary action game Castlevania: Rondo of Blood is reborn on the PSP system with incredible 3D graphics and timeless side scrolling gameplay in Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles. Gamers take up the Vampire Killer whip as Richter Belmont as they seek to destroy the maniacal Dracula once and for all in this pivotal piece of the ongoing Castlevania saga. Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles also includes the original Rondo of Blood and Symphony of the Night games, delivering incredible gameplay and value while updating two of the most beloved video games of all time for a new generation of gamers.","reviewerName":"S. Carlson","summary":"Nothing much new here","reviewText":"I do love Castlevania games and was eager to play Rondo of Blood for the first time, but I was a more than a little disappointed in this entry. Symphony of the Night was a mediocre Castevania game for the original PS, and it's gotten no better here. Rondo of Blood was enjoyable, but I feel that neither of these games utilizes the PSP to it's potential. If you just have to have a Castlevania game for your portable, you really have no other choice...but they really should have tried harder on this one.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2011"}

{"product_name":"B004P7VGF2","description":"As Vincent, a man recently succumbed to the irresistible beauty of the game's titular diversion, players find themselves swept into a treacherous love triangle. Catherine's core themes-those of free will, of the delicate nature of relationships and the choices we make within them, marry perfectly with the intense, terror-filled gameplay that serves to accurately reflect Vincent's growing sense of anxiety. It is an experience wholly unlike any to come before it, and is certain to leave gamers talking and thinking about Vincent's tribulations long after the credits have rolled.","reviewerName":"Khanh Phan","summary":"An Experience Not to be Missed","reviewText":"Catherine truly is a game unlike anything we've ever seen.  It comes from the developers of Persona 3 and 4 and it retains those games' artistic style.  The meat of the gameplay involves challenging, but rewarding puzzle gameplay where Vincent must climb out of his deadly dreams to survive.  Although it sounds like there is not a lot of variation of gameplay, you will want to hurry up and get to the next level to see what you can improve on.The other portion is where you play as Vincent in a bar and manage your karma meter to either the Good Katherine, or the Bad Catherine.  The story itself is very intriguing with themes of love, cheating, children, and marriage.Catherine is a game not to be missed, it may not be for everyone, but I will say that  everyone can find value in its unorthodox gameplay and story.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2012"}

What is up with the negative reviews? This game is fun and a bit frustrating. This game started in RE 4. RE: Mercenaries rules are simple; you chose a character and you fight monsters. The more monsters you kill, the more monsters will attack even bigger, stronger, scary, and badass monsters will also attack you. You have to more collect points in time limit before it runs out. If you collect more points and stars, you will get unlockables. If you want to kill an endless monsters, this game is a recommended. If you are an true fan of RE, you can buy this game if you want to and do not listen to the negative reviews.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00005TNI6","description":"Final Fantasy Xis the first title in this landmark RPG series to be released for the PlayStation2. The main characters are Tidus, a star of blitzball (a hugely popular sport in the Final Fantasy universe), and Yuna, who has learned the art of summoning and controlling aeons, powerful spirits of yore. These two people of different backgrounds must work together as they journey through the world of Spira. This installment of Final Fantasy has a distinctly Asian influence, bringing a fresh feel to the characters, music, settings, and story.Features include voice-overs for the first time in the series (utilizing the Facial Motion System), high-polygon, motion-captured player characters designed by Tetsuya Nomura, and a camera that automatically adjusts its perspective to correspond with the movements of the characters--a feature now possible because the game is largely polygonal.","reviewerName":"Stewart J. Gaddy","summary":"Like, Aaahhh, Totally Awesome","reviewText":"Hail to the person who got rid of that stupid junctioning system in one of the previous Final Fantasy games.  The fighting scheme is much simpler.  The graphics and story are great.  I actually care about what happens to the characters, except Riccu.  The FF series is the only role playing games I've ever played and except for the one mentioned in the first sentence above, they have not let me down.  Problem is, my wife is mad at me because I played this game before she did.  I can only play when she is at work.  Thanks a lot Squaresoft!!!  You've done it again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-31-2002"}

{"product_name":"B000KRXAGE","description":"Wii Play collects nine quick and addictive games that are easy to pick up and play and hard to put away. Thanks to the intuitive controls of the Wii Remote, even the most inexperienced gamers will have no trouble mastering the controls.    &lt;p&gt; Wii Play features nine separate mini-games, including the following: &lt;li&gt;Shooting Range, a point-and-fire game of target practice in the Duck Hunt tradition. &lt;li&gt;Billiards, a simplified variation of nine-ball with stunningly realistic physics that uses your Wii Remote as your pool cue. &lt;li&gt;Find Mii, in which you scan the crowds to find the right Mii&#8212;and Miis you and your friends created make an appearance. &lt;li&gt;Tanks!, in which you command a toy tank on a miniature battlefield in a gauntlet of 100 missions. &lt;li&gt;Other games include Pose Mii, Table Tennis, Fishing, Charge!, and Laser Hockey. &lt;p&gt; Every game features a multiplayer mode, so you and your friends can compete for the high score or go head to head to see who&#8217;s the best.  Wii Play comes with a white Wii Remote so that your friends can join in the action. (Nunchuk not included.)","reviewerName":"S. Melvin","summary":"For the price of a remote, you get a game and a remote","reviewText":"This purchase is almost too easy.  You get a remote control for the Wii and a gamepack.  Granted, the games are by no stretch of the imagination hit releases, but they are some good classics made to Wii format.  Duck hunt?  Yes!  Pool? Awkward, but fun!  Ping pong?  Yao!If this package included the Wii remote attachment piece, it would have been the perfect set.  Remote, attachment and a game - all for a very reasonable price.  Now, Wii technology is getting a bit long in the tooth, but the games are still pretty fun and honestly, it is  the first console to incorporate motion into gaming, so it should get kudos just for that.Overall, the games aren't stellar, but fun - the remote is a nice bonus and the price is hard to beat.  And to ensure you know what you are getting - this is a real licensed Wii remote, not some generic knockoff that will stop working after 2-3 uses.  If you've been looking for another remote and fun way to kill a day inside with the family - get this gamepack and play to your hearts content.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-08-2013"}
