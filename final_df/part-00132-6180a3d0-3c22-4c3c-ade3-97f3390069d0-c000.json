Frank escapes to the local shopping mall, thinking it will be a bastion of safety but it turns out to be anything but. It will be a true struggle to survive the endless stream of enemies, but players will have full reign of a realistic shopping center and its varied stores offering an endless supply of real and makeshift weapons to fight off the flesh-hungry mob.

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this game.Story: You are in a castle kingdom called Illumina and your party includes a scientist named Elco, a warrior named Tal, a princess named Ailish, and a anthromorph (half animal, half human girl) named Buki. The queen of the kingdom wants the kingdom protected and seeks Elco to build a barrier. He needs crystals to power the barrier so you try and hunt down the powerful crystals. You later find out that Queen wants the crystals for another purpose. Later in the game you travel through a portal that is actually an alter reality to your own and you come across yourselves, though slightly different in appearance but with the same abilities.Gameplay: There are 4 main characters you get to control throughout the game but that later doubles to 8 when you find your alter selves in the other realm, though one of them is not controllable (Elco's alter self). Combat is real time and you control 1 of the characters during combat while the others are controlled by the AI. You can switch between characters during combat. Each character has Skill Strike and Spirit Strike abilities that upgrade and expand throughout the game. Each character has certain button combos they can use during fighting for more powerful strikes. The game plays like a an RPG and you travel to multiple areas and towns. There are numerous side quests available if you talk to all the NPCs you come across in the game. Each main character has a different spirit power that they need to track down to upgrade, such as the Cat for Buki, Wolf for Tal, Eagle for Ailish, and a Dragon for Elco. Every time the character finds his symbol in the game, they will upgrade in Spirit power and abilities. You can upgrade all your weapons in each town or find weapons in areas outside of towns. Each character has an ultimate weapon. Your characters all have a unique ability that allows them to travel to areas that they can only reach.Overall, great game.

Often I did get frustrated at the amount of time it took me to get from one end of a battle to the other, only to get sniped from behind and start over. (run... run...run... run... run......... die...... repeat....) But adjusting your game play to take advantage of squads and vehicles, helps cut down on being shot from behind while you advance across the field.It can often be difficult to ID friend or foe, as there will be a mess of HUD displays blocking your view of an enemy running at you.I'm also not a huge fan of the load out process, but the addition of the Battlelog android app actually helps to sort through your load out ahead of time and figure out what you want to use.Normally I prefer the fast paced, close quarters of COD, but luckily BF4 thought of this and set up a few different &#34;no vehicle&#34; close quarter maps and game modes. (i.e.: team death match, etc...)The single player campaign is good... but the story is a typical shooter storyline. What I really miss is the humor and story behind the Battlefield: Bad Company games. (Those kept me engaged in the single player game longer before I ventured online.)From a graphical standpoint, this really is beautiful game. The guns are detailed, and the environments are awesome. Being able to blow a hole in a wall to get to someone is cool, but sometimes I found walls that somehow are made of some indestructible substance.Control wise it takes a lot of getting used to. While similar to most FPS controls, for some reason I find controlling vehicles far more difficult than they are in other games.Overall this is should be in any true FPS collection.

While I have not hit the new episode of Half-life 2, I have played the first episode as well as Bioshock recently.  I would say this game tops those easily.Lets start with the pro's:1. The game was built for both XP and Vista, so none of that sad little marketing ploy of \"You need the amazing powers of Vista to play this.\"  The visual difference for games such as Shadowrun and Halo 2 wasn't enough to merit an upgrade and it is good to see that this game appeals to everyone (unless you are a Mac user, not sure if it is available for that).2. Looks absolutely amazing and runs very smooth on my machine.  I recently went through a pc upgrade for some new gaming.  Using a Core 2 Duo, 8800 GTS, and even just 2 gigs of ram, this game looked wonderful.  I haven't seen quality like this before in any game.  While Half'Life 2 did very well, Timeshift's use of focal distance, blurring effects and water reflections was amazing.3. The control worked well in this game.  I love games where you can load it up and start playing immediately without fiddling with buttons for the next few hours.  If you have played any PC FPS before, you will fall into this easily enough.4. Gameplay.  Odd that this is actually last on my list of Pro's, but it is the last thing I see when starting a game.  The reason I value this game over any Half-Life or Bioshock is simply the amazing gameplay.  The use of time powers to reverse, slow or stop time is incredible.  While you may play those annoying teeter-totter puzzles of Half-Life just so Valve can show off a physics engine, the added dimension of time gives this game a complete edge over the competition.While these powers did make combat interesting, I didn't feel that they unbalanced the game.  Even on the normal skill level I sure died enough times to prove that.And the con's:1. I had a score of rather nasty crashes when I tried to play with the game settings.  I use on board sound in my machine, which usually sounds like total garbage in any game.  I went into the sound settings to attempt to turn down the default quality, and locked up my computer.  After resetting and starting the game once again, ALL of the default configs were gone.  Sound, Video, Control, everything was wiped and would not restore.Attempting to manually fix everything caused one of the worst error messages I had ever seen.  How often does a game dump you into a debug screen full of what looked like assembly code?I did a reinstall and never touched the settings again, game worked well after that but I was too scared to try and fix my sound or play with my video modes after that.2. I felt a distinct lack of plot details when I started into this game.  You pick up bit and pieces as you go along (Much like the tape recorders in Bioshock) but I miss the days where you started at the beginning of the story and followed it along.  Having to read a plot summary later to fill in gaps isn't my idea of a very deep gaming experience.Overall, I loved this game.  I never touched the multiplayer aspect of it, but I would assume that since you wander around and shoot things in both modes, the multiplayer works well.  From what I have read, the use of time powers makes an interesting experience.If possible I would give this game 4.5 stars due to the lack of an engrossing storyline as well as my crash issue.  But then again, most gamers would shell out the 15 bucks and buy a decent card to avoid this issue altogether.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-12-2007"}

The core gameplay is still the same and is good fun once you get a few hours into it. The graphics are decent but won't blow you away like the pc versian.

This game loads more than you actually play it. It simply ruins the action! Your in the middle of a tense adrenaline pumped chase and your really into it when it all suddenly stops and the game loads. The loading times last between seven to thirty seconds and it really just makes you want to swear at the t.v. screen. Half-life 2 for x-box isn't bad game but it is completley inferior to the p.c. problem which had loading problems as well. It's possibly worth a rental if can sit through all the constant loading but beyond the loading issue it's worth a playthrough.

I don;t think it was a 5 star game but it was definitely a good game.You are the trick-fighter pilot Star Fox and you are accompanied by a Frog and a Rabbit (sorry the names aren't coming back to me) and with their help, you destory evil enemies and their warships in an attempt to bring peace back to the galaxy.O.k. first off the game play was very easy to get used to. All you had to do was aim, shoot, dodge and occasionally, pull off the barrel roll shooting which was fun to do. Anyone could get this game and get good at it and for a lot of people, that's a great part about a game.One of the things that I truly didn't like about Star Fox was that is was a 1P only game. Honestly, why give you a couple of guys that help you through out the game if you can't have a couple of your friends come over and take control of those characters. I think if this would have been a multi link game, a lot more people (than already established) would have been all over this game.The other thing that bothered the pants off me was that your 2 buddies never help you when you need them. I was getting grilled by a dozen enemies and all those 2 could do was hang out and watch me get beat up. Again, what's the point of having extra characters to help you when they don't do anything to help you. All they did (at least when I played) was get beat up and I'd have to save them everytime but whenever I'd have someone on my tail... \"oh watch out Fox\". Thanks for nothing!Even though those were 2 really annoying parts of this game, it was still fun to play and again, any level gamer could get really good at this game.

Kick butt.Graphics: This was an early PC port, so running it on a PS3 means there are framerate issues occasionally, and the general level of detail is a little old school. Having said that, the detail in the daylight and atmospheric effects are really nice.  There's one level during an approaching desert thunderstorm, and having seen a few when I lived out west, the detail is right on. Entering Juarez by chopper with the skyline littered with AA fire and smoking buildings was stunning.Play: The gameplay is really the thing, here.  Having played Rainbow 6 Las Vegas, I was surprised how much more (way more!) FUN this game engine was. I loved clicking on the right stick while running toward a wall and watching Capt. Mitchell actually slide into a crouch. On some levels, you'll commandeer a 3 man squad (you can mix riflemen w/grenadiers, machine gunners, medics or a marksman), clicking your left stick will bring up each members helmet cam, allowing you to target individual units, or give orders to heal a teammate. Your teammates will also call out targets, AND their location, which is really cool (\"Target!  By the Blue Car!\"). Pulling your right trigger will give you control over various gadgets and support units, ranging from an aerial recon drone to a mobile weapons cache ('the Mule') that comes in handy for healing Capt. Mitchell, or drawing enemy fire or even as a battering ram. In later levels, you can also give orders to a Stryker, a Chopper, an M1A2 Abrams, and even anti-tank air strikes (I'd like to point out that the explosions are particularly loud and satisfying!). There are also shoot em up sequences where you man the minigun on a chopper to take down enemy convoys (fun, but there's an odd lack of ambient sound in these sections, like the sound of the rotors.. strangely absent).Glitches: I did have this game lock up on me once or twice, during transitional sections, and occasionally, the squad would get hung up on obstacles and not follow the regroup order.  Didn't ruin the game, but forewarned is forearmed (make sure your squad is ACTUALLY with you lol).Other reviewers have commented on the shortness of the single player campaign. I would agree it's a little on the short side, but it's not dull, and the command options and weapons choices make all the scenarios alot more replayable. And there's plenty to do online when you finish it, it's definitely a solid engine for online play.For under 20$, it's a gameplay bargain, in this reviewers opinion.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-25-2008"}

While the game does indeed live up the hype it did exceed my expectations and ultimately turned out to be one of the most innovative JRPG's that I've played in years - and this is including most of the JRPG's that have appeared on the 360 over the past few years.What really impressed me right off the bat with this game is the freshness of its overall presentation.  The entirety of P3 is wrapped in a funky, upbeat chic of a neon-lit Tokyo with all of its trappings.  Everything from menu design, pacing, soundtrack has a glossy, snazzy, modern hue to it and gives this rpg a whole new vibe that one typically does not encounter when playing games in this genre.  The game is also packed with a surprisingly serviceable storyline and a smattering of memorable and compelling characters.  The way the game time is structured is also worth mention.  Basically the game takes place over an entire calendar year and players will play through each and every day within this year ultimately deciding how to utilize their time each day (study at school?  Pursue friendships to build up S-links? Dungeon Grind?  Rest up for a big fight?).  This timeline structure allows the game and its settings to evoke the mood and seasons of a Tokyo high school along with its accompanying seasonal festivities and other important events.Recently finishing my first play through, my game clocked in at about 117 hours (I tend to take my time and like to explore everything possible) and I have yet to finish the additional storyline added to this 'FES' edition of the game.  My only nitpick on this title is that the dungeon grind aspects of this game tend to become tedious at a certain point but thanks in parts to the strong story/character arcs that comprise a good deal of your game time the positives ultimately far outweigh this one hassle.  This game is a must buy for anyone who enjoys JRPG's or for those with a curiosity and fondness for modern Tokyo culture.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-18-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001HWB68K","reviewerName":"A. Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Great storytelling, decent action, lacking in length","reviewText":"Halo 3: ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Trooper) is a first person shooter set in the Halo universe.  Your character, trapped in a futuristic Mombasa, battles Covenant soldiers in an attempt to locate his squad mates.  The story of ODST unfolds in a series of timeline jumps that span multiple characters.I played this game through, in co-op, in about 5 hours.  It was very short, in my opinion, and really only constitutes an expansion pack's length worth of material.  That being said, playing through the Campaign in co-op was a fantastic experience.  The story is very rich and told in a unique manner, and the tasks required are varied enough that each mission feels different and new.  ODST does have Halo 3's epic quality of story telling, but the scope is much smaller as it is contained to one squad and one city.  The story is also supplemented via various \"audio logs\" that can be found as you go along.  They are mostly obnoxious in that they can drown out the surrounding sounds -- so you either need to stop and listen to them, or risk missing telltale signs of the enemy near by.The maps feels a bit more open than Halo 3, which is a nice change.  You can use multiple tiers to circumvent or flank enemies, as well as traverse through some buildings to achieve the same goal.  Having played the Campaign in co-op I never felt too choked with my partner near by -- which is the opposite of some of the Halo 3 levels.  I felt like we had the opportunity to use team tactics more effectively on the enemy.You really do feel like a lite version of Master Chief, however.  You don't seem to get the special items, and your health works slightly differently.  You still have a shield that regenerates over time, but you have static health.  You can get health packs at various places in the game...  but it basically feels the same.  The only major irritation is the beeping sound you have to endure while your health is not at 100%.I can't comment too deeply on the story itself as that would contain many spoilers.  The story is the best part of the game, honestly, and is worth the full price of the game.  What is startling is, when reflected upon, how few \"levels\" they actually created.  They used the space well.I tried Firefight with a friend and found that to be great fun.  I highly advise anyone who picks this up to give that a shot.  It is essentially a waves-style co-op stand-off game.  It has its own intricate rules -- a shared pool of lives, the concept of \"rounds\", a central base that is restocked with supplies every round -- and so forth.I have not ventured into the multiplayer action.  My copy came with a second disk full of multiplayer action and maps.  For people into the MP, I'm sure this is a great bonus.All in all, an entertaining and fun game, though rather short, that is worth the cost.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-31-2009"}

Mauricio","summary":"Immitation is the highest form of flattery.","reviewText":"If you're going to imitate a well proven franchise like Mario Kart, you should take a cue from Sumo Digital's new combat racer Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing. Honestly, this game is so good, the only things I miss are the Nintendo characters. This game was developed by the same people who made newer OutRun games as well as GTI Club on the PSN, so they do know a thing or two about arcade style racers.20 Sega All-Stars make up the roster here includes primarily of Sonic franchise characters like Sonic, Tails, Eggman, Amy, as well as characters like Ryo Hazuki (Shenmue), Beat (Jet Grind/Set Radio), Akira and Jacky (Virtua Fighter), Ai Ai (Super Monkey Ball), Opa Opa (Fantasy Zone), etc.The gameplay is smooth and easy. You'll only be using the L1, R1, and X buttons predominantly. R1 used for accelerating and L1 allows you to drift or power slide through rough corners. Much like in modern Mario Kart games, efficient use of power sliding will give you speed boosts therefore giving you an advantage over the competition. The combat aspect of the game comes from the game's standard arsenal of weapons your player can pick up. Missiles, boxing gloves, mines are some of the generic pick ups you can get along with a special \"power-up\" technique that each of the game's 20 characters can posses. These are like the invincible stars you pick up from the Mario Kart games. Though unlike Mario Kart, these special powers come different forms depending on the characters you pick. For example, Amy whacks around a pink mallet hitting any one on her way or Ryo Hazuki drives his infamous crane from the original Shenmue and pushes off any opponent he touches.Visually and design-wise, Sumo Digital did a spectacular job with this game. The game has 24 tracks based on locations found in Sega's games. Each track successfully captures the feel of the game it takes inspiration from. For example, the stages from Samba De Amigo are super vibrant with rich colors, the characters you see in the game, and the houses and cacti dancing to the music. Tokyo-To from Jet Set Radio has the same cell shaded style that made the Xbox sequel so iconic in its own right. Curien Manor from the House of the Dead is full of ghouls and monsters that you may recognize from the game. Nor only do the tracks look and are well designed, the game is just downright pretty from a technical standpoint. The game isn't constant 60 frames but the frame rate never dips into unplayable levels. Truth be told this game is the best looking kart racer on the market, and the first one in HD.Sonic & Sega-All Stars Racing is the best kart racer you'll find on the PS3. It's smooth gameplay with sharp controls make it a Mario Kart knock off that successfully does imitate the iconic series. Oh did I forget to mention that the game has many modes as well as secrets to unlock? Well yeah it does. Play it with a friend or random players, this game is best played in multiplayer. At 50 bucks, there's really no reason to skip this game if you like arcade or kart style racing. It's not the most ground breaking kart racer, but the game feels so right in every aspect.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-14-2010"}

As with the original, whichever character wins the battle gets the opportunity to complete a Fatality, which is every bit as violent as it sounds.

It was gory and fun as hell. If you missed it because you were too young, you should definitely try this one out on the PS3 on PSN.Mortal Kombat II upped the character amount, the gory fatalities and all of the game's ruthlessness. Old favorites such as Raiden, Lui Kang, Scorpion, Sub-Zero and Johnny Cage make their return here while newcomers like Mileena, Kitana, Jax and Baraka made the game much cooler than its predecessor. The graphics were crisper and made more colorful, the sounds more varied and the settings much more detailed/eerie. The game was just an all-around delight to experience.Not everything was perfect, however. The main thing I'd like to say about this game that brings the score down  is the difficulty. Playing through on Normal was somewhat tolerable, but any higher and the game gets damn ruthless. You would find yourself dying over and over again even if you were just facing the second person up the totem pole. To this day, I still haven't completed this game in all of its difficulties and I have no desire to. The game just gets too cheap too soon. But that's what 2-player mode is for!All in all, still one of the best fighting games you could ever ask for. It had nice graphics for its time, contains my two favorites characters (Sub-Zero and Kitana), introduced Babalities and just made the series that much harder to live up to itself later on. III was solid, but it wasn't II. Deadly Alliance was great but it (as well as some of the characters) didn't have the same \"umph\".

Occasionally some quests won't let you complete them (although Microsoft has already issued one patch for this).But far and away the worst thing abut this game is it's lack of direction.

Taylor","summary":"Half of a Great Game","reviewText":"Fable 2 is a Good game that could have easily been great.  The game seems rushed out the door to meet the holiday rush. There are numerous bugs, some are gamebreakers.  One of the major gripes is the use of only one save file, which autosaves.  In a game all about \"major\" choices, this seems to be a dumb move by the developers.The game is not as open as games such as Oblivion but it tries to be.  I found that if I killed NPCs they would disappear for an hr then be replaced by a carbon copy with a different name.Some highly publicised features are not as dramatic as you would think. Take for instance the dog. The game manual states that it will take on very drastic visual changes based on your moral alignment.  The only change i found was that the dog was a Golden retriever when I was a Saint and just a dark colored version of the same dog when I was being naughty.  I expected the dog to be a vicious Kujo clone or something.The game is not very balanced either.  It is very easy to max out the upgradeable stats( strength, spells etc.)  So halfway through the game I have useless xp reserves.  This is a small problem though.  Another problem is, there are few weapon stats to compare weapons with.  This leads to the game randomly telling you weapons are better and you taking it's word for it.The menu system kinda sucks too.  If I bought 6 potions and I wanted to use them all.  I would have to pause the game and go into the items menu then select the potions menu then select the potion i wanted and repeat this same process 6 times.  Also when you go to buy weapons there is no comparison screen showing how the store weapons compare to the weapons in your inventory.  So you have to exit the buying menu to see your current weapon is better. But all of these are small annoyances.My major annoyance is the games unclimactic ending.The level designs and art are gorgeous and the sound is pretty good as well.  There are plenty of emotional moments in the game. One toward the middle actually forces you to make probably the hardest decision in the game.The economy system is a pretty well thought out idea.  You purchase stores and houses.  You can lower the prices/rent in these properties and this will make the towns economy stronger.  If you raise the prices/rent the economy suffers.  Plus you get paid every 5min in real time based on the properties you own.  If only GTA4 had something like this.All in all Fable 2 is a good game with a short main story but tons of side quests and secrets.  It is plagued by little annoyances and bugs but is still an enjoyable game. I would give it 3 and a half stars but I went with 4 instead of giving it 3.

They all test my powers of eloquence, and all the verbal embellishment probably isn't necessary to communicate the simply point that this game is absolutely, staggeringly, phenomenal.All the narratives in my head end up something like this in structure: \"First was good, second was great, third is absolutely dazzling, and here's how & why.\" Instead of writing a novella about spoilers (others have taken care of this) I will instead, simply, relate a few relatively discontinuous thoughts & observations:- It's bigger & better, more detailed and more involved than AC-II, by far. Storyline, open world, texture qualities and effects, cinematics. And as mentioned above, AC-II was already \"great\" in my book - top-5 game of all time. This one slides in to an easy #1 spot for me.- There are more types of side-missions involving more types of secondary characters.- It has better fighting dynamics, better moves, and generally speaking, superior (and more gleefully enjoyable) @$$-kicking.- The artwork, in terms of realism, detail, variety, and sheer staggering scale, is to my knowledge unprecedented in gaming. This map is so big and so detailed it literally could (and I would argue, SHOULD) provide a virtual world for use in other games - like leasing a hosting platform, they could realistically license this virtual world as a commodity and allow other studios to create new stories, themes, etc, in this world. I would love to see / do more in this world.This game really takes everything that was already great in the second game and makes it even better, more elaborate, and immersive. You definitely don't need to have played the first or second one to enjoy this game; really, it may just make some parts of the story line being continuous and making a little more sense right out of the box. And obviously, playing the earlier games will help you enjoy the 'saga' of the storyline. However, within a couple of minutes, you get the hang of everything anyway, and a couple of minutes after that you're just totally immersed in this game anyway.Buy it. This one's worth having and playing... it's just a spectacular game!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B004EDJOYC","description":"","reviewerName":"Scratchy","summary":"So close to a really good game.","reviewText":"Is it enjoyable yes.  Is the game broken unfortunately yes.  You think they would fix alot of things that was wrong with it the first time before rereleasing it on the ps3 instead of just adding new features.  Far as i know they have since i have not played the xbox or pc versions so for all i know it could be a ton better but still kinda bad.First of all this game is best suited for people who love sniping.  People who hate sniping or aren't very good at it will probably hate this game.  Does this game have it's faults yes many, but the sniping makes up for it(atleast for me).  If you can over look some of its faults you can really enjoy a game like this.  Now for the breakdown...The good :)Graphics aren't amazing but pretty good for a modern shooter.  Nothing Battlefield or Cod worth but definitely better looking than Medal of Honor.Sound is great.  The music during the missions adds to the tension of being shot at while trying to snipe people and not getting noticed.  Also the sound that a silenced sniper rifle makes is just awesome.Bullet cam.  This is the best part of the game IMO.  You setup your shot, measure wind, monitor your breathing keeping it steady (shooting during exhales increases accuracy for those long shots), guessing when to aim your shots so it won't get interrupted by the rain/wind, measuring bullet drop (the further your enemy is the more likely gravity will pull the bullet down so you need to aim over your target).  For those of you who are lazy Easy and Normal modes of the game come with all that factored in an easy to read red dot.  Point, shoot and then watch your shot travel all the way to your enemy.  Glorious!!!  Another use for the bullet cam would be to scope out the area to see where other enemies would be hiding since your bullet pretty much acts as a really fast disposable camera lol.The bad :(The AI is terrible.  Laying down in prone and picking off a battalion of enemies is fun but i was hoping for a challenge.  Why give us claymores and C4 when the enemy doesn't even come to look for you.  When one of their friends gets taken out they run for for 4 feet then just duck.  Yes they just duck.  For casual sniping fans who are playing on easy, normal this is awesome you just keep getting more crazy headshots and more bullet cams but i was expecting better than that.Glitches galore. Some are good like being able to exploit the poor level/movement design and climb up rocks very cheaply and have great vantage points to snipe from.  Also you can use this same glitch to possibly bypass entire camps by glitching your way up a wall instead of having to carefully snipe/sneak your way through.Then there is bad glitches, like the trophies glitch.  It's not bad if your not a trophy hound but if you are it is very time consuming to have to redo tasks over and over because the game reads things you haven't done yet as already done and therefore it wont unlock.  There are a number of trophies in the game that won't pop even if you have done it 5+ times.  Example \"One shot, Two Kills\", the shoot 2 enemies with one bullet trophy i've done atleast 10 times before i seen it pop.  Another notorious trophy is the \"Fallen Eagle\" Trophy where you need to shoot 10 eagles out of the sky.  Apparently if you can't unlock this trophy the other trophies in the game won't unlock causing some people to have to delete their saves and play the game over from scratch.  So its advised to get that trophy out of the way during the tutorial.  If it doesn't pop you don't have to go far when you start over.The movement and level design mechanics are broken and annoying.  If you jump over anything you will end up slipping and getting stuck into crevaces alot!  When your crouched you can't climb stairs.  It is advised to crouch everywhere to avoid being spotted so being crouched when sneaking through an enemy camp is usually what you will be doing alot unless you need to climb something.  So you end up having to stand up and possibly make noise in order to climb stairs and risk being seen.The rest :/This is not a COD type game but if you wanted to you can pick up an Assault rifle and go through the game setting off alarms, shooting people and lobbing grenades to your hearts desire like in any COD game.  That sounds awesome to some people but for me i thought the whole point of a game like this was stealth seeing how its called Sniper: GHOST warrior.  But the game doesn't really punish you for setting off alarms so its possible to go through the game clumsy as hell just shooting people left and right with no regard for stealth whatsoever.  Meh...The main game is pretty easy (even on hard).  As long as your used to setting up your shot, know about bullet drop, leading your bullets for moving targets and everything else involved the game isn't that hard.  It is extremely rewarding to pull off bullet cams without the red dot telling you where to aim and also very frustrating for some of the longer shots in the game.  Thank god a good chunk of the sniper rifles you use are semi-automatic and not single shot or i would have failed some of the time sensitive kill shots. I.e. Sniping a general standing on top of a moving yacht from 350 meters away before he sails off, or trying to hit a sniper in a communications tower from 250 meters away while jets are flying over head masking your shots.The bonus missions and the challenge mode which is the new features in the game is the hardest part of the game and yet the most glitched.  It is very fun but at some point the glitchiness of the game makes getting those trophies a chore.  In every new level there is a possible glitch that will make you not get the trophy for that level, so you will end up having to delete your save and try again.Much like the rest of the game the multiplayer is not great but pretty fun.  A big map with a ton of campers usually would suck for people who love action but there is also the choice of running around and gunning people down with your handgun.  I found the most fun playing on the tower map where you have to snipe people in other towers while trying not to get sniped yourself.Far as i can see the game is imperfect that is probably why it was released for $40.  But it is definitely fun, if you into a somewhat realistic sniper shooter with long distance cinematic head/body shots.  If you like that sort of thing then i say give this game a try.To sum It all upGraphics 8+Sound 9AI 5Glitched trophies (unacceptable) 0The Extras 9The Sniping 11","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2011"}

They had the same thing going for them - a well-done career mode and tons of content. While I didn't play Forza 4, I did get Forza 3 and while I really did not like that game's career mode, I had a great time in the hot lap mode, working on my times and tweaking my cars. So it is with Forza 5. The staid career mode is more than made up by the hot lap mode, called Rivals. If you are into beating times and improving, it's great.The career mode, while a bit dry, is better than most. I will say the game benefits a lot from the Drivatar system. Normally the AI in these games is just awful. In Gran Turismo they are scripted and stick to the line. In Forza they go from being terrible in one difficulty to perfect speed demons in the next. Here there is a large amount of granularity in difficulty and they drive dynamically and keep you guessing. It works.Forza 5 is a launch game, as we all know, and to its credit it still feels like a fully-formed game with a lot of content. There is a lot to do in this game. It suffers, though, compared to games on last-ten platforms. Forza 5 has far less content than Forza 4 and still lacks some things in GT5/6. By now I feel that Forza definitely needs a weather system, night tracks, and other types of races.I hope Forza 6 can really bring it home and blow everyone away.

{"product_name":"B002I0K3M0","description":"","reviewerName":"tdl","summary":"A creative party game and technology demonstartion","reviewText":"Nintendo Land isn't anything like what you've played before. It isn't Mario party style, nor is it Wii Sports. It was intended to be a small little demonstration of the Wii U's capabilities, but it ended up being so much more. As the obnoxious robot host, Monita, took me throughout the theme park hub world, I realized this game was going to be something special. I was expecting it to be some lousy mini-game collection like Game Informer had promised it would be, but instead it was an AWESOME mini-game collection just like what Nintendo promised. The twelve mini games are highly diverse, from the on-rail Zelda themed shooter to the extremely addictive Octopus Dance rhythm game. The games (in no particular order):Yoshi's Fruit Cart: 7/10- Your Mii hops on a robotic Yoshi and you must draw a path to all of the fruits that are on the TV screen. Not easy at all since the fruits are not displayed on the Gamepad controller screen.Ninja Castle: 8/10- Based on a Legend of Zelda style Famicom RPG, the goal of this mini game is to aim the Gamepad at the TV and slide your finger across it to launch ninja stars at the origami ninjas who kidnapped Monita (the host of Nintendo Land).Octopus Dance: 10/10- This is my favorite game. Based on the 1980 Game and Watch game Octopus,  you have to copy the diver's dance moves in time with the beat. What makes this game so good? It has crazy funky catchy music and is some really epic moments (like when the octopus eats your brother's Mii).Captain Falcon's Twister Race: 8/10- Based on the F Zero series, your goal is to finish the race before time is up. It has amazing graphics and really good music.DK Crash Course: 9/10- An amazingly complex obstacle course with the original Donkey Kong arcade look to it. Really fun and has kept me occupied for months.Balloon Trip Breeze: 7/10- It is basically the Balloon Trip mode of the NES game Balloon Fight remastered. Fly high with balloons while avoiding the spikes, fish, birds, water, wind, and every other thing under the sun.Mario Chase: 4/10- For a mini game starring Nintendo's biggest character, I would have thought that they would have put more effort into it. It uses the same engine as Sweet Day and Ghost Mansion, except it is dulled to the point where THE TOADS of all people chase Mario around a field. Why Toads? What did Mario do them? Why do the Yoshis from Fruit Kart invade this game and ruin the challenge? I really don't know.Luigi's Ghost Mansion: 8/10- This game is pretty addictive. The person with the Gamepad gets to be the ghost and the Wiimote people have to find them and catch them with their flashlight. The ghost person has to sneak up on the Wiimote users and scare them.Animal Crossing Sweet Day: 9/10- The colorful world of Animal Crossing is a perfect example of the graphical capabilities of Wii U. Not only that, the person using the Gamepad uses both analog sticks simultaneously to control the guards trying to catch the animals who are eating all the candy.The Legend of Zelda Battle Quest: 7/10- An auto moving battle game where you use the Gamepad as a crossbow to defeat the monsters in your path. It can be difficult but is a good demonstration of the gyroscopic technology.Pikmin Adventure: 6/10- It isn't the most exciting game in the park, although one of the most advanced.Metroid Blast: 7/10- I feel Metroid Blast is a little over-complicated, and although fun, really is confusing.Of course Nintendo Land rewards you for playing the games. You can earn coins that unlock decorations, music, and extra features. A tournament mode is also available and is developed so where everybody gets a turn. Nintendo Land is a score if you can get it for cheap (or in the Deluxe Wii U Promotion).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-19-2013"}
{"product_name":"B004EW948E","description":"","reviewerName":"J. Leigh \"JL\"","summary":"Don't judge a game by it's cover art","reviewText":"When this game first came out, I took one look at the cover art and the silly name of the title and never looked at it again.When it hit the bargain bins I again ignored it for the same reason. The cover art makes the game look like a cheap 90s game, whereas in fact this game has quite a lot of depth- the visuals, the characters, the gameplay and the plot are all quite engaging, and certainly more so than the popular critics give it credit for.Some highlights of the gameplay\"- When the robots are shot they come apart piece by piece and continue to function. So they will continue to crawl at you and shoot you. If you shoot off their head they will walk around shooting blindly. This adds something new to the first person shooter genre.- You earn points as you play which you can cash in to either improve your skills or buy more bullets, med packs, nano enhancements, etc- not to dissimilar to Borderlands.- You get to choose your squad mates and when you are shot down you can either use a medpack on yourself to revive, or if you are out, you can ask one of your squad mates for help. And while you are in this injured state you can still crawl (e.g. into safety) and continue to shoot before you eventually die or are revived by your squad mate.- The script and voice acting are decent (for a Japanese title).  Each character has a distinct personality/attitude which makes them engaging though cliched perhaps, but surprisingly they are sometimes humorous. This is refreshing for a FPS. I don't think I have ever laughed at or with any of the Halo and Gears of War characters. Probably the most cheesy line in the game is \"Holler if you're dead!\" which later you discover was intended to be cheesy as the game laughs at itself.- I really appreciate being able to give voice commands to your squad mates using a microphone. It is something seldom used in a first person shooter but makes a lot of sense. Further I liked the fact that if you shoot your squad mates they will eventually lose trust in you and stop following your orders. Also if you compliment them too much they eventually get irritated. Lastly the trust system will determine who will fight with or against you in the finale.- Just when the game starts to feel repetitive toward the end they change up the story a bit and things quickly start to conclude.- Watch the end credits all the way through- there is a final cutscene.As others have mentioned, the multiplayer is rather weak. The character selection is very generic and there just aren't enough people online to make it worthwhile to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-22-2012"}

Good graphics, even though the character models do look very cartoonish. Spell effects are especially good. But it does feel like they used this engine for black and white 2, or vise virsa.Sound. A great soundtrack, good weapon and spell effects. As for the voice acting...\"The people of Albion are imigrants from every concieveable point of the British Isles\"...That sentence covers it, all NPCs have a heavy British accent.Gameplay. The combat is great! It fells very believeable and fun. But the game is all about how you progress from little kid to an etremely old battle veteran in 11 hours, this system is actually pretty good, you never notice the ongoing transformation of your character, and he will look appropriately good/evil depending on which path you take. As for non-linear, that is true, but it is not open-ended, and for the most part you are following a predetermined path, with little else to do.Length. Dissapiontment, it only takes about 10 hours to get through the whole game in one go, of course, you will want to go back in and do it again. It's not really long but the experience is increable.Story. What would an RPG be without a story? Well, Fable has an excellent story. (No, I am not going to spoil it! Play it for yourself).All in all, Fable is a great game with gorgeous graphics and a great storyline, but it's a little too short.

If you finish the round with 5% of your life, that will carry over to the next round as is. If you're good (or lucky) enough to beat the other one with that, my hats off to you!It's a nice and welcome change to the usual formula we all know.Graphics-wise I do not see a very big improvement over the PS3 version and I do believe that the actual game looks better than the pre-rendered cutscenes. Maybe the improvements to the graphical engine were made only to the actual game but they did not render them again. I've definitely seen better.There are so many game modes to try. You have your regular story mode where you'll be able to try the different characters and their moves while following a somewhat OK storyline or you can try going on a ladder mode  la Mortal Kombat where you fight a few opponents and you'll get a brief story on that character at the end.Several of this modes pay homage to MK with a small twist and they're definitely fun.Controls are spot on once you get used to them.

In fact I actually still enjoy playing the original 8-bit games on my old NES.  The series has always been known for its difficulty, even back in the old school days.  So, nothing has changed there.  I have Ninja Gaiden Black for my Xbox 360 and I also have Ninja Gaiden Sigma for my PlayStation 3, which version is better?  The PS3 one definitely is by a long shot.Ninja Gaiden Sigma plays exactly like Ninja Gaiden Black and Ninja Gaiden.  The main difference many people take note of is the new, more polished visual style that the game received after being enhanced for a next generation console.  It's as if Tecmo put a new fresh coat of paint to make the game's graphics \"pop\" a little more than the Xbox versions.  The graphics are truly amazing, especially cut-scene visuals.  But graphics alone don't make a game.  So, how does it stack up to the games released before it?  Pretty good.The story remains the same as Ninja Gaiden Black, but with a few additional missions, and a few new gameplay tweaks to persuade customers to purchase the game over its various counterparts or in some cases in addition to its counterparts.  The additions range from minor tweaks such as the camera, which still can be finicky at times, to more drastic changes such as weapons, and missions.  Some of these additions include new weapons, such as my personal favorite weapon in the game, \"Dragon's Claw and Tiger's Fang\".  This weapon is a special dual wielded set of katanas that have fluid and contain elaborate combos, making them a great addition to the game's arsenal of already diverse weapons.  Another addition is the ability to shoot the bow while in the air and the ability to walk across the surface of water.  However, the biggest, and most obvious addition to the game is the ability to play as Rachel.Rachel's missions play differently than Ryu's, mostly due to the different play-styles between the two characters.  Ryu is fast and nimble, while Rachel plays slow and bulky, making maneuvering her around the areas quite challenging at times.  Tecmo took full advantage of the Six Axis, in a well implemented, non-gimmicky way.  The controller's internal gyroscopic technology can be used to power up Ninpo attacks.  This is a nice little feature to have in the game.  The \"quick menu\" that allows the player to use items without having to go the menu screen is also a great addition that can be very beneficial in the midst of an enemy assault on a massive scale.  Ninja Gaiden Sigma is only lacking the additional NES games that its counterpart had, but otherwise this is my favorite version of the game.  A solid action game with great mechanics, stunning visuals, and intense challenge and depth make Ninja Gaiden Sigma a must own game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2010"}

{"product_name":"B00000I1BF","description":"Spyro is a cute purple dragon in a bit of a pickle. Each of Spyro's dragon friends has fallen victim to the nefarious Gnasty Gnorc, who has turned them into crystals. Accompanied by Sparx the dragonfly, Spyro sets out to free his buddies, while collecting gems and dragon eggs. Sparx also serves as Spyro's health-o-meter, glowing gold when Spyro is healthy and turning dusky green as he tires. To boost his energy, Spryo can blast docile creatures with fire, turning them into butterflies, which Sparx transforms into much-needed fuel.This title has bright graphics in six well-developed worlds, each with several subworlds, including bogs, deserts, and ice worlds. Unlike some action games, inSpyro the Dragonthe enemies are more fun than frightening. In the Peace Keepers world, for example, Spyro must burn down the monster soldiers' tent, sending one of the minions running out, quaking with fear or, if you're lucky, dropping his drawers and shooting a moon.Spyro's movements (fire breathing, gliding, jumping, and climbing) require entry-level gaming skills. For this reason,Spyro the Dragonis an excellent title for youngsters or less experienced players, who want to play without having to master complex movement combinations.--Kasty ThomasPros:Large worlds provide hours of game playingVariety of scenariosEngaging graphicsCons:Low game skill requirements may prove less challenging for expert players","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"dragon madness!","reviewText":"Spyro the Dragon: the game that SHOULD have been Sony's mascot instead of Crash Bandicoot.The original Spyro the Dragon is probably the best platform/adventure game you can find for the Playstation.  I can't give Spyro's first adventure a 5-star rating, though.  Let's get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about Spyro (and believe me, there's a LOT of good things about this game).People have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to Banjo-Kazooie to Nights, and... who knows what else.  Well, I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games.  In fact, Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game.  Now THERE'S a game that disappointed me.  Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning.  I never would have guessed back in 1998 that Spyro would have went on to become a classic.Spyro's debut does have a few problems, though.  Seeing as how this is Spyro's very first adventure I won't be TOO harsh.  Am I the only one who thinks the play control could have been better?  It's not that I have a tough time controlling Spyro.  Well, to be honest, I DID have trouble controlling him at first.  Spyro doesn't QUITE take off when you hit up, down, left or right on the directional pad.  There's a split second delay before moving forward.  Maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since, after all, you're moving a DRAGON.  A BIG creature like a dragon won't move forward right away.  Then again, Spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescue.Controlling Spyro was definitely a problem for me at first.  For example, attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was NOT an easy task.  I kept sliding off.  By the way, I recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller.  Master the controller before exploring the world.  This will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the future.I have to consider that my inability to control Spyro may have been due to the camera angles.  Even though the camera in this game is *drastically* better than many other games, you have to admit it isn't flawless either.  If you hit Pause and go to the options, you will see an option for a second camera view called \"active\".  This view is better because the camera immediately follows behind Spyro at ALL times.  The other (default) camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where you're moving, and you can't get a good view of what lies ahead.  You may want to change it to \"active\" if the other camera view is difficult for you.  Thank goodness for this option!Some people have a problem with the lack of challenge.  While it's completely true you won't have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game, prepare to die 4 or 5 times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do, and where you have to jump.  I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a far-away platform, and many times you just BARELY make it.  Many times you will fall to your death.  Be patient, though.  The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps.  Sometimes it's about finding *just* the right spot to jump and glide, and if you're off just a *little bit* you won't make it.  The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating, seeing as how it's supposed to be a game for the entire family.  Good work.The biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss.  He's really easy to beat, however, GETTING to him is a whole other story.  You see, right at the very end before you face him, you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall (and you WILL fall the first few times because it's hard) you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again.  Not that the stage is really that long anyway, but this is by FAR the hardest part of the game.  The other 99% of the game only offers a slight challenge here and there.With that said, don't be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout World One.  It DOES get harder.  You see, many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head, or shooting fire at them.  You won't know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment.  You also have to dodge fireballs, sword-swipes, dogs jumping at you, and tons of other enemy attacks WHILE you try to find the best way to defeat them.  So it's not pathetically easy after all.A minor complaint is that sometimes while you're walking or running, the path will suddenly end, and you'll fall to your death.  Doesn't happen often, but I thought it would be worth mentioning.I hate the way Spyro talks.  He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice.  Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like.  Also, when you rescue the dragons, sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to.  The problem here is that many times the important tips they say aren't really helpful because they say them right AFTER you've already had to do them!  For instance, in one case after you glide to a far-away platform and rescue a dragon, the dragon will tell you how to glide.  Obviously, since I needed to glide in order to rescue him, I already KNOW how to glide!  So I didn't NEED his help!  This happens a few times during the game.  You just want to scream \"Thanks for nothing, bonehead!\"The music was done by a member of the rock band the Police, Stewart Copeland.  People may not realize it, but certain themes in Spyro the Dragon are *very* close to some of the songs that made the Police such a legendary rock band.  Stewart Copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the Police, specifically the songs \"walking on the moon\" and \"message in a bottle\".  You'll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those Police songs.  The music in Spyro the Dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level you're in.  No complaints.  The music is fantastic.I think the creators made a mistake.  When you hit L2 the camera rotates clockwise, and R2 makes the camera rotate counter-clockwise.  It should be the other way around.  Another thing that needs reversed: the way Spyro flies in the bonus stages.  When you press up, you fly down.  When you press down, you fly up!  Strange mistake.  This makes it harder to complete the flying stages, however, you don't have to finish them.In fact, despite what people may tell you, you do *not* have to collect ALL the gems and ALL the dragons.  Finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game.  The gameplay in Spyro the Dragon can actually be compared to Yoshi's Island- you don't have to find everything, but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score.  The creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons, increasing the challenge.  More often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it.  It's fun to run around and think about how to reach it.  Some of them are cleverly located.  One word to describe it- *awesome*Anyway, Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a 3D Donkey Kong Country, what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on.  Spyro is much better than that overrated Crash Bandicoot game, and you should pick up Spyro the Dragon today.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-10-2006"}

{"product_name":"B00008J7NZ","description":"Halo 2is one of those rare video games that garnishes attention from regular folk who wouldn't know which direction to point a game controller. With more than 1.5 million pre-orders and a massive release party in Times Square, the game enjoys the sort of buzz, and sales, generally reserved for boy wizards. But does it merit the hype?Opening SceneHalo 2opens with a cut scene in the Covenant Holy City of High Charity. Much has happened since Master Chief (that's you) created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do for his failures. This first cut scene is long, but the lush graphics, orchestral sound, and polished voice talent for both this and other cut scenes as well as the game itself put most animated television shows to shame.Much has happened since Master Chief created so much havoc for the Covenant in the firstHalo, and the Arbiter has much atoning to do.In the end, though,Halo 2is unabashedly a first-person shooter. It has a Mature rating and is not meant for kids. Gameplay is constant and intense. No sooner is one bunch of aliens taken care of than another descends. The controls are identical to the first game so those familiar with it will be up and blasting in no time. And the sound and graphics have been beefed up so thatHalo 2is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful console games available.Opening FireMost of the weapons from the first game return, although strangely the MA5B Assault Rifle (the default weapon in the first game) is not available. There is a single melee weapon known as the Covenant Sword, but the controls for it are the same as that for all the shooter weapons, making it difficult to direct. Also, for a new twist, you can hold two of the smaller guns at the same time and shoot double-fisted.As for vehicles, the old favorites are back and joined by a few new, mostly Covenant wheeled monsters. Some improvements have been made to the AI so that the nonplayer characters can drive without running into too many obstacles while you man the turret. This improved AI also has enemies ducking for cover, and the banter from both the Marines and the bad guys has undergone massive improvements so that it no longer sounds quite so repetitive.On Your OwnThe most significant change in the single-player game is with Master Chief's much-touted defensive suit. At the beginning of the game, he is told that the suit has been upgraded, but it's really undergone a severe downgrade. InHalo 2, the player has only one lifeline. Unlike in the first game, there is basically no defensive shield on the suit, making gameplay tougher. It can often take multiple--sometimes a maddening number--attempts to make it through thorny parts of the game.Or with a FriendFinally, no review of aHalogame is complete without mentioning multiplayer. One of the main reasons to buyHalo 2is the ability to play through Xbox Live, a feature not included in the first game, which was among the original releases for the Xbox. Multiplayer forHalo 2uses all of the same weapons and vehicles as in the single-player game, and the types of games available inHalo(King of the Hill, Slayer, Capture the Flag) return with a host of new maps. MultiplayerHalo 2offers customizable profiles, control layout, and screens as well as a voice proximity feature, where you can talk with other players via an Xbox Communicator so that those closer to you sound louder than those farther away. Players can also create both permanent clans and temporary parties in the Xbox Live world. Undoubtedly, this multiplayer feature alone ensures thatHalo 2will remain a top-selling game for years to come.--David MorelPros:Lush graphics and orchestral soundConstant, thumping shoot-'em-up actionMultiplayer available through Xbox liveCons:Suit downgrade makes single-player often overly difficultGet ready for some bleary-eyed mornings","reviewerName":"greg","summary":"good but...","reviewText":"i liked this game don't get me wrong, hours of play time and lots of fun just like any other halo game with multiplayer. the only thing that bothered me was the balancement with the weapons. if you had an energy sword, rocket launcher, or sniper rifle (depending on map)you were unstoppable, other guns just seemed so worthless like entire clips wouldn't kill anything.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2012"}

{"product_name":"B007TYC8MI","description":"","reviewerName":"Leohlyon","summary":"Much better than I anticipated!","reviewText":"Much better than I anticipated!Ok, I know it seems odd to give any God of War game 5 stars, then act as if I'm surprised by it. I'll explain my reasoning behind the review title. As you may or may not know, there has been some criticism thrown in the direction of God of War Ascension. Heck, just look at all of the 3 star reviews here on Amazon! In conjunction with the criticism and 3 star reviews, I was very hesitant when I heard about multiplayer being incorporated in the game. From my personal observations, the inclusion of multiplayer usually detracts from the single player experience. With all of those red flags, how could I NOT be surprised when this turned out to be a 5 star game?Combat- Ahh combat... I'll admit, the combat does feel a bit different when compared to previous God of War games. But, that doesn't have to be an awful thing, does it? I can't really put my finger on why it feels different, but it does. Now, some people have mentioned that the parry attack has drastically changed. Well, one of two things is happening here: A) The change is very minor, and I didn't notice. B) I'm far too dumb to even realize something changed. (The latter is probably correct, but that's a topic for another day). The combos were easy to execute, and I had a blast whenever I encountered enemies. I primarily judge combat based on one key thing - rather or not I looked forward to fighting enemies. There have been games *COUGHS spyro COUGHS* where I would break down and cry whenever I was forced to fight, that's how atrocious the combat was (I apologize for the cough, I haven't dusted around my computer in a few days). The combat in God of War Ascension is spot on, and I enjoyed every fight, down to the final encounter. Oh, I almost forgot... You can use magic attacks as part of your combat, if you get tired of the hack and slash approach. I won't go into too much detail about magic attacks. If you read any of my reviews, you'll know I'm not fond of magic attacks in any game. Magic attacks - blah blah blah, that's the extent of what I'll say about those.Weaponry - I was very pleased with the weapons, and I like the big change that was made. Of course, Kratos has his usual blades, that's a given. In addition to his blades, you'll be able to pick up weapons from enemies, as well as stray weapons just lying around! I can't remember all of the weapons, so I'll do my best to name the ones I remember. Swords, shields, javelins, and my favorite; the mace! I'm sure I forgot some, but you get the picture. It's cool how you can hold on to these weapons as long as you please. Once I got ahold of the mace, I kept it for the rest of the game :) Earlier, I mentioned Kratos having his trusty blades. In God of War Ascension, having the blades is like having 4 weapons in one! As you progress through the game, you'll discover 4 'special' powers. The fire of Ares, the lightening of Zeus, the soul snatching power of Hades (not really sure how to articulate that one), and the ice of the great Poseidon! Each of these powers have very different effects on the blades, and in my mind, makes them 4 different weapons in one. You'll be able to use each of these at your discretion, so nothing will be forced on you.Enemies - As I progressed through the game, I became a little concerned. I felt that I was seeing the same handful of enemies over and over again. Since the combat was so much fun, I thought I could overlook this, if it continued. Luckily, once I got into the later chapters, I started to see new enemies, so that was a big relief. I'll tell you what, there's nothing finer than a one on one battle with a Chimera!!! I wish there would have been more one on one battles (non boss battles) but that's not a big deal. Overall, I found the enemies to be tough to beat. I don't recall too many boss battles, but I thoroughly enjoyed the ones I did happen to partake in. Many reviewers have stated there were spikes in difficulty, in regards to the enemies. I didn't notice any spikes in difficulty because my butt kickings were pretty proportioned and consistent... Just sayin... When I think of spikes in difficulty, I think about some enemies being easy, then another group being harder, then the next group being easier, and so on. EVERY enemy tossed me around like a ragdoll, so perhaps I misunderstood the meaning of 'spikes in difficulty', or, maybe I just suck. You be the judge...Miscellaneous - Wow! In regards to the puzzles, all I can say is wow! These are some of the hardest puzzles I've ever seen. I'd estimate I 'cheated' on about ehhh 95% of them, don't judge me... Nothing new in the collectibles department, just the usual Gorgon eyes and Fairy feathers or whatever the hell those things are. I think the game was a little bit shorter than God of War 3. It took me about 17 hours to get through this. If you're reading any of my reviews and wondering how long it would take you to complete a game, my advice would be to subtract 10 hours from any total I give.I always try to point out at least one weakness in every game I review. The weakness I see is Multiplayer! I haven't played it that much, but I'm really stubborn about the inclusion of multiplayer in single player games. Although the single player campaign was great, maybe it would have been even better if more time was spent on single player, and less spent on Multiplayer? No? Ignore my multiplayer rant, I'm just resistant to change and I HAD to find something to whine about with the game. Great game for first time God of War players, and vets alike. Tomb Raider, you're up next! What's that? This game has multiplayer too?! Sighs...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-07-2013"}

I thought I was content with my PS2 until the launch commercials for this game came out and the humor, action and adventure of which, captivated me. I saved up the money and got the console just for this game. Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is a brilliant game and a great way to dive into a new console. At that point in time, this game had the best graphics I had ever seen. Surprisingly after all these years later, this five year old game  still has better graphics than a lot of brand new games. When you make Nathan Drake walk into water, his clothes get wet and have to dry, when you continue through  your adventure, he gets dirtier. All this blew my mind, I had never seen a game like this or controlled such a likeable and fleshed out character before. To me, it's stunning that a video game was able to create such a defined and memorable character the likes of which rival Indiana Jones and Malcom Reynolds in likeability and general awesomeness. Nathan Drake is easily the best video game character I've ever controlled and the Uncharted series is easily the best franchise I've ever played.This game takes you to lush environments where you feel like you're actually trapped in the jungle. You get to pilot vehicles and shoot a huge arsenal of guns at pretty cleverly designed A.I.. Greg Edmonson does an amazing job creating a memorable soundtrack which I personally think is his best work. This game is as iconic as a Steven Speilberg film and as fun to watch. The cut scenes are brilliantly animated, mostly from motion capture, and the gameplay itself helps tell the story. Nothing is too repetitive and the gunplay is fun and exciting. There are no frame rate issues, landscapes look realistic, character design is spectacular and  detail is superb.This game did not disappoint. I got a PS3 to play this game and it far exceeded my expectations and set the standard for how games should be made. The Uncharted series is unrivaled, Naughty Dog has made an iconographic franchise with memorable characters, level design, musical score and gameplay. This is a must have for any fan of platforming, adventure, puzzle or 3rd person shooter games. This game I highly recommend. If you like Indiana Jones or adventure movies then you will like this just fine. I can't say enough good things about this game, the franchise or the creative team. This is a piece of art and video games at its best.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B000UW21A0","description":"Sony Uncharted: Drake's Fortune 98103 PC Games","reviewerName":"S.Papstein","summary":"No Title","reviewText":"'In a world of pirates, treasure, and curses, one man must rise above all others to save his friends and himself'. I guarantee you if Uncharted was a movie, Naughty Dog would have a voiceover as such. But calling Uncharted a movie would'nt be too far-fetched after all. Given the production of cutscenes, story and gunfights, Uncharted may be one of the closest interactive movie games on the market. Heck, I'd even wager it would even be par with Indy Jones(Spielburg could make Drake his kid).Uncharted fallows it's hybrid outlines to a T, with such fluid pacing, Naughty makes it look easy. To put in basics, set in Indiana Jones enviroment/traps. Add a few gunfights with a 1:2 ratio of prince of persia platformning, and in essence, thats Uncharteds gameplay. Our hero, Drake, is an average treasure hunter, but his hold is that he's the long lost descendant of the famed explorer Sir Francis Drake, looking for Sir Frances' treasure of El Dorado. Using a newscaster host as a sidekick, Drake and co. head out for an unmarked island filled with all the greedy 3rd world seedy pirates vying for the gold as well. When you have the occasional run-in with the modern-day Black beard crew, Naughty gives a Gear of War cover system with gunslinging controlled by shoulder buttons. I've not played to many shooters, but the combat makes Uncharted a great 3rd person action-shooter.But with all the positive said, what really 'grinds my gears' is the stiff camera angles. Often Drake's scaling leaping, and shimining abound across chandalers, rock crevices, and ruins. Which I really enjoyed, Naughty pays homage to Prince of Persia and a few dashs of Tomb raider. But constantly you'll be given pre-positioned camera angles which are constantly not showing enough for us to see. Often, I'd be jumping out into space, hoping I'd latch on to a ledge.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2008"}

Kim","summary":"Dragon Warrior VII, YES, INDEED.","reviewText":"First of all, i would like to mention piece of my mind on graphic.  Lot of people complain that the graphic looks really outdated.  Personally, i didn't think it was outdated at all.  You see, certain games have to accommodate particular graphic in order to really convey the atmosphere and theme of the game.  Could you imagine Parappa the Rappa with 3D, realistic graphic?  Just go to top of the castle, and roate your screen, dang, it's beautiful!!  How many games let you rotate your screen and yet so smoothly?  It took long time to make this game and i'm sure that staff at Enix thoughtout everything thoroughly.Alrite.. I have to, first of all, let you know that this game isn't for everyone.  I've played the series from NES day, Dragon Warrior 1 through 4, and replayed them again on GameBoy.  Personally I love Dragon Warrior series more than I love Final Fantasy series.  When you play the game for few hours, you will realize that it's not really easy to earn your money and experience point like other RPGs.  What this means that you will have to not only fight diligently but also spend your money wisely.  It's not like other RPG where you have so much money, you have no problem with equiping everyone with latest weapon and armor once you get to next town.  However, in Dragon Warrior 7, you will have to work your way up to buy one weapon or armor for one character.  Now..you might think that's so stupid, spending, or rather wasting your time on these meaningless thing, when you have world before you to save..  Wrong.  You see, when i heard about RPG for very first time, I thought it was so stupid.  Come'on, give me a break, no action whatsoever??  You just command character to attack or use magic, and that's it??  And your health point just got reduced by 8 points?? But once you get a taste of RPG, it becomes very addictive, isn't it?  Same thing with earning money/exp. point, and buying that one weapon, that one armor which you will see with your own eyes during battles that actually equiping that very weapon, that very armor really works, inflicting more damage, reducing damage points from enemies.  Like I mentioned in Dragon Warrior III review, Dragon Warrior VII doesn't flood the world with countless weapon and armor.  There are just several of them, and really good ones, which you will have to search and find with good effort.  You will appreciate each weapon and armor, knowing that they are not something to be done without even thinking about it in other RPGs, but it sort of becomes more personal, knowing you are battling to save money to buy that particular weapon/armor.Music.. you know, personally, I love Dragon Warrior music much more than Final Fantasy music score.  It seems like Final Fantasy does pull out excellent ones once in awhile, however, the composer (what was his name,,Koichi??) really knows how to compose good music score.  His music, if you listen to them from Dragon Warrior 1, is very simple, yet it really does pierce into you very deeply.  It's sort of easier to compose something with lot of sound effect/channel, but it is REALLY difficult to make a masterpiece with let's say only piano sound.  The most famous music score for Final Fantasy is probably the very first song of opening movie, starting in C major, A minor, F major, G major then back to C again.  Koichi is the master of composing excellent music score from very simple mean and sound.  His music is very simple yet, really delivers the various situation.  I still think the very first music from Dragon Warrior, the music which comes out when you are on over world field as the BEST music ever.  And i'm glad Enix decided to bring some old sound effect, like going up and down stair, sound of reaching next level, etc.One thing I didnt' like about Dragon Warrior 7 is that time to time, you don't know where to go, or get stuck because you don't have the stone shard to proceed to next story.  What it means is that you will have to search everywhere, explore same place in present and in past as well in order to proceed.  But that's really minor thing.Overall, if you are too fond of Final Fantasy's graphic, and deep storyline, and haven't played previous Dragon Warrior series from NES time, then I'm not sure if you will like it or not.  But one thing for sure, when it comes to the DELICATE BALANCE OF GAME PLAY, nothing can even come close, really.Enjoy your Dragon Warrior, the Best Selling Japanese PlayStation game console Title of All Time!

The first thing I did though was look at the trophy list after installing. If there are any platinum trophy freaks like me this one has work cut out for you. One of them i noticed was Gold star in all license, events, and single events. If you ever played a GT then you know there are easily over 300 races, just me popping through the menus I think there are definitely 300 but I could be wrong... not to mention the endurance races. Now for the graphics...  I honestly must say that this just might be the best looking racing game ever if not, tell me what is. As for the game play its a step up from gt4 in simulation but not anymore difficult. The only problem i see with GT5 so far is the loading times. I'm use to fast load times on other games but this is not the case for GT5, but I don't care because each race is worth the load time, oh and by the way I'm sure after a few races one would just get use to the load times, every race I have done so far I have just admired every detail that the developers put in to it. I would recommend every ps3 owner to have this game if you are into racing games, however, if you like need for speed or any other type of arcade game GT5 is nothing like those games. If you have never tried a Gran Turismo game before I suggest you rent this or play it on a display before you buy so you know what your getting into.Have fun, Happy Thanksgiving to all.EDIT:Although amazing I have been finding flaws which remind me of the huge mistake of releasing Gran Turismo 2 in the state that it was in. I'm having fun racing but the B-spec mode SUCKS......... Its twice as long as a-spec and you cannot speed it up like GT4. I really think these guys just sat around and got drunk or just hanged out for the 5 years of development because in 5 years they should have been able to have the usual amount of races for each class. This time around there are hardly any rally races and at times the graphics shop up like crazy. I loved gran turismo sense day one of me playing it. Although i feel let down. I hope us fans don't have to wait 6 more years. Seriously I love gran turismo but i cant see myself playing it as much as I did the previous GT's because its extremely short when compared to the previous games. I wanted more races.

{"product_name":"B0054INKZK","description":"","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"An artful masterpiece that must be experienced","reviewText":"We often see the debate rage on about whether games are truly art or not, but rarely do we ask the question: what sort of game would an artist make? El Shaddai would be that answer. You see, the game's director, Sawaki Takeyasu, who was in charge of the game's overall development, has only worked as an artist and even art director for past games he has worked on. Two of them,OkamiandViewtiful Joe, are considered some of the most beautiful and stylistic games ever made. He was also art director forDevil May Cry. His artistic focus, as well as the entire creative teams' purposefully artful approach, is evident throughout the entire game. This game has had a somewhat polarizing effect in the press (Game Informer: 9/10, Gamepro: 4.5/5, IGN: 5/10), with reviews being either universal praise or lots of (undue) criticism. Yes, you need to know what you're getting into when you pop in El Shaddai, a masterfully crafted experience that is meant to immerse and move you.For me personally, I can already tell you after a bit of time with the game, this game should be bought and bought new to encourage the market to make more products as breathtaking and refreshing as this. It is an exceptional masterpiece that you will never forget, a truly amazing experience. Games this unique and beautiful are extremely rare and El Shaddai ranks among the very best of artistic games. Games likeOkami,Viewtiful Joe,Muramasa: The Demon Blade,Odin Sphere, and a few others come to mind. The publishers and developers of El Shaddai need to be rewarded for taking such a huge business risk by putting out a piece of art very different from the 1,001 desaturated shooters that flood the market each year. Also, by buying these sorts of games new, we can show the publishers that we do love beautiful, artistic games, and maybe they'll start making games of this caliber more often than every couple of years or so. With that out of the way, here's some information to help you know what you're getting into with the game. I will keep it all spoiler free. This game is full of amazing surprises that need to be experienced first-hand.El Shaddai is based on the ancient Hebrew text, theBook of Enoch, found among the Dead Sea Scrolls. Anyone who knows a bit about their Biblical history knows that Enoch was a prophet that was active some time before the fabled flood of Noah. The story of his book, and this game, is that he is sent to \"cleanse\" the souls of fallen angels, called \"Watchers,\" whose job had been to watch over mankind. They however, grew obsessed with humanity, took women as their own wives, birthed monsters called Nephilim, and now lived among people, corrupting God's divine purpose. It's a fascinating story subject for a game, and the fact that it is a traditionally western scriptural text being interpreted by distinctly Eastern, Japanese sensibilities makes it even more interesting. The characters are fascinating and while the distinct quirkiness of Japanese game design are here (although I wouldn't really go as far as to call it \"anime style\" per say), it's all a very refreshing experience. As Enoch, you will ascend a massive tower, each floor of which is an entire world devoted to each angel, and that's where the art comes in.You see, each Watcher became obsessed with a different aspect of mankind, and offered their own unique \"gift\" to mankind as well. This translates to each Watcher's floor being completely unique in its art design. They're all striking and totally unique. In this game, you will transverse entire worlds that range from ever-shifting water color paintings, a world seemingly pulled from a minimalists' abstract painting in a modern art gallery, an organically rendered world, and even a hi-tech city very reminiscent ofTron: Legacy(Cycle sequence and all). I'll stop there because I really don't want to give anything away, as this game is spectacular when you discover for the first time what it has to offer. The enemy designs all fit their respective environments, and are pretty bizarre and interesting. Actually, all of the character designs are very striking, and some are very strange. Enoch himself is shirtless prophet in designer jeans, with white armor pieces that look like porcelain attached to him to indicate his health level. Archangels wearing black skinny jeans, while talking nonsense (at first anyway) on a cell phone? Yeeeeah, El Shaddai is kind of out there on its own in the world, but that is partly what makes it so spectacular. I really cannot praise the art direction in this game enough. It is one of the most varied, unique, and downright beautifully designed games in terms of art that I have seen sinceOkami, and I sincerely mean that.The music cannot go unmentioned either. Composed by Masato Koda, who also wrote the music for the Devil May Cry series, this soundtrack is awesome. This game features music from all over the spectrum, ranging from levitical choirs, to Japanese garden zen-like music with harps and other traditional Japanese instruments, to 1970's jazzy-disco, to majestic Post-Rock. It's all here, and it's all quite excellent. I love it.The gameplay is probably the most polarizing aspect of El Shaddai, and I can understand why (rhyme unintentional). At its core, El Shaddai is a 3rd person action adventure platformer with lots of beat-em-up moments. This is very well executed. However, this game takes another artistic school of thought and applies it straight to the gameplay. That concept is minimalism. You see, there is no HUD at all in the game. The combat is much more oriented on having encounters with only a couple enemies, with a focus on flow and elegance. Even the non-combat gameplay mechanics are very simple that use few buttons, but are executed elegantly. In fact, \"elegance\" is the word I would use to describe the gameplay in El Shaddai. This is intentional, and it is done with a purpose. Some in the gaming press have missed that and therefore given the review some poor ratings. Some will hate the gameplay, it's to be expected when it is so deliberately focused on being artistic in its execution and flow. You need to know that going in. Personally, I found it refreshing and very enjoyable, all of it.Really, whether you enjoy the game or not will really boil down to whether you are in the right mindset to play the game. If you understand that this game, in every single possible way conceivable, is meant to actually stand as an immersive, beautiful work of art, you will absolutely love El Shaddai with your whole soul. Chances are, if you're looking at this obscure game at all, then you will be the type to love it. It is a niche title, that will probably grow to having a very devoted underground following (I truly hope it transcends an underground, cult status though). Personally, I fall in that category, and I am so refreshed after playing El Shaddai. It is a beautiful work of art, poignant and affecting, and I really hope that we get either a direct sequel, or at least a spiritual successor, soon. I said this earlier, but I must reiterate: BUY THIS GAME AND BUY IT NEW! Buy it, immerse yourself into it, and be transported to a magical world where games truly can be masterful works of art!*As I continue my way through the game, I'll post updates to my review if I feel there is anything important to add to what is here in this review. For now, though, I think this review pretty much sums up the game in a spoiler-free yet informative fashion. I hope it was helpful. Thank you and good day! :)","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-17-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUD","reviewerName":"sporkdude \"sporkdude\"","summary":"Good, but no Super Nintendo Mario Kart.","reviewText":"The Super Mario Kart of SNES days, despite the cartoonish nature of it, was perhaps the greatest racing game ever.  In my time, it was a college dorm staple.  The battles were just a medium for trash talking, the time trials were a measure of pure skill, and the races were a great combination of both.  Very rarely does a game reward skill.  When the N64 version came out, it came out with a collective, \"ughh\".  While darn good looking, much of the skill was replaced by luck, and it just wasn't as fun.Now the latest incantation is for the Gamecube.  Sure, Nintendo is no longer the only major player in the video game market, but it still shines.  This game still relies a lot on luck, and the power slide of yesteryears have been replaced by a useless unintuitive turn boost.  The Super Nintendo version had different levels of characters, where the ultimate goal was to master the clunky but amazingly fast Bowser and Donkey Kong Jr.  Now, even though there are more characters, the AI and lack of a power slide removes all motivation to switch from the lighter ones, reducing replayability.  The battles are good though.  I especially enjoy the bomb battles, but the lack of good levels severely limits the playability.The worst part of the AI is what I like to call the \"Colorado Rockies Pitchers\" syndrome, where if you get hit once, you get hit over and over again.  The second you get caught in the pack, it's over.  It's very common to get hit once with a red shell, then before you start again, get hit by a start, a green shell, a red shell, and hit by lightning, throwing you into last place.  It sucks.With all its faults, it's still darn fun and is pretty easy to pass all the levels.  Probably the best non-shooting multi-player game out there at this time.Pros:Good looking.Still fun.Cons:Cheap AI.The larger characters are not fun.Needs more battle levels.No power slide.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-18-2004"}

Though it had little replay value, I really enjoyed it while it lasted.The Pros!The web-slinging is AMAZING.  For the first time  you are given an entire island to websling around.  The environment is practically endless and there is so much to explore.  The random crime setup is nice, since they give you extra brownie points.  But oh my goodness, there is nothing like diving off of a tall building and watching Spidey tear through the sky.  And the rebound of the web slinging is positively perfect!  The basic mechanics that are signature to Spiderman are here, and it makes for a fantastic time.  Webslinging is by far the greatest aspect of this game.The random crime system as mentioned before is also an interesting addition.  If you ever played True Crime, the system is sort of like that.  You'll hear somebody shouting for help and it is your choice whether or not you go to help them, much like the feds would prompt you in True Crime.  If these random crime missions are completed successfully, you get extra points so that you can buy speed boosts and more moves.The purchasing system!  Now it's been a very long time since I've played the game, but I'm pretty sure that whenever you go into a library or coming book store you can spend your skill points on buying new moves and speed boosts.  Some things are superficial, like air tricks when you release your web, and others are helpful like mid air strikes and web throws.  Each attack has its own special purpose, and it is up to the player to deicde which one is best.The ConsActivision is not famous for its good graphics.  The graphics in this game could have been executed on the PS1.  They are really really bad.  Unacceptable.  I don't know how many copies of poeple I have seen crammed into one street, but it is ridiculous.  The cars look like boxes covered in cheap paint.  The graphics were just...bad.Also, the game was very repetative.  Luckily it was short though.  But if you are the type of person that needs something new every mission, you won't finish this game. After a while it just dragged on...But overall, the game was good.  The 4 Stars were very well earned.  The game Followed the orignal Spiderman 2 plot reasonably well with some additions to put more action sequences in the game.  The gameplay is great while the nature of the game's progression is not.

It improves upon the original Lego Star Wars I (LSTI) in certain areas, though not many areas (except length of game) needed to be improved. There is NO learning curve if you played the first game, which allows you to jump right in and not worry about a bunch of new controls. That's not to say there aren't new controls or actions that your characters can do. However, any new action has a \"this is how you do it\" screen pop up. I bought it yesterday and took my time playing it for just a little while, so I am only in Episode IV, Stage 3. In just that short amount of time, I was very pleased with the quality of the game's graphics and sound--seems to be even more improved over the original's. Likewise, there are certain doors or areas you cannot go into and are specific to other characters, requiring you to replay levels, which is always fun with this game. The characters so far that I have played as are Princess Leia, R2-D2, C3PO, Rebel Soldiers, Luke Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. All of them control like the characters in the first game--but hey, that isn't necessarily bad. They have added new animations (such as Luke moves and ducks while shooting). Force powers for Obi-Wan include the original push and pull, but now include the ability to confuse or cause certain characters (Jawas, Tusken Raiders, etc.) to fall asleep. You can now build and ride more vehicles and creatures(so far only the landspeeder and was able to ride a Bantha  and a Dewback).For $39.99, you can't get a better game.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

I finished the first GOW and thought it was a good game, not the best game out there.  So far, I enjoy this game a lot more.  It seems a bit easier, and your AI teammates play very solidly for the most part.  The varied environments make it seem more epic in scope and doesn't make the experience too too repetitive (although the crux of this game is taking cover and shooting). The small tweaks they made to the game like using human shields, then executing them; planting bombs on people; being able to crawl once you're about to die add refreshing variety.  What I don't like so far is controlling the Centaur vehicle...very clumsy controls.  This and Dead Space are my games of this year.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-15-2008"}

{"product_name":"B0009Z3K9O","description":"Castlevania: Curse of Darkness delivers an entirely new storyline and main character to the classic game world. In Castlevania the story always revolved around the Belmont family and Dracula, but now there's a new character with new abilities: Hector, a Devil Forgemaster who once refined his skills under Dracula. Fueled by revenge for the murder of his girlfriend, Hector sets off to confront the evil forces of the night. Armed with the powerful skill of Devil Forgery, he must find his way back to the ruins of Dracula's castle and uncover an intricate web of deception -- completely unaware that it is all a sinister play, orchestrated to lure him home.","reviewerName":"-- \"--\"","summary":"Second Verse, Same as the First...","reviewText":"\"Castlevania: Curse of Darkness\" is a game that fails in two very important areas. First of all, it does very little to improve upon the formula of its predecessor, \"Lament of Innocence\" -- and there was already a lot of room for improvement. Second, and of equal importance, is the fact that it fails to evoke the \"Castlevania\" brand nine times out of ten. With little in the way of nostalgia going for it to longtime vets of the Konami series, and very little to offer that's new in any way, it's very nearly a bust.Fortunately, there is something to be said for mindless hacking and slashing. This \"Curse of Darkness\" has in great supply. Combat is frequent, fast, furious, and smoothly animated. The controls are highly responsive, making for some excellent arcade-like battle sequences. Enemies are many and varied, and far more memorable than their \"Lament\" counterparts, and this is true of boss encounters as well. Here, at least, the developers decided to take the initiative and move forward a few steps.Level designs remain unchanged since \"Lament,\" however. The flat, narrow and generally unadorned corridors were one of that game's greatest flaws -- and the same is true of \"Nanobreaker,\" another Konami effort from the same producers. You might rightfully expect something to have been done about this after two games were fashioned of the same broken mold, but you would be mistaken if you were to assume as much. Although the environments are diverse and strive to have their own gothic personality, each one is basically the same as the last once you move beyond the aesthetics. Even though \"Curse\" offers more outdoor areas, they are merely a novelty, as they are designed in the exact same fashion as all those halls and corridors. The word \"linear\" doesn't even begin to cover it.One unique gameplay element unique to \"Curse\" are summoned creatures called Innocent Devils. The game makes much ado about them, and they do prove useful during the course of the campaign, but they certainly don't revolutionize the gameplay inherent in the series. In fact, their presence gives \"Curse\" more of a generic fantasy vibe than one of \"Castlevania\" origins.This just doesn't feel like \"Castlevania.\" For all its faults, at least \"Lament\" managed a few real nostalgic moments. Not so here, apart from some returning enemies and a soundtrack that pays homage to the Nintendo originals. A good storyline might have gone a long way to make this game better than the sum of all its parts, but no such luck here either. The new hero character, the Forgemaster Hector, is brash and unlikable, the actor portraying him always screaming his lines. To make matters worse, it's the usual anime fluff about slain girlfriends, rival peers, and a desire for vengeance... which makes it virtually identical the plot of its predecessor.Unless you loved \"Lament,\" there's very little reason to go out of your way to play \"Curse.\" Even longtime \"Castlevania\" enthusiasts aren't guaranteed a good time here. That said, if you have a space in your schedule between \"Devil May Cry\" games and don't mind some mindless hacking and slashing, you could do a lot worse. It just so happens, however, that you could do much better. Konami really needs to dig deeper than this if they want the franchise to survive for another decade or more.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2006"}

Blasiman","summary":"Excellent game and very challenging.","reviewText":"I played the first Hitman a lot. I liked its style and it did have some well-done aspects. However it did have some glaring mistakes that kept it from being a hit. Thankfully most of those have been done away with. And what was good before has been refined in to an even better game. If you did like Hitman, the sequel is much better. If you did not like Hitman, the sequel is much better.There are many things to like. The sound stands out in my mind. The weapons all sound good. Some I liked more than others just for their sound. And the music is top notch; a real symphony adds much more atmosphere than the usual video game background noise. The voice acting is good enough and is kept short and to the point.The graphics are good with some notable lighting and shading effects. The physics are also above average for a video game. The models vary in detail but are generally good. Lots of cool particle effects, from the lingering smoke of automatic weapon fire to the flash of a bullets smacking off metal pipes as well as some impressively gruesome blood spattering. But the many guns look great. They are highly detailed even out of first person mode. And the addition of a first person view is great since there are many indoor areas. While it is not the newest engine from Id, it can hold it's own.The AI on the other hand is a mixed bag. It is not too quick, but just smart enough to offer a challenge. While the enemies you will face are competent enough to detect you if you act suspicious they will not use much in the way of tactics. In one instance a few bad guys came running straight at me in a line down a corridor firing away. It was easy enough to now them down. It knows how to locate you and to shoot at you, that is about it. However when not going in Rambo style you can admire some of the more subtle aspects of the AI. Even when using a silenced gun a guard near by can still hear the bullet hitting the wall. If a civilian sees you do something suspicious he/she will run and find a guard, even tell them what you look like, who will then investigate the location of the disturbance. Yet after games like SOF2 and NOLF2 this AI fails to impress but it is still not bad.Of course the core of any game is the gameplay. Here Hitman2 uses what worked before and refined it. It also improves or drops what didn't work the last time. Stealth is still rewarding but not required. Hitman2 let's you set the pace, either to the beat of automatic weapons blazing away or the steady footsteps of a silent hunter. Usually you will end up in the middle. Either method works, and works better in some cases than others. While it's fun to whip out an Uzi and waste anyone standing in your way, I also enjoyed the professional hit by keeping my body count low. It's this dynamic with great sound and good graphics that make the game worth playing.Unfortunately I found some parts of the game less than impressive.  The story starts out strong with some great cut scenes, but drops off by the mid point of the game and really doesn't appear again until the final two missions. For the most part, it serves as a thin reason to send the player off to some exotic locations. But these locations do little or nothing to support the story. I can live with out a story to a game, just that his one started with one that seemed promising. Thinking of the later part of the game, I found the last few missions (before the final two) to be dull and tedious. There were not as good looking as the previous ones or as well designed. I got the impression that they were tacked on to fatten the game. They were not bad, just not as interesting and mostly repetitive.What my biggest complaint is that the map is still near worthless, making any real pre-planning pointless. I had to screw up a couple times each mission just to get a good feel for the layout of the level. An early mission has you knock off a Russian general and local crime boss in a public park. I decided the use a sniper rifle to take them out. I studied the map and saw a building marked radio tower. I thought a tower would be high enough to have a good view of the target. So I planned my way and it was going perfect until I got to the tower to find out that it had no line of sight at all with the target. Why couldn't this have been indicated on the map? In another mission I had planned an elaborate route to my target based off of what the map indicated were walled off alleys. Only when I got there I found out that I could get through some of them since some were not really blocked off. Yet the map leads me to think so. Other things like windows or where stairways lead are not clearly marked. I like thinking; I don't like guessing at what the map is telling me. It should be helpful, not confusing.Still the rest of the game is a great experience. Whatever flaws are quickly out done by the many strengths. If you are looking for a slick and stylish \"thinking shooter\" with an action movie quality, look no further.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2002"}

I really like the mechanic where you can revive from death if you make a kill in your last few seconds.  The sequences do get repetitive though, basically you attack bandit camps over and over to get the piece of technology they've got tucked away.So while these shooter sequences are sort of fun, actual game play comes down to a whole lot of walking around from one bandit camp to another, and then a whole lot of digging around bandit camp sites going through lockers to pick up small change.  There's guns lying around everywhere and I hear one of the attractions is all the different guns, but in actual gameplay it didn't really make that big a difference, they're guns and you shoot them.  Additionally, the menu system is a bit of a bear - the constant selling and replacing guns and ammo is clumsy, and the quest system will only show one objective at a time.

{"product_name":"B0000C6EB4","description":"IntroducingCall of Duty,a new, first-person, action game for the PC. Developed by Infinity Ward--a newly formed studio including 22 of the individuals, and all of the production leads, who developed the PC titleMedal of Honor:  Allied Assault.Call of Dutydelivers the gritty realism and cinematic intensity of World War II's epic battlefield moments like never before--through the eyes of citizen soldiers and unsung heroes from an alliance of countries who together helped shape the course of modern history. Play through the chaos of battle as part of a well-trained squad, that lays down covering fire and pulls its wounded to safety. In addition to authentic squad movements and tactics, each soldier's distinct personality and training comes out on the battlefield.","reviewerName":"AntVector","summary":"Blown away...","reviewText":"Call of Duty might just be the most authentic and engaging WW2 game you've ever played.  Featuring 24 mission, split into 3 campaigns, players take on the roles of a GI paratrooper, a British commando and a russian conscript, taking the first-person fight to the Germans with a variety of weapons.  So far, so Medal of Honor.  Where this title raises the bar is in its full realisation of squad based combat, hinted at in other games but never before explored to this degree.  Players fight alongside computer controlled squad mates, usually between 6-8 in number.The AI that governs your fellow soldiers is one of the most practical, robust and flexible I've ever seen in a first-person shooter.  Your buddies will lay down supressing fire that actually WORKS (a very pleasant change), cover each other's movements, use grenades without blowing up the whole unit, and generally behave as realistically as you could hope for computer players.Thankfully the AI for the baddies is just as convincing.  No longer do enemy soldiers bluster towards your rifles, hurling grenades with pin-point accuracy.  In Call of Duty, they will advance in sqauds from cover, laying down their own supressing fire, lay traps and ambushes and even fall back to cover when overwhelmed.  If a machine gunner gets hit, his buddy might choose to take over, or make a run for it.  It gives a very rounded impression that you are flanked by real people, and facing an adaptive and versatile enemy.The real beauty of the title is that you are part of the team, without being the star of the show.  Sure, there's times when its up to you to take the initiative, and maybe even save the day, but if your squad fails, you fail.  When playing, I actually felt like covering my squad rather than dashing on ahead, protecting them rather than trying to ignore them.  Likewise, I felt confident in their abilities to watch my back, without cringing in case a friendly grenade lands at my feet.Graphically, Call Of Duty is gritty, realistic and smooth, even at high resolutions.  Explosions look great, with tanks going up in flames, while grenades produce a convincing burst of dust and fragmentation.  Tracers wizz overhead, puffs of dust ricochet off walls, and wood splinters apart under machine gun fire.  The scenery isn't fully deformable, but their is enough scripted demolition to keep things realistic.  There's also some great additional touches that really round and polish the experience, such as the blurry 'shell-shock' that warps the screen when a explosion goers off right by your head, or the restrained mixture of blood and dust that marks bullet hits on your target.I found there was some loss of framerate when my squad found themselves in very close combat with lots of enemy soldiers, but the haze and confusion of the situation was such that I didn't really mind.The real star of the effects show is the sound, where the game really drags you kicking and screaming into its world.  The weapon effects are sufficiently hefty and the bass from an MG42 will definately stop you in your tracks before its bullets do.  Best of all, dialogue between soldiers is both contextual and practical - shouted warnings to seek cover really do make a difference, your officer's military jargon is clear enough to give you a good idea how to act in the middle of a firefight...\"Shift base of fire right, FIRE!\" barks my captain as a platoon of German Paratroopers bursts from cover, and I find myself hurling myself prone and rattling off rounds from my Thompson Carbine.Call Of Duty brings to the table the intensity of Medal of Honor and the epic scale of Battlefield 1942 with unsurpassed grace and conviction.  A must for any WW2 gamer, and a splendid heart-thumper for any action game fan.  Highly Recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-28-2003"}

Taking the Resident Evil series out of it's survival horror roots and turning it into and action-adventure series is one of the best things to happen (in my opinion as I never found the original Resident Evil's all the scary). Resident Evil 5 is a very impressive follow-up and while it doesn't really stand too far apart from RE4, it's a very engaging game in it's own right.The story of Resident Evil 5 puts you in the role of series character Chris Redfield. After events separate him from his former partner Jill Valentine, Chris finds himself teaming up with Sheva Alomar in investigating a bio-weapon threat in Kijuju (a fictional African town). The story plays out in an action-oriented manner as Chris and Sheva fight their way through zombie-infected townspeople, soldiers and monsters  while discovering the truth behind the outbreaks and puts Chris face to face with an old nemesis. While the plot is an exciting one (and very much like Resident Evil 4) it's the African setting that keeps you engaged and unnerved with a few elements (issues of bio-terrorism, illegal experimentation on native peoples, anti-colonial themes) that come surprisingly close to reality...for a video game. The voice acting in this game is also very solid and the voice-actors playing Chris, Sheva and Josh Stone (Sheva's mentor who bails them out more than once and gets his own DLC starring role) are very likeable and engaging.The gameplay in Resident Evil 5 is very fun, though borrows a bit too heavily from RE4. You still can't walk when you aim and unless you're running Chris and Sheva move somewhat sluggishly. The quick-button inventory is a good idea and I liked how you can see your items on your characters even when you're not using them, but I would've preferred a bigger inventory pool (similar to RE4's briefcase). There's no reason they couldn't have mixed and matched this. Also, while I like the co-op idea of having two characters at once I would've liked the opportunity to switch between controlling Chris and Sheva on the fly instead of just picking one at the beginning and giving orders to the other.Resident Evil 5 is very much an action-adventure game and a good one at that. There were some miss-fires with the gameplay and some missed opportunities but that hasn't stopped me from coming back to it. Now with some good DLC packages (and a nice price-drop) I recommend Resident Evil 5 to any action fan.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2011"}

Shafer","summary":"Gears of War meets RE 4","reviewText":"RE5 takes place in Africa when Chris Redfield is sent on an assignment to find some guy named Irving for an unexplained reason and meets up with his partner Sheva Alomar.  While going through on their mission, they get more than what they bargined for.It was hard to make an introduction because frankly, im not really sure if there was a story to this game.  You spend about half of the game looking for the aforementioned man Irving and when you finally do catch up to him, Chris just decides that hes going to go looking for JIll.  Why you ask?  \"She was my partner\" as Chris would say it, and he says this too many times when it really isnt even a good reason.  Towards the 3rd half of the game you start having more random characters, companies and locations thrown at you for almost no apprant reason and the only way you could understand most of this is if you read the files you get while playing through the game because the game itself assumes that you already know everything.A new feature in this game is the AI partner and like most people, im going to have to agree on Shevas annoyance.  To make it simpler ill put it in list form- Constantly varies from being helpful to stupid as a brick- Sometimes can pull off nice shots while other times she will waste ammo.  There was one point where she picked up some ammo and started randomly firing when there was no enemies in the hallway i just cleared out.- Will constantly take anything on the ground unless your standing next to it-  Will use healing items at wrong times, id rather use something that heals me all the way when im about to die, not when my health is half empty- Will die every chance she gets.  There was one part where i had to take out a mounted machine gun and instead of staying behind cover, she fealt the need to have her entire body exposed so the turret could constantly put an entire clip in her face every 3 seconds.I could go on but you should get the point by now.A better title for this game would be RE 4.5 because its basically the same exact game (which is good because thats how a sequel should be, only improved) down to the point of how the game is set-up.  The first 3rd is the best, second 3rd sucks while the final 3rd was good.  Another thing in this game is the inclusion of quick time events.  For those that dont know, a quick time event is when during the middle of a cutscene or boss fight(and occationally doing a puzzle), you will be prompted to press a specific button within a matter of seconds where-upon failing to do so results in extreme damage or almost all of the time, instant death.  Nobody liked them in RE4 so i dont understand why theyre back.  Also snakesn hiding in barrels were also incredibly annoying in RE4 and for some reason, theyre back in this game as well when they shouldnt be.Some of the enemies and bosses were just brutal as well and ill just name a few so you get the idea.  At around chapter 3, the game introduces the blue village majini who are basically like the regular ones, only tougher.  Now every group of enemies has a specific special enemy,(IE chainsaw for regulars) the one for the blue majini being a large hulking guy that carries a giant mace made of spikes and skull while wearing a helemt so comically large that it covers nearly half of his body.  This enemy is so strong that at one time, i shot 6 grenades at it with my grenade launcher and he still managed to live.  Another annoying enemy is a large bug creature code named a reaper.  Not only does it take alot of ammo to kill it, but you have to wait for its weakspots to appear.  It also does alot of damage and also has the ability to kill you in one hit, something you cant even dodge as well.  Since most of the bosses were annoying, the only one i can really pick out for being a complete ***** to kill was the Uroboros 2 fight.  Basically, the only way to kill it is to constantly catch it on fire and then shoot its weak points, however the chances of the acctual spot you need to hit to come out is rare, in fact i dont think i ever saw its true weak spot when i died to it about 10 times.  Each time when i fought it, i used the following items:  5 flame rounds loaded into my grenade launcher, 5 incendiary grenades, all 3 flamable tanks in the room, the flamethrower itself constant times, and about a ton of lead shot at it.  Did it ever die? NO.  I was forced to kill it finally with the RPG (instant kill) because the thing just would not die.Your probably wondering why i mentioned gears of war in the title by now, well thats because in the final 3rd of the game, youll spend most of your time hiding behind cover and shooting things while taking rediculous amounts of damage from bullets(2-3 shots took off 3/4ths of my health) which only really serves to show us how back any 3rd person shooter like gears would suck if a health system was implemented into it.My reccomendation, rent the game.  If youve played and loved RE4 then its a definate buy.  If your new to the series, rent it, have a buddy do the same thing and play some co-op because the experience is so much better without having to babysit an AI that cant think for itself half of the time.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2009"}

It is almost 3 years old now as it was one of the near-launch titles for the Wii, but it is still one of the prettiest titles available in the entire catalog of Wii games.  So, if you have never owned/played Metroid Prime 3, then this purchase is a no-brainer: In addition to Metroid Prime 3, one of the best titles available on the Wii... you get it's pre-Wii predessors: Metroid Prime and Metroid Prime 2, both of which, despite being ports of Gamecube game, still look incredible, and have the added benefit of the new Wii controls.For the price of one Wii game, you get 3 of the best games available on Gamecube/Wii.  It is estimated by Ign.com that the entire trilogy amounts to over 80 hours of gameplay... and this doesnt even take into account the fact that Metroid Prime 2 also has 4-player splitscreen multiplayer (LOCAL ONLY unfortunately!).  Also, for those of you that are like me and like a real challenge, once you beat the game on \"Veteran\" difficulty, you unlock \"Hypermode\" difficulty.  I never did beat Metroid Prime 3 on Hypermode difficulty... it is that hardcore.Here are some features that make this trilogy an epic must-have for the Wii:1) 3 GREAT games for the price of 1... no brainer.  All 3 games look great and are a blast to play.  When you start up Trilogy, you can select to play any of the 3 games, or to play Prime 2's multiplayer (which is available from the start).  Each game has it's own progress tracking/save, as well as achievements.2) Improved controls, visuals, and gameplay for Metroid Prime 1 and 2: The visuals on both games got a bit of an update, and some of the bosses and enemies are more balanced.  Basically, MP 1 and 2 play almost exactly like Metroid Prime 3.3) Achievements: Each game includes a pretty robust set of unlockable achievements (a new addition to MP 1 and 2).  When I originally played MP 3, this was one of my favorite features (maybe I am borderline OCD?)... I really enjoyed scanning each and every enemy and item, gaining various trophies, etc.  This feature is a welcome addition to the first 2 games.4) Metroid Prime 2 multiplayer - This was a welcome addition to Metroid Prime 2, and I am glad they preserved it in the Trilogy collection.  It is fairly basic, but an absolute blast.  I really enjoy local multiplayer personally... I prefer it to online only games because frequently with Wii games, you can either play online, or you can play with your friends locally... almost never both for some reason.  I love having friends over for a good old fashioned frag-fest... and this game will deliver.  It's just a shame they didnt add an online multiplayer component.  This was a real missed opportunity... but not a deal breaker.  4-player splitscreen versus mode is a welcome addition, and works very nicely.  Granted... it's no Call of Duty.... but it is a blast to play through.  Me and my friends will have a blast with this, especially since The Conduit only has online multiplayer (what a shame!)... part of the draw of owning a Wii is having your friends over to play local multiplayer games.5) Hardcore Difficulty: \"Hypermode Difficulty\" mode is a BEAST.  It will make you want to pull your hair out. It is not for the faint of heart! =)  I loved every second of it... Metroid Prime 3's Hypermode Difficulty was REALLY punishing... enemies are hard to kill and plentiful.  I LOVE a challenge, and hate when games end too early or are too easy... and these games do neither.  Over 80hrs of hardcore gameplay? Yes please...In short, this Trilogy belongs in EVERY Wii-owner's collection.  Not to mention it comes in a \"Collector's Edition\" tin case with a poster and cool concept art... I even got a free MP Trilogy T-shirt.  GO BUY THIS GAME!  NOW.. seriously... I'll wait.. GO!Here are my rating scores for the Trilogy (all 3 games as 1):Presentation: 9/10 (menus are updated with pointer functionality, and you can select your game (MP1,2,3 or multiplayer) from the start screen. My only gripe is that your gamesaves from the original Metroid Prime 3: Corruption CANNOT be used for this game... so I have to start from scratch.  No worries, though... I played through that game 2 years ago, so I am about due for a replay.Graphics: 10/10 - this is one of the pretties games on the Wii. Enemies and environments are colorful and lively.Gameplay: 10/10 - These are 3 of the best games available on ANY Nintendo console.  'Nuff said.Lasting Appeal: 9/10 - 3 hardcore games with unlockable \"Hypermode\" difficulty, plus robust achievements.  Local only multiplayer. I would rate it 10/10 if they had included online multiplayer... but I prefer local-only multiplayer to online-only multiplayer.Overall: 9.5/10 - Absolutely incredible set of games. A must-have for all Wii owners!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-25-2009"}
{"product_name":"B008E6ZXTA","description":"","reviewerName":"Private Quentin Tarantino Fan","summary":"One of the Best HD Deals Out There - Highly Recommended!","reviewText":"A QUICK NOTE: First off, before I begin this review, I want to lay my cards out on the table.  Doom 3 is one of my favorite games of all time, but unlike other PC gamers, I never was able to play it on PC.  I originally owned the Xbox version (and only that version), and I have never played the original at all on any other platform.  Unfortunately, this review will not compare this edition to the original PC games, because I have never owned any of them.  I also do not even have my copy of Doom 3 any more.  So basically, this review is written by someone who doesn't even own Doom 3 any more.  Before I got this, the only Doom game I owned was Ultimate Doom, which I got for PC during this summer's Steam sale.So readers, please, PLEASE, don't go into this review expecting a comparison to the original PC games.  I just felt I needed to be honest because I understand that people who already own the games, will want a look between the original games and the BFG Edition.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Eight years after it's initial release, Doom 3 is finally available for consoles in the form of the BFG Edition.  I'll go out and state that this review will put the overall package over my personal opinions about the games themselves (although I will at least give my personal opinions on them throughout.  After all, I love the Doom franchise).  Besides, I suspect that if you are here, you are a Doom fan, right?  Or at least have a great interest in the series!  So let's break it down.* Both Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil have been remastered with changes to the audio and visuals of Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil.* HD Remastering and technical improvements are the main selling point id is pushing.  This includes improved lighting, rendering, textures, and many more.  Also, Doom 3: BFG Edition supports 3D TV.* On the Audio side, Doom 3: BFG Edition includes 5.1 surround sound.* The Doom: BFG Edition also includes Trophies/Achievements, as well as a new checkpoint save system for consoles.  You can use a flashlight and your weapon gun at the same time.* The Lost Missions, a totally new, seven mission campaign with a whole new story.* Finally, Doom 3: BFG Edition includes the original Doom and Doom 2 as a bonus.THE GAMES THEMSELVESDoom 3 is one my all time favorite FPS games.  Given it's game play model, it's overall consensus is a bit divided.  Doom 3 is basically shooting a ton of enemies, only done with extremely amazing technology (At the time, any way), with lavish production values.  It's easy to see how Doom 3 can be a tad simple for certain gamers.  Those who prefer the likes of slower, more strategic FPS like Metro or Crysis may not enjoy Doom 3 as much as their games of choice.  However, if you still find Doom to be as great of a game as it was when it first came out, Doom 3 is as good as you remember.For me, Doom 3 is still one of my favorite First Person Shooters.  Doom 3's combat is pretty straightforward, and it does resemble the original's game play in many ways.  However, all the pieces come together for Doom 3, even today.  As a result, Doom 3 is still an amazing FPS experience, and as amazing as I remember it.  The enemies are oh so cool, the weapons are classic Doom mainstay (read: Awesome), the bosses are frigging awesome, and the experience is still totally compelling and immersive.  Yeah, I don't think that this game has at all aged, as controls and all other technical mechanics are as smooth and playable as they were when the game was first released.Resurrection of Evil follows suit, and aside from new enemies, a new  story, and new weapons, it pretty much plays the same. It does, however, provides a fresh new experience for gamers, and simply adds more to the great game that is Doom 3.  Rest assured, it's very simple.  If you love Doom 3, you will love Doom: Resurrection of Evil.Doom 1 and 2 are still playable classics, which is amazing considering how old they are.  While id's earlier games (starting with Hovertank 3D, and ending with Wolfenstein 3D) feel very antiquated and boring, the original two Doom games are still simple, great fun.  Rest assured, they are very old games, and their game play mechanics are very simple.  Heck, Doom didn't even feature a \"true\" 3-D environment.  However, despite the fact that the FPS genre has evolved dramatically since it's inception (don't listen to the people who say otherwise, they know nothing about the genre), Doom 1 and 2 are still great games worth playing today.In addition, all games feature multi-player.  The multi-player modes don't feature all of the standard features you expect in games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, but they provide for some classic FPS multi-player that predates the modern incarnations we know and love.  The modes included are pretty standard, but fun. Deathmatch is primarly the mode available, but there are different flavors of deathmatch.  Standard, team, one-on-one, and last man standing are all included.THE LOST LEVELSWhile not worth the price of the full package, The Lost Levels add for some more game play to the already long Doom 3 campaign, but they do not add anything radically new to the Doom 3 experience.  However, they are still fun, action packed, and still atmospheric as the original games, so they are worth playing through.REMASTERING - AUDIO AND VISUALHere's the big one: the spruced up visuals.  Doom 3 and Resurrection of Evil have both been given the HD treatment; another set of games in the line of increased visual and sound fidelity.  In the case of the visual end of the games, Doom 3 looks tons better than it did on the Xbox copy I had, which had visuals that looked similar to early current generation video games (heck, it looks better than, say Mindjack).  In more technical terms, id Software built the game on improved lighting and textures.  The result is as pretty you might expect.  I wouldn't go so far as to compare the game to Crysis 2 on PS3, but from afar, it actually could pass for a next gen game (or at least an early one).  Seeing Doom 3 in HD only makes the experience even better.  If you have a 3D Tv, then you will benefit from the remaster even more.As for 5.1 Surround Sound, I think it's mostly a somewhat trivial asset.  5.1 surround sound is nice, but it really didn't enhance the experience to previously unheard levels. Having said that, it definitely makes a difference and it sounds awesome on a surround system.  If you have one, you already know that this makes a big difference. This edition takes advantage of sound in all directions, letting you hear sounds from.every angle, for better or for worse.  Needless to say, this provides a high level of immersion, indeed.  Hearing footsteps and unforeseen, near unexplainable ambient noises is scary in every form.  Terrific sound design only makes this better.  Guns sound extremely impressive, as do all the various sound effects that capably draw you into the experience.  In short, not much to complain about here.As far as sound design goes, Doom 3 sounds great.  It's been so long since I owned the original, but as far as I can tell, more well placed sound effects only add to the horror.  There was some stuff that I never even remember hearing when playing the original all the years back, and it makes the game all the more immersive.MINOR GAME PLAY CHANGESFirst, flashlight.  In this edition, you can finally use a flashlight and your weapon at the same time.  The flashlight needs to be recharged, so use it wisely.  Thankfully, it doesn't hamper the game's difficulty.  The original Doom 3 didn't let you carry both a flashlight and gun at the same time.  Some people found it annoying.  Other people thought it made the game more nerve-wrecking.  Doom 3 changed that, but unfortunately, I can't find a way to switch it back to the original flashlight approach.Lastly, the inclusion of auto-saving checkpoints.  Despite the use of them, you can still save your game whenever you want.  It's a good thing you can to, because I found the autosave points to be located very far away from each other, which may either be good or bad depending on where you stand.  If you enjoy games that auto save, but not so much that you never feel the inclination to survive, than you will be pleased.  If you prefer a more generous approach, you might want to save more often.  Ultimately, it all comes down to where you stand.  On a plus note, the auto save checkpoints are not as spread out like they were in Rage, so you will feel in less danger of losing all the progress you made within the levels.TROPHIES/ACHIEVEMENTSAlright, there's not too much to say about this one.  The games come with Achievements/Trophies, and you will find some more replay value in completing certain objectives in order to show other games what you can do if a game company throws a certain task at you.  Personally, I honestly find Trophies and Achievements trivial, but if you are a trophy/achievement collector, Doom 3: BFG Edition has many trophies that will keep you busy.OVERALL:Playing through all the content in the BFG Edition has definitely reminded me of how much I still love these games.  If there is anybody who doesn't own Doom 3, now's your chance.  This is one great deal for the price, and it's definitely one of the best HD remaster collections alongside the Ico/Shadow of the Colossus collection.  Now, if you already own it, I'm not going to automatically say it's worth buying, so I would advise anybody who wants to know about the comparisons to check out other reviews.  However, anyone with a fledgling interest in one of the best FPS franchises of all time should consider this a must buy.  If you, like me, lost most of your Doom games as well, then this is also a must buy.  At it's current price, it's a terrific budget package for a game series that still holds its own ever since its first inception.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0002A6CQ4","description":"The walking dead have incoherently moaned, clumsily shuffled their feet, and affectionately given us crater-sized hickeys in every Resident Evil game to date. The animated corpses that put this series on the map and redefined video game horror as a whole are now buried six feet under the soil at Capcom's Production Studio 4. It may be difficult to envision a Resident Evil game without flesh-eating zombies, but Capcom is showing us that there are far more terrifying things that go bump in the night. Nothing can truly prepare you for the unspeakable horrors that will hunt you until your last breath is given. It's been a long time coming, but Resident Evil is back, and it is better and bloodier than ever before.This game is such a departure from the series' heritage that the only familiarity gamers will have with it is through protagonist Leon S. Kennedy, who was first introduced as a greenhorn police officer that spent his first day on the job handling the outbreak in Resident Evil 2. Attracted to madness like teenage girls are to Camp Crystal Lake, Kennedy once again finds himself knee-deep in unspeakable horror. Rather than having maggot-infested zombies gnawing at his neck, crazed villagers are the order of the day. Unlike the slow-witted, slow-moving dead, these adversaries are very intelligent, extremely agile, and not afraid to use weapons. They also like to attack in packs. Picture if you will a group of six murderous souls with beady red eyes glowing under the moonlight running at you with lit dynamite, ducking out of the way of your shots, and calling out for others nearby to lend a hand in your death. This is a new kind of scare that far surpasses the suspense and jump-out-of-your-seat shock moments that fueled the previous chapters in the series. As you'll soon learn, there are few things scarier than a middle-aged housewife that sprints at you with a blood-soaked axe raised into the air, belting out a bloodcurdling scream.To counteract the intelligence and sheer brutality of these new foes, Capcom has completely reworked the combat system. In the past, we blindly fired into areas we couldn't see and ran past enemies to preserve ammo. This time around, everything that so much as raises a finger at you must die&nbsp;&#8211; preferably by a nicely placed headshot. A remarkable new targeting system allows this feat to be handled with the utmost precision. On this note, I've never seen so many heads explode in my life. The new over-the-shoulder perspective coupled with a beautifully crafted laser sight makes for a lethal and satisfying combat experience. Additionally, players can now interact with their surroundings in a handful of clever ways, such as knocking down ladders and pushing dressers in front of doors. The Resident Evil games were always criticized for being too clumsy in gameplay. With Resident Evil 4, however, I can't envision it playing any better.I also like how the game pushes players to scour every inch of the environments. Rare treasures that are unearthed can be traded in to a vendor for cash. With enough funds you can buy new weapons and items, as well as upgrade all of your armaments. Inventory space is still limited, but it's finally done in a way that makes sense. You now manage a physical space. If a new gun doesn't fit in your case, try moving things around to make room for it.Recently, developers have been talking about the need to blend story cinematics with gameplay. Capcom has accomplished just this, and it's captured in way that will make you wish that every game that you play utilized this innovative system. For instance, if a character in a sequence comes at you with a knife, you have to press the L and R buttons at the precise moment to dodge the attack, otherwise the scene will end with blood gushing from your neck. The interaction that you have at your hands is unprecedented, and you'll be doing things you didn't even think were possible in games.There are no flaws in Resident Evil 4. It is the greatest horror game to date. I never thought that a game, or movie for that matter, could deliver pulse-pounding action in such an awe-inspiring way.Concept:A brilliant new direction for survival horror that focuses on gunplay and truly cinematic momentsGraphics:A sickening level of detail accompanies every little object, animation, and effect. It looks too good to be trueSound:Great voice acting, stress-inducing music, and disturbing sound effects combine to create the perfect atmospherePlayability:The controls are fashioned beautifully, boss fights are ingenious, and the popping of heads is immensely rewardingEntertainment:Hard to put down even after you've beaten it twiceReplay:Moderately HighRated:10 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:March 20052nd Opinion:Some games are simply destined to become milestones in gaming history, and Resident Evil 4 is one of them. Even those who have never picked up one of the previous titles and swear that they hate the slow-paced crawl of survival horror games simply must play it. Capcom has managed to create a game that is a complete reinvention of the series &#8211; even the entire genre &#8211; without losing anything that Resident Evil fans expect. Perfectly balancing elements of horror, subtlety, and wit with explosive action and over-the-top thrills, playing RE 4 feels like living one of the most epic films you've ever seen. Gorgeous to look at, a dream to control, and filled with some of the most exciting moments you've experienced in a game, Resident Evil 4 is stellar on every level. It goes without saying that it's the best in the series, the best survival horror game yet, and simply one of the best games ever made.Rated:10 out of 10Editor:Jeremy ZossSubscribe to Game Informer--Amazon.com","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Resident Evil is back in a new way, shape, and form.","reviewText":"Resident Evil 4 for the almighty Gamecube follows Leon Kennedy, one of the heroes from Resident Evil 2, as he finds himself in some sort of Spanish farm village to find the President of the United States' kidnapped daughter Ashley. Little does he realize that he is stepping right into another nightmare, one that may just surpass that of the Raccoon City incident. On his adventure he will encounter unlikley and yet familiar faces, crazed religious men, and many more..For better of for worse, RE 4 is a major step in a different direction than the previous games in the series. To begin, this is the first Resident Evil to have a free-roaming camera instead of having it in a fixed position. In addition, you can finally interact with your enviroment & enemies (half the time you have no choice if you wish to survive). By this I mean you can now jump over fences, kick enemies away, etc. And finally, this game is all about fast paced, heart racing action instead of puzzles and shooting something once in awhile.I'll tell you straight up, this game is hard. Maybe to many it wasn't, but for me it was. Anyway, you get a lot of weapons like a handgun, shotgun, sniper rifle, a few types of grenades and many more. You also get a lot of items like ammo, first aids, treasures, and herbs. As you progress in the game you can upgrade your weapons to a much more powerful state, and if you do certain things right, can unlock new weapons altogether. Like I said earlier, this game focuses more on the action like really intense shootouts. Like in one part, you and a new character named Louis must shoot it out against pretty much an army of parasite-infested villagers before they kill you, and the best part is, they will break windows and use ladders to get into the house - both on the first and second floor.The AI in this game is truley amazing. Every enemy you encounter will call for backup, try dodging your aim, and use any kind of weapon they can get their hands on. Even your allies AI is good - for instance, if you aim your weapon at Ashley she will duck so you can fire at someone who may be coming up behind her. I was impressed, and apparently, so were hundreds if not thousands of other players.Now it is time for graphics. I'll say it out right and blunt: They are pretty much some of the best on the Gamecube and probably some of the best in the whole gaming industry. I know I say this a lot, but everything looks so damned lifelike, and at times, extremley menacing. The guns look real, and sound it too, and every character (be it Leon, the village chief, etc) all look so amazingly real. Capcom did an exceptional job on the enviroments. From the lonley, pre-21st century villages, to the dark and scary graveyard, to the HUGE and terrorfying castle you will be amazed. Hell, even the water moves fluid and looks beautiful... until the Watcher of the Lake comes and attacks you.Whats cool in this game is just like in RE 3: Nemisis, you can unlock a sort of \"Mercenary Mode\" where all you do is kill as many enemies as you can using a small assortment of weapons until time runs out. If you complete certain stages with a certain score you can unlock other characters to use such as Hunk, and Wesker... although I wasn't too impressed with Wesker, it is still a lot of fun and is also very action packed.The sound is pretty awesome, although there isn't much music besides the save music. The voice overs are awesome and when it comes from the enemies, it definitley freaks you out. The villagers, Illuminados, and every one else all scream and whisper and growl.. its awesome. Although Leon is voiced by someone different than that of his RE debut in number two, whoever voices him now he helps give Leon some personality and just makes him more human.Wha I didn't like was that this game, to me, feels as though its a basic run-n-gun game instead of a real horror filled Resident Evil title. I guess I'm just too old school nowadays. Anyways, dont get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun and is definitley worth picking up... but dont think that just because Leon Kennedy is in the game that it has anything to do with the other titles in the series. In otherwords, older fans of the series may feel left out of the circle.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

Not two playable games and all of the cut scenes from another. Who would like this aspect with any other re-released trilogy game? Just imagine what the feedback would be for Sly Cooper, Jak and Daxter, Ratchet and Clank or Devil May Cry if you could only play two of the games and just watch the cinematics for the last installment?

Now they'll know for sure that you killed that guy!\" at the TV screen while watching a movie, getting dirty looks from everyone else who's trying to watch the movie? Well, now you can come up with your own answer. That's what Indigo Prophecy is all about - making important decisions during dangerous situations within a few seconds. The first choices you get to make are right after you (Lucas Kain) cut your wrists and then kill an innocent man in a restroom. There's a cop in the same restaurant as you, and at any moment he could decide to use the toilet. How will you hide the evidence of the murder? And will you do it quickly enough so you can get out of the restaurant before anyone finds the body? What will you tell people about the wounds on your wrists?The system works like this: you have multiple choices during dialogue and certain situations. You have to pick the right one to convince people to help you, convince people that you didn't kill anyone, etc. You only have a couple of seconds to comprehend the question, read the answers, and pick which one will work. The answer you choose sometimes affects the plot drastically, causing you to get arrested or causing people you care about to die. It's worse if you run out of time before making a choice. Then you might blurt something out like \"I wasn't at that restaurant,\" when no one mentioned the murder in the restaurant, which completely gives you away.Another speed test is the Simon-type reflex game. If you're in a dangerous situation and you have to dodge flying objects, or you're trying to read someone's mind so that you know how to answer to their question, two color pads will appear on the screen. You have to move your analog sticks in the direction it shows to succeed, and you only have a second to react. A small problem with this game is that, sometimes the sequences drag on too long, like a boss that just won't die. You have to concentrate, so it can get tiring. If you mess up, you have to start all over again. That can be a little frustrating.In this game, you get to play as each of the two cops working on this case, and Lucas Kain, the accidental killer. You take turns playing each one. They have their own personalities, abilities, and lives, which makes for an interesting story.A fairly unique feature is the stress meter. When something upsetting happens to your character, the meter goes down. If it goes low enough, the character will give up or commit suicide, resulting in a game over. You can eat, drink, rest, contact friends, etc. to increase the meter.I had a few small problems with this game. There is an \"Otherworld\" that you can occasionally see into, which is inhabited by ghostly green bugs. These bugs range in size from the size of a penny to the size of a car. That doesn't seem very creative to me. They make it out like the Otherworld is a pretty horrible place, but all you see are radioactive cockroaches. I just think that they could have come up with something better. Another issue is that one of the powerful, evil people in the Otherworld sounds like he has inhaled helium. It sounds funny, which seems out of place in this type of game. These don't affect the game too much, so it's no big deal.I enjoyed playing this game. It was like a book I couldn't put down. Some parts are spooky. For example, one of the cops investigating the murder goes to a mental asylum to visit someone who was involved in a case similar to this one. The power goes out and the electronic locks on the doors malfunction. All of the psychopathic killers come out. It's dark, there's maniacal laughter, and the guy who was with you just got attacked. You have to sneak out without alerting the inmates to your presence. How exciting! Each new scene had something interesting happening. There weren't beautiful cutscenes, but the overall graphics were good. The music added to the atmosphere. I recommend this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2005"}

For the first time, drivers explore new competitive kart possibilities, such as soaring through the skies or plunging to the depths of the sea. New courses, strategic new abilities and customizable karts bring the racing excitement to new heights.","reviewerName":"rodjoh \"rodjoh\"","summary":"It's the Mario Kart you know and love. Great fun.","reviewText":"The Mario Kart games have easily become the most respectable spin-off series to come out of a flagship Nintendo franchise. You really don't want to break Mario Kart, because they are potential system sellers and even non gamers stay amused at the sight of Mario and friends riding them karts. After the amazing Wii and DS entries I was expecting a lot from this new version. I can't say that Mario Kart 7 is everything I wish it was, but it is close enough to be worth your time and money.What's great about MK7? Well, the graphics are sweet and the 3D effect works well enough. I was surprised that even when set to full, I had no major issue with the 3D effects. Which is not the same I can say about other 3DS games. Considering this is a racing game that is always moving makes this even more amazing to me. MK7 also includes both new tracks and tracks from previous Mario Kart games. I got a great kick out of this with the previous versions so I'm glad they are keeping this trend.What is also great is the new features on this version. For starters, you are able to customize your kart. Its a very simple system, but its there. You can choose the body, wheels and your glider. The combination of these (and your character choice) will determine your kart's stats. This adds a little extra dimension to the series which is more than welcome. And yes, your kart can glide in the air for a little bit in certain sections, and you can also drive underwater. These may not seem like much but they could totally make the difference in a race when taken to your advantage. Coin collecting is back, and the Tanooki tail is a new item to hit people with. There's also a dedicated channel with online play where you can challenge other groups of people and race ghosts. Also welcome.What bothered me a bit about MK7 was the track selection. The new tracks are questionably okay, they don't suck but they aren't all that great either and they seemed to force the gliding sections in an awkwardly obvious way. I liked that they based a track on Wuhu Island (wii fit/sport's setting), but did they really need TWO tracks in Wuhu Island?? I don't think so. The classic tracks chosen to return are a bit hit or miss too. Though overall I suppose they do the job.A bit disappointing was the fact that the bikes and the stunt system from the Wii version are also gone, tho I may understand that in a portable this may not work that well. At least you can still get mini-boost from jumping at the right moments.Overall MK7 is a great Mario Kart entry. Any fan of the series will love it. I would have given it a bit more time so it came out better, but as it is it works just fine. Recommended.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-12-2012"}
{"product_name":"B00009WAUK","description":"You can almost hear the collective drooling of RPG and Game Boy fans worldwide. As the inaugural Nintendo/Square reunion title,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancehas a lot to live up to--and it does, spectacularly!The long heralded Final Fantasy series has enjoyed a number of spin-offs and sequels. Using the familiar character types and classes of the Final Fantasy series, but with a wholly original storyline,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancecreates an immersive world of strategic combat and conquest.Snow JobWhile most fantasy games favor romantic landscapes,Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceslyly starts out in a plain-vanilla suburb. Players assume the role of young Marche Radiuju in the humble burg of St. Ivalice.A snowball fight introduces the characters and sets the groundwork for future battles. After a brief (but chilly) skirmish, Marche heads home to visit his younger brother.Marche MadnessSoon after, Marche's friends drop by to show him an ancient book of mysterious origins. After failing to translate the text properly, Marche's friends leave for the evening. After a wistful slumber, Marche awakens and realizes he isn't in Ivalice anymore... or is he?Alone in a foreign land, Marche quickly comes under the care of a helpful creature known as a Moogle. It doesn't take much to convince Marche to adopt a lucrative career as a mercenary.Gangs of IvaliceA quick stop at the town inn introduces Marche to his new gang. A motley crew at best, your associates include low-level monks, mages, archers, and soldiers. The only hope you have of finding your way home is to turn your ragtag group of misfits into a finely tuned fighting force.Begin your tour of duty by chatting up the local barkeep. He'll clue you in to interesting news bits, rumors, and job opportunities. Due to your severe lack of experience, early quests are little more than errands.As you gain experience and reputation, your job options grow as well as the rewards. You can also send one of your crew members on side missions for extra swag. You cannot use these members in your regular quests until they return from their mission.Rules of EngagementWhether your quest is to fetch rare herbs or escort the local nobleman, you can always expect bad company. The battlefield is set up from an isometric 3D viewpoint, allowing clear view of every character in play.At the start of a match, you must choose which members of your gang you wish to take into battle with you. You have a clear view of the enemies before choosing, so try to match your lineup to your opposition.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceintroduces an innovative law system to the series. During every battle, an impartial judge decrees specific rules, such as banning poison attacks or physical attacks. The judges' unpredictability requires players to keep a well-rounded group of characters at all times.Technically, you can break the combat laws, but it is generally not recommended. Even if you win the battle, any of your characters who breaks a law is whisked away to prison. They can only be released after paying a hefty fine.Fantasy FightingThe battlefield is set up like a 3D chessboard, with elevations and terrain types. In each turn, a character can move a specific number of spaces and perform a single action, such as attack or using an item.Most strategy games employ either real-time or turn-based action.Final Fantasy Tactics Advanceemploys a speed-based system that is somewhere in-between.Characters still take turns to move and perform actions, but these are based on each character's individual speed ratings. Nimble characters like rogues and ninjas are usually the first characters to go and can usually move farther than other characters. The downside is that faster characters typically lack strong armor and health stats.Subtle details such as terrain type and attack proximity can have a direct affect on your ability to hit an enemy. Attacking an enemy from behind or the side will yield much higher hit percentages than head-on attacks.Job FairWhat you do off the battlefield is arguably more important than what you do on it. Thanks to a stable economy, your characters can usually change job classes once they gain enough experience.Need a little more magic in your life? Try turning one of your grunts into a mage. There are more than 30 different job classes available, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.Even in far-off fantasy lands, commercialism is a way of life. You'll be amazed at how quickly you'll end up spending your hard-earned greenbacks on shiny new stuff. Weapons and armor serve not only to boost your stats, but also grant special abilities to specific character types and species.While one sword might grant tremendous attack points, a seemingly lesser sword may give its wielder access to a special attack that can tip the scales in your favor. Thanks to the law system, one should never get too attached to a single piece of equipment.Face ValueGorgeous character illustrations and 2D sprites harken back to Square's 16-bit glory days. Each of the shops, inns, towns, and fields is superbly detailed, with subtle background animations.Final Fantasy Tactics Advancemaintains the series' stellar rep for technically and visually brilliant summon attacks.Uniquely,Final Fantasy Tactics Advancefeatures three separate display settings, depending on whether you're playing on the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, or the Game Boy Player. Each setting offers different levels of brightness, contrast, and saturation to appease even the most fickle of gamers.The only thing that can rival the on-screen wonders is the audio candy. It is no surprise why Square Enix's soundtracks are the most sought-after in the video game community.Lasting PowerNeedless to say, there are hours upon hours of gameplay packed into this tiny little cartridge. Square Enix has done a tremendous job in creating an easily accessible yet incredibly deep gameplay experience. Plug into one of the finest strategy RPG experiences ever created withFinal Fantasy Tactics Advance.","reviewerName":"Cloud \"...\"","summary":"Deep gameplay for something that doesn't look like it","reviewText":"Maybe a year or so after Squaresoft released the uber-masterpiece Final Fantasy VII, they released Final Fantasy Tactics, a more strategy-based game in which you move players around a playing field. It had a immensely deep job system where there were so many jobs and abilities you could've racked up over 100 hours at least if you wanted to get all characters with all the abilities. But the story was way too complicated for it's own good, thanks in large part to a shoddy translation. Now we have the \"sequel\" and it may look kiddy but it is deeper than the deepest ocean.Story: After a snowball fight, main character Marche's friend Mewt says he's gonna buy a fantasy book. Marche suggests he brings it to his house and invites his other friend Ritz. The book is in a different language with someone reading out loud a passage. During the night, their world actually takes the form of the book's world, with different races and creatures. Now Marche must discover how to get home, but do his friends even want to, let alone him?Graphics: Very...um, pretty is the word I'm looking for. Even vibrant. Like the amazon page says, it harkens back to the 16 bit days of Yoshi's Island and Chrono Trigger.Sound/Music: I didn't notice anything particularly catchy but the music fit the areas. The enemies give out really weird death screams in some cases. But the sound effects from spells and hits are very nice.Gameplay: Some pros and cons like all games. Gameplay is immensely deep but enemies earlier on can really kick your *** even when you don't have a lot of time in the game. Plus, don't be surprised if you're 2 squares away and your attack misses yet they perfectly nail you from far away. And your classic way of levelling up either comes from clan fights or story missions, which means you can't just wander around and beat enemies left and right. Or maybe you can, who knows but I haven't seen it yet.The menus are ugh also. When you buy a weapon, it may have a spell that you want to learn but you don't know how useful it is in battle. Be ready for menus upon menus mixed with more menus.Any fans of the original Tactics remembers that after every battle you obtained Job Points, collect enough and you can use them to \"buy\" a spell or ability. Now it takes the Final Fantasy IX system by having them attached to weapons/armor.I'll try to explain: imagine Rod A has the Life spell and it needs 200 ability points to learn it. You get these by competing in many battles where at the end, you get the ability points. If you've obtained 200, you've learned Life and can de-equip Rod A and equip Rod B. However, if you haven't learned Rod A's Life spell and equip Rod B, you can't use Life unless you equip Rod A and get those 200.This can be extremely annoying as this amazing useful ability is done by doing some off-the-wall missions you probably wouldn't bother with, or stealing off an enemy that you're more concerned is gonna kill you in 2 hits.Also, there is 300 missions in this game. Some are optional for story advancement, others simply for completionists or for people levelling up. It's as short or as long as you want it to be but you'll probably enjoy yourself in the process.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-29-2004"}

Put together all the Mario games (at least to that point) on a single cartridge and allow players to SAVE their progress.  Wow!  While the concept it a great one, the trouble I've always found with this collection comes from the individual games themselves.-Mario 3: 95% percent of my time playing &#34;All Stars&#34; was spent playing this game, as it is the one that easily translates the best from NES to SNES.  It is the only game that doesn't feel like a &#34;port&#34;, and it is the best all-around Mario game maybe ever (Mario '64 may give it a run).-Mario 1: A faithful re-creation of the iconic original.  However, I've always felt that game was meant to be played on the original NES with the two-button control.  It plays okay on the SNES, but it loses some of that atmosphere.-Mario 2: This is just a strange game to begin with.  It is completely different (pulling up plants and throwing them?!) than any other Mario game.  I know some people really enjoy it, by I always skipped this one because I thought it wasn't as good as the traditional Mario setup.-Lost Levels: The trouble here is that Lost Levels is just too doggone difficult (the reason why the strange Mario 2 exists in the first place, as game distributors correctly evaluated it as much too hard for U.S. gamers).  It looks great and feels like a classic Mario game, but good luck getting anywhere past the first couple of levels.  I can run through the entire Mario Bros. original with almost no damage, but I could barely even make a dent in this one.Thus, your overall enjoyment of &#34;Super Mario All Stars&#34; will likely come down to two factors: 1. Does it bother you to play a game on a different system for which it was intended?&#34;; and 2. Will you play Mario 2 and/or Lost Levels enough to even make it worth your while?  I had hours of fun playing Mario 3 from this cartridge, but all the others pretty much sat stagnant for the reasons described above.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00DC7G2W8","reviewerName":"Nutwiisystem.Com","summary":"We've seen Mario save the Princess. Now can it save the Wii U?","reviewText":"It's no secret that the Wii U has been struggling. Nintendo needed to hit an out-of-the-park grand slam to have any chance of reviving it. With Mario Kart 8, it may have done just that.There's not much new with Mario Kart 8. It's the same kart racing concept that's been around since Super Mario Kart for the SNES. You race against a number of other Mario characters in various tracks. As with Mario Kart Wii, you can use the Wii remote to steer (the Mario Kart wheel is just a round plastic accessory that you snap the remote into). You can also use the Wii U Pro controller, the Wii Remote or the Gamepad (you can also use the Wii remote + Classic Controller Pro or the Wii remote + Nunchuk).The Gamepad offers additional features, of course. At its most basic, you can steer by tilting the Gamepad. The ZL button lets you throw things you've picked up, the A button accelerates, and the B button goes in reverse. In addition, you can use the ZR + A button to \"drift\". If you play on the Gamepad, you still look to the TV to play, but your Gamepad screen shows everyone's position in the race (and what extra they have in their possession), as well as a video of the race, a map of the track with everyone's position, and a horn in the middle like a real steering wheel.The graphics are phenomenal and finally showcase the HD capabilities of the Wii U. The colors are bright, and there's amazing detail in all the screens, from delicate giant dandelions to giant candies that look good enough to eat. New tracks are wonderfully creative, such as one where you drive through an airport's terminal area, baggage claim area, and right onto the runway as a jumbo jet flies towards you. Classic tracks like Moo Moo Meadows have been totally redone with crisp graphics and exquisite attention to detail, from beautiful sunrises to trees and cows with detailed 3D rendering, to marks your vehicle makes when driving over sand. The tracks are a lot more nuanced, so you can either stay on the main road or take various shortcuts you'll discover over time.Unlike the previous Mario Kart Wii, you can not only choose a Kart type (50cc, 100cc and 150cc), but also configure it with custom tires and a custom \"parachute\" that deploys when you're in the air--as you get more advanced in the game you'll understand how subtle choices you make here can give you an advantage on certain tracks.Gameplay is mostly the same as always. You race around the track, pick up cubes that'll unlock extras to use in the race (including new ones like a boomerang, a sonic boom device, and a rotator that lets you use 8 of them in succession).  They've kept old features in, but subtly introduced new ones, like a blue strip that turns your car into a hovercraft. You can also pick up coins throughout the game which will help you unlock things like new accessories, vehicles, and characters.Of course, the game is best played using the Gamepad or the Wii remote to steer. The controls are much, much improved over Mario Kart Wii. You feel much tighter control and precision than I've felt in any other racing game on any platform.There are a lot of new bells and whistles. After each race, you can view a \"highlight reel\" that lets you relive your greatest moments during the race. A new feature called \"Mario Kart TV\" archives your recent race videos.You can play single player against the computer or multiplayer. As with Mario Kart Wii, in single player mode, you can race the Grand Prix (4 race matches), Time Trials (racing for new time records), VS Race (racing using special rules, including adjusting items, computer difficulty, number of races, etc.), and Battle Mode (where you try to pop the other team's balloons). Multiplayer mode has the same options except for Time Trials, and lets you race up to four players.One of the worst features of Mario Kart Wii was its online play. There was simply much too much cheating going on, with cheaters racking up thousands of points and creating hacks that made the competition meaningless. I was shocked at how good online play is now. You see your Mii join in with other Miis from around the world, you all vote on which track to play, and it looks like at least for now there's no cheating--you can observe the technique the top players are using, and it's clear that it's all skill that keeps them up front. For me, I consistently placed around positions 5-7, and I was very happy with that. If you have 12 friends, you can get around the 4-player limit on a local Wii by connecting them online, forming your own Room, and competing against each other.They did seem to do away with the \"driver's license\" feature of Mario Kart Wii where you could keep track of which tracks you've played, but that was no great loss. What is a bit annoying is that it's not easy to change your Mii in case someone else want to play, so unless you quit the game, select a different Mii, and restart the game, all the videos and progress will be attributed to one Mii. The exception to this is online multiplayer, where player 2 will be able to select their own Mii to play online.Simply put, this is not just the best game on the Wii U, it's one of the best games Nintendo has ever released, and one of the best racing games on any platform. It's a shame they didn't have the foresight to bundle this with the original Wii U when it first came out, because I think this game could have boosted sales of the Wii U by millions of units, just like Wii Sports did back when the Wii was released. Still, they did a smart thing and are running a generous promotion where if you register this game, you'll get another great game for free (Pikmin 3, Super Mario Bros U, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Walker, or Wii Party U). It's a nice way for Nintendo to thank those who purchased the Wii U early on, as well as push people on the fence to get on board.While this game is hardly original (the concept is the same as it's been for over 20 years), the graphics, gameplay, and precise controls make it a must-have for anyone who has a Wii U, and a reason to run out and buy a Wii U for those who don't.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-08-2014"}

And an excellent soundtrack","reviewText":"Although this was a surprise to me for I had loved the original sands of time trilogy and had doubt about the quality potential of this game. I just loved this game. I was pleased to see that they were ready to give a different prince, more positive, charming and sympathetic, but with enough human depth to have feelings of doubts and of fear. I was pleased that the princess in this universe also had a more important like to the plot and I loved the idea that the player could combine her powers and create great combos. Even the idea of putting various discussions between the prince and the princess really gives more depth to the story. A great job not only from the producers and artists of the game, but also to Rihanna Pratchett, the screenwriter to the game who also worked on EA'S excellent Mirror's Edge. Not only that I loved the soundtrack. An excellent job they did for it gives to the game a magical atmosphere of greatness which makes the castle, in which you travel, much more impressive.Although different from the original trilogy, a great game to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-16-2010"}

If you want to use a standby during battle to replace one of your characters, just hit L1 to switch them out.My only small beef with this game is that there is no monetary system at all.  It needs to have an option to sell what you don't need and to actually buy new equipment instead of just acquiring all of them.  Some shops would have been nice.

Prepare foods, combine raw ingredients, cook the meal and present your culinary masterpiece to Mama for your final score.","reviewerName":"C. Bakehorn","summary":"Extra tasty for only $20!","reviewText":"Putting me, your friendly Game Freaks 365 video game reviewer, into a kitchen is about as productive as chucking an infant armed with a combat knife on the front lines. I touch spatulas and pots and pans and things go wrong. Three-minute Ramen noodles take me eight. Ultimately Cliff Bakehorn fits with cooking as well as trying to put LEGOs together the wrong way. Well, Mama doesn't care. She wants me to cook delicious meals. In Majesco's cute little DS game, my gaming cooking skill was equal to that of my real-life skill, but I couldn't help but enjoy it anyway.Might I start by saying that never in my life has a video game made me hungry. They've made me happy, excited, angry and, in the case of Kingdom Hearts, cry like a baby. Cooking Mama made my stomach growl like an angry dog. There are dozens of recipes for gamers to prepare, including simple things like Instant Ramen and much more difficult dishes like shrimp curry (there goes my stomach again). Now, bear in mind that Cooking Mama is no simulation-far from it, in fact, it is closer to being a rhythm game than a simulation. Wolfgang Puck will still make a better meal, even if you earn gold medals in all of Cooking Mama's dishes.The audience that Cooking Mama appeals to will appreciate the simplicity of the game's controls; almost everything is done with the stylus. The stylus is your virtual hand, fork, knife, spatula, everything. You'll trace lines to cut vegetables, draw circles to stir, and tap things scattered around the screen to add ingredients, select pieces of food, and the like. Like real-life cooking, Cooking Mama is all about directions rather than difficult controls.The game is set up in a way that is even more simple; each step in the recipe is its own mini-game of sorts. For example, you'll begin to make rice by filling up cups of water and pouring them into a pot. Then you wash the rice, and if the recipe calls for adding other things, you continue in that direction. When stirring and cooking things in a pot, you'll follow a rhythm-like line of commands, changing stove temperature, blowing on the DS microphone, and stirring when prompted. Mama grades you on each individual step, and making good meals is a matter of doing each step as efficiently and properly as possible. For example, filling up a pot with too much water makes Mama very mad, and she gives the fiery death glare and a Failure to any cook who messes up.Sadly, some actions don't work as well as others. I had the hardest and most frustrating time trying to peel vegetables, but had absolutely no trouble with the rhythm stuff. Fortunately the annoying task of blowing into the DS microphone is done better here than in other games, and at least with a cooking game it is appropriate.There isn't much lasting appeal to Cooking Mama, sadly. Sure, it's fun to go back and play through all the recipes, earning gold medals and unlocking extra stuff, but there is nothing outside of that. Majesco was wise to release Cooking Mama at the bargain price of $20, because it isn't worth more than that to anyone. The Nintendo Wii follow-up, Cooking Mama: Cook Off releases this April with multiplayer features, Wii remote controls, and more content-perhaps anyone who hasn't invested time into Cooking Mama and is now considering it should wait for that release instead.Visuals and sound effects are pretty simple. Cooking Mama has a ridiculously cute art design, that's for sure. The ingredients and different parts of foods are hit and miss, but I don't think sushi seaweed ever looked very good anyway. I am actually quite satisfied that Taito didn't use more realistic images of food, because in hindsight, that wouldn't have been a very attractive sight. Real food, before being prepared, rarely looks delicious.For $20, you can't really knock Cooking Mama. It's a simple, cute game that I can guarantee for any younger or female DS owner. As mentioned before, the Wii follow-up is coming soon with even more Mama to go around, so DS owners with a Wii might consider waiting for that instead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-21-2007"}

Likely much better on the PC.-Movement was again awful, even to simple things like walking up a fire escape, became annoying, Again probably better on PC.-Cover system, was really bad, plus the camera control mixed, made it all bad.-Weapon aiming, again some of the worst ever, PC would be ok, I'm sure.-Weapon selection, is so bad, really? Left or right on the d-pad? With this many guns, why not hold a button and select from a weapon wheel, or something.-Driving was bad, so very bad, sloppy steering, the cars are all over the place, and the motorcycles are un-drivable. I like the driving in Red Faction Guerilla, that was slickly done, or maybe just done right.-Graphics are not really that good, not even for when the game was released, but graphics don't make a good game, so I over looked that fact.-Mission selection, where are my check points? Ok so I drive all the way across the city and try out a mission, I die, ok that's not bad, I'll just try again, but when you have to restart you have to drive again all the way back across the city and hope you don't fail again. Not all missions are like this, but it seems like the hard ones are. Why can't there be check point throughout the mission?

It pits you against some new enemies and lets you run around a brand new city saving the day (or destroying it depending on your preference). Infamous' gameplay is solid and very fun and this sequel doesn't skip a beat. You'll be grabbing some new powers along side some of the old favorites. The melee system has been improved due to a sort of big electric conductor that you swing around like a jackhammer to obliterate any opposition. Infamous 2's biggest improvement is it's AI. The enemies are more diverse, intelligent, and fun to play against. Infamous 2 looks better graphically as well and the chaos can look very impressive with the amounts of explosions and environmental destruction that unfold throughout the game. Infamous 2 also has a new impressive feature that allows players to create their own missions that other players can play in the game. This feature plays well into the game and you'll be hard pressed to run out of things to do in this game. Infamous 2's gameplay is top-notch. Much like its predecessor, Infamous 2 is genuinely fun and you won't soon be tired of playing it.It's not without it's flaws though. To put it nicely, Infamous 2 is the picture perfect example that a game can be awesome and fun without having any sort of plot or story. To put it in a worse light: Following in the original's footsteps, the plot just plain sucks. The story is boring and uninspired and the characters are stereotypical and not entertaining. Yes it's true that while you're jumping buildings and destroying your enemies with all sorts of amazing powers, you're not going to care one bit about why you're doing it. Infamous 2 fails in this area even more than it's predecessor and this is why Infamous is not a 5 star series. Without feeling the weight to what you're doing in a game, it can only take you so far.In conclusion, Infamous 2 is an excellent game that capitalizes on outstanding and fun gameplay that you won't soon forget about. If you're on the fence about it: rent it, check out the demo, or just buy the 1st one since it's pretty cheap these days.PROS:-Improved graphics-New powers to play with-VERY improved AI-More fun and diverse enemies-Just plain fun to playCONS:Story is uninspiring and boringCharacters are lame","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-03-2011"}

{"product_name":"B002I0J4VQ","reviewerName":"Siklootd","summary":"New Design, Is It Worth It?","reviewText":"I am a proud owner of an Xbox 360.  However, I purchased a PlayStation 3 60GB just within a few weeks after its initial launch, while I have only owned my Xbox 360 for about a year now.  What attracted me to the PS3 were all of the diverse and immense features that the console contains:Wireless ControllersLarge Hard DriveMedia Manager (music, photos, videos, etc.)Web BrowserBlu RayFree Online GamingExclusive Games (Heavenly Sword, Killzone, Resistance, Infamous, etc.)I purchased the Slim in addition to my PS3 60GB simply to have an additional console in another room, and I must say, I am very impressed.  The console is about 1/4 the size of the original PS3, and with the new matte finish, it no longer collects fingerprints and/or dust as easily as the chromatic versions do.  The console is much lighter, allowing for easier portability and easier locations in which to store the device.  It runs a lot quieter than my 60GB and at a much lower heat generating level as well.The major benefit that the PS3 has always had over both the 360 and the Wii is Blu Ray.  I'm not talking about graphics, or size of the capacity in which the disc can hold, both of which may be accurate statements, instead I'm actually talking about the reliability of these discs.  DVDs can scratch easily, resulting in discs that need to be resurfaced or in some cases even replaced.  With Blu Ray it is virtually impossible to scratch the disc unless you're actually trying to do so!  This can save you a lot of headaches down the road, especially if you have small children in the home who may mistreat discs.The lack of PS2 backwards compatibility at first does seem like a bad thing, but if you have purchased any of the next generation consoles you probably won't ever finding yourself going back to the old games anyway.  It's a realization that all PS3 owners inevitably come to at some point.  The increase in graphical performance is simply incredible and sometimes going back to the older games just doesn't feel as nostalgic as you would assume.The Slim also lacks the card reader and additional USB ports that the older consoles contained.  This is a minor annoyance and can be fixed by purchasing a USB hub with multiple inputs, and a USB SD card reader. My 60GB PS3 had a hard drive that was easy to change out, but Sony made it even easier with the new Slim.  A simple swap with a properly sized laptop harddrive can make the PS3 Slim have capacities of over 500GB if done properly.Sitting at a much lower price point now, the PS3 Slim is a great way to get into the next generation of gaming.  The console's library is steadily growing, gaining many multi-platform games that it shares with the Xbox 360.  The controller of the PS3, the Dualshock 3, is one of the best controllers ever designed.  It takes the great design and aspects of the Dualshock 2 and amplifies them with the inclusion of wireless gameplay and the ability to assign multiply controllers to the console at once.  The controller's design is perfectly suited for high action fighting games, such as Street Fighter or Marvel VS Capcom, giving the PS3 an edge over the 360 when it comes to playing games that require the use of the directional pad (d-pad).Some minor complaints I have about the PS3, however, are also in regards to the controller.  The controller contains a built in battery, yes this means no more need to change batteries, but this also means that if the controller is running low on battery life you cannot simply swap batteries in the midst of a gaming session.  The only choice you have is to plug the controller into a USB port using the provided cable (or upgrade to a longer cable) and charge the remote while playing.  A minor inconvenience but when using a longer cable this problem does not matter at all.  Both my PS3 and my Xbox 360 get an equal amount of time, and I love both of them.  Both consoles have so many exclusives that it's worth checking out both consoles and see which one sparks your interest more.  If someone has ever been interested in owning a PlayStation 3, the Slim is the perfect choice.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2009"}

Melvin","summary":"Nintendo took an old system, gave it some new life and reinvented the remote control again","reviewText":"First, allow me to say I've been a long time owner of the Wii (classic white or original if you prefer) and recently upgraded to the Wii U.  Second, I will caveat that I do not consider this to be my primary gaming platform (PC, PS3, then maybe Wii U, then tablet/smartphone).That being said, the Wii U took a fairly old system and gave it a bit of life.  Too many other systems figured out that the &#34;motion&#34; type control was what people wanted to interact with games and so Wii lost its advantage.  When the Wii U was introduced, however, I think Nintendo regained some of its old glory.  No, I do not think this system advanced the company ahead of either PlayStation or Microsoft - but the touch screen, improved video output, upgraded WiFi adapter, and overall faster processing give this little thing a nice boost.First, the touchscreen controller.  While a bit large and certainly not as &#34;user friendly&#34; as the other controllers out there, it has the unique distinction of having a touchscreen in the center that allows you another medium to interact with the game you are playing or the software you are running.  Whether you want to watch your big screen while you hop Mario around the map or look down at your controller for those quick, hair raising moments, you have both options at your disposal.  Additionally, software such as Netflix now give you the option to see what you are playing, advance, pause and even see reviews of the show/movie while it is still playing on the screen (or even transfer to the little screen, so you don't disturb others.  The controller - while big, is a highlight for me.The video output (now up to 1080i - at least on my screen) and the WiFi (802.11b/g/n) improvements over the old Wii are worth it in my book.  While we enjoy a good game of Mario or playing on the balance board, we enjoy watching Netflix and Amazon Prime just as often.  Now you can view those in HD streaming - with the upgraded video and WiFi connection.  Win!Finally, the Wii U, while unable to play the old Nintendo GameCube games, is a heck of a lot faster than the Wii.  You can still play most (haven't found one in my collection yet that doesn't work) games from the old Wii, as the Wii U ships with an emulator for older games - which allow you to use the older controllers.  It may take a little patience, but you can sync all your old controllers, including the balance board, if you follow the onscreen instructions.  Also, if you are the proud owner of a Wii and want to upgrade, there is even a simple way to transfer all your old data from the Wii to the Wii U (SD card required).So, if your Wii is getting a bit long in the tooth or you just want to boost it a little - consider this Wii U.  It is still a work in progress (Nintendo is releasing updates, Netflix is still releasing updates, etc) - but it has worked for me thus far without issue.  There are less interruptions while watching movies and games load faster.  One aside - keep your old controllers or consider purchasing at least two old controllers if you wan to play multiplayer on some games.  The Mario/Luigi games that ship with this can be played alone with the touchscreen or multiplayer with two-four older controllers.  Not all games require only new/only old, but this one does.  Just a heads up if you're looking to buy this for the game and want to play with your family/friends.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2014"}

Halo 4 picks up right after Halo 3's Legendary Ending.To start, the game looks amazing.  It is clearly the best-looking console game to have ever been released.  Cortana has never looked better in a Halo game, and the facial structures and emotions from the humans in the game are simply a work of art.  Sometimes, I couldn't even tell if it's just a game of if they used real actors during the cutscenes.  The story of the campaign is easy (enough) to follow, but I wish they would've gone over what happened between Halo 3 and Halo 4.  More on that later in the spoiler section.The controls take a bit to get used to, since they tried to copy Call of Duty but with a slight Halo twist.  Banshee tricks are no longer mapped to the A button; you use LB to pull them off (WHY?!!!!), but other than that, if you didn't get so used to Halo: Reach's control scheme, you should be fine here.  Personally, I wish they would stop changing the controls so much and stick to what worked in Halo 2.  The gameplay itself, when it comes to the campaign, is your typical Halo experience we have all loved since 2001 when the original Halo launched with the original Xbox 360.  You're running through levels, shooting old and new enemies, uncovering the story, and reaching the end of a short campaign.  It took me five hours to be the campaign on Normal, but double that on Legendary.  I personally think the writing and the voice acting was well-done for everyone except Master Chief.  Some of his lines are unbelievable, and the painfully wrong tone is used sometimes.  However, it's still the campaign we expected from a Halo game.  But is the multiplayer the same we've loved since Halo 2?  No.  Unfortunately, no where near it.To start off, Halo 4's multiplayer has gone through a bit of a change since it first came out.  They greatly reduced the auto-aim that was present when the game first came out (nothing wrong with that), and have added a few new modes.  They also recently added in SWAT and FFA Throwback.  FFA Throwback is basically what the original FFA mode in the game should've been, ripped straight from Halo 2.  FFA KoTH and Oddball are FINALLY available to play.  For some odd reason, though, they removed Team Snipers. But if you bought Halo 4 hoping to have as much fun online as you did in Halo 3 or Halo 2, you will be more disappointed than I am.  I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am with the multiplayer.For one, they introduced a CoD-style loadout menu.  Now you can pick your primary, secondary, grenade, armor ability, and two perks from the Infinity menu.  First of all, when was the last time Halo had perks?  I didn't play Reach so I can't speak for that game, but as far as I'm concerned, NO Halo game has ever used perks, period.  Why are they in Halo 4?  If I wanted to play Call of Duty, I would've waited for Black Ops 2 instead of picking this up a day after release.  I don't mind being able to choose what weapon I want to use, I'm actually glad they FINALLY let me use the DMR over the Assault Rifle instead of having to hunt for it on the map, but perks?  On top of that, gone is the hectic fast-paced action from Halo 2 and 3.  For example, I like to use the armor ability Promethean Vision because it lets me see enemies through walls.  And I have yet to play a game where someone wasn't crouched behind a corner waiting for someone to pass them, or behind a box, or underneath the enemy base waiting for someone to walk down.  Camping has always been in Halo; those that loved the sniper know what I'm talking about.  But to see it in literally EVERY single Halo 4 game I play online is horrific.  Gone are the arena-style FPS days of Halo when you got destroyed because people had a better shot and reaction time than you.  Now, all you need to do is pick Cloak, find a corner, and sit and wait for someone to walk by so you can either shotgun them from behind or assassinate them.  Unfortunately, Team Slayer Pro, a game mode that eliminates the motion sensor, armor abilities, and perks, does nothing to fix this issue.  If anything, it's worse, because people are now more likely to hide in a corner knowing that no one but their teammates will know they're there.  Oh, remember seeing an X where your teammate died in Halo 2?  Those are gone in Halo 4.  So now you have no idea where your teammate died.  His clan tag just disappears and comes back when he respawns.Another thing wrong with the multiplayer is the matchmaking.....I'm sorry, I meant the lack of matchmaking.  There is nothing that determines the players you're matched with.  For example, Halo 3 allowed you to choose between the quickest process or to only search for games with a good connection.  Those are completely gone from Halo 4.  I once played a game with a person from Guam.  Guam, for those that don't know, is a little island controlled by the United States that is located above Indonesia.  Can anyone explain to me how in the world someone that's thousands of miles away from the closest coastline of the United States managed to connect to someone living in the Midwest?  I stopped playing Uncharted online for the very same issue.  Too many times did I get paired with people that weren't even within my borders (Egypt, Portugal, Spain, UK, Brazil, etc).  There's nothing wrong with playing with foreigners themselves, it's just that the server I have to connect to in order to play with a foreigner is so far away, my ping is going to be ridiculously high, which means I'll experience a high amount of lag.  The only game I can think of that gave me little-to-no lag while playing with Europeans is Battlefield 3, which has dedicated servers.  Halo 4 does NOT have dedicated servers.  Another problem that comes with the lack of proper matchmaking is the mismatch of player levels.  It's never a good idea to pit a level 56, 65, 47, and 70 against a group filled with those still in the 10's and 20's, and I shouldn't have to tell you why.  Because of the absence of dedicated servers, there are times where the game will change hosts.  This is nothing new in a Halo game....except for the fact that someone may have killed you by the time your screen turns normal.  I've had that happen to me twice.My biggest complaint with the multiplayer, besides it being too much like Call of Duty and not enough like Halo, is Spartan Ops.  Spartan Ops is the biggest P.O.S. I have ever played since Uncharted 3's multiplayer.  NOTHING is good about Spartan Ops.  The entire thing feels rushed.  The cutscenes are short and make me miss dramatic pauses I originally thought were over-done in a lot of games and movies.  The lack of dramatic pauses makes me feel like \"OK, what's going on h....oh...on to a new scene.  OK what's going o.......onto ANOTHER new scene\".  I don't have time to take in and digest what I just saw/heard two seconds ago.  On top of that, the cutscenes are literally crap.  This person talks, this person responds, this person goes somewhere else, says \"this is wrong\" (Really, Sherlock?!), some random end scene, end cutscene.  I can go to YouTube if I wanted to laugh at short videos all day.  To make matters worse, the actual gameplay is more boring and repetitive than Firefight from the previous Halo.  At least Firefight was challenging and time consuming (even though those types of modes I have never liked).  Spartan Ops is literally, \"kill these enemies, then kill some more, now move here, kill some more, hit some random switch, VEHICLES! :D, kill the last few enemies before the dropship arrives, end of episode\".  An entire episode of Spartan Ops (five per chapter) takes ten minutes at the most, and that's on Heroic while playing with a group of randoms.  You just sit there, kill kill kill, boring dialogue, vehicles, end game, and you're then sitting there wondering \"Why in God's name did I just waste 10 minutes of my life?\"  The fact that these keep coming out every week only hurts Spartan Ops; that only adds to the repetitive feel of the mode.  The part that had me crying from laughing so hard is there are rumors (as of me writing this review and to my knowledge) that 343 Industries plan on charging for the second season of Spartan Ops.  YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME!!!!  That's a bigger rip-off than paying for cheat-codes, like Capcom has tried to do many times before.  Personally, Halo 4 would've been a better game if they stopped wasting resources on the abomination that is Spartan Ops and actually spent them improving the multiplayer.**WARNING!!!  WARNING!!!  SPOILERS BELOW THIS POINT!!**As much as I liked Halo 4's campaign, like I said before, I wished they had explained more in the game.  For one, I had no bleeping clue who the Didact was until halfway through the game when the Librarian (again, don't know who she was, either, or why she was important) explained a bit of the history pre-Halo 1.  It would've been wonderful if the game was more friendly to newcomers/people who haven't been following the story/people who didn't read every book and watched every video made about the story.  I don't like having to search through hundreds of material to find out information on some of the events going on in Halo 4.  Granted the Librarian did do a fairly-good job catching me up, I STILL want to know, what happened to the Brutes?  They're just gone.  What happened to the truce between the Elites and UNSC?  Even Master Chief says this at the beginning of the game, \"I thought we had a truce with the Covenant\".  Now they're back at their old tactics, looking for random artifacts on some random planet for religious reasons, and making sure those filthy humans don't taint holy land.  Another thing I wish was more explained was what happened to the Arbiter after Halo 3.  A side-story on Halo: Waypoint explains he took the remaining Elites from the rebellion back to their home world.  OK, so why are they fighting alongside the rest of the Covenant?  They also barely talk about the Flood in Halo 4, and our favorite parasite is also absent from the game.  You blow up Delta Halo in Halo 3 and all of a sudden, no more Flood?  Maybe an explanation for some of my questions were explained in side-material, but again, I would've appreciated it if Halo 4 explained some loose ends, even briefly.Another problem I had with the campaign, besides it being short and a bit ridiculous on Legendary (headshots should kill shieldless enemies, period), why does Master Chief have such bad voice acting?  When Cortana informs him that she's not going back to Infinity with him, he stumbles with his words, then changes his tone completely when he says \"We go together\".  He went from complete disbelief to sounding like he was barking an order to a Marine.  It's so painfully obvious that it doesn't match, that ONE bit of the campaign is something I'll remember for a while.  I'm actually a bit neutral towards them showing his face for the Legendary ending.  His eyes were blacked out, but you got a pretty good idea of his facial features.  Nothing too major, of course.** END OF SPOILERS!!!**Overall, I miss Bungie.  I do like the campaign 343 created, and the graphics are amazing, but considering the multiplayer is only OK at best, it's a huge disgrace to the Halo franchise.  Halo's multiplayer has never been \"OK\".  Let's not forget it was the console king until Call of Duty 4 was released.  Unfortunately, 343's methods of handling the issues is quite poor, and makes me miss the way Bungie interacted with its fans.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6E67A","description":"","reviewerName":"The Incarcerator","summary":"Trumps Gears of War 3","reviewText":"I picked up this game having just beaten Gears of War 3 for XBOX 360.  I was expecting it to be pretty good from the reviews I read online.  I must say, the single player campaign thus far does not disappoint.  I am halfway through the game on novice difficulty as the game's only major gripe would be that it's too challenging on any of the other difficulty levels.  The game's action is paired very nicely to the PS3 controller making the experience much more visceral as I shotgun blasted my way through globs of chimera!  I also didn't find the graphics to be as lackluster as other reviewers noted finding them to be of a different artistic style so to speak.  While they aren't as good as Gears of War 3, the graphics are nothing to complain about and add nicely to the game's overall feel.  Weather effects are especially good during one of the earlier levels as you traverse your way through a delapidated town in the rain.The weapons in the game are probably one of the game's best features as they pair very nicely with the in-game weapon wheel.  I found them to be above and beyond those found in Gears of War 3.  Throwing a grenade in Resistance 3 is as simple as positioning your crosshairs where you want to throw it avoiding the trajectory based guide of Gears 3 altogether.  I can't begin to describe the difficulties I had in Gears 3 trying to get a grenade thrown where I wanted it!  Kudos to the game developers for Resistance 3 for making weapon usage so effortless.Resistance 3's sound design is also in a class above that of Gears of War 3.  Listening to a shotgun reload was probably one of the best parts of the game especially after a weapon upgrade.  Listening to the shells click into place after blasting through the chimera was a nice touch overall.  I also should note that while the game is a first-person shooter, it works much better in it's game class than that of Gears 3.  I think the game in scope doesn't take itself as seriously as Gears of War 3 and that is it's strength.  Anytime there is so much hype surrounding a game it is often better to go to the movies because what you are getting as a game is often less than what you are getting in story.

McAdams","summary":"Reporting for duty, SIR!","reviewText":"This game series is simply, hands down, the most entertaining game series I have ever played -- with a caveat -- to get the maximum amount of enjoyment out of these games, you *must* play it in multi-player mode.I have never had more fun playing a video game, than I have when this game (or its predecessor) with a buddy or two in either split-screen or system link mode.  Although I wouldn't recommend playing over X-Box Live, due to all of the racist, sexist, screaming, lamers on that service -- but I guess if you do so without the headset, then you are okay.Improvements over the last game, which I love:- Multiple game modes!  You can now play capture the flag (1 and 2 flag versions), assault, and a new type of mode, called \"hunt.\"  Hunt is basically the local, indigenous species, versus a human team.  So: Ewoks vs. humans, Gungans vs. humans, Hoth Ice Creatures vs. humans, etc.  It is a lot of fun.- More than 2 players in split screen mode!  You can have up to 4 players in split screen mode now.  This was really needed in the last game, and I am glad to see they added it.- Better balance!  They have balanced all of the player classes against each other better.  The basic solider class is now less powerful (their blasters don't shoot as long, or in a straight line as long, when constantly firing) -- Engineers (the old \"pilot class\" in the last game) now have a shotgun, instead of that stupid scatter gun, and they now have explosives they can use -- making them an actual, playable, class on the ground.- More levels!  That is always a bonus, but they have also better balanced the levels, to support the new game play modes -- which is cool.- Player awards!  You can now earn rank in your profile (allowing you to command other troops -- up to 4, once you reach general), and you can earn medals while playing and doing well, that grant you special bonuses (such as increased damage from your attacks, or increased weapon recharge rates, etc.).- An actual single player mode, with an actual story!  Enough said, although ... I would prefer to play the \"good guys\" over the bad guys ... but I digress.- New and improved Conquest mode!  The new layers in strategy and overall game play for the conquest mode, make it much more enjoyable.- Intelligent AI!  The AI of your allies is much less idiotic (although they do still get stuck in corners, etc.), and allows you to control up to 4 other AI soldiers which will follow you around like wingmen -- MUCH better than the \"follow me\" command from the last game, which would grab your AI compatriots attention for about 15 strides, and then they would get distracted again.  In the new mode, they will stay with you and follow your lead, until you die or they die, or you release them.- Space combat!  There are now game modes, and encounters that exist only in space.  You can choose to play as a \"space marine\" and just board an enemy ship, and blow it up from the inside, or you can man a turret on your own ship, and just shoot at enemy ships and their fighters.  But, if you have the knack for flying, the space fighter combat as a pilot, is where it is really at.I highly recommend this game.  It may not be a Halo (but you can play it in first person mode, if you so prefer) -- but then again, even Halo fans, I have spoken to, weren't all that fond of number 2, while every Battlefront fan I have spoken to, has *loved* the sequel to the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-13-2005"}

I'm a buffy fan and this heavily reminded me of that game/show as well so this really appealed to me.I bought the game on tuesday and fired it up and was immediately sucked into it's colorful,vibrant world and rocking tunes.  My first impression was it reminded me alot of a sega dreamcast era arcade beat em up with its graphics and over the top house of the dead like humor.  The game just throws you right into the fire with exploding vehicles, tons of zombies and fellow students needing your help.The combat was easy to grasp and very stylish with Juliet flipping, kicking, chainsawing, and knocking the undead silly with her pom pom's. You start with a few basic attacks and dodges, but as you collect money you can upgrade your stats and purchase new moves, it's very addicting to watch Juliet improve and her fighting arsenal grow. I found the controls during these fights just a tad bit clunky though sadly, as sometimes J seems kinda slow and once you commit to some attacks you have to wait for her to go through her animations before attacking again, i wish it was just a little more fluid then that but it's not a gamebreaker or anything.  Sometimes the camera likes to get in the was as well and get close up on the action to the point you can't see whats going on but this happened few and far between.The game is alot of fun and some parts will have you laughing out loud at the screen.  The game is very arcadey and not very long, it's the replaying of the levels to get higher scores and unlockables is where the game really shows it's stuff.

Rhodes","summary":"Could be better than what we got.","reviewText":"Medal of Honor Rising Sun is not exactly what you'd expect from the MOH franchise. In fact, compared to previous installments this one is dangerously weak in a few departments.  The game has it's highs and lows and while the PS2 has online play, that doesn't make it much better than the other platforms.To begin, the graphics aren't up to date with today's current standards.  Just as simple as maybe two years ago these graphics would be a little better but the fact that the layout of levels is dismal and not much color and texture went into the landscapes is a little disappointing.  If you ignore the environments and such, the graphics of say...the characters or the weapons don't look that bad, in fact they're decent but looking at some of the landscapes made me feel like I was playing my outdated PSX again.The music in this game, however, is top-notch and doesn't sound that different from other Medal of Honor games. So the soundtrack is outstanding!  Sound effects are great too.  Gunshots sound good and the voice acting isn't bad. So sound is certainly a nice edition to the game.The gameplay is a MAJOR department where this game could've used some improvement.  Things that worked well in the past MOH games don't stand out in this one.  Such as enemy AI.  As I said, they needed to keep up with the times.  MOH has usually presented a bit of realism and in this one it is completely lost!  For example, enemy AI is decreased. I stood in front of two enemies and shot one of them until he was dead while his partner just stood there and watched.  Then I had to reload, and while I was doing so the enemy still stood there. When I was finally done reloading he finally attacked.  The next result was that I shot him 15 times: IN THE HEAD!  This is NOT realism at all.What's also strange about the realism is that shooting an enemy in the leg with a shotgun actually causes them only to jump around on one foot for a while and then they recover and act as if nothing happened, almost as if the shot never took place.But the gameplay does have it's high points.  It's still a little fun to play.  You start off at the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Medal of Honor is always good at giving us this intense war feeling and Rising Sun does this to perfection. So the levels are complex, each taking about 30-60 minutes each to complete and this was actually pretty nice so the game does have longevity.Plus, the game features a few historical videos with a great narrator to present them. So the game has several extras to behold and completeing missions only unlocks more.The multiplayer, I can't help but admit, was a bit of a letdown.  It's nice to play the multiplayer with a friend but it becomes boring after a while. You select the weapons that you want to battle with, which are no different than what the MOH verteran is used to.  What makes the multiplayer a drag for the PS2 is it's online capability.  Yes, I like to play games online as well, but with this, it's no different than if you played it with just yourself and a friend.  No new, or extended, maps or new weapons and all the character animations look very identical to one another.The co-op on the game was nice to behold. There is actually a differene in the gameplay this way, such as player one will have to do things for player two to advance forward.  Makes the game a little more involving for both players.So while Medal of Honor Rising Sun isn't a terrible game, it isn't really good either.  It's worth maybe a rent or two and if you can get past the very unrealistic gameplay it may even be worth the buy.  But I can't help but think what a few more months in developement would've done to it.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-29-2003"}

Until now. It's sad to say, after all the good times I did have, but Cataclysm does not do enough to keep me wanting to play. I don't trust the developers anymore, either, so it's going to be a hard sell to get me to play again.At first, the expansion seems worthy. The questing content from 80-85 is, despite the issues of linear questing, more fun than past content. However, past questing content was not particularly fun to begin with. It's never been challenging or dynamic enough to compete with any number of quality console games. What brought me to WoW was always the total package and promise of an MMO: that you will find redemption in working with others to tackle huge challenges.Once you get to 85, though, and all the questing is over, you find that the endgame has only gotten worse from the past expansion. Wrath of the Lich King did so much wrong from the easy heroics to quickly-trivialized raids to horrible balancing issues in Wintergrasp PVP, so everyone was hopeful for Cataclysm to fix many of the known problems. In the end I feel most veterans will come to agree that it did not get better, though. Let's take a closer look:PVP in Cataclysm is so underwhelming it's almost astounding; Blizzard just will not fix their model of giving PVP players a fraction of the content. It's nothing new that Blizzard put less time into content for their PVP, but it doesn't make it any less astonishing that the most profitable MMO in history continues to keep the bar so low in this department. What's new in PVP? Two battleground maps and one outdoor zone that replaces Wintergrasp. That's it! Tweaks to classes and how you acquire items be damned: those are not real changes that genuinely affect gameplay. The fact is you'll still find yourself sitting in Warsong Gulch the same as you did in 2005. Why do we have to play the same exact battlegrounds as we did when battlegrounds were first released? Can you imagine the poor guy who subscribed to WoW since day 1 and considers himself a PVP player? This guy got an average of less than 2 new battleground maps per year for all his hundreds of dollars. It's amazing that Blizzard has not put more work into PVP when they have an industry-leading game. I want to see a whole new set of maps every year, and phase out the old maps like what's done for PVE dungeons. I understand \"the battle for Warsong Gulch rages on\", so make a NEW map for it. Make 5 new maps. Make 10 new maps. Is it that hard to throw together some more maps for one battleground type? The PVP player does not have enough to keep his subscription, and that's truly sad. I don't care if Blizzard listens to my idea or implements another, just give the PVP players more in some way!I'm more of a PVE guy myself, so let's take a look at that. Blizzard did something ostensibly good, which was make dungeons harder. I was a huge fan of this. I did kill raid bosses and finish every heroic 5-man in short order, but it was tougher than in the past. Here's one problem: the things which kill you are generally just instant-death type of mechanics. There are exceptions to this, and some of the content is still VERY EASY, but if you do die, chances are it was some kind of instant-death thing that one guy forgot about. I know what you're thinking: you shouldn't succeed when people don't perform. That's true! That's why I'm seriously glad they tried to make it harder. It's just that I want a better way to increase challenge than what was presented. A larger problem with the 5-mans is more that you're supposed to run them every day. For the amount they have, that gets old within a couple months at best. I don't expect unlimited content, but we got fewer 5-mans than we got in the past two expansions. The last time we had this small amount of content was back in Vanilla, but back then people didn't even finish the dungeons most of the time, so they didn't get stale quite as quickly. I should also mention the time investment required. Yes, if you have a good group the time spent in a 5-man is not horrible, but if you get a new guy in your party, you're probably looking at a 2 hour time-investment. I don't find this to be game-breaking, but it's something to mention.Raiding is also largely no fun. Clearing trash still feels like a chore; WHY? It doesn't have to feel like work, but it absolutely does. Some aspects of the boss design are alright, but many of the wipes are the same type of thing as in 5-mans where one person doesn't perform one stupid mechanic one time, and the entire raid ends up dead. Missing your assignment and causing a wipe is generally nothing more than accidentally not pushing one skill at some exact time. This sort of design is artificially extending the life of what little raid content there is. One guy forgot to interrupt? Wipe. That's it. I had no issue clearing content. I had issue with the way we died when we died. It was petty and annoying. Again, I understand that failure should not meet with success, but the game focuses too much on micromanaging instant-death abilities in mundane ways. I want my wipes to be based on dynamic decisions made by players, not failure to push this exact skill at this exact time.Something else that bugs me is the homogenization of the classes. Warcraft designers are so obsessed with balance that they are giving every talent spec similar abilities. The balance is still not perfect, but the design philosophy seems to be moving towards making everyone more or less the same. Blizzard says, \"Bring the player, not the class\". No, Blizzard, bring the class. Bring the class! It's what makes us unique! People liked when classes were vastly different, despite some more serious balance issues at times.For that matter, why should they make some classes able to tank, heal and DPS well, while others can still only DPS? What is that about? There are two ways we should do this in MMOs: make everyone able to fill any role, or make each class highly specialized for one role. The random mixing and matching of potential roles does not make sense. A class should be unique, but the number of roles that class can fill should be equal. Realize that originally, a druid was a jack of all trades, master of none. It wasn't intended as competition for any one class. Why can't a druid do half and half healing and DPS? Why is it a full-on healer, full-on DPS or full-on tank? It would be so much more unique if druids healed and attacked at the same time, but weaker in both. I believe that this was the original intent of the class. A hybrid class is supposed to work like that, not be good at everything. As far as I know, Warcraft was the original MMO to botch the idea of a hybrid class in this way. The designers claim that it was bad to have people using a class who was not good at any one thing. Yeah, but, with their combat resurrection, druids would still have been a desired class. Speaking of combat resurrection, it's almost been eliminated from the game. Only one person may be revived per battle now. If you have a warlock with a soulstone, forget about a druid's combat resurrection. The thing that made that class unique is often now useless. That's the way the design is going, and I don't like it at all!Blizzard still never brought their user interface up to par; already other MMOs are surpassing it in this area. I have never played it, but I hear Rift launched with a superior interface; surely they had a lower budget than WoW has. In Cataclysm we admittedly do get a better interface again, which is great, but it's still not up to par with third-party add-ons. If you want to be the best, you still have to use add-ons and then argue elitism with people who think it's better to play without them. If Blizzard just put these totally legal add-ons into the game themselves, it would be so much better. I don't know if there is some reason why six years later we now have a default raid interface which almost matches what an unpaid gaming enthusiast put into the game himself years ago.The final point is that the everyday tasks you do in WoW are so boring it's hard to find enough negative adjectives to do them justice. Daily quests are required for reputations to get items and gold, but they amount to killing X and collecting Y every day. Gone are the bombing quests introduced two expansions ago. The daily quests feel slapped-together. Want to make money collecting herbs and ore? Great, except you don't play a fun mini-game to get it. You click nodes on the ground. Fly around and click nodes. That's it. Fishing? Equip a pole, push the fishing button, and click the bobber when it splashes. Given how important the economy is in the game, it's pathetic that the way you get materials is so mind-numbingly boring. Why not a mine instance with a mini-game to collect ore? Why not a farm mini-game for herbs? Why not a mini-game for fishing? No, we click nodes on the ground. For the billions of dollars changing hands here, the innovation and fun-factor of everyday play in WoW is extremely pathetic. They added archaeology to Cataclysm. Guess how it works? Yep, you fly around, use an item, then click stuff. No challenge or fun involved. After countless hours of this, you may get a flavor item or an item to give to your alts. Wow.Overall, WoW has turned into a sloppy mess lacking in content. On the surface it's still got what it had that makes it popular, but I can only mildly recommend this game to new players who haven't been there and done that. Even then, I think you should try a different MMO at this point. The only way this genre will grow is with competition. Blizzard isn't going to fix this monster on its own. They don't realize how bad it's gotten.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2011"}

Roman","summary":"Woah, the Wii version isn't a lesser-version of the ps3/360 game.","reviewText":"[This is one of those rare times where the Wii version of a game that's available on all consoles isn't a stripped down port. Honestly, if you only have a Wii, or tend to buy as many Wii games as you do your other console(s), the only thing that might keep you from buying Skylanders for the 360 or ps3 is if you care much for trophies or achievements. But for some reason, a few of the Skylanders characters are slightly different in the Wii version, being a little better than they are on the other systems. It's not a big deal though. Since the game's essentially the same, my review for the ps3 version will just be carried over here.]Skylanders...good god, where do I start with this thing? My initial reaction to seeing the game in stores, with the dozens of figures on the shelf, was that it was just a fad and the kind of game that had little content, and was more of a way for the developers to make money rather than have a good game that we'd all be talking about. Well, after Christmas came and went 3 months ago, what is it that's STILL sold out everywhere? That's right. Skylanders figures. Even right now, you're lucky to find even the most unpopular ones anywhere more than a day after a shipment arrives. My daughter wanted this game not really based on how it looked in the commercial, but just by the characters she saw on the figure chart that was given out as a promo item. When the game went down in price a bit, I decided to get it for her birthday, figuring that if she didn't like the game, it wouldn't be a big deal, and that we'd be better off not shelling out the money for figure after figure.Hoo boy, that was not the case.Not only is Skylanders a fun game that doesn't treat kids like idiots and hold their hand through every part of the level, but it's one that you can enjoy with your children if you have two controllers. How many games these days have good co-op features that don't involve the same tired war gameplay? Yes, the whole buying individual figures for characters is a little lame, but look at it this way- where you're spending a few dollars just for a character or level for any other game, here you're at least getting a cool little toy that your kids can play with too. Do you have any idea how much I would've loved to have had a figure of Liberty Prime when I bought the Broken Steel DLC for Fallout 3 a while ago? Anyway, the game doesn't force you to have any more characters than the 3 you start out with. But you will be needing one of each type in order to access everything in the game. Each level has an area that can only be opened with a certain type, but let me stress again that you do NOT need to do these areas. What's cool is that each elemental type has 4 characters, all ranging in designs from robots to dragons to human-like creatures. You're bound to find at least one for each type that you'll like, and the best part is that while there -is- a kind of tier list for the game, there's really no such thing as a bad Skylander. All of them are fun to play as in their own way!The game is easy to play, since it's a standard action dungeon crawler. You run around smashing open treasure chests and barrels to get money (used to upgrade your character's attacks), defeating enemies to gain experience, and can find various hats in the levels to boost a stat or two. The main plot involves a short, evil dude named Kaos who wants to control everything, just as most villains do. You, the person holding the controller, are a Portal Master, and it's your job to send a Skylander into the world and make everything right, defeating Kaos and his minions, and finding special items needed to restore the world.The Portal that comes with the game works great and is way faster than I expected. As soon as you take a figure off of it, the game goes to the screen telling you to place a Skylander on the Portal, and once you do, it shows the character you selected, and they're zapped right into the game where you left off. It never feels like a chore to change characters, and I'm glad that they got things down with this whole Portal thing. I've yet to have any problems with mine not recognizing a figure or having any other problems. Both my daughter and I love playing the game together, or as a single player game, and collecting money to upgrade attacks. Each Skylander has two paths they can take for improving their attacks. Spyro for example, can continue to upgrade his fire breath, or upgrade his fire charge attack. Which is better? Well, both are good, but it's up to you to pick one. And if you don't like what you picked, you can always reset your Skylander and start from scratch.I'd say that kids from the ages of 4-10 will probably get the most out of it. The only 'hard' parts in the game involve puzzles, but they're fairly simple. And if they get tired of the main game, there's a Versus battle mode they can play as well, with different modes. There's even a Challenge mode in the main game where you have to complete a certain task, using whatever character you want, and once you beat it, a certain stat will get boosted. If you want to have a really strong Skylander, taking care of these Challenges is a must.Really, the only complaints I have are that the Portal tends to go through batteries like they're going out of style, and that it's annoying having to sit through Kaos' stupid ramblings of 'Doooooooom' over and over when going back through levels to get 3 stars on each one. I had enough of hearing jokes like that in high school when Invader Zim was popular with the Hot T...I mean, goth kids, and they'd constantly quote it, and not being able to skip over these scenes was irritating. But at least with the battery problem, you can take care of it by getting some good rechargeables. Also, for some reason a lot of the character's voices don't match up with their speech, especially Kaos'. Heck, some characters speak without even moving their mouths. That's just plain weird. Aside from these problems, the game's a blast. The graphics are good, the soundtrack has some memorable pieces, the voice acting is above average, and it's fun going through the levels with all the different Skylanders and seeing what each character has to offer. One quick thing though- it's odd that the game has Spyro's name in the title, and yet they never say his name once in the game, since you can play using whoever you want. You're always referred to as 'Skylander', and there's no talk about Spyro's previous adventures. Look at the game's box- he's not even front and center! He got bumped aside by the Skylander many consider to be the best in the game. Ouch.We've had the game for less than a month now, and we're up to 11 Skylanders, all of which are getting about equal playtime, and I have to admit that even I get excited when I see a new one on the shelf at the store. Buy this game now! And get ready for the sequel coming out later this year. Hopefully they raise the level cap and add online play...","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2012"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXX88","description":"","reviewerName":"Peter Faden \"robilar5500\"","summary":"Pretty amazing game!","reviewText":"The description of the game as an open world first person shooter is quite apt. That's exactly what it is...a great first person shooter open world RPG style gaming experience. Instead of leveling up, you gain perks, which can be anything from swimming faster to assassinating an enemy on a ledge above you, and many more options as well.The shooting mechanic in this game is pretty much on point. The guns feel real, and each selection comes with pro's and cons, forcing you to choose carefully. You start being able to carry limited amounts of everything, including cash, but as you play, you can hunt various animals and use their body parts to craft upgrades to all your various storage devices. You can also craft special weapons and potions (in the form of syringes) by doing the same (well, plants are used for the syringes). You can craft at any moment, anywhere, as long as you have the proper ingredients.The story itself is pretty dark, and is definitely more a mature audience type game from that standpoint. If this was a movie, it would be rated R. There is no shortage of horrible violence, drug use, etc....The main character, Jason Broadie (spelling?) goes from being a totally naive, whiny college kid to a hardened killer. There are a few points in the game where you must make decisions that would be considered evil, for the greater good. In fact, I would say the overall morality of the game is ambiguous at best. I think it does a great job of bringing the true nature of morality in this world to the forefront. There are no easy decisions. Sometimes, you just have to do what you have to do.The various personalities in the game are all pretty awesome in this game. I think most people will like Vaas and Citra the best. I know I did, although Sam is pretty awesome as well. However, there really arent any slouches in this regard. All the characters are well thought out and developed.Although the overarching theme in this game is saving your friends and brother who have been captured by slavers, there is also the element of saving the locals from ruthless slavers and pirates as well, by helping the &#34;rebels&#34; (i.e. natives/locals) fight to take back their islands.As far as graphics go, again, I would say they are top notch. Everything looks pretty amazing in my opinion. I noticed a couple glitches later in the game where I parachuted inside of a bridge and had to restart from the last checkpoint or where when swimming, the graphics would get a little wonky, but those moments were few and far between.Speaking of checkpoints, every major event is preceeded by an auto save, and you can manually save as long as you arent in the middle of a mission. Sometimes, when dying mid-mission, the auto save brings you back to a more advantageous position then  where the auto save actually occurred. I'm not sure if this was intentional in the game development or not, but I actually found this to be a good thing in a couple instances.Overall, I cant say I played a better game in quite some time, and given the fact that there have been some great games released over the last two years, I think that's saying a lot about the quality and fun of this game. This is a definite must own for any system.Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000OLXX86","description":"Microsoft Mass Effect M59-00073 Games & Entertainment","reviewerName":"Omnes","summary":"I'm Commander \"Bess\" Shepard and this is the first part of my War with the Reapers!","reviewText":"Three years after playing Bioware's excellent \"Jade Empire\", I was happy to learn that they did another RPG-adventure game, which would happen not in an ancient past but in the future, down in space. Following the same concept of creating a customized character commanding a team of adventurers/soldiers, this game differed from Jade Empire by giving to our hero, Commander Shepard, either a female or a male voice/body. Although I think both do an excellent job, I have to say that I preferred the female voice of Commander Shepard, done by the excellent Jennifer Hale who does in this trilogy her most popular role so far. Indeed, her voice carries emotions and is versatile according to the players Paragon (good) or Renegade (evil) actions, up to a point that many have wished that Bioware offered a game cover with the female Shepard and Youtube users praise her work.But what really stands out in this game is how the story has been developed as trilogy dedicated to Shepard's war with the Reapers, as she discovers and tries to warn a Galaxy Council that an invasion will happen and that everyone will die if nothing is done. Over three games, she will associate herself with characters having ambiguous intentions, even experiencing with some of them romantic relationships, and accomplish Primary, Secondary quests all over the galaxy. As such, their resolutions  will either have a direct or indirect influence with the last two games, since your saved games can be transferred on the second and third Mass Effect games.Taking my game experience as an example, I called my Commander \"Bess\" Shepard, in honor of Lars von Trier's character \"Bess McNeil\" from Breaking the Waves. Then I customized her face by giving her Black lipstick and dark red-purple hair, which gave her a cyberpunk look much more interesting than the plain face offered on the female Shepard at the start of the game. For those who are hesitant in giving your hero a customized look for fear of giving something awkward, the game offers a random selection of looks that you can either modify or keep if you find the choices acceptable. Along with other origin choices to give plot depth to your Shepard, I felt Bioware gave excellent character customization.Of the story, I'd say, without giving out any spoilers, that this game is the start of Shepard's career as a Spectre, a professional agent employed by the Galaxy High Council, who finds out that Saren, another Spectre, has become traitor and is involved a conflict involving the Reapers, dangerous creatures whose legend speak of an apocalyptic ending when they'll reappear in the galaxy.In the gameplay, you not only get to command a whole team of characters and a ship called the Normandy, but you also get to explore planets with a tank called the Mako. Of the things that I least liked, I'd say that the Mako displeased me since exploring several planets slowed down the rhythm of the story as you had to find on each planet your quests and resources locations. As such, the story's much better when you dive right into the action and do the quest, which they did starting from the second game. For the side quests, I liked doing them although I'd say that I wished that the majority of them would not be given on the Citadel. I would have preferred instead if the game had given some of them on other explorable cities on different planets, like in the last two games. Speaking of them, I just think it's a good thing that in the last two games the characters moved around when they talk in the second game and don't stand still like in the first game. Indeed, by making them move around, the characters felt more like real people than 3D game models.Of the soundtrack and visuals, I'd say the quality is awesome on an HD television screen with Surround Speakers. It makes the game a better experience than on a standard television set and I was astonished to see how they became richer over the next games. Especially for the character designs on Garrus, Wrex, Liara, Tali, and Joker, who became more present in the next game and had funny interactions with EDI, another favorite of mine in the second and third parts. Of my romance, I did it with Kaidan, but I really wished I could have done it with Garrus instead since he was funnier and more conflicted  with himself than Kaidan, whose personal story only gets interesting in this first part. I heard that this first game originally offered, for Male Shepards, a homosexual relationship with Kaidan as I've heard players apparently found audio clips presenting this relationship in the PC version. But for unknown reasons, the makers never put it in the final product, instead introducing it in the third part of the game.In the end, I'd say Mass Effect introduces the main characters and sets forth the path points certain groups will take in the eventual games. Whose story gets more mature and better. Maybe not to everyone's personal satisfaction, but to a great storytelling level.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-14-2012"}

Blur is just a carbon copy Mario Kart game with better graphics, just as the commercial admits to and I must say I personally love the commercial for it's humor and honesty. Now, I'm not saying it's necessarily a bad thing to borrow elements from successful games and make them your own, just like the saying goes imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. However Blur doesn't do anything new with what it borrowed. For example, Darksiders which I personally loved borrowed many elements from various games but Darksiders made it their own and it worked very well with the over all game play. Blur on the other hand does nothing new, it's only graphically superior to Mario Kart. I must say the premise works better with Mario Kart's cartoony charachters and banana peels than Blur's licensed vehicles in my opinion. If you're looking for a good enjoyable arcade racer with a twist pick up Split/Second, if you've never played a Mario Kart game then you might enjoy Blur. So, overall not a horrible game but nothing new and in my opinion not really anything special. If you're into arcade racers and have never played (or can't play) a Mario Kart game then try it, you might like it.

I remember playing both 1 and 2 in the arcade and 3 on the Xbox. I have to say this is the best game in the series. It abandons the serious storyline of the previous game in favor of a stupid, juvenile, but fun and hillarious setting. Even though this is on the Wii, this is not in anyway a game for kids. In fact it's gone into several areas that not even Grand Theft Auto has yet. There's more foul langauge then a public school playground, one of the themes is incest, there's a song about necrophilia, there's massive quanities of toilet humor(including a scene where we see a guy taking a wizz, u don't see his privates but it was still pretty gross) and oh did I mention how violent it is too? Heads and limbs are blown off, bodies explode into bloody chunks, and players are rewarded for how fast they can kill thier enemies. Needless to say it truely pushes the limits of it's M-rating. Parents if your uncomfortable with your kid watching shows like South Park or Drawn Together then keep them FAR away from this because this game revels in it's explicit content. Despite it pushing the limits of good taste at times, it's still pretty fun to play. The game is a little easy at first since you can merely restart by paying a certain number of points but after you beat the main story you can do the \"Director's Cut\" mode which has more enemies and limited continues. All in all this is probably one of the funnest games on the Wii if your an adult or a mature teen.

Think Skyrim, Fallout, MMORPG or a JRPG (pretty much any of them) I could spend 60 dollars on a sub-par, WAY over-hyped action adventure game *cough* *the last of us* *COUGH* (had to take a jab, I played it, it's so mediocre it makes me question if any of you have ever read a book or watched a movie before the year 1999.) But I digress, Dark Arisen is BANG FOR YOUR BUCK. For 30$ you're getting a solid 200+hours of adventure, exploration, leveling, gearing up and what have you. The story...well it's Japanese, that's as far as I'm gonna go on that subject. What you come to this for is game play and tried and true mechanics. From this point forward I'm just going to review the new content. The new content is a decent addition and warrants another 25-40 hours of game play, easily. Essentially it's a endless dungeon crawler with constant gear upgrades as your fuel to keep plowing through. My favorite part however is the fact that it's difficult. New bosses and enemies are quite effective at killing you, should you be under-geared or inattentive. The new music is nice , on Bitterback Isle anyway. I will note they replaced the original opening theme to something that doesn't force you to spam start and A (or X) as fast as you can to avoid someone else (or you) hearing it. I will admit that cheesy opening theme grew on me and on several occasions I caught myself singing along. I actually miss it. They made fast travel easier for all of you who whined. Also, wow almost forgot JAPANESE VOICE OPTION!!!!!!! It's a big deal. While I actually didn't mind the English voice-work over-all it had some short comings for side characters and other random events that totally shattered the consistency. The Japanese voice option is a refreshing addition and breathes some genuine emotion into the events, whether or not you understand it (there are sub-titles) *To all American voice actors involved with video games* Please try harder to not sound like monotone, chronically depressed robots. Buy it, it's great and underrated. For those who played the original, if you liked it I would suggest a purchase of this. If you have no inclination to return to Gransys...Gransis?, (w/e) I would recommend you look else where because essentially it's more of the same but supremely refined.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2013"}
{"product_name":"B0088MVOES","description":"","reviewerName":"Shannon B Davis \"Nepenthe\"","summary":"vast game, complex puzzles, very different from Lego Batman.","reviewText":"I am a huge fan of LOTR so I was over the moon when this product was announced. However, I have to say that it lacks the simplicity of previous games such as Lego Batman.  The open world concept is a bit challenging when you take in the epic story and characters.  Essentially you play through the entire story in story mode, and then you may replay parts of the story in Free Play mode.  That does feel odd since you are essentially taking other characters where they wouldn't have been in the books. But if you are enormously attached to the books, this game may bother you as it had to make changes in order to accommodate two players at all times. In order to have two players, new characters are introduced or characters may appear earlier than they would have otherwise.  The story follows the movie closely, with identical voice acting.Two of the standout parts of the game are the Ent battle, and when Sam saves Frodo in the orc castle.  I enjoyed the novelty of the first, and the puzzles and humor of the latter. The game is rife with humor, a lego trademark.  The earlier parts of the game are more of a visual delight, with the elf settlements and Hobbiton.  I enjoyed the game much more in this earlier part, then when the landscape became pretty much the same later on.  But then, Fellowship of the Ring is my favorite book of the three.Following Golem through the swamps is one of the most annoying sections of the game, along with some of the battles (the oliphants!).  Sometimes it felt like every battle was also a puzzle.  Some of these are easier if you have two players, as when you play single-player, the second \"player\" doesn't play very effectively.The interface is more challenging than previous games, since now you have inventory. It isn't always obvious how to access your inventory.  There are many characters to choose from, and buy, but it's not always easy to figure out how to swap characters. Sometimes the character you swap goes into the player 2 spot.  Some puzzles are extraordinarily annoying (certain jumping sequences especially) in a way that I don't recall from previous Lego games.  And every major story scene had some annoying battle where you had to do a certain sequence of movements. After the first runthrough, one has no desire to repeat these experiences, especially if many minutes were spent trying to figure out what  to do while being killed by a troll repeatedly.  Once you know how to do it, there's no challenge - it's just rote repetition.  Ironically, it's more of a challenge than some previous lego games where battle is just button-mashing, but sometimes when a girl comes home from work, she just wants to button-mash and beat up bad guys.The game does have lots of tips to help you on your way.  There are infinite ways to achieve things.  Again, this goes to the lack of simplicity that made previous Lego titles so great.  The concept is that - in addition to each of the characters having special powers - you can also craft and acquire items that give you the ability to do things.Definitely this game will reach a more adult audience than lego Batman, with the scope of the story and the depth of the horror.  Lego of course makes it lighter and less violent than the original.  I think that's why Lego chose to make the game more complex, complicated, and wide-ranging.Overall, I will give the game three stars because unlike Lego Batman, I do not wish to replay every scene to get the maximum score and items. The massive scale and number of things to do overwhelms me, and I actually dread my son asking us to play it again.  It just doesn't have the fun factor.  We played Lego Batman for months.  I don't see the point of playing this game for months. It's too big to appreciate the small victories along the way. it's too difficult to figure out how to replay previous levels.  Overall, I just had trouble making the adjustment.  Although I do play complex games on my own (like Assassin's Creed, Dragon Age, etc), when I want to play a game with my child, I don't want it to be hard for ME to figure out, because that makes it less fun for both of us.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-03-2012"}
{"product_name":"B002I0K3CK","description":"","reviewerName":"MisterMusicFan","summary":"The best New Super Mario Bros. is on Wii U","reviewText":"The fourth overall release of a series doggedly plagued by monotony, New Super Mario Bros. U is likely to be met with a muddled mix of expectations, particularly given that its predecessor, New Super Mario Bros. 2 on the 3DS, was easily the schlockiest installment yet. The good news is that although NSMBU retains some of the series' trademark setbacks, it is hands down the best New Super Mario Bros. title to date, and in fact presents a blueprint of what the series should have offered from the very beginning.We all know it by now, the tried and true \"storyline\" that just won't die: given that Peach is beginning to spend far more of her days in Bowser's Castle than the Mushroom Kingdom, Mario and his pals have got to retrieve her from King Koopa just in time to be kidnapped again for New Super Mario Bros. U2. Like its predecessors, NSMBU is a multiplayer platforming adventure in which players 2 through 4 have the option of playing as Luigi or one of two differently colored Toads, while player 1 must play as Mario. You'll run, jump, stomp and swim through a variety of different worlds while making use of various power-ups and crushing (mostly) familiar baddies.Although this sounds wholeheartedly identical to NSMB 1 through 3 (and granted, it sometimes is), there are several key factors that amp up the originality and the fun: for one, NSMBU is the first New Super Mario Bros. title to revamp the overworld map, and the results are glorious. Rather than a bland series of numbered, separated worlds and levels with familiar designs, NSMBU presents a beautifully designed and detailed single world map that interconnects on multiple levels via secret exits and other features, very similar to that of the SNES's Super Mario World (each and every stage is even lovingly given its own name). The variety of stage scenery has also been appreciatively expanded-long gone are the days of \"forest-desert-lava-repeat\" stage sequences. There is now an innovative slew of new environments to explore, including a surreal, watercolor-soaked swamp (inspired by Van Gogh), musty coal mines, seasonal-minded glaciers dotted with enormous Christmas trees and glittering stars, and blissful romps through pink, puffy clouds. NSMBU also borrows Super Mario World's recurring theme of naming worlds after candies and sweets, but pushes it to a delectable new level by incorporating it into stage design (you'll see towering sand dunes that seem slathered in frosting and strawberries in Layer-Cake Desert, as well as acidic liquid that bubbles and fizzes like root beer in Soda Jungle). The overworld map has also become interactive, among the most delightful new features: you'll now occasionally come across Toads and other characters on your way to certain stages who may request something in exchange for a rare item or power-up, while you may have to sneak past an enemy while proceeding or risk challenging them in a bonus stage. You'll encounter baby Yoshis who can join you, and occasionally face a mischievous bunny named Nabbit who will repeatedly steal rare power-ups from Toads (you'll have to chase him through the level he jumps into to retrieve it). Via the Miiverse compatibility, other real-life players from all over the world will appear throughout your map, making exclamations, giving tips and other commentaries about the game. Great touches like these make traversing ordinarily boring world maps much more exciting.Along the lines of visuals, it is sheer bliss to finally witness a Mario game in glorious HD, and although it clearly doesn't push the Wii U to its limits, this is without question the most beautifully designed 2D Mario game ever. Nuanced details like rainbows, waterfalls and tumbling leaves in the background make most stage scenery a joy to behold. The enemies you'll encounter also come to vivid new life, and there are surprisingly a great variety of entirely new ones, including adorable flying squirrels, snowball-hurling walruses and crafty hermit crabs that could have crawled straight out of Kirby's Dream Land. Along with the aforementioned Nabbit, some of these cutesy and creative new characters I could imagine joining the iconic cast for years to come.The game also makes fairly inventive use of the Wii U's GamePad by incorporating \"Boost Mode,\" which allows a fifth player (assuming there are already four others using Wii Remotes) to help players out by creating platforms on the touchscreen, stunning enemies and activating other special features. Boost Mode can be activated at any time, which means you can also simply whip the GamePad out during 1-player mode and tap yourself out some platforms if you're having a particularly hard time reaching a certain spot or Star Coin. You can also, should you so desire, play the entire game on the GamePad itself (with normal controls, as Mario), as NSMBU is compatible with remote play. Although this is a great option to have if you share a TV with others or love the thought of playing in bed, keep in mind you'd be missing out on some vibrant HD visuals.NSMBU also marks the return of the Yoshis, and notably their long-missing baby counterparts (well played, Nintendo). The classic green Yoshis can still flutter jump and gobble up enemies in their way, but the baby Yoshis play a different role than they ever have before. As where full-grown Yoshis are mounted and can be ridden through a stage, baby Yoshis must be manually carried like an item, meaning if you let go of the 1 button you let go of the baby Yoshi and can't use it (this can in all honesty get a bit obnoxious). Unlike the ones found in Super Mario World, the baby Yoshis here don't grow (although you can still feed them enemies); instead, they sport different special abilities depending on their color. Pink Yoshis can inflate to an enormous size and allow you to float, as where yellow Yoshis create bursts of light that illuminate dark rooms and stun enemies, and blue Yoshis blow bubbles that can be used to trap enemies or hopped on as fragile platforms. Each of these abilities are activated by shaking the Wii Remote while holding the baby Yoshi. Curiously, baby Yoshis can travel with you continuously until you lose them in a stage, as where you'll be automatically separated from a full-grown Yoshi once you reach the end of a stage.The Power-Ups this time around are decent but as with most games in this series, don't present quite enough variety. The Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, Ice Flower and Mini Mushroom all return; the only notable new addition is the Super Acorn, a power-up that essentially transforms Mario and pals into big flying squirrels. At its worst the power-up feels like a wonkier Tanooki Leaf; you unfortunately can't attack with it, but will instead be able to slow your falls by gliding. You'll also gain the ability to air jump and cling to walls. Although there's not exactly a plethora of new choices at first, however, without spoiling anything, I'll just say your arsenal expands as the game goes on. NSMBU also marks the return of stock items (similar to Super Mario Bros. 3), which you'll be able to access from the world map to power yourself up before ever entering a stage.The game has a rather impressive amount of content, too, and should in fact keep players occupied for much longer than a typical New Super Mario Bros. title. Along with a rather expansive world map with several hidden stages and worlds, the variety of modes is a key contributor to this-in addition to the classic story mode, there are a variety of other modes that successfully switch up the gameplay mechanics and core goals. Challenge Mode lives up to its name, in which you'll traverse through different levels while trying to attain specific goals. These goals cruise through a nice variety of side quests and recurring goodies in the Mario franchise, pushing them to the forefront and making them the focus. There are different goals of reaching a stage's goal within a strict time limit, collecting a specific number of coins or power-ups, making your way to a flagpole without killing an enemy or touching the ground, and even a survival mode in which you have to traverse narrow platforms while having projectiles hurled at you just to see how long you can last. These are unique, innovative divergences from the series' standard gameplay and in fact make for some rather addictive fun. Some of these modes are so enjoyable, in fact, that Nintendo should really incorporate challenges like these into the core story mode next time around; it'd make for some fantastic variety.Although NSMBU is at its core a success, players particularly weary of the New Super Mario Bros. series and its recurring drawbacks will still find themselves letting out a groan or two. Given how fantastic Mario soundtracks have been in the past and could easily be, why on earth the New Super Mario Bros. series insists on recycling the same tunes in every installment is beyond me. There is some new music to enjoy this time around, but the same ghost house, castle, desert and classic NSMB themes we've been hearing for years reappear yet again. Given how delightful the soundtracks of Mario Galaxy and Super Mario 3D Land were, Nintendo really should know (and do) better. The multiplayer mode is still fun, but also still chaotic and feels built more for trolling each other than working together-intentionally or not, playing with four other people just makes you feel claustrophobic on more difficult stages with a minimal amount of narrow platforms; more serious-minded gamers will have their frustration tested quickly. Although the game looks incredible in comparison to past Mario games, it really only scratches the surface of what the Wii U is capable of and what could have been-I dream of one day traversing through a vividly detailed and beautifully lit Mushroom Kingdom, and I know it is possible at this point in time. Here's hoping the next 3D Mario game takes that step.All in all, NSMBU is a pretty great game, and unlike many of its predecessors even seems to offer some solid replay value through its various modes and array of secret goodies. You'll be more motivated than usual to collect each and every Star Coin in this game (and the reward is worth it, trust me), and doing so presents quite a challenge; the game itself as a whole is in fact quite a bit more challenging than a typical NSMB game, which is a nice step up given that some previous installments have been plagued by serious simplicity. These new inclusions and features are ultimately an attentive love letter to the veterans, which I'm personally very appreciative of coming from a series that has for too long been built upon vanilla accessibility. In its very best moments, NSMBU reminds us what we loved most about the classic Mario games to begin with, as it recaptures the glitteriest bits of nostalgia while coating it with a new modern sheen and (at last) making it feel fresh all over again. Maybe Super Mario Bros. does have some newness left in it after all.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2012"}

{"product_name":"B000FQ2D5E","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"5 stars for fans, 2 1/2 stars for everyone else.....","reviewText":"It's no secret the Metal Gear Solid series has a huge cult following. Hell, I've been a fan since I first played the original PSONE game. Personally I still prefer Snake Eater 'cause I'm a sucker for origin/historical stories but this game takes everything a fan loves about the previous games and increases it ten-fold! If you're like me and a huge fan....well you probably already own this one. If you're not.....If you're a newbie to the series DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! I hope I got that across. If you've never played a Metal Gear game DO NOT START WITH THIS ONE! I don't care how much your friends are into it and demand that you start with this one. I know all the magazine and fanboy reviews are calling it \"Game of the Year\" material for any gamer....it's NOT. The Metal Gear games from the beginnning have always been story heavy (and I do mean HEAVY!). I'm talking at least 1/2 gamplay, 1/2 dialogue-cinematics-story (some of which  is great, most of which is unneccessary). Your liking of this game and the series in general will VERY MUCH depend on your liking to the story. The gameplay itself plays very well off the story, but if you're not into it from the get-go you're not gonna like the game. So newbies: if you're still curious, save your $50 and buy (or rent) one of the first three games to see if you like it. I love this series and the story, but if you're not familiar with it DO NOT START WITH THIS ONE!If you didn't like the previous games...well don't worry, this game willl will NOT change your mind. Save your $$$ (and stop reading these reviews!).I hope I got my message across. I love this game. If you are a fan it's still the best game for you on the PS3. If you're not a fan and are intrigued: give the previous titles a shot first. If you don't like the series....well keep going with that feeling.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-26-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0050SXKU4","description":"","reviewerName":"Mike London \"MAC\"","summary":"Welcome to the American Jungle","reviewText":"Video gaming has come a long way since the late 1970s and early 1980s. Game budgets have balloned into astronomical proportions and marketing campaigns have become blitzkrieg extravaganas. Major video game titles, like the major \"tent pole\" movies of the summer Hollywood so heavily relies upon, represent significant investment of capital. If you believe the marketing copy, each of these big budget video games represent the very best the video game industry has to offer. *Sadly, such hyperbole is very seldom the case, especially with non-Nintendo titles. Unlike Nintendo's IPs, which are consistently recognized as some of the most enthralling, well-designed games out there, and also certainly among the most bankable, newer games must establish such a strong, realised world and marketing presence that big budgets are in demand. While Nintendo and Mario/Link are the family friendly alternatives, there exists an large opening for more adult oriented fare to enter and dominate the market place. Enter Rockstar and the GTA titles which, while always controversail, has long helped bring adult themed video gaming into the mainstream with writing that is both brilliant and deeply satirical of modern day life..GTA V follows the Grand Theft Auto social commentary satire the series is so famous for, and expands it tremendously, becoming a mirror of America after the economic downturn. Rockstar paraodies everything form Facebook to political classes to celeberity culture, etc. The use of smart phones in our culture is also heavily featured. GTA has become the video game equiliant to South Park - there is no sacred cow left standing by the end of Rockstar's commentary on America.CHARACTERS: Rockstar changes up the GTA formula by introducing three main protagonists. GTA V features Michael, a retired, bored middle-aged criminal who reminds me of Henry Hill's fate at the end of \"Good Fellas\"; Franklin, a young gang-banger reminsent of Carl Johnson, and Trevor, a psychotic, in-your-face nutjob who is so unhinged that you can't help but feel he is little more than a caricature than an actual person. Of the three characters, Trevor is by far the most over-the top. At any time (other than specific points restricted for story purposes) you are able to switch between the three characters, which are at differing locations depending on time of day. The game will then take you to where the characters happen to be at the time. Each location fits into the character's story and place in the GTA universe.One of the weak points with the GTA series has always been the sometimes unavoidable narrative inconsistencies brought on by its open-ended gameplay, all the while moving the characters down specific narrative arcs. Likewise, the Elder Scrolls games from Bethesda suffer from this flaw to some extent. By introducing three characters, Rockstar is able to marry that illusion of cohesion between character and gameplay much better than the superficial unions of past games.STORY: Rather than gradually introduce a wide cast of supporting characters and develop their backstory, Rockstar has streamlined the writing, focusing largely on Trevor, Franklin, and Michael, at the expense of having numerous, secondary characters that so frequently stole the show in previous titles. That's not to say there aren't any memorable secondary characters; rather, the narrative focuses on the big three (and I don't mean Harry, Ron, and Hermione) and delves expensively into their lives and how the characters' fates become inextricably intertwined as the game proceeds.SETTING: After the sprawling landmass of GTA: SAN ANDREAS, which featured three cities divided by expansive countryside, deserts with secret government bases that may or may not hold alien bodies, and rural communities that appear to be straight out of Deliverance, GTA IV focused on a reimagined New York City. GTA V returns to the west coast, taking place in Los Santos, one of the three cities first introduced in SAN ANDREAS. While not as widely broad and disconnected as \"San Andreas\", GTA V features the series' biggest map yet, which also includes surrounding mountainsides and Sandy Shores, a costal village. Unlike previous titles, the entirety of Los Santos and the surrounding areas is available from the very beginning. The gaming world, while always artificial, feels truly alive.GAMEPLAY: The gameplay elements of GTA IV have all been finely tuned. AI is superb,. You can engage in a wide variety of activities, such as base jumping, cycling, flying, golfing, hunting, tennis, triathalons, vehicular racing, and yoga. Expanding on \"Vice City\", \"San Andreas\" and \"GTA IV\", you can also unlock vehicle storage facilities and purchases businesses and go on missions to help those businesses make profit. You can even play the stock market on your smart phone. There are also individual activities tailored to specific characters (Michael visitng a therapist and playing tennis or practicing yoga, Trevor hunting, etc).Like any GTA game, there is driving, and a LOT of it. For a series focused so heavily on driving, GTA V is the first time that Rockstar has nailed the driving down so effectively. Cars handle so much better overall (though the joy rides can still turn into some memorable crashes). Certain elements of driving in past titles have been frustrating, due to how wildly odd they handle. vehicles handle with precision, while still providing a wide variety of gaming experiences. Unfortunaly the flying sequences are still dreadfully awkward to control Another great addition is if you fail missions, you are no longer required to repeat the driving segments of those missions.MISSIONS: The shining point of GTA V, undoubtedly, is the missions, which constitutes the core of the gameplay. Several of the missions are tailor made to one of the three characters. Michael's missions deal with his increasingly fragmented family life as he goes back into crime. Franklin becomes more and more involved with grand theft auto and assassinations. Trevor's missions intimately suit his extremely psychotic psyche with larger-than-life explosions and wild, freewheelin' rampages that would earn anyone in real life a one way ticket to an impenetrable mental instution.GTA V grades missions on different qualifiers, contingent upon completing optional objects as well as time, appealing to the speedrunners out there. The biggest addition (and it's been a LONG TIME COMING), is, after failing a mission three times, you are able to skip that section of the mission, though your score will be directly effected. Since the 1996 N64 classic \"Super Mario 64\", open world games have been notorious for having that one, infuriating mission. In the GTA series, often times that mission must be passed in order to progress, and it's high time Rockstar has come up with a solution for those \"one mission\" nightmares that so often send us into tirades (I'm looking at you, \"Wrong Side of the Tracks\" from \"San Andreas\"!). Why develop all these hours of content if, because of one mission early in the game, the player eventually puts down your product, with the game unfinished? Likewise, you can replay missions at any time, another needed addition to the franchise.A major addition is the heist missions, which involve all three characters. Rockstar is able to show off just how effective they are at featuring three protagonists in the Heists missions, and add a new depth of gameplay not previously seen in the GTA universe. The heists can be done one of two ways: guns blazing, ala Clint Eastwood, or channel your inner Solid Snake and infiltrate and plunder by stealth. Depending on what route you go, the three protagonists then must chose a crew (such as computer hackers, drivers, gunmen, etc) with varying degrees of experience. The better the crew, the more expense, but the less likely the mission will fail or you will run into further complications. The multiple character mode, the choice between stealth and combat, the action-packed setpieces, along with the variables of the crew you have chosen, make the heists some of the most engrossing missions ever seen in an open world game. Unfortunately there is only a handful of such missions in the game. The future of GTA, and sandbox games in general, resides in these type missions, and theres so much untapped potential in them that it almost comes off as a criminal waste. Off the beaten path you will find a wide variety of one-off missions that are both fun and imaginative.VISUALS: Fantastic and breathtaking. The game features a wide variety of environments for Rockstar to show off their graphical prowess, from scuba-diving sequences to cross-country to wealthy neighborhoods to seedy, dank areas more terrifying than they are amusing. The variety of locals is astonishing and adds to the overall texture of the game. You will be very hard-pressed to find a more gorgeously looking game on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, with all the details becoming much more crisp and the character animations superb.SOUND: Fantastic as always. GTA V does everything the other games in the series does and more, with a wider variety of musical content, new original music, and the best talk radio (featuring the GTA III perennial favorite Lazlo) this side of Rush Limbaugh. The voice acting is top-notch, as always.CRITICISM: The game comes across as rather misogynistic, with no strong female characters treated with respect, even given the criminal nature of the gameplay. Sometimes Frankenstien's seams show through, breaking the illusion of reality, and the scripting becomes apparent. While boundary-pushing content has always been a hallmark of the game, there is an (unskippable) torture mission that Trevor must complete that is little more than a veild criticism on the US policy of waterboarding. Even for a game as intentionally lewd and morally reprehensible as GTA V, this mission is deeply troubling and the one time that Rockstar breaks the illusion of \"this is just a video game\" and actually feeling dirty about yourself as a human being, even though you are playing as Trevor.ENDING COMMENTS: The GTA games have become a massive cultural phenomena the likes of which few games can attest too, attracting both controversy and fanatical players. With the release of GTA III in 2001, Rockstar introduced a fantastically realised, open sandbox world which was deeply satirical in nature and have only built on the foundations laid by that groundbreaking game.But twelve years in the electronic entertainment industry and pop culture in general can be an eternity. With the prevelanace of increasingly violent and sexual content regularly displayed throughout our culture, games like GTA V aren't quite as shocking as they were in 2001, let alone 1994 with Mortal Kombat's spine-ripping fatalities went all the way to the United States Congress. Even Christine Hefner, Hugh Hefner's daughter, has stated pornography has become such mainstream that it can hardly qualify as edgy anymore. By this point, the major groundbreaking gameplay elements introduced in GTA III has become a matter of course for big-budget titles. To Rockstar's credit, they have prefected and honed the GTA gameplay to such fine precision that GTA V stands proudly as among the best games ever made in the admittedly very young medium of video gaming [history].Overall, despite the jaded, cynical culture we now live in, GTA V pushes the boundaries of sex, drugs, and violence to a new level. Like Insane Clown Possy's Dark Carnival mythology , I believe Rockstar is more moral than their detractors allow for. They hold up a twisted, exaggerated picture of life in America today, twisted by crime and sleaze which is enacted by deeply pathological, flawed people. Essentially, GTA V is a video game equivalent of the sleaze of Guns N Roses's \"Appetite For Destruction\", and, more specifically, \"Welcome to the Jungle\".And what a twisted, warped, manically unhinged jungle that truly is.*Both Steven Speilberg and George Lucas said Hollywood's reliance on huge blockbusters would cause the implosion of Hollywood's business model when several pictures costing over one hundred million would fail to recoup their investment, shaking the studios to their very core, Modern video games can also represent a significant investment of capital. Disney's video game division estimates the new Disney Infinity game, with its focus on NFC enabled action figures, has a development price tag of one hundred million dollars. Disney's video game division has lost 3.4 billion between 2010-2013.).","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-17-2013"}

{"product_name":"B0000A0MDV","reviewerName":"Paul Mosier","summary":"I'd call it Gran Turismo 3.5","reviewText":"While I loved Gran Turismo 3 and probably logged more hours than I care to count, after playing Gran Turismo 4 for maybe a few weeks I was frustrated with the game and stopped playing altogether. First off, the setup of the game is almost identical to GT3, which makes me wonder why it took nearly half a decade to release it. You have licenses you need to obtain to race in certain races. There are three different main circuits (amateur, professional, and expert), as well as new circuits based on country. Rally races have been expanded to include ice tracks. Your normal speed ring as well and tuning shops are still a staple in GT4. A considerable amount of cars and carmakers were added in this game; over 500 individual vehicles. The soundtrack is quite literally sublime, with a huge selection from classical to hip hop music. A new feature for those who felt the endurance races required too much...well endurance is the driver or coach mode. With this you can have an autopilot take the reigns of your vehicle for the whole race or get back in the car during a pitstop. My friends and I ended up using it for many many races however. Physics are as always extremely close to real-life.  The interactivity is at the same level as GT3 as well as the graphics, which was probably one of the most dissapointing parts of this game. Paying $50 for this which seemed more like an expansion pack sort of griped me. Another problem is the gameplay. I don't think I have played a game quite as difficult as this before or since it came out. The world championship in the professional circuit was where I got to and ultimately had to quit to save my sanity. It wasn't for lack of trying. After using dozens of setups on my multiple Le Mans autos and at least twenty times playing ten different races each time I attempted to even come in 3rd in that championship. You cannot advance if you don't receive at least a bronze medal. One reason and possibly the most likely to make the game so ridiculous challenging is that instead of players complaining about Gran Turismo 5 coming out they will still be glued to their TV trying to beat this one some years down the road. If you liked any of the Gran Turismos you would probably like this one to the extent that it follows suit. Many who love the series as long as it has the name Gran Turismo on it would go with the \"if it isn't broke don't fix it,\" defense. In my opinion, the sequel to GT3 lost some of the luster for this racing series and I am thinking of converting to Forza Motorsport. So, is Gran Turismo 4 worth buying? Ultimately I would have to say no. A game that takes up hundreds of hours of your time that is possible to complete-fine. A game that takes up hundreds of hours of your time that you may never even get halfway through-absolutely not. If you have a game rental service make use of that because you will most likely be dissapointed in GT4; especially if you are a fan of this line of video games. 6/10.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2005"}

You play the role of an up-and-coming hunter who must accomplish various quests to achieve glory and help the residents of their village survive. Do you have the courage to hunt the monsters that roam your world? It won&rsquo;t be easy &ndash; the monsters are strong and numerous. Yet by hunting together with friends, or fighting the good fight solo, there is no monster that cannot be defeated.GameplayMonster Hunter Triis an action RPG centered around players' expertise with the various weapon sets available in-game to take down the plethora of monsters that fill the gameworld, including underwater environments. Hunters can track monsters, set traps for them and either capture or slay them when they are encountered. In single player mode players can select a hunter of either gender, choose from a variety of weapons classes and set off with a crew of AI companions referred to as ChaCha. When a monster is slain, the hunter can carve off their horns, scales and bones, which can be used to create a huge variety of weapons and armor. These items can be bought or crafted by giving the village blacksmith materials and a fee. With success comes upgrades both for yourself and your ChaCha companion.Co-op MultiplayerUtilizing the graphics and wireless capabilities made possible by Wii,Monster Hunter Triallows for a unparalleled co-op gameplay experience, both online and offline. Players can hunt in groups as large as four players online, or two players offline (split-screen). Co-op play is split between two modes: Open-world hunts and Arena mode. Open-world hunts allow players to explore theMonster Hunterworld, taking on the creatures they seek wherever they may be found. The caveat is that within this mode players, as well as monsters, can retreat and even escape bad situations regenerating to fight another day. Players who fall in these clashes will respawn nearby, and as long as one of their party remains alive the monster(s) faced will retain the level of damage inflicted upon them before the player's death. Arena mode is similar in most ways to Open-world hunts except that battles take place in set arena settings where there is no retreat for either side, making it a battle to the death. Communication between players in either mode is facilitated via Wii Speak and text chat support.Multiple Controller SupportMonster Hunter Trifeatures a wide array of controller configurations and options. These include: Wii Remote and Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Classic Controller Pro. Each features in-depth mapping of questing and weapons classes. And finally the Wii Remote allows the ability to save your character&rsquo;s information directly to it, just as is possible with Miis, so you&rsquo;re always ready to play at a friend&rsquo;s house.Key Game FeaturesSpecial Controller Included- Designed with input from the Capcom development team, the Wii Classic Controller Pro is included in this bundle.Hunt Together- In the hunt, you&rsquo;re never alone.

They camouflage themselves to ambush hunters, but will flee or call for help if outmatched.Immense Living, Breathing World with Ecosystem- Monsters interact amongst each other in a living breathing ecosystem, complete with food chain. Monsters have stamina, migrate and even attack one another, the strong feeding on the weak.New Underwater Maps- For the first time ever in anyMonster Huntergame, you will be able explore land and sea and hunt monsters of the deep.Fully Customizable Equipment- With ten weapon categories &ndash; including the all-new Switch Axe &ndash; and new armor and weaponry created from the remains of slain monsters, there are almost limitless opportunities for equipment customization.Choice of Controls- Play with either the Wii Remote and Nunchuk, with the Classic Controller or Classic Controller Pro.Take Your Character with You- The ability to save your character to your Wii Remote lets you engage in multiplayer hunts anytime on a friend's console.","reviewerName":"Carlos A. Ramos \"Voltaire Tempentry\"","summary":"Difficult, complex, and long, but oh so satisfing","reviewText":"Monster Hunter is a franchise of limited popularity in the Western world, it demands a great deal of time, perseverance, and devotion. Ill say this right off the bat, Monster Hunter tri is an incredible game, but beware, it is not a game for folks that want to play for a few minutes then leave. It has an incredibly difficult learning curve (but much less so than previous MH titles), and its that difficulty that makes MH3 so rewarding and frustrating at the same time.For the first few hours, gamers won't find much in terms of action and adventure. MH3 is a VERY deep game, it has strategies with branching strategies that can only be achieved by using OTHER strategies. The first few hours will be spent going through text box after text box, collecting remedial items, and learning the aforementioned strategies. This game is as complex as they come, and i will openly refuse to recommend it to those who want a simple type of fun, as this game will not deliver it.After the initial slosh through the long tutorial (which is cleverly disguised in a plan story mode), you'll be set out into the world to fight monsters, collect bounties, and simply harvest necessary items. Eventually you gain the ability to create your own armor and weapons based from the items you've collected. Defeating monsters grants you the ability to \"carve\" them, IE collect items from the monster. Items are unique to specific monsters, and several are necessary to complete a piece of armor/weapon. Its a chore at times, but the brilliant system replaces the archaic leveling up of ancient RPGs. As you progress in the game, you'll gain access to new lands, deadly monsters, and different items, all of which can be used to build newer, stronger weapons/armor.Everything you build has a distinct appearance or similarity to the monster it originated from. Much more than color is used to identify a weapon/armor to its original monster. Physical traits, edges, fangs, textures, and in game attributes are all often used to bring a weapon together with its original source. For example, a monster has a heavy poison attack, the weapon created from its materials will have its own poison attacks, or the armor may be resistant to poisonous attacks.It the weapon/armor crafting/upgrading system that grants MH3 such an addictive quality. As soon as you find a new monster, you start to wonder how its weapon will look or handle, or how the armor will be. Although it takes a long time to amass the required materials or money to craft a certain weapon, the ending feels so worth it.There are several \"large monsters\" (18 in total), each with its own style, attack patterns, weaknesses, strengths, materials, and appearance. Since each one is unique and different, and there are so many different monsters, it hard to get bored.Which brings me to my next topic, the actual battle system. The core combat in MH3 is very much like a simple 3D brawler. There is no camera lock on, several combos, full camera control, and dodging. A good deal of criticism directed toward this game was about the camera system. At first it was difficult and frustrating to use and handle, since constant movement of the camera was necessary to fight and kill a monster.  After practice, the game rubs off on you, and you begin to handle the camera before certain events, such as evading or running away. Items are an absolute must, since the enemies are strong, and have much, much more hit points than any warrior. Items to raise attack/def, health, stamina, efficiency, and weapon sharpness (after repeated use, a blade weapon looses sharpness and deals less damage). Most of these items can be made by combining materials found in worlds, others can be bought, or other given to you.Monster Hunter Tri has some of the very best graphics and art design found on Wii. It's right up there with Red Steel 2, Super Mario Galaxy, Metroid Prime 3, and Dead Space Extraction in terms of graphical fidelity. Everything from character models to armor and monsters is incredibly detailed (so much so that some of the details are \"clustered\" together in the Wii's limited 480p presentation), locations are beautifully redendered, designed, and animated in such as way that each area  is it own unique and living world. Monsters are given an incredible amount of polish, from design to animation as well.Monster Hunter Tri is one of the few MH games to include online play, and Capcom has done an incredible job with the online infrastructure in the game. Like everything else about it, Monster Hunter Tri has a complex online system that links servers to lobbies to \"cities\" of only 4 players.  After the hard learning curve, youll find buddies, shops, exclusive quests, and items that can only be gained in the online mode. Players can join and play with any group of people without friend codes, gameplay is almost always lag free, and keyboard and WiiSpeak chat is included. To use the keyboard, the game provides a simple on screen variation if you don't have a USB keyboard; otherwise it's as easy as typing and posting. To use WiiSpeak, at least 2 people must have the devise, and have it enabled, and then each must be a \"friend\". Keep in mind this is not Nintendo's infamous \"friend codes\", instead its merely sending a friend request, and having the recipient accept it.--------On Wii Speak--------Having played Monster Hunter Tri online, ive found (on several occasions) that those using WiiSpeak MUST turn down music and SFX volume in order to use it effectivly. See, the music/SFX are easily consumed by the \"echo cycle\" described below, so turning down the in-game volume yields great results. If BOTH parties have said settings, WiiSpeak works well enough. The voice quality is still low, there is still the second lag, and you still can't communicate with more than 1 person at a time without your voice turning into a confusion of random bable, but it works.The microphone is intended to receive the voices of several people, and in that effect it attempts to receive a wide range of noises, including those from your TV speakers. What this does is create long echoes. Noise sent from one Wii Speak is received by the other, is produced by the others TV set, and is received by Wii Speak 2 and set back to Wii Speak 1. This vicious cycle never ends.--------------------------The bundled Classic Controller Pro is Nintendo's upgrade to its existing Classic Controller. It was developed with the help and insight of the actual MH3 development team, and is sold for $10 more in this box set. The new additions include nice grips, redesigned shoulder buttons, control sticks, and cord. The new extras do help round out the controller, but obvious problems persist.The controller is still wired to a Wii remote in order to function. In a generation where wireless is standard, it is a nuisance and shame that Nintendo, once a pioneer in wireless controller, has limited its controller to a wire. Its not a huge deal as it doesn't affect gameplay or control in any way, but it is something worth considering for those interesting in \"re-buying\" a CC.The Classic Controller launched without a rumble feature, and now the CC Pro has done the same. Since the CC is tethered to a WiiMote, and gathers its power from it, a lack of rumble is sure to safe battery life. It does take away from some of the experience however. Although it is true that Sony launched the Play Station 3 without a rumble controller, they have since released the DualShock 3 to remedy it.Since it has no battery source of its own, or any internal mechanics to support a rumble feature, the CC Pro is very light. The plastic used is sturdy, so it doesn't feel cheap or breakable, but it does feel flimsy.The CC Pro has a gloss on top of the controller, similar to the Wii remote, but the entire bottom of it lacks any of the gloss, OR a matte finish like the newer Wiimotes of Xbox 360 controllers.The CC Pro is being sold standalone for $20, and it becomes obvious why it lacks a sense of luxury, but it's disappointing that Nintendo would go through all the trouble of redesigning a controller only to do it poorly. The low price means that it isn't a serious investment, but the additions don't really warrant another purchase for those already stock full of original CCs. New comers are very welcome though.I find that the Wii Mote control scheme may turn off players, but it is responsive and works great. There are no awkward gestures of button holdings, and since most of the game doesn't offer you full 360 degree camera control (horizontal yes, but vertical control is limited to set intervals), an analog stick is really not required.Monster Hunter Tri is a difficult game, one that takes a great length of time to understand, and an even greater time to master. It's a game that demands time, attention, and focus; casual gamers beware, this is NOT a pick up and play title. It is, however, very satisfying to spend hours to forge a weapon, or finally defeat a monster after an hour long battle. Despite its faults, it manages to go on beyond its pieces and become a masterpiece.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-04-2010"}

I owned Black Ops, but could not really get into the Multiplayer, however I did like the Black Ops campaign and I think the Battlefield 3 campaign so far is just as good if not much better than what Black Ops had to offer. So I'm having a hard time understanding why many reviews bash the Battlefiled 3 campaign because it has been incredible so far.One thing I have to say about this game is that the sound is just amazing. You know those few games where every so often you have to turn it down or take off your headphones because you can't tell if what you're hearing is actually going on around you or if it's just the game? Yeah, BF3 has THAT kind of sound. Gorgeous graphics and plenty of suspense in both game modes to boot.Multiplayer is the best out there IMO and the best you can get out of a multiplayer experience in an FPS today. I mean, c'mon.. realistic Jets, Tanks, Helicopters, Hummers..  what's not to like? COD offers none of that. Also the Frostbite engine that offers the destruction of buildings and environment helps keep Battlefield at the top; I mean, it's such a blast (no pun intended) to knock down a whole building full of enemy players.Only complaints so far is that there are a few rare glitches that occasionally slow the game down and multiplayer has some issues with joining games and getting dropped from games, but I'm sure that the latter issue will correct itself with time. So far the game hasn't crashed on me once, so that's a bonus. IMO neither issue takes away from the game enough to hinder it's overall rating and I give this game 5 out of 5 stars. I'll be playing this for a long, long time and to me that makes it worth the price of admission.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-02-2011"}

Im not a big FPS fan, Ive played the unintersting COD games, and halo got boring really fast.  Those games just turned me off to any FPS shooter.  I was bored one day and was debating what to spend my money on, so I bought this for about 10 bucks. I figured why the hell not, and I must say this game is so addictive.  The control scheme is very complex but feels much more realistic that COD or Halo etc. The story is interesting and has a great way of drawing you in. I never played the first one, but thats ok because you dont need to have played them to understand whats going on. The multiplayer feels familiar yet so diff...it actually feels like there is war going on. There are explosions every where, and the 32 player chaos that goes on is fun as hell. This is very tactical and makes you think about how to attack.  I love Uncharted 2 and 3 multiplayer, and I love Gears of war multiplayer. I found myself the other night playing gears of war and found myself wanting to play killzone 2 instead. That says alot.In short, this game is worth it. The online community is still alive, the graphics are amazing. Its a diff. feel than any other FPS out right now. I have MW3 and I have not played it, Ive played killzone 2 for only a week and have spent more time on that than MW3. I regret not getting into this franchise sooner, but better late than never. The best part is you can find it for less than 15 bucks now, so I say, hell yea buy it. Hope this helped.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-26-2012"}

Everything is top notch, story, sound, graphics, mechanics. Probably the best example of cell shading yet for this console generation. The mechanics won me over big time. I went into the game not knowing anything other than it was designed by level 5 and the art was done by Studio Ghibli, which was enough to sell it to me in a heartbeat. It has a Tale's/Star Ocean type open battle-field. The battles feel very fluid and intuitive. The familiar system reminds me somewhat of Pokemon. Each familiar can evolve twice from it's base form and the 3rd evolution is always an option between two different end-versions. There is just too much character in the game, it's teeming and oozing with style. If you like level 5 games or are a fan of Studio Ghibli I suggest buying this instantly.

People are complaining about the length of the game, but I think it's the same length as super mario land. I will probably play through it around 4 more times as I did the same with mario land. The only problem I've seen so far is that I preordered it and I can't redeem my free bioshock mini pack. In closing, trust me when I say that this game is worth buying a vita for.

Fans of the series will come to find that Dante has taken a back seat with this installment (although there are segments where you play as him) and you will spend a majority of the game in the shoes of Nero; an ultra cool, ultra stylish antihero with a demonic arm.  If you've been playing the games in the series for any substancial amount of time, you won't be disappointed with what you get in Devil May Cry 4.  Nero is an awesome character with an even more awesome array of moves and techniques to take down baddies, all of which is made the better by the incredibly sharp controls.  The game itself is simply gorgeous to behold, from the in-game graphics to the beautifully rendered cut-scenes, along with great character animations; all of which more than make up for some repetitive looking environments.  The combat of the game is addictive, thrown in with some great, fun boss fights as well.  The only real drawbacks of Devil May Cry 4 is that the platforming elements that appear in the game just don't really fit in well with the rest of the game, seeming as more of an afterthought.  The puzzle elements aren't anything special either.  It should also be noted that Capcom has downed the difficulty factor as well.  Anyone who first played Devil May Cry 3 when it was first released will remember how unbelievably hard the game was before it was re-released, and fans should be happy to know that this installment is nowhere near as hard, but its not a breeze either.  All in all, Devil May Cry 4 is a beautiful, bloody, and addicting action game that nicely updates the series for the next-gen, and despite some moments of repetition, the game succeeds mightily.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-13-2008"}

Thankfully, they're not the only ones who have evolved. This game also offers access to powerful new weapons variations that extend your destructive capabilities.And the updated, quick-select inventory system allows for real-time inventory management, as well as allowing characters to trade items and allowing you to place an item on the directional pad for instant access. Add all this to a detailed storyline the touches on what the past ten years have meant for Redfield and a Hollywood-caliber soundtrack, and it's clear that the latest installment in this series really does showcase all the elements at the heart of horror gaming.","reviewerName":"W. freeman","summary":"Average for PS3, Great for 360, looks Godly on PC!","reviewText":"I originally purhcased the game for PS3 because i was buying every 3rd party title for 360 because they looked better and wanted to see how this one faired up. Well i was impressed UNTIL i downloaded the demo on xbox to compare to the game on PS3. Well to my dismay this version looked very uncolorful, washed out, was extremely laggy with terrible frame rate drops during large zombie attacks and certain areas with heavy water and foilage. The game itself is great, although being a team can be a big tedious sometimes it adds a great new twist to the adventure. I took the PS3 version back got store credit which was still a lot and got it for xbox, played all the way through and defeated it no sweat, well a little sweat in some areas ha. The game is not what i would call HARD, but can be a lil difficult in some areas. The PC version looks totally incredible(hense why that version was up for best graphics) and the 360 wasn't far behind. So overall this game is great, just don't get \"this\" version its plagued with many bugs, not that its unplayable or anything but just not as impressive as the other two. Why am i writing this a year after the games release, not sure, it popped in my head so i just woke up and wrote it lol. Go figure. Get it for what system you want no matter what I say, not swaying anyone, just what my experience was. Its still the same ole resident evil(although nothing beats 4), its just short and sweet, almost to short. One of the coolest things to happen to me in any game happned in this, i was getting ready to bend over to pic up ammo, Sheva was behind me, as SOON as i bent over one of the archman zombies shot a flaming arrow, so i was bent down and it hit her instead of me!!

Real-time lighting forces your eyes to adjust to changing conditions, such as when a car rounds a turn and the sun comes out from behind a building to cause glare on the windshield. This makes the game harder, but more realistic. Heat rises off the ground and mist swirls around vehicles as they make their way across the racetrack.Gran Turismo 3also features more than 100 distinct cars, each with different statistics, including the Subaru Impreza Rally, Dodge Viper GTS-R, and Mazda's RX-7 RS. Computer-controlled opponents benefit from enhanced artificial intelligence; they don't act like baby ducks following their mother, but instead respond to other cars, the course, and the conditions in much the same way that real drivers would. Pressure a car, and it will pressure you back; cut one off in the early part of the race, and expect to receive similar treatment down the course.

Master the moves of each character as they race through each environment on their own specially designed track.","reviewerName":"T. Hill \"Relytia\"","summary":"A great expansion to the stellar console version experience","reviewText":"I loveSonic Generations. It's a fantastic platforming-action game and one that is, in almost every possible way, a true celebration of the Blue Blur that any self-respecting Sonic fan should love. The 3DS version is no different. It's gotten a surprising amount of flak, though, and honestly, I don't feel the common complaints reflect honestly and fairly on this awesome title. I'll admit, this version of Sonic Generations is very difficult for me to objectively rate. I have a lot of nitpicky thoughts about it that aren't technically flaws or complaints, but rather questions due to confusion at some design choices that went into making this game. Still, even though some things about this title confound me, I cannot deny that it is just as enjoyable to play through as the console version. It's just different.Any Sonic fan knows immediately what Sonic Generations is about. It's essentially a title that is meant to celebrate Sonic's 20th year anniversary by presenting a simple plot involving a universe/time paradox mechanic that makes it possible for us to revisit some of the more famous levels from Sonic's history. While the story may not be particularly deep or anything, the writing is fantastic, with tons of charm and humor that is genuinely well done. The plot in the 3DS version, however, is a lot more convoluted and confusing to follow because the snazzy cutscenes of the console version have been done away with in favor of idle, gesturing 3D model talking heads, much like theDS Sonic Colorsdid. Overall though, I felt the presentation and development of the story in the 3DS version would only be understandable to those who are already very familiar with the console version. Who cares though? Sonic has always been about awesome, fast-as-sound platforming through brilliantly imaginative environments with a stellar soundtrack in the background, and that's where this game really shines.There are two different versions of each level too, one for \"Classic Sonic\" and one for \"Modern Sonic.\" Classic Sonic's levels play exactly like the old Genesis titles, with the same kind of level design and, thankfully, the same classical physics system that we all know and love. I must say, Sonic Team nailed the Classic Sonic gameplay in every version of this game. In fact, I think the 3DS version feels even more like the classics than the console version does, because everything in the 3DS classic levels is at the same scale as the classics too. In the console Generations, classic Sonic's levels were bigger in scope and even faster than the Genesis titles ever were, but in the 3DS version, it truly feels like this is just new graphics and sound overlayed on top of the old gameplay engine. It really is fantastic.Modern Sonic's gameplay is very similar to the modern portable Sonic titles, such as Rush or Colors on the DS, so it's still 2-D, bizarrely enough. In addition to running and jumping, however, you'll also be homing attacking enemies (although Classic Sonic gets that ability later in the game too), grinding, boosting, and sliding throughout the adrenaline-pumping stages that seem to send you in every which way. Paths will take you to the foreground, the background, and everywhere in between, giving the gameplay a 3-D sense of scale, and I feel it really lends a feeling of organic life to what would normally be a 2-D \"flatformer.\" Trust me, nothing about this game is \"flat\" or \"lifeless.\" Overall, Modern Sonic's levels are characterized by an over the top craziness that saturates the whole experience. It's really awesome.The audio and visual work done to bring the classic levels into the year 2011 is amazing. The 3DS version is essentially like a portable Gamecube, in terms of graphical power, and it really looks snazzy on that small screen. Some complain that the screen is too small to keep track of Sonic or the gameplay taking place, but I disagree, I had no problems as I played the game. The game is so colorful and capatilizes so well on the art design of all of the Sonic titles represented here, and the 3-D visual effect of the game was implemented excellently. The same goes for the music, which is also amazing. Obviously the source material for the songs were brilliant to begin with, but the remixes in here are almost all simply fantastic. Overall, the visual/audio aspect of this game is just great, and as a lifetime Sonic fan, I was overcome with nostalgic joy the entire time I played this game.Now, here is where I'll voice my confusion about the game. It may be ranty/rambly, so I apologize ahead of time. First off, special stages make a return in this game, and each one is amazingly fun. It's basically a blatant copy of the special stages fromSonic Heroes. It's 3-D, and it works very well, so... Why wasn't Modern Sonic's gameplay 3-D?! It's obvious from the special stage that the 3DS version was more than capable of 3-D gameplay. What gives? In all honestly, the Modern Sonic gameplay in this version feels more like the 2-D segments in the console version of Generations, or the 2-D segments inSonic Colors (the Wii version), than it does the handheld modern titles, if that makes sense. I don't get it. I think it would have been a real benefit, and made a big difference in adding to variety, to make Modern Sonic play like he does in the console version. This is a big oversight, in my opinion.The game is also shorter than the console version, by two stages. Granted, besides Green Hill Zone, every level in this version is unique and different, which is great. Same goes for the boss fights, for the most part. In many ways, this 3DS version feels like a DLC expansion pack to supplement the console version with six new levels and three new boss fights. I don't say that as a complaint, as I think more Sonic history being given the Generations treatment is a superb thing indeed. Unfortunately, the game is far too short. I beat it in a mere 2 1/2 hours, with all chaos emeralds in my possession and the final fourth boss beaten. I beat Sonic 4 Episode 1 in the same amount of time, but I spent $10 on that game, not $30 like this one, so I must complain about the small content volume.Finally, one last area of the game that is slightly confusing is the level choice. Obviously, for the classical era, Genesis games were selected. That makes sense. Then for the second \"era\" of Sonic, levels from his Dreamcast masterpieces were chosen. Again, it makes sense, I suppose. Then, for the last \"era,\" one level was selected fromSonic Rush, and the other from Colors. What? Rush is the only portable game included here. I guess Colors was also on the DS and so there's technically two handheld games represented, but still, that just adds more confusion. I don't understand why only the third \"era\" has any portable games in it. There are tons of awesome level possibilities from Sonic's portable history to make this version of Generations unique as a salute to Sonic's handheld gaming past. The GBA's \"Sonic Advance\" series is a great example of this. Frankly,Sonic Advanceis brilliant, and I personally consider it the true \"Sonic the Hedgehog 4,\"Sonic Advance 2is awesome as well. TONS of potential in those titles for Generations. If the inclusion of \"Water Palace\" and \"Tropical Resort\" indicates that this is a \"Portable Sonic game\" version of Generations, why isn't the Advance series featured instead of the Dreamcast titles since they were released at roughly the same time? And how about some of the fantastic Game Gear entries instead of Genesis games? How awesome wouldBridge Zonehave been instead of Green Hill for this version? I genuinely don't get it. A handheld themed Sonic Generations would have been incredibly unique. Oh well. That's the end of my rant, sorry if it went on too long.All-in-all, however, this is still a stellar Sonic title. I think the reason it's gotten all the flak it has is that for years, handheld Sonic titles were always expected to be vastly superior games to the console titles. When the console version of Generations released and blew most gamers' minds, expectations for this handheld version skyrocketed. Frankly, I don't think this 3DS release is worse than the console one. Honestly, they're equal quality in terms of gameplay, but the console version is simply more complete, more coherent, and has more content in it, and that was enough to get this version an unfair reputation. I highly recommend it, though, if you want more of the wonderful experiences that the console version had. It's still a fantastic title. So buy it, enjoy the stellar \"fasting thing alive\" platforming, and blast through even more nostalgic Sonic wonderment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2012"}

The game features Dolby Digital sound, comprehensive voice acting, and a completely original soundtrack.","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"It's a good game, but there are better","reviewText":"I picked up Baldur's Gate: Dark Alliance (BG:DA) for Playstation 2 after finishing Dungeons & Dragons: Heroes on the Xbox. I'm familiar with Bioware, who consistently makes games I really enjoy (including Neverwinter Nights and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic). Additionally, Baldur's Gate came first before D&D; Heroes, so I knew there would be some improvements. Still, Maleficent and I enjoy blowing stuff up together, so we needed a new fix and Baldur's Gate fit the bill.Unlike D&D; Heroes, BG:DA pretends it has role-playing elements and in doing so, just highlights how non-role-playing the game is. Similar to Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and Neverwinter Nights, there are conversation trees. When you speak to a character, you select a series of responses from a menu. There are maybe five characters you can talk to in total and your conversation doesn't really matter - we quickly discovered that clicking the top choice always meant we'd get to hear the whole story. But you can just skip the whole story too and get right to the matter at hand, which means the role-playing elements are just trappings to make it seem more like D&D.;Forget character customization too, at least at character creation. There are three character types, including an elven sorceress, dwarven (cleric? I didn't play him so not sure), and human arcane archer. Some warning flags should go off for folks who play the third edition of D&D; - one cannot start out as an arcane archer, that's a prestige class. But that doesn't matter - the human, named Vahn, is whom you get to play. While he can hack things up in melee, Vahn's clearly optimized for ranged combat. The game gives subtle hints like dropping great heaps of arrows as the only equipment you find in treasure hoards.BG:DA is obviously geared towards a particular breed of player - the young, [...], male kind. The first character you interact with is a blonde elf that is quite buxom and has a habit of leaning forward, gesturing towards her chest or thrusting her hips. Similarly, the elven sorceress is only elf-like in that she has pointed ears - the rest of her is quite human. [...]The artwork, especially for a PS2 game, is fantastic. The backgrounds and sound effects are impressively crafted and filled with a loving attention to detail. The characters themselves move smoothly and act like real people in their hand gestures and emotions - even the lizard man acts slightly inhuman in how he speaks and moves. The voice acting is well done, but that's something I've come to expect from Bioware.There are some lazy shortcuts that were very irritating in their exclusion. One lizard man sends the heroes through an elemental plane of water, spends five minutes explaining how dangerous the journey will be and then we see a cut scene focusing on some random tower. POOF! That whole water/drowning thing? We never see it - we don't' even see animation explaining the journey. We have to trust on faith that it was a tough swim through the elemental plane of water. When everything else is narrated and explained in such painstaking detail, I expect to see animation explaining it.There is, of course, all the good stuff that some people think equates with a role-playing game: you can buy equipment, switch out arms and armor, and train particular feats and spells as you advance. Little of these powers resemble third edition D&D; - fire shield is considerably weaker than its tabletop counterpart. Strangely, my character was unharmed by Maleficent's burning hands (even when she was blasting right through him) but her fireballs hurt him. Go figure.Some of the monsters are radically different from their tabletop equivalents in weird ways. In Neverwinter Nights, umber hulks are wusses with an irritating confusion gaze. In BG:DA they are terrifying juggernauts, sans gaze. Drow are still as sneaky as ever (it's clear Bioware has a soft spot for the dark-skinned elves), dragons are still a pain in the ass, and giants are suitably fearsome. Bulette burrow and are extremely difficult to kill, which is appropriate, although they waddle like fast moving turtles...not how I envisioned them (or how they move in D&D; Heroes).Perhaps the most unforgivable flaw in the game is that it crashed. That's right folks, just like a PC, the screen went white and the game crashed hard. Considreing we were at a critical point in the game and a lot of objects were on the screen at the same time (magic missiles, multiple enemies, arrows, etc.) I imagine it overtaxed the PS2. But what the heck - if I wanted a game that would crash I would have played it on a PC!As a game developer myself for RetroMUD, I was surprised to see that every corpse and item stays where it is. That means there's no object cleanup. This means that the system has to determine the location of every item, corpse, and monster at all times. Corpses stay right where they are, which is alternately cool and disturbing, especially in rooms of mass slaughter. This problem was resolved in D&D; Heroes (the corpses disintegrate) but it's a big mistake for a game of this size and probably led to the aforementioned crash.I also got stuck once in an area due to clipping errors. These are amateurish mistakes that I haven't since seen repeated (certainly, not in D&D; Heroes) so I'm willing to forgive the developers. But it's their first foray onto console games and it shows. It's a good game, but there are better games now with less boring, click-so-they-shut-up \"role-playing\" elements.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2004"}
{"product_name":"B007CSF3GO","description":"","reviewerName":"Skitz","summary":"It Was Almost Perfect, So Close...","reviewText":"Right off the bat I'll say this game is drop-dead gorgeous. I remember the Skyward Sword haters complaining about graphics, well I believe this game had the graphics those fans were looking for. At times I even think it looks like a PS3 game. The graphics look so rich and at times so realistic, I can see why it has...THAT problem. Sigh We all know Wii's power limitations. It's no secret. This game is PLAGUED, and I mean PLAGUED with frame-rate drops. Like for no reason while running through the game no matter where you are, you will most certainly experience slow-downs. Personally, I believe that if the programmers were more versed in the Wii's tech this could have been avoided. I don't think Wii was too weak for it, but I think that because of it's power it couldn't cover up the sketchy programming of the game. That, in fact, is the only problem this game has whatsoever.The story is pretty well scripted and planned out. The voice are British, and I was afraid of that at first cuz Xenoblades' voice acting wasn't all to my liking but he english voice actors in this games speak clearly and loudly. I can understand them properly and they sound great. It gives the game the feel it's suppose to have, since it's taking place in the time of kings, castles, and mythical beasts. Battles are epic, and there's so much ways to go around fighting. You can be a long range fighter, close quarters, assassin-like, or a mixture of all 3. Not to mention the carnage really looks good due to the graphics. The hype is there with all the magic flying over your head, explosions, and an environment that can be destroyed by attacks. You can control your entire party's attacks, where they attack, or you can leave them to themselves and fight with only your character. It makes for deep strategic gameplay as you at time need to plan out your entire attack sequence to make an effective strike against the enemy.The town is vast and lively, the music is great everywhere in the game and is ever changing. There's always so much going on on the screen. Things way in the distance at time are animated and moving. Birds, clouds, streams flowing, if this game ran smoothly it would probably be the greatest looking game on the Wii period. The slow downs aren't bad enough to make you stop playing, the game is way too good for that, but it's present enough to make you die inside just thinking of how awesome it would be if it ran smoothly. You think that every time it happens lol. This is a 5 star game without doubt. I just wish it was executed better. I've never played a game with so much slow downs in my life. This is the first time I've ever been able to call a game that was plagued by so many slow downs, &#34;polished&#34;.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-03-2013"}

{"product_name":"B004LLRYOY","description":"Square Enix FF IV:The Complete CollectionFinal Fantasy IV:The Complete Collection PSP","reviewerName":"J. Cummings \"Somewhere in PS2 land\"","summary":"The definitive FFIV experience","reviewText":"FFIV (or, FFII in the US SNES release) redefined how gamers saw RPG's.  The first appearance of the Active Time Battle (ATB) system, a deep but easily followable story, hilarious translations (who can forget seeing \"You spoony Bard\" the first time and being like WTF? :) and deep gameplay made this the first of many FF's that gamers have played, and indeed many things that appeared in FFIV have appeared in many other games since.This all being said, this is no less than the 4th remake of this game (it has also been rereleased/refreshed on the PS1, GBA and DS).  Since the DS game took the gameplay in a much different direction (MUCH harder difficulty, the \"augment\" system, 3D graphics, etc) it's more than a little unfair to compare the two games, they play drastically different.  So for the purpose of this review I'll stick to comparisons between the SNES/PS1/GBA games.For those that have played FFIV in one of those other releases, you're not getting much more here.  The game has the same individual weapon challenges (each players \"ultimate\" weapon) as the GBA release did.  The difficuly also is around the same (however, for me at least, it sure SEEMS like the enemy isn't attacking nearly as quick as they should compared to the others).  This probably has the best translation of the Japanese text as well vs. the other versions.What really makes this a must buy are the two add-ons:  Interlude (which connects FFIV and FFIV: The After Years, and then The After Years itself, which was only previously released as a Japanese phone game and on WiiWare.Interlude is BRUTALLY tough compared to the other 2 parts of this package (your first clue should be Cecil starting out at level 30).  If you don't grind you're going to die, a lot of times in 1 hit.  It's also very, very short (around 4-6 hours).  Still...it's a NEW addition to the FFIV world, and for a game that is 20 years old, that's a pretty remarkable accomplishment.As far as FFIV:  The After Years, it's a whole new story but it pretty much takes place in the same locations.  There are some new \"tweaks\" made (the moon's phase affects your attacks, positively or negatively, and you also have special \"Band\" attacks you can perform only with certain groups of characters).  For most this game will clock in at 20-30 hours, which combined with the 20-40 hours you can put into FFIV makes this a very, very great RPG package for $30.If you have NEVER played FFIV before, this is a MUST BUY, period.If you HAVE played one of the other versions, it really comes down to personal preference and whether you think Interlude and FFIV: The After Years are worth your $30.  I think they are and so that's why I made the purchase.Pros:- The definitive edition of FFIV- Graphics, sound and translation are the best in all the releases- First chance for non-Wii owners to play FFIV:  The After Years- 40-70 hours+ of gameplay for $40- Deep, engrossing storyCons:- Game does show its age against recent RPG's- Siginificant number of random battles and level grinding are required- Little room for party customization except near the very end of the game- Core FFIV game is very similar to other releases","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-21-2011"}

The background is very beautifully presented and the characters look vivid and beautiful in a retro 2D presentation. In KOF 13 the story mode has been added back along with other modes such as endless and mission challenge, AND some popular characters that were RIDICULOUSLY missing in KOF 12 such as Mai. The characters are fully customizable from head to toe. Guys if you are a KOF fan or if you are into fighting genre in general this is the one to got for!For the online play part it is definitely much better! If you ever played Super Street Fighter IV online you can expect the same level of smoothness, which is great because you probably wouldn't be able to notice the tiny lag that exists in the physics of Internet.If you read the IGN review the reviewer complained about the bosses being cheap. That is just bull$h!# it's a fighting game and the boss has the same life meter as your characters do how do you expect the bosses being more challenging than regular opponents if they are not using full screen damaging supers?Actually my little complain is that the main theme sounds really like cheesy rock music, but the team theme absolutely can make up for it.[UPDATE]So I have played about 10 online matches, there were definitely good and bad network conditions. More than half of the matches I could say they were completely lag free, for some others I could notice that there were very tiny noticeable lag between your input and your characters' moves, but I was still able to do all the combos I trained in practice mode. There was one match that was totally unplayable but I could confidently say that the reason is the other person has really crappy Internet connection (Good luck with any game!) I have the same experience with Super Street Fighter 4 and I guess it's a regional factor.[UPDATE 2]When you are playing online, you will encounter players with four different levels of network latency. LV.3 and LV.4 are recommended as you will not be able to notice any lags. LV.2 is playable, you will notice a tiny lag which will make you feel awkward and some combos you practiced for hours are harder to do.

But fans ofGTA IIIshould note that  whileState of Emergencycontains adult themes and extremely violent  gameplay, that's pretty much where the similarities end. WhereasGTA IIIwas about creating a deep experience unlike any other video game,SOEis  a throwback to arcade beat-'em-ups likeSmash TVandDouble  Dragon. However, the game takes the genre to a new level with mind-blowing  graphics.InState of Emergency, you play as one of five selectable characters  that's going up against the Corporation--a tyrannical group that has the city in  an iron grip. The city is in a state of disarray and the citizens are rebelling.  Amazingly, up to 250 characters can riot onscreen at once. It's shocking that  the developers were able to render so many moving characters while keeping a  smooth frame rate. Basic gameplay consists of picking up numerous weapons and  objects to cause as much damage as humanly possible. Providing context to the  mindless violence are the revolution and chaos modes. The former is the game's  story mode and features more than 175 missions, while the latter is a  single-session mode with a few variations.For the most part, the game is an enjoyable cacophony of senseless violence, but  there are some flaws. Although the revolution mode boasts an impressive number  of missions, they do get repetitive. The game screams for a multiplayer mode,  but it's strictly one player. In spite of these flaws, the game remains  addictive and fun.

But it is good at wearing out your thumb. I can imagine how many people will want to buy this game, given that rockstar made the great GTA3. Just don't let the name fool you - this game is just a lot of headache... There's way too much going on on the screen at one time, and it's near impossible to concentrate on the game hero. The game is basically a specialized gta3 (centered on beating people up and breaking things), except it's nowhere near as realistic (you can run straight through people, and the amount of detail is miniscule, compared to gta3).Overall, I strongly recommend renting this game first. Once you do, I'm quite sure you won't want to buy it. Everyone is everywhere at once, and you will find yourself jamming the buttons mindlessly.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2002"}
{"product_name":"B00319DX4W","description":"Enslavedis a post-apocalyptic retelling of the classic 400-year old novel &lsquo;Journey to the West&rsquo;. Set 150 years from now, the world has been ruined by war and ecological disaster with only a handful of survivors remaining.End Game LogoBegin Descriptive Image","reviewerName":"D. Allen","summary":"Intesting game","reviewText":"I want to compare this game with Beyond Good & Evil. Mainly because it's a third person fight game that is heavily driven by story.The story plays you as Monkey. A nomadic merchant who happened to be on a slaver ship. He is enslaved by a girl named Trip who is trying to escape her captors and return home. After crash landing and killing countless amount of innocent people captured for slavery, Trip reveals that she'll remove Monkey's slaver headband if he takes her home safely. So Monkey suggests to return to the crashed ship to retrieve his motorcycle that the slavers somehow think is important enough to keep on the ship where Monkey can easily access it and gain weapons that can destroy them.The world of Enslaved is unique. It's a post-apocalyptic wasteland where you can tell years ago some sort of war occurred and the world is left in ruins. Vegetation has taken most of the land, and it's now a literal urban jungle. The problem is that the world is overtaken by machines. Lucky for Monkey, Tip is technologically knowledgeable and she helps out by pinpointing weaknesses.The game plays out rather nicely. The fighting is nice and smooth. You can do a variety of moves and you have the option to upgrade. I found that the \"partner\" system between Monkey and Trip to be excellent. You're really involved in protecting Trip and you can call her to create shields, and even carry her on your back when needed. It felt really like you were trying to get home and you develop a good bond between you and your partner.The best thing about this game is the environment. It's breathtaking and the only sad thing about it is that it's very brief. At the start you're on this ship crashing and one of the most epic moment is you're on top of the ship and you get a clear view of the environment. The only issue is that you can only very briefly look at the beautiful landscape as the camera closes it off and you concentrate on platforming off something. Some of the more memorable battles is when you're able to see the environment and things are breaking and moving and exploding. It's very nice.There are several problems with this game though. First I notice a few hickups.I think it was chapter 5 where Monkey is trying to protect Trip in an used out APC. At the end, the bridge starts to crash and I tried to jump but I died and the game locks up. When I reload, the game puts me in the next chapter but I clearly died.Another point is this part where I was battling a lot of robots and this one shot me with something, but I fell off the map and I should clearly be dead but I can run around in this invisible field to later die by moving around.The game seems to be unresponsive sometimes. For example, there is one part near the end where you have to protect something. Every time a new sequence occurs where the camera zooms to the area in question, you lose control for a brief second where you can be injured or the enemy robots are causing damage that you can't control.I also dislike the lack of various enemies. You face the same enemy throughout the game from start to finish. One of the best enemy you face is this thing called the Dog. It's very unique and there are several times where you get into epic battles with it. Other times you face enemies so large that you just fight individual pieces of it rather than facing the whole thing.Overall though, I don't think everyone will experience these problems. I think it's unique and when it does occur, it's not as bothersome.I think the next thing I found unfavorable was the story. At the end, it made no sense. The game never reveals why there are robots or who made them. Then the game further throws another curve ball at you. The romance between Trip and Monkey never fully develops although it hints heavily. There was also a comical character who is in the shape of a pig (hence the reason why I compare this to Beyond Good & Evil) but he doesn't really add to the story. As a matter of fact, it made the story even more ridiculous. At the end you confront the slavers, but it made no sense. It just left with no sense of fulfillment that you took part in this grand adventure and it didn't concluded and pulled a major story pull away from the primary focus at the start which was Trip & Monkey.Overall I loved the game for the build up to the end. I think right when you get to about 65% of the game, you'll realize the story took a major turn for the worst with questionable story telling. Overall I was please and based on that 65% this is one of my most favorite and memorable game of 2010. I definitely recommend this to anyone out there who likes adventure game or have a like for Beyond Good & Evil and looking for something similar.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2010"}

For the hardcore gamer who wants a game with all the violence and blood he can handle for the Wii, this might be his best bet. In 2009 Sega released Madworld for the Wii, a terrific rated M game that offers highly creative visual, black and white anime look that is very different from other Wii games. Every time you hit a character sounds effect like \"blam\", when you ride a motorcycle it will have \"screech\" and such so there is definitely a certain cartoon aspect to the game.  I really like the visual aspect of the game; I feel it's one of the best parts of the game. The least I can say is that the graphics are pretty and unique; Chinatown was one of the best levels for me because it was nice to look at. It's a very distinct game which is why I like it so much.You are Jack a tough guy who is a competitor on the show Deathwatch, your goal is simple: kill your enemies and try to survive. Nothing spectacular for a storyline but it's different and it works so no complaints. You have your fists and a chainsaw (a la Gears of Wars) to defend yourself. I like how you can also take just about any objects around you and use it as a weapon in some way; it's always fun to beat enemies with different methods. The motorcycle biking level has got to be one of my favorites The mini games provide great pleasure; you make fun of the enemies, Darts is one of my personal favorites! Boss fights are always entertaining even if they're not all that difficult. Actually the game is not that difficult until you switch difficulty, also it's not a very long game I beat it within a day after a couple hours of play. The game is a little too short but don't let that keep you from playing Madworld it's really worth it and a fun Wii experience.  The controls are fairly simple and they're effective. The game is mostly punches, jumping, moving, chainsaw, combos, performing a combination of buttons will make a small sequence of a hilarious and spectacular kill. Madworld makes good use of the Wiimote and Nunchuk, the game has a first level that's a little tutorial and the controls are easy to remember, the camera is not always spot on and I have seen better controls but I also have seen worse.Madworld is really mindless fun, the game has a crazy and mature sense of humor which will make players either love it or hate it. There are two announcers who are hilarious with their comments and they add to that humor element of the game. The mini games that you unlock at the end of each level are perfect examples of this. Once you unlock the mini games you can play them multiplayer which is fun but I wish there was more to do for multiplayer gaming. There are plenty of good things to say about this game but it also has negatives. For instance, the game is too short I would have liked it to be longer at the price I paid. Madworld can get repetitive since all you do is kill enemies, bosses and move on but the mini games, unique visuals (reminds me of Okami, another excellent game for the Wii) and the humor put into it makes it all worth it. Madworld is an excellent Wii title but I can't quite give it five stars because it's a tad too short; however it's a different game and one that is always a blast to play. For Amazon's current $7.91 price I say buy with confidence, it's not one of the Wii more known title but I see as more of a great slightly obscure games. Overall, I rate it a solid 4/5 stars.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2011"}

The epic story line will reveal secrets about Riddick's past and cast light upon his future. Features the voice and likeness of Vin Diesel.","reviewerName":"KlownArt","summary":"Well Worth a Buy","reviewText":"The Chronicles of Riddick- Escape from Butcher BayAfter the success of the movies,Riddick Trilogy (Pitch Black/  The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury/ The Chronicles of Riddick), it is destined to have a video game to go along with it. Luckily, this game did not follow the storyline of the movie. This game had perfect graphics for it's time and had near perfect gameplay. This is one of the very few movie games that actually turned out to be any good.Graphics- 9.5/10Everything is perfect. Things are shaded well, people look good, your weapons look good, everything is good. The load times are the only drag on this game. They aren't too long, but they are constantly being pushed on you.Story- 10/10You are Riddick. You are a murderer. You have been sent to Butcher Bay, an extremely secure prison, to rot the rest of your life. You do not like this idea and decide you escape. Along the way you meet an interesting cast of characters that will either help you or halt your progress. Just when it seems like you are going to escape, you are stopped, and pushed further into Butcher Bay.Sound- 10/10Vin Diesel does the voice of Riddick in this game. Very rarely do video games have their true voice actors. Every character in this game has voice-overs. Machines and guns have brilliantly put together sound effects. Sounds fade in and out as you get closer to the sound.Gameplay- 8.5/10This game is less of a shooter and more of a fighting game. In the beginning of the game, they hint a lot of gun fighting. Don't be fooled by this. The game is more of a stealth/fighter game. This is not a bad thing, and is in most ways very refreshing. A good portion of the game consists of running between people in the prison to get what you need to advance. This slows the game down a lot and gives you a lot of backtracking to do.Difficulty- 8/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)When you have guns, this game is simple and very easy. The rest of the game, around 75% of it, is a lot harder. You will become stressed out trying to get past 10 enemies with nothing but a shiv.Overall- 9/10I can't give this game a perfect score due to its difficulty, backtracking, and pacing. Don't get me wrong; this is a fantastic game. It's one of my favorite games in fact. I just can't give it a perfect score due to some minor problems.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-14-2008"}

We fully enjoyed the first 2 and we (well...\"I\" anyway, as the wife and kids never seemed to have any doubts) had doubts that they could keep up the quality and fun factor after 2 other games plus a spin-off or 2 (such as JD Kids). The series makes it's Kinect debut with a game that takes everything good from the previous entries and runs with it. There is some new stuff here if you are familiar with the other games not the least of which is being able to dance hands free, and a lot of old favorite modes too but that isn't bad since the others are so good. Someone here said the graphics were zippy and family friendly. That's a really good way to put it. The dance numbers are varied with a good song list and fun dances, some challenging. For those who are new to dancing or just not that good like me there are difficulty levels. There is also a create mode where you can make a dance routine and upload it to Youtube for the world to see, so you had better be either really good or lack humility completely  :-  The gist of this review is this: the game is fun, challenging at times, good for groups and every bit as fun as the last entries, so if you like Just Dance already you can't go wrong, and if you haven't tried any of the games in the series this is a good one to start with because with Kinect you are hands free and the dancing feels a lot more natural (we played the first 2 on Wii).

It's not the prettiest game I've ever seen - the graphics are somewhere between XBOX and XBOX360 quality - not quite last gen, but not quite current gen either.  Lots of button mashing is the name of the game.  A few combos to learn, a few abilities to earn, but mainly just hack, slash and bash.  The environments get repetitive as everything takes place in one absurdly large mansion.  One thing about this game that sticks out is the difficulty.  It's overly difficult.  You will get to levels where you are being attacked relentlessly from all sides and it gets pretty frustrating.  The difficulty starts early on, too - not later in the game.  So, if you're into lots and lots of button mashing and lots and lots of blood and dismembered body parts, you might like this game.  For me, this game was ok when I was very bored and was playing while imbibing a few adult beverages.  It's not good for much more than that.  I'd give it 2.5 stars if I could, but I rounded up rather than down just because it's slightly entertaining when mindless killing is all you're after.

The action is surrounded with more than 80 hand-painted comic-screens that enhance the game's gritty atmosphere and attitude, introduce the game's murderous cast of characters, and carry the plot from one location to the next.","reviewerName":"Knewace","summary":"Max Payne","reviewText":"Max Payne is a third person game with a fantastic single player gameplay but no multiplayer gameplay. It has an average plot, ground breaking graphics and lots of comic book type animated cutsences. It supports two video modes \"Direct3D Hardware T&L;\" and \"Direct3D Software T&L;\". Set in New York City, Max Payne is a cop who goes undercover to seek revenge against the gangsters who killed his wife and daughter, His cover is blown and is framed for murder with cops and gangsters after him. The game ends with a great climax action which will do any hollywood movie proud. What's unrealistic is Max is a cop fighting against drugs but he uses pain killers to cure his injuries. I played on the Direct3D hardware T&L; and the game runs very smooth. The graphics are fantastic, The charecters and world look real, Though not many different colours. The world detail is superb, You could turn on the tv, shoot it and watch it explode. The sound recording is very good and loud. The music which plays during the action sences is superb. Load times are very good, The quick saving and quick loading are very quick.Max Payne's level design is superb, They are very well done, In one level you need to chase a gangster jumping from the cities roof top to roof top and finally jumping on a moving train. Mp is a short game but the length is just right. The selection of weapons are very good but some of them are very dissapointing, Grenades and molktov cocktail for example, It is quite hard to through grendes. Colt commando is my favorite. Max Paynes gameplay is pre half-life, But still the action gameplay is superb and very thrilling. The problems in the game are it is shipped without a multiplayer and initially it has only one difficulty, other three difficulties can be unlocked only if you finish the first, They are both very bad decisions. It has got loads of annoying cutsences, cutsence of the sniper bullet charging to the target is cool, but others are very annoying and take the controls from the player. It is also quite hard as max cant take much damage. Third person perspective is always a bad choice for action games like this, But its third person view is quite good but it does not support the turn left and turn right key for the keyboard, You could turn only with the mouse. Max Payne is not a ground breaking title in gameplay but it is a very good pre half-life kind of game with better graphics and bullet time. If you like pre half-life games (not many puzzles, shoot everything that moves, Bad AI) then you will really love Max Payne.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2001"}

The basis of your zombie-fighting arsenal is a variety of found items. These items can be crafted into a many different more powerful weapons.The zombie fights are intense. The standard maneuver involves kicking (to stun zombies and conserve your stamina) followed by a brain-smashing swing with your weapon of choice. While there is no local co-op, the cooperative scheme is ambitious and lets you join with other players who are at similar places in the quest line. I have been waiting for a great rpg multiplayer.  Dead Island most reminds me of Borderlands in that it is an action-fest with customizable characters.Quests are unlocked by talking by talking to NPCs. The graphics are good, but the shining strength of Dead Island is zombie killing action.  There is something satisfying about deciding to use a lead pipe to crack a zombie over the head or deciding to curb-stomp the undead.There are lots of things to do on Dead Island.

{"product_name":"B000QY9C90","reviewerName":"Z. A. Recht","summary":"Winner!","reviewText":"It took me a while to get my paws on this game. For one thing, I don't have Xbox Live, so I didn't immediately see the appeal of a game that was being billed as an \"online shooter.\" For another, I usually wait until games have been out a little while to see if the hype is true (and also for the price to drop.)I picked up Left 4 Dead for 19.99, started up a campaign, and found I should have purchased this title a long time ago.It's not really your *ideal* zombie shooter--I have yet to see one that meets my unusually high expectations for this genre--but it IS very fun.I'll start with my few negatives, and move on to the positive.Here's what annoyed me:-Limited weapon selection. This is maybe the biggest disappointment, but even so, it's hardly noticeable once the action ramps up. Still, it's worth a mention. Besides pistols, there are only five weapons to choose from in the entire game: generic submachinegun, generic pump shotgun, generic assault rifle, generic hunting rifle, and a pretty spiffy lookin' auto-shotgun. And since the game tends to be either slow moments of skulking about where the pistols are most useful or frenetic rushes of undead where the assault rifle/submachinegun's hail of bullets are most useful, the hunting rifle and shotguns are of limited appeal to me, meaning that there are really only three weapons I can choose from.-Stupid AI teammates. I know this game is meant to be played with four human players, but still! It's really frustrating when you're near the end of a campaign on Expert and your teammates run in front of your assault rifle and get shot in the back of the head, or refuse to move when you throw a pipe bomb and it unfortunately lands right beside them. Worse is when you have to sneak past a Witch. They just love to run up right next to her and fire off a shotgun blast at a distant zombie, thus dooming themselves.Okay, that's all for the negatives!Positives:-I really liked the presentation of the campaigns. They're fun to play through multiple times, especially since the content varies itself. While the levels remain static, enemies and items do not, and appear in random places on every play-through. This means you'll actually take the time to look around in every play-through as opposed to breezing through the levels confidently. You don't want to leave a bottle of medication or a closet-full of zombies behind you.-It's really satisfying getting a headshot in this game.-I love the dual pistols for every situation except those frantic rushes or special infected. There's nothing like coming around a corner, seeing a hallway full of zombies, and emptying a pair of .45s into them, and seeing them all crumple to the floor as the smoke clears. And I get a thrill every time I spin around to see one running up on me, only to double-tap them in the chest at close range and see them skid to a halt at my feet.-The Witches are nerve-wracking little wenches. The distant crying is a little creepy, but the closer you get, the faster your heart will go...the crying gets louder and louder and then that music picks up, letting you know you're right on top of her...if you're lucky, you'll spot her from a good distance away, but many's the time I heard that crying change to a low growl and came around a corner to see her standing right in front of me, ready to attack. You back off very fast in those situations, trust me.-I liked the inclusion of the special infected. They not only added variety, but a degree of danger that kept you focused. The regular infected were predictable, but the special infected can come at you any time, and from anywhere--even the rooms you just cleared minutes earlier.-I've noticed that either a Witch or a Tank will spawn in certain areas. This leads to some trepidation on my part as I approach those areas, wondering whether I'll hear crying or suddenly get ambushed by a hulking brute. I like that.-The \"finales\" of each campaign are awesome. I love fortifying those little outposts and getting everything ready--finding the nearest source of pipe bombs is often a priority. Nothing's more thrilling or frustrating than being overwhelmed right as the rescue vehicle pulls up--it really can feel like a movie climax.All in all, even if you don't pay for Xbox Live, I can recommend this game. The two-player mode isn't too bad, and you'll still enjoy playing with three AI teammates, too.Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-11-2009"}

And while this one might be the \"best\" of the bunch, I'm starting to wonder...about the wonder. The fact is, we have all been here before. Literally.\"Katamari Forever\" essentially repeats the stages from \"Katamari Damacy\" and \"We Love Katamari\". And when I say repeat, I mean it literally. You'll see a race stage. You'll see a sumo stage. You'll see a stage to create the moon. You'll see an underwater stage. Yes, the total number of stages are pretty staggering (and more so when one considers the different modes - more on that in a moment). But they are just like their earlier counterparts. OK - so the graphics are in HD. I wasn't aware that this game was selling itself on graphical prowess.But anyway, on toPros:- Fun. This game is still fun. And while I have played nearly all of these stages before, it doesn't change the fact that it is a lot of fun to create a massive sumo that eats an entire town.- Game Modes. OK - Katamari Forever mode is what you expect, and if the whole game was simply this, it would rate 3 stars. But then, you unlock \"Katamari Drive\" mode, which puts everything into super speed. And honestly, this is what Katamari should be about. The super speed levels (and you can play them ALL in super speed) are, simply put, the most fun I've ever had playing Katamari. Play well enough here, and you can unlock Eternal mode, which allows you to roll as long as you want on any stage. It's great if you are wanting to complete your collection, but it's also nice if you just want to roll a really, REALLY big Katamari. Finally, you can unlock Classic Katamari mode, which essentially lets you play the stages without the new bells and whistles, and in the original graphics. This didn't wow me, but it was surprisingly different to be so similar.- Colorful. One thing about the great graphics we see on the PS - there is no real aesthetic beauty. In an attempt at realism, many games look bland, dark and dull. Not a problem with Katamari. While the graphics are nothing special, there is so much color that it astounds. All the colors of the rainbow.- Multiplayer. It's fun. I like both the co-op mode and the versus mode.- Trophies. They are tough, but well thought out.Cons:- Control. At times, you will be frustrated to no end with the control. Is this a ramp I can roll over? No - its simply a step that is destroying my katamari. I hate the sixaxis motion controls, and their use here is no exception. Thankfully, you need not use the silly motion to jump - there is a button command as well. Unfortunately, the hop never goes where you want, and is generally a pain in the rear.- Graphics. Yes, I like the color. But We can do more in our royal majesty. I mean, when you rehash levels, the least you can do is enhance the graphics. I do like the new graphics mode (although \"comic\" and \"wood\" leave me cold). But let's put a little more effort here, shall We?- Minigames. I generally like minigames. I only like one here (the \"Beautiful Katamari\" endgame, which is fantastic).- Price. Fifty bucks?!? Really?!?!?! I remember the original was twenty, immediately upon release! This seems a little steep. Still, you will be playing for a while, so maybe it isn't so bad.All in all, I would recommend this game to fans and newbies. But if you weren't wowed by the original offerings, this isn't going to change your mind.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-01-2009"}

I was really looking forward to this game but I was greatly disappoint with the outdated and basic gameplay.The only good things about this game is the art direction and the story.  The graphics and story are basically \"anime/manga-ish\", both of which, while not awesome, give this game alot of character and uniqueness.However, if I wanted an anime I would have bought an anime.  I buy games for gameplay and this game is an absolute failure in the gameplay department.  Here is a few of the points that irritated me with this game and why after 1 day and only 7 levels I put it on eBay.- Shoots that \"hit\" targets (it is obvious when you miss a target) and grenades that land 1ft from targets did no damage.- No strategy required.  Most maps are narrow and small which basically limits you to one strategy.  You are basically limited to the strategy designed by the developers and that is it.- A stealth mission where you are supposed to slip by the enemy to get back together with your platoon.  However, the ONE path through the level brings you in front of every trooper in the level.  Even those that you sneak behind turn around and fire on you.- The always fun \"invinsible enemy\" level who can run all over the map in one turn and shoot her ultimate weapon that instantly kills your team.  How do you survive said level?  That's right, you have to use the one strategy designed by the developers.- Rudimentary battlefield.  The only battle cover is tall grass, sandbags, and trenches.  However, these do not hide you from the enemy nor lower your chances from getting hit by fire.  All it provides is that it negates the auto-kill headshoot.  No protection from trees, no popping out from the sides of buildings to fire.  Basically move, shoot, move shoot.- Weak weapon/armor/troop leveling flow chart and no weapon customization.- No multiplayerThere is a reason why this game has poor sales, it is a poor game.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this game.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-19-2009"}

Redmond","summary":"In almost every way, inferior to the first.","reviewText":"While The Force Unleashed 2 has some nice graphics, it was something of a disappointment for me.  It is shorter than the first, the dialogue worse than the first, the gameplay/combat is more tedious than the first, and the story is more lacking than the first.  The game really seems like a step back.I beat the game the night I got it... in just a few hours.  The first game was too short, this one is basically a joke.  I don't understand the production company here... the shortness of the first game was probably the biggest complaint.  Why would they make the sequel even shorter?  I've played demos that were longer than this (and they were free).  This is probably part of why the story suffered so much... it was too rushed and made to be a little farcical.  About that:The story is very haphazardly put together and pretty cliche, even for an IP that has many cliche game stories.  All your amazing power and you are just a clone.  That isn't much of a spoiler, since it's in the demo and in the first minute of the game.  Are the three flashes of memory you have your own?  (Yep, that's about how much development the plot has.)  Well, let's not bother with that yet -- let's just save the girl we think we might have fallen for in 10 minutes flat (hey, we beat Anakin's record!) and we might have maybe left behind when we may have sacrificed ourselves in that event that might have happened to us.  Why not, it'll be fun right?  What makes the story even worse is the awful dialogue.  I got so sick of hearing Kota gripe that I wasn't doing something fast enough.  His inane instructions were equally annoying, because I always knew what needed to be done before he opened his mouth.The combat starts out feeling smooth and fun.  Some of the controls are slightly, very slightly, better than the first game.  This game takes a step back, however, in that combat becomes repetitive very quickly.  You basically only fight 4 baddies -- regular/flying troopers, shock troopers, force users, and robots.  These are all recycled throughout the game.  You basically have an \"I-win\" button as well, with the grapple.  Doing it over and over gets incredibly boring, however.  There is at least one memorable moment in the first boss fight, but you'll soon be forgetting it when you get back to the repetitive stuff.  I also noticed that on the PS3 the game lags up quite a bit whenever there is a lot going on.  This happened during regular fighting as well as on the final boss fight.  Nothing says awesome when a Jedi gets up close and personal only to start stuttering.  Still, there were some moments that made me think \"hmm, that's kinda neat\".  The parts of the game where you are falling and using force powers to deflect or blow up stuff in your way was actually enjoyable.You would think with a game so short, it would be difficult to become bored.  It still happened, at least for me.  So, despite the couple of not-quite-saving-graces the game has, I would say it is worth a rental.  If you don't get your hopes up too high you might have a bit of fun... but you won't get $60 worth.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-26-2010"}

Risk Everything. Trust No One.","reviewerName":"JO MOMMA \"COOKIE-MONSTER\"","summary":"Much Like Hot Pursuit","reviewText":"If you enjoyed Hot Pursuit then you should pick this game up for more than just one reason.1) An online session has 6 people but one person will host the game so if he leaves, the game will migrate.  But having people would also benefit your races.  Anybody near the area of a race starting will be automatcially out into the race so you can actually race with your friends and get Gold on all the events or just help you against cops.2) You earn SP which is used to upgrade Tech for cops but you have to upgrade each Tech for each car.  You cant just unlock a level 4 tech and use it on all vehicles unless you buy the shortcut DLC.  Fortunalty you will earn a lot of SP to upgrade different cop cars and you wont loose any SP for getting wrecked or failing a race.3) Unlike the cops, your SP will be used to buy cars (which are few), upgrade your tech (which is better than the cops) and even purcahse modifications (top speed, acceleration, durability, ect).  But dont worry, I have earned over 200k SP in a single session but dont get busted or wreck because you will loose it all.4) The single player game (if you would call it that) is very short.  You are forced to choose between 3 different assignments to progress up to level 20 where you get your last event and then all the other assignments you didnt choose and continue to level up.  You might be a little confused by now so let me explain even further: in order to level up, you have have to complete an assignment and their are a total of 61 assignments but the max level is 60.  Each assignment could be different while others are the same.  3 assignments for certain levels could be wreck 5 cops or wreck 5 racers.  Or they can be different like get bronze in a race or get bronze in an intercept event.  The lower assignments are easy while the later assignments will be more demanding like get a Gold medal on a Hard event, drift for 500 years, splitstream for 8 seconds, drive on the opposite side of the road for 1000 years, jump a total of 10 seconds and even accumilate a certain amount of SP in a single session.5) The MP portion could be rather annoying.  Cops are looking to bust racers and racers are trying to complete events.  So you could be doing the final even as a racer that lasts 12-13 minutes (its a race around the entire map) could be rather challanging when you have oncomming traffic with another racer in an event or human cops on your tail with level 4 tech.6) The map is very large that offers different scenery like mountains, desserent, beach front and bridges where you can make over 100 meter jumps.  You can drive to each event or just fast travel from the command center/garage but with the MP community, I tend to drive to the locations unlike what i did in Hot Pursuit.I hope this helps.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2014"}

That's what the game gave me as a summary report when I finished the game - once. I've only sporadically played games throughout my life. My recent playing has all been FPS or action games in straight campaign linear mode to get through-and-move on. ME2 is a role playing game that needs to build up a team and build royalty while excavate minerals. The game like this usually turn me off after few hours as I refuse to put so much time in it (Dead Island for example). But this game is highly addictive, and I keep coming back to play. It was worth the money for sure.The only thing I find repetitive (but still wanting to do) is mining all the planets for minerals. This at the end wasn't necessary for 3 out of the 4 elements. The mining probably took me a good 1/4 of the time. I give 4 (instead of 5) stars for fun because of this time waster. In Me3 they simplify this which is good.The other complaint is the reloading time after getting killed. It can take up to 30 seconds to restart a section each time, which is a real downer. I have a 7200RPM hard drive and it's a real drainer. I strongly suggest using one of the faster SSDs if you want to play at more difficult level to deal with the slow reloading time.This edition comes with most of the DLC content, so lots to explore. That's a huge value! I think there is only one DLC that is not part of this and can be downloaded separately.My only major complaint is loading time after getting killed. Typically can be 20-30 seconds. On some very challenging battles, the loading-before-restarting can really drag the gaming session on. (I have a 7200RPM HDD, and may need to try SSD)All in all, it was a GREAT game that really had an effect on my work productivity and cut into my sleep time!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-05-2012"}
{"product_name":"B007CM0K86","description":"","summary":"Must own for any PS3 fan","reviewText":"I am an Xbox Gamer, but own a PS3 due to titles that you can not get on Xbox such as God of War, Uncharted, Twisted Metal, and MGS4. I am a huge Uncharted fan, I love the games so much I had to buy a PSVita just to play Golden Abyss! I have been dying to play The Last of Us just because it reminded me of a Walking Dead type of game and I am huge fan of the Walking Dead and its character driven point of view. Now that I have picked up The Last of Us and played it through I can say with confidence that what Naughty Dog did with Uncharted for games they have outdone themselves with this title. The characters and story offer so much depth that you will start playing and wont want to stop just to see what the actions your playing through are going to lead to.This game is beautiful and to me the actual Swan song for the PS3, Ill wait until Beyond Two Souls comes out to determine if that game is really the final Swan song for the console. But at the moment I do not see that game surpassing TLOU. The voice acting is top notch (part of why I was excited for this game is troy baker is one of my favorite voice actors). The performances and story as well as so incredibly will done. I will admit some of the story elements are predictable but the performances are what makes the material really pop out of the screen. At times playing you will forget it is a game and feel as though your playing a movie (reminds me of Heavy Rain in that way). The controls are brilliant they feel natural and not foreign at all. At times I wish Uncharted would have had the same controls, but they are different games.This game is going to be up there with Bioshock Infinite for Game of the Year easily, as much as I love this game and think everyone with a PS3 needs to own this game I still believe that it is just shy of what in my mind it takes to make Game of the Year, but that is my opinion. Do yourself a favor and go by this game and seat down for a very addicting, emotionally charging game that is only for adults. The content and material is not suited for young children (the first level will be all it takes to make you not want your kids playing or watching). ENJOY!!!1","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-29-2013"}

Hell, some of these elements even preceded the MW games and were in use for Call of Duty 2. I traditionally have loved this series, so it pains me greatly to say that I was simply not floored by this. By all means, get it if you are a MW fan but don't expect anything new. It's certainly not a bad game, it's actually very good, but once again the single player is LAMELY short (you would think that after the many complaints on this after MW2 that they would add significantly to the game length. LISTEN TO YOUR FANS!!) and the multiplayer is the same ol same ol. It IS a good game but what it isn't is up to par with the rest of the series. This may as well have been DLC for MW2 in my opinion, it's just not new enough or different enough to consider a true sequel.For the first time since the COD and the MW series began, I will not be getting the next game on day one. After this game I will wait and see what others think before I jump. I still would have liked to play this regardless, like I said it's a good game despite my feelings of it being under par, but I would have liked to play it for about half the price I paid. If I had known it was under par I would have waited for a sale or a price drop.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-21-2011"}
{"product_name":"B000VJRU44","reviewerName":"Ammy_Evaluator","summary":"Adjust your expectations and you'll have a lot of fun","reviewText":"First of all, remember that this is *not* a \"game\". Its a way to get your 40 minutes of daily exercise without making it feel like a lot of work.What this means is that you probably won't buy this for your under-11 year old. Before you start the \"game\", you are asked for an objective ... in terms of how many pounds you want to gain/lose. Whether this question is meaningful for your child depends on many factors - and other reviewers question the use of the BMI measure for kids, anyway.The only true game component of this are the \"Balance Games\" which turn your balance board into a snowboard, or into a tightrope, etc. However, I don't expect kids to return to this game everyday just to play. In short, its not a replacement for Wii Sports.So, how does it fare as an exercise regimen?Not very well so far. I use an elliptical for aerobics, and a [...] machine for strength training, and I can't see myself as shelving those two in favor of this toy. With the elliptical, I can adjust the resistance, get feedback on my calorie burnout, and can determine how long I want to keep going. Best of all, I can even watch TV, listen to music, or read a magazine if I care to.With the Wii Fit, the cutesy graphics are good, but once the novelty wears out, I'm guessing the chinks in its armor will begin to show. My TV is taken up by my virtual Mii running along, I get to listen to canned music, and there's really no way I can read along.Strength training is purely isometric exercise based (such as push ups). So, if you're fairly fit and need to work with additional resistance, this is not the place to come find it.Yoga is where it truly shines. I tried the breathing exercises and a few of the postures, and the instructions were fairly detailed and easy to follow. I expect that I'll use this as a cheap and convenient personal yoga instructor for months to come.The final aspect worth mentioning is core muscle control and balance. I particularly enjoyed learning how my body is balanced, and it does highlight whether you tend to favor one leg over the other. I can see this as being a worthwhile tool as part of a physical rehabilitation or therapy regimen.To summarize - if you have trouble getting motivated to exercise, or get bored by exercise machines at home, or can't get to a gym, and you don't care about its limitations, then this is for you.For those who are really serious about losing weight or getting fit, either setup a home gym or get a gym membership. This will be fun, but will likely be a large waste of your time. The biggest problem would be the inability to set up a sequence of activities that you could run through one after the other. Having to navigate menus to start up the next set is distracting. There is a Favorites tab that lets you get close to achieving this - but I haven't tried it enough to see if its a good replacement.I'm still in the \"novelty\" phase - so I'm going to try and make this work. I like the way it tracks your weight/BMI, which is much better than the paper and pencil approach I use currently. However, as stated before I expect to use it more for the balance and yoga portions, *after* I've completed my aerobics/strength activities on more conventional machines.Bottom line - as with every Wii product, the apparent \"shortage\" drives up demand and makes this seem more desirable than it should.As long as you are aware of its limitations, you're in the best position to determine whether this is for you.= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =Update (Week + 1):I've averaged about 30 minutes/day in the past week using this product, and here are some updates to my initial observations:(a) I've been surprised with how interesting the kids find it. They can't wait to get higher scores than me, and are constantly pushing to get ranked higher in almost all activities. Every evening I come home to scores that are better than mine, and am forced to play catchup. The balance games were an expected favorite, but I certainly didn't expect push-ups and the tree pose to capture their fancy.(b) The menus are nagging at best, and annoying at worst. My workout style is to focus on the activities at hand without needless conversation/distraction, and that's hard to do when I have to repeatedly click the A button just to get started. The text has this annoying teletype format as it prints across the screen, and can't be dismissed until it is displayed in its entirety.(c) This is compounded by the fact that this device can be very chatty. While some of the messages are good to know, I'd really like the option to turn these off. Counting the number of messages that I need to click past has become a running joke for us now.(d) Because I can't automatically string together activities in a logical sequence, I need to have the Wii-mote handy. Finding a home for it is a challenge when I don't have pockets, or need both hands for balance and can't be bothered to hold on to it (as in some of the more kinetic strength activities, or the yoga poses that need my fingers locked together).(e) Even worse is that you need to aim the Wiimote at the screen to click the menu buttons, which is an exercise in frustration. I'm mastering the art of using the arrow keys (the rocker switch) and the A button while the Wii-mote is in my pocket, but its still a problem when I hit the wrong button, which I seem to do frequently enough :((f) A yoga/gym mat is a necessary accessory - otherwise having to lie on your back when doing the jackknife for your abs means your flooring comes in contact with a very sweaty T-shirt. I'm not so certain about the silicone cover. We've used ours pretty rough, and I don't see any serious stains or dirt on it. And anyway, I like my workout machines to show some wear as a badge of honor :)(g) There is a half baked interface which allows me to track activities that I do outside of the Wii - such as jogging. So far, I've been logging my other workouts, but since I don't seem to earn Wii points for those, I can't tell how that factors into the overall Wii experience.(h) The BMI/weight tracking using a line graph, is really a nice touch.(i) Rather than a primary weight-loss device, I use it as a nice way to wind down from a heavy workout, and it serves that purpose very well. A commenter below questioned its usefulness for yoga. True, it does seem funny to learn yoga from a game console - but the funnier thing is that the yoga poses do seem to work very well to ease up strained muscles. Combine this with the immediate feedback as to how well you are balanced, especially on single leg poses, and you have a really unique combination.(j) The balance games are fun, but I tend to spend only a fraction of my time on them. I'm willing to take Nintendo's word that its good for me, but I'd rather spend my scarce exercise minutes on the other Wii Fit activities. After all, there's only so many times I can enjoy riding my bubble to the end of the stream.(k) The fact that the balance board is wireless is a wonderful touch. Its easy to hide it under the couch when its not in use.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2008"}
{"product_name":"B003VUO6H4","reviewerName":"aka TRAP","summary":"There's no need for a review, but here you go....","reviewText":"2005, the year the Xbox 360 was released a full year before system....everyone wanted it because it was the first next-gen console out on the market.But how did that Xbox 360 turn out?Well, from my personal experience, in January 2006, I got my Core edition, which I eventually ended up buying a hard drive, wireless controller, and HD component cables for.  Remember, this was when HDTV's were still relatively new and HDMI wasn't as wide-spread as it is now.  1080i was god-like in these days.  But anyway, after all that, Christmas of 2006, not even a year later, my console starts to break down.  So what did I do?  Buy another one....only for that one to fail in about April, RRoD (Red Ring of Death), sent it to Microsoft, got it back three weeks later, and it lasted for another year until it broke again.  So I sent it back, AGAIN (remember, that was the third one), got it again three weeks later, and it broke in three months.After four horrible consoles, I decided to get an 80GB PS3.  This was back when it was the fat PS3 that showed fingerprints like no tomorrow.  But that paint was very shiny!Eventually, sold it for yet ANOTHER 360 (got lucky and nabbed a Jasper chip), but got bored and went back to the PS3.  Now I own a slim, but with a 120GB hard drive.**side note**it really doesn't matter what hard drive comes in your PS3, since you always have the option of upgrading it to as big as 500GB, even though it's a tad bit harder this time, so go on YouTube and search up tutorials BEFORE you try to swap your hard drive out.ANYWAY!This my second PS3, and I've had it for almost a year.And I gotta say.........why did I EVER choose this over an Xbox 360?!!!Don't get me wrong.  I actually like the Xbox 360 in some ways.  I like Gears of War, and Forza Motorsports.  But to be honest with you, unless you LOVE Halo (I started getting bored with it after the third one), there really is no good reason to buy a 360, unless you're a teenaged fraghead male that's addicted to Call of Duty, even though it's the same thing over and over again.  In that case, why are you reading this?Continuing on, one thing the PS3 has over the 360 is NATIVE 1080p.  This is for those that have nice HDTV's that can push out 1920x1080 progressive scan (1080p to everyone else), and you can actually see every pixel (i.e. huge T.V.'s).  What I mean by NATIVE is, unlike the Xbox 360 which hardly has any games that are naturally shown in 1080p, the PS3 does it straight from the box.Another thing the PS3 has over the 360 is iPod functionality, to a certain point of course.  I'm pretty sure an iPod Touch will work on a 360, but it WILL NOT work on a PS3 (as far as I'm concerned).  Now if any of this has changed, feel free to tell me in a comment, and I'll update this review.  But my iPod Classic 160GB works on my PS3 when I put it in hard disk mode.  What that means is, if I go to iTunes and click \"Enable hard disk mode\", that means whatever I store on my iPod, I can COPY TO MY PS3 HARD DRIVE.Yes, I'm dead serious.  I have my entire (well...it needs to be upgraded) iTunes library and movies (yes....movies on my hard drive...Hangover, anyone? :D) on my PS3 hard drive, with still enough room to store as many game files as 46GB can hold.....that's actually a lot of space for games, when you think about it.So for example, let's say I want to put a new movie on my PS3.  Well since I now have my iPod Classic acting as a 160GB external hard drive, I can put the movie on the iPod, plug it to my PS3 (btw, I forgot to mention this, my iPod only works when I put it in hard disk mode, so IF YOU DO NOT HAVE AN IPOD THAT CAN BE PLACED IN HARD DISK MODE, IT WON'T WORK), go to \"Movies\", select my iPod, Triangle, find my movie in a folder I created, and now I can watch it on my T.V. instead of my laptop.  I love this feature.So if you couldn't care less about native 1080p or how you can copy music and movies on your hard drive, maybe you'll love how it's a blu-ray player.  So when you go to Best Buy, sometimes you'll see blu-ray players that aren't worth anything at cheap prices, but don't work too well.  Then you'll see those that are just shy of the price of what I paid for a PS3, $320 something with tax included, but can only play blu-ray discs (and I think DVD's...not too sure).  Well, with a PS3, you get a blu-ray player, CD player, DVD player, video game console, web browser, and a Netflix streamer.  Now go have some fun trying to find another blu-ray player that can do all of that and then some.That didn't impress you?  Oh, you're a gamer, huh?  OK, think of it this way.  What other system can you play amazing games like Gran Turismo, God of War, Killzone, Uncharted, Metal Gear Solid 4,Resistance series, and many many more games that are already out, on top of many more (Agent and Final Fantasy Versus XIII being some of them) ONLY coming to the PlayStation 3?  How about playing a shooting game on a dedicated server?  For those that don't know, dedicated servers are BETTER than the P2P servers used on Xbox LIVE.  YES, it's a fact. NO you can't prove that part wrong.But I've done nothing but praised this console, so let's talk about some bad things.  Well.........uhm...........the controller!  Yea, it's too small.  I mean, sure, I can go out and buy another controller to fit what I want, or I can get used to it (it's really not bad at all when you DO get used to it, and I have big hands).....you can't use your iPod right outta the box until you do what I described above...........uhm.........no Halo....wait, that's a good thing.........uhm......no For...wait, Gran Turismo.......uhm...............You know what?  I'll just end the review here, and when I think of something bad to say about the PS3, I'll update this.  But don't expect to happen anytime soon.  I'll be too busy with college work and enjoying my PS3 to come back here and explain what I don't like about it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-16-2011"}

However Wolfenstein is something more. I have played the past Wolfenstein games and enjoyed them all. The New Order reminds me a little of classic Wolfenstein the PC game and it plays a little like the Resistance games. It has a very classic feel, it is challenging and very entertaining to play. It has action, crazy machine guns, lots of violence, and plenty to explore and do. I like that there are little secrets around each level which if you're rushing you'll run right by them. This game is flat out fun! It has a classic feel with nice graphics and solid control. The level design is very good and feels more open then your usual FPS.

Low repetitiveness and high repeatability.+ Solid story, keeps you engaged in the characters and gameplay.+ Very detailed graphics and decent sound.+ Well put together, no glitches or stability issues.+ Classic game feel on a next-gen system.+ You made decisions which result in a slightly difference story and gameplay experience.+ There is much to explore and some really cool secrets to uncover.-/+ No Multiplayer, but I'm okay with that.- The AI seems inconsistent. At times is quite decent, however there are instances where the characters don't react how you would expect them to. There was a time where I was looking at a desk and picking up items, there was a bad guy right behind me just standing there alert and ready to strike, but he didn't move or react until I went in for the kill. Just a few odd AI situations like that, but I've seen much worse.The case says there is no PS Vita support or remote play options, however it does work. You may not have as many control options as with a regular PS4 controller (weapon choice wheel, ml&eacute;e, sprint), however you can play well remotely on your PS Vita.Classic gamers (us in our 30's+) as well as newcomers (you 14-year olds) will both find this game quite enjoyable and fun. It does have a very good story as well, which pulls the gameplay together even more. It's very well built and put together. Wolfenstein is a lot of fun with very enjoyable gameplay which I see playing multiple times. The graphics are clear and detailed and while they are not mind-blowing on the PS4 (due to it being a multi-platform game) they still are quite solid and smooth. The gameplay is fast and full of action which keeps things interesting, reducing the repetitiveness you would usually get from a FPS. I've played it twice and received the platinum trophy. A great game and a lot of fun!Highly Recommended!psn: adrielaugust","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-20-2014"}

{"product_name":"B004FS8LYK","description":"","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"(3.5) Some Pretty Fun Gameplay In Lieu of Pale Storytelling and Characterization","reviewText":"The Good:+Well realized, in depth environments+Satisfying gameplay throughout+Great music and voice acting+Lots of variety in the gameplayThe Bad:-Annoying Quick Time Events-A poorly realized cast of supporting charactrs-Lara Croft is not nearly as well realized as she could be.  There's a lot of potential here, but the game rarely pushes beyond a certain threshold with it.---NOTE: The following review is long.In 1996 the Tomb Raider series debuted on the original Playstation and immediately became a huge seller.  It was one of the biggest selling games on that particular platform.  Since then it has been a staple in the gaming culture.  Perhaps what people took most from it, however, was Lara Croft being a sex symbol, which kept her from being realized as a memorable character for anything other than her enormous pixels.  Soon a reboot was announced.  One that would try and develop Lara Croft more and add more dimension to her.  It tries but manages to stumble along the way.Tomb Raider wastes no time jumping into the plot.  Lara and her band of survivors find themselves stranded on an island while searching for the lost city of Yamatai.  Quickly stranded and separated from her band, Lara must find a way to survive.  But there is more than just the horrors of the mysterious island to worry about, a mysterious faction called the Solarii is also on the island.  And they're a brutal group as well.  Lara needs to figure out a way to survive, and she'll have to learn to do it.The story itself has potential but never quite reaches the ambition it's aiming for.  It's way of just jumping into things leaves a lot to be desired as far as character development goes.  There are bits of backstory sprinkled in there, but the cast of characters is fairly forgettable in the long run.  The supporting cast especially is extremely forgettable.  Most of them are there to play a very specific role or fulfill a very specific stereotype, but at no point do they ever really become memorable in any way.  Many of them might as well be invisible.  The dialog they spout off seems to only give you hints about what their role in the story should be, but never really establishes them beyond the trope they're supposed to represent.Lara herself isn't such a bad character, but how she grows through the story isn't quite as consistent throughout.  She's likeable, but there are moments where the story breaks the immersion.  For instance, Lara kills a man and cries but it's hard to find a lot of humanity in any of this when just seconds later you're mowing down the bad guys left and right with absolutely no emotional holds.  The leap from \"fearful young woman\" to \"brutal survivalist killer\" is swift.  To put it one way... the development of the plot doesn't quite match the development of Lara as a character through gameplay.  We're not introduced to Lara as a hardened survivalist, we're introduced to her as though she doesn't know what she's doing.  A woman who has never been in any real danger.  Yet she seems to adapt to her surroundings and danger rather quickly with no transition or revelations about what she's doing.  There's little gradual change in her character.  When she shoots down an animal for the first time we're treated to a scene of her feeling quite sorry for the beast... and then the game quickly puts an emphasis on hunting them down for experience.  What's the point of making her feel sorry for killing a helpless animal if she's immediately going to slaughter animals?  It's a character trait that is immediately subverted the moment gameplay begins again.  And the player is quickly rewarded for it.  The moment we are able to engage in gunplay you'll quickly forget that Lara was supposed to be scared.  It's not a gradual move from \"frightened woman\" to \"hardened survivor\".  This would be okay, if the story itself wasn't so downright insistent on this particular arc of Lara gradually coming into her own.Video games have been pretty good about bringing a characters personality into gameplay elements.  But Tomb Raider does no such thing.  It's hard to sympathize with Lara's vulnerability and perceived innocence when the next moment I'm running up to enemies and brutally executing them by shoving their face into the barrel of my machine gun and moving on.  Or sinking my axe into their skull.  It would be one thing if there was some emphasis on the idea, \"I must do this survive,\" but at some point the game overindulges itself in this and undermines what it's trying to do with Lara's actual story arc.  Again, if the game wasn't pushing her character arc so hard this would've been a non-issue.  But Tomb Raider is clearly trying to reach higher than that when you sit down and watch the cutscenes.The character of Lara in the cutscenes is inconsistent with her portrayal in gameplay.  And while that may not seem like much, consider that in many games we're usually introduced to characters who have already been in combat and thus in other games it's not really unusual.  The reason no one minds Solid Snake or Nathan Drake is because there's enough background to show us that they're no stranger to taking down people out to kill them and neither game tries to play this small conflict of having to grasp with the reality that they'll have to kill.  Tomb Raider, on the other hand, has a moment where it does.  Her personality rarely comes out beyond the cutscenes.  At no point when roaming around does she even seem to reflect on much of this.  The only thing that seems to harden Lara is that she's consistently getting the crap beat out of her throughout the game (more on that later) or finding herself in peril.  But we don't get a lot of heartfelt moments as the story progresses, or see Lara gradually become a hardened survivor.  And that's mostly due to the fact that her supporting characters just don't do enough to help Lara along in her development.  They do help out in her quest, but very few moments are spent where they just... talk.  She rarely has any natural back and forth moments with them that help establish her character or theirs.  And despite some hints of backstory every now and then, the way it jumps into the plot so quickly leaves a lot to be desired.The gameplay is another story.  The game is really fun and quite well done.  The pacing in Tomb Raider is pretty well established and well done.  There is some variety here to keep things moving along steadily.  Tomb Raider embroils you in combat, puzzle solving, exploration and survival.  You'll never feel overwhelmed by any one element at a time.  The environments feel big and expansive but for the most part you'll know where you need to go at all times.  There's a useful map if you need it.  Likewise, if you're ever confused at where to go or what to do you can easily toggle Lara's \"Survival Instinct\" which shows you where your goal is and highlights anything you can use in the area.  It's a much more straightforward and linear game than you might expect.  There are certain challenges in some areas (such as lighting statues with your torch) and sometimes you'll find that you need to return later when you have the proper item to do something, but for the most part the campaign is extremely straightforward.  There are also relics to collect as well as notes and diaries to find from friends.  Tomb Raider isn't short on content or longevity.You'll also be forced from time to time, to explore your environment.  You'll sometimes find yourself having to hunt animals to survive.  This brings about the experience system that Tomb Raider has in play.  As you perform certain actions or hunt animals or pull off kills, you'll gain experience.  These can be spent on skills such as getting more ammunition for your weapons, steadying your hands to fire a weapon and more.  You can also salvage the corpses of your fallen enemies and take components which can be used to upgrade your weapons.  It's a lot deeper than it sounds.  The more skills your learn and the more you level them up, the more become available to you in the long run.Most of the puzzles are pretty simple and straight forward.  The combat, on the other hand, can be a bit to get used to.  It's frantic and fast paced.  You'll start off with a lonely bow, but before you know it you'll have a handgun, shotgun and machine gun at your disposal.  Lara will crouch behind cover automatically whenever enemies are near, but she'll also stand whenever the area is clear--which is a nice indication that combat is over.  Ammo is pretty plentiful, especially because you can easily get more ammo from your slain enemies.  You can perform sneak kills when they aren't looking as well.About the only thing that keeps Tomb Raider down is that there isn't much in terms of melee combat.  Poor Lara can't seem to swing a punch to save her life (literally).  The press of the melee button will mostly just shove enemies out of the way so you can shoot them.  You'll be able to acquire skills later on that allow you to beat them with melee weapons, but Lara doesn't really punch or kick her enemies.  It would've been nice to have a full bonafide melee combat system here, but I suppose we can easily make due without.  The gun play is pretty satisfying, for the most part.The stealth element isn't quite as much.  You can stealthily kill your enemies, but most times you'll only result in getting involved in a gun fight.  It's only a matter of time before the enemies start noticing their numbers dwindling.  Even shooting arrows to distract them only deters them for a moment.  The stealth elements could most certainly use some work.Tomb Raider provides quite a few challenges.  Some gun fights and set piece moments are pretty tense and exciting.  You're sure to bite the dust a few times.  There will be moments where you'll screw up the first time you reach them and learn from these experiences.  On the other hand, the Quick Time Events here are pretty annoying.  While not as painfully annoying as say... Resident Evil 6, there will still be some times when you'll fail because of a quick time event you didn't quite know was coming.  The good news is that Tomb Raider isn't out to punish you.  It's pretty lenient as far as checkpoints go.  You almost always begin right where you died.  And if you fail a quick time event you'll more likely than not begin right at that quick time event and the button presses are usually the same ones.  After a while you'll be able to tell what button you'll probably need to press.  The game doesn't punish you for mashing on the Triangle button before triangle actually pops up, for instance.From a production standpoint just about everything Tomb Raider does is pretty good.  It's a sleek looking game with a clear defined art style.  The environments are really detailed and filled with life.  There were times when the framerate can get a little choppy, but it's not so bad.  The best part is that Tomb Raider does a pretty good job of masking some of its load times.  You'll know when the game is loading, certainly, but for the most part it keeps pressing on in some instances when it is.  The sound is also really good.  The voice acting is among the best you'll hear in any video game.  The music is good and tense like you'd expect.  And the sound effects are some of the best I've heard in a video game.On the other hand there are times when it feels like Tomb Raider is pushing just a little too hard in the gritty direction.  It's got a lot of dark moments, but very few of them seem to really be about establishing Lara as a character.  At some point it seems like many of them are there JUST so that you don't see Lara as a sex symbol.  There are more ways to create a well established character than just constantly showing them beaten and battered.  The problem is that there is little else done to establish Lara Croft as a character beyond putting her through hell.  Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with Lara being put through hell but... where's the heart?  We don't see a lot of well established emotional connections to other characters.  There needs to be more than showing Lara beaten, battered and covered in blood to get us to connect with her and sympathize with her as a character or see her as more dynamic.  It's dark and gritty but Batman Begins didn't just work because it was dark and gritty.  There was an emotional core that Tomb Raider seems to be lacking.Ideally, some gamers might not mind any of this.  The gameplay is sure to be enough to suffice, but for gamers looking for depth, it's not really here.  There's a great illusion that makes you believe there's A LOT here, but beneath the surface the game only appears to reach higher without actually doing so.  In the long run, the new Tomb Raider is worth playing.  It's a pretty fun game in its own right even if it doesn't quite reach the emotional heights it clearly set out to reach.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2013"}

{"product_name":"Wii","description":"","reviewerName":"Zachary Koenig \"K-Dawg\"","summary":"May Test Brand Loyalty Of A Certain Type Of Gamer","reviewText":"Ever since my Grandma bought me the Nintendo Entertainment System back in the early 1990s, I had been hooked on the Nintendo brand of video gaming.  After the NES, I favored the Super Nintendo over the Sega Genesis, the Nintendo '64 over Sony's Playstation, and the Nintendo Gamecube over the original XBox and the PS2.  Whenever a new console cycle began anew, I was a bit nervous as to what the change would bring, but Nintendo always seemed to keep me very satisfied with its classic games, identifiable characters, and solid consoles that didn't (at least after the NES) give me many technical difficulties.Once the life-span of the Gamecube had run out, though, I was drifting away from gaming a bit.  From hitting the books in college to finding a job out in the \"real world\", I just didn't have the time or the inclination to log as many hours as I had as a child.  However, there were still a few games (mainly sports, some adventure) that I still enjoyed playing, but no longer could keep up to date with a Gamecube (and I wasn't willing to shell out the money for a Wii).  My brother, on the other hand, WAS willing to part with this hard-earned dough in order to bring the next generation of Nintendo into our living room once again.At first, I was as intrigued by the system as any other.  The new motion-sensor technology behind the Wii Remote (no more \"controllers\") seemed exciting, as was the Wii Sports game that came with the system.  My entire family had hours of fun tinkering around with that game, and it seemed as if our Nintendo brand loyalty would continue into the future.  But it was not to be...With the inclusion of every new Wii game or Wii console feature, I began to get the full picture...Nintendo was turning the Wii into a family/kids system, and there wasn't anything I could do about it.  Now, I'm not the kind of gamer that needs intense violence or blood-curdling imagery to have a good time with a game, but I believe I am somewhat traditional in the notion that I like improvements (either in graphics or controls) and don't like taking steps backward.  With the Wii, however, both things occurred.The first issue came with the controls.  Originally touted as a \"revolutionary way to game and exercise at the same time\", the Wii pretty much fails (at least practically) on both counts.  Until the introduction of Wii Motion Plus (which still isn't even perfect), the motion-sensor controls were often shoddy at best.  There is nothing more maddening than not being able to do what you're trying to do within a video game and not have it work due to the sensitivity of the hardware.  Add to this the fact that the system fails to live up to its \"exercise\" mantra (all you do is pump your arms, which may be better than sitting on the couch, but not by a whole lot), and this was a down-grade from Nintendo systems past.The breaking point, at least for, was how the graphics on the Wii had taken a step backward from the Gamecube.  In trying to cater to their market of children and families, Nintendo turned many of its games into cartoonish caricatures of past creations.  For example, the new Punch-Out! title just recently released was a welcome trip down memory lane, but also much too over-the-top in its character goofiness.  Even worse was the stalwart Madden franchise, which (while looking incredible on other systems) was reduced to cartoon football in the Wii installment.Thus, after some brief consideration, my brother and I decided to sell all our Wii components, games, and accessories on Ebay and transfer our \"loyalties\" to the XBox 360, which offers a much more traditional, liner gaming experience (graphics get better, controls improve, etc.).  Will I miss the classic Nintendo characters and such fascinating pursuits as Wii Bowling?  Sure.  But the transition to Microsoft's gaming product, after nearly two decades of Nintendo dominance, seems like the right thing to do for the kind of gaming experience I'm looking for.To close, then, I would like to note that I don't consider the Wii to be a bad system by any stretch of the imagination.  In its own way and for its audience, it is one of the most revolutionary consoles of all-time (shown by strong sales vaulting it ahead of all competition).  However, at this point, I just have too many gripes with the presentation and controls of games to recommend it to gamers who (like me) have grown up with button-pushing and improving standards.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2009"}

While no one is going to argue the fact that this is great for gaming, it sort of hurts those who love a good single player experience. Super Paper Mario answers this call and is a staple among the first wave of Wii games. It doesn't have a multiplayer mode but then again there are a million multiplayer games already out for Wii.Super Paper Mario is the original Mario Bros meets Paper Mario. It isn't quite one or the other, it's a little of both. I was disappointed by this at first because I loved the turn based action of the first one when I was younger but after about an hour of playing I started to get hooked. The dialogue is very funny and even though it's long it's very enjoyable if you take the time to read it.The storyline is similar to that of every Mario game, big bad captures Princess Peach, Mario saves the day. Only this time Bowser is on your side and thank God he is because he'll come in handy on more than one occasion. Luigi and Peach are also in your party and round out your team with their abilities. The plot revolves a evil man named Count Bleck who rips a hole in this place called Flipside. Mario must found the pieces of the True Heart to save Flipside and his friends. He is accompanied by Luigi, Peach, Bowser, and these creatures called Pixls. Instead of the various characters you use to fight with in the first two games, you use pixls who each give your character certain power up likes a hammer attack or even making Mario little depending on which one you use. A lot of the game calls for you to sit down and examine the situation so that you can figure out which Pixl and character you need to use. This can be tricky and some points.The game play is like that of the original Super Mario Bros. You hold the Wii remote like a NES controller, the nunchuck is not used in the game. You can point the Wii remote at you TV to reveal certain things and shake it to use power ups on enemies but not much of the game revolves around this. Some people say the game is short but depending on the skill level it should take you fifteen to twenty hours to beat. It isn't Zelda or Final Fantasy in that sense but a little kid can beat it without being frustrated or getting bored.There aren't a whole lot of really good single player games out for the Wii and if you're looking for some good single player action and have beaten Metroid and Zelda than Super Paper Mario is the game for you.

Treyarch had a lot to prove, which is why they leaned on Infinity Ward and borrowed a lot from them.  The end product still works, even in the over populated and tired WWII genre.  I was skeptical, but I'm glad I took the plunge.  The campaign was simply fun.  I enjoyed the graphics and gun play.  The AI was a little retarded at times, but having the opportunity to drive the tanks more than made up for it.  The game is pretty linear and short, but I'm fine with that as long as the game is fun.  Kiefer Sutherland's voice over work added some drama and intrigue to the story, but during combat I got tired of him yelling the same orders at me over and over again (take care of that bunker, Miller).  COD5 is definitely not in the same league as COD4, but if you're looking for some simple shooting action you should go for it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-18-2009"}

Other than that, this re-release is the one you should be getting!Journey back to 1986-87 where you DIDN'T have 3D games.  Take a look at &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;.

But Princess Zelda broke the Triforce into 8 pieces and hid them from Ganon.  Angry at this Ganon kidnapped and imprisoned Princess Zelda.  Now a hero must come forth and rescue the Princess, find the eight pieces of the triforce and save the land of hyrule!

This was almost undoubtably the greatest game on the NES and now you've got the entire original ported to the GBA.  Keep in mind its a DIRECT port.  There are no bonus features and that sort of thing.Perhaps my only gripe with this game (and it sounds stupid I know) is that the GBA cartridge isn't a Gold cartridge.  The original NES version had a Gold cartridge and I was hoping that the &quot;Classic NES Series&quot; would recapture that Gold Cartridge.  Either way, this doesn't make a difference to the experience of the game.  If there is one Classic NES game you should get... this would be it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-10-2004"}

This is supposed to be a nex-gen console, isn't it?  If so, why is it using last gen media?  You pay $400 for a gaming machine that MS doesn't seem intent on supporting for a long period of time.  You have to buy a remote for DVD playback and you don't even have the future to look forward to.  This device will not play games on an HD-DVD format, so you're stuck paying an extra $200 for a device that only plays movies!  I can't wait for the games in 2 years that take 3 and 4 DVDs simply because MS wanted to rush a system to market.  The games are going to out-grow the DVD storage media in no time, and X-360 owners are going to be stuck swapping out disks just to continue playing their games.  For all of the grief Sony took for their PS3 pricing points, it's actually starting to look like a bargain.  You get a next gen console, a next gen movie player, more available media options, and a 60gb hard drive for what you'd end up paying for the X-box 360 and the HD-DVD add-on.  Plus PS3's game format is on Blu-ray disk (55gb storage capacity compared to DVD's 9gb or so) and Blu-Ray is likely to win the format war against HD-DVD due to the massive studio support BD currently enjoys.  I just don't understand MS's business model on this one and I feel sorry for those that bought a 360 (myself among them).  I guess if you really (and I mean REALLY) like first person shooters, these won't be problems.  But for the bigger games like RPGs and the Grand Theft auto type games, Xbox 360 is going to end up being more a hassle than a pleasure to own.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-05-2007"}

All the challenges of the popular sport combined with the weird, wacky fun of Mario's world come together, for laughs and thrills.","reviewerName":"Kevbo","summary":"Great Baseball Title for Everyone.","reviewText":"Sure, it's another Mario sports game.  My biggest appreciation is that these games appeal to both genders.  (Guys typically like the competitive elements and the trash-talking opportunities, and the girls typically like the cute little characters and sounds.)As an avid lover of sports, but especially baseball and football (American), I found Mario Superstar Baseball to be a blast.  I've played it in the \"Story Mode\" (one player), and I've had an awesome time playing it with friends of mine.The women I know who have played the game prefer the Story Mode because if we go up against each other, I'm throwing off-speed pitches in deep counts, getting them to strike out.  I also rub it in their nose.  So they prefer to play when I am not there since I never go easy on them.But when I play against my guy friends, all the feel of the Mario games is present: great controls, great features, the Mario World, and above all else, variety.What makes the variety so wonderful in these Mario games is the ability to unlock characters who have unique abilities.  After you go through the motions to unlock them, you can't wait to use them in a game.  And it is nice to have such great balance and variety because then you don't have to argue with your friend over who gets which players on whose team.In terms of sheer baseball, Mario Superstar Baseball has it all.  I read reviews here defaming the controls and the ease of fielding.  If you have played most baseball video games, you will see that MSB actually ranks pretty high in controllability.  It is easy to find the ball in the outfield (the computer switches your active player for you and even camps you under the ball to make a play).  If you have a good head for the game of baseball, MSB won't let you down at all.  I also think that about most of the Mario sports titles: if you understand the game you are playing, the Mario World video game style will provide a different way to make it fun.So to close, if you don't like baseball, don't buy Mario Superstar Baseball just to see Mario and his cute friends with gloves and bats - you won't like it.  If you love baseball, competition, AND the Mario World theme, this game rocks, and I recommend it for anybody, all ages.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-08-2006"}

Just make sure to set the game to the hard setting (you can change it later). Otherwise it is just a button mash hack and slash. On hard you have to pause and give orders, set up formations, fall back and so on.The thing that blew me away was the presentation of this game. I've played a lot of \"create your hero\" games, but in this one, your character IS what you want them to be.You select the \"mood\" of the response and your character will then say something without you knowing exactly what it will be. It's pretty neat.What is extra nice is that all the voice work is TOP NOTCH and the world is very well developed.Another interesting thing is that your team may be one of the most socially dysfunctional ever.If that's not enough mental conflict, you can even try and romance one or more of them (yikes).The combat can get a little repetitive, but for the most part if one of your characters dies, the rest of the party is soon to follow, so you got to pay attention.I never played the original dragon age; they say that one had a super story.

More than a simple movie translation, this has earned its top-seller status on its own. Fans ofDoomandQuakewill recognize the first-person shooter perspective, but there the similarity ends. James Bond 007 has too much style to simply blast everything in sight and move to the next level. No, as 007, the player has a variety of different missions to perform, each with its own specific objectives. Each mission follows thefilmclosely, and so James must use stealth and cunning as much as brute force. But if you see a Kalashnikov rifle lying around, by all means pick it up.Controls are easy to master, which is impressive considering the variety of actions the onscreen hero can perform. James can run and walk at variable speeds, duck, pivot, hide, attach mines to enemy helicopters, block doors from opening, and more. The optional auto-aim feature is especially nice. Of course, James Bond is proficient in a wide variety of weapons. You get to use them all, from the trusty Walther PPK (with silencer) to double sets of full-auto machine guns.The game's faithful tribute to the Bond legacy includes briefing dossiers on each mission, complete with wisecracks from Q and flirtatious comments from Moneypenny. And the 3-D representation of locations and characters from the movie is very impressive. The Rareware team spent time on the set with digital cameras, and it shows.One of the distinguishing features of the game is the outstanding artificial intelligence of the enemies. When attacked, squads will rush to hit the alarm. If they make it, reinforcements come running. Enemy soldiers respond to being shot or blown up with chilling realism. According to Rareware, there are over 30 different animation routines that come into play, depending on where the soldier is hit. For those who prefer the challenge of human opponents, there are six clever multiplayer modes where up to four players can shoot it out, as teams or solo agents.With excellent gameplay, intelligence, and style,GoldenEye 007is a first-person shooter that'll keep you coming back for more.--Jeanne UyPros:Built-in save capability for up to 4 playersAuto-aim feature helps novice players feel like a sharpshooterRich, complex game world filled with detail and varietyGreat bonus missionsCons:Sometimes cinematic scenes for fulfilling mission objectives are a bit anticlimactic","reviewerName":"greg","summary":"the first, first person shooter i ever played","reviewText":"One of the games that made n64 so great, had graphics for the time, multiplayer all around fun and in my opinion one of the best games of it's time","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2012"}

The graphics do their job, the sound is excellent, and the story is decent. The battle system is a mix of party battle and ship battles, while a little lengthy and way too frequent, your wanting to play just to get to the next area. I haven't played a game like this in a long time, a game where you want to really explore the world rather than rush through a story. 4/5, random battles knock it off one point because they are obsolete.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-05-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000A0EFHY","reviewerName":"Aaron L. Shaw \"Casual Reviewer\"","summary":"WOWOWOWOWOW","reviewText":"Wow what a beautiful game.  I am very impressed by the graphics on this one.  But what about the gameplay.  It is very unique.  Most of the game you are a human running around in first person shooter mode.  This is pretty cool.  Sometimes you will have to look around in the environment to find things to use.  An example would be finding a spearlike object to hurl at a t-rex.  THis sounds like it would be tough, but it really isn't.  While you cock the spear with one hand, your other hand points to where you will throw the spear.  THis brings up a very unique aspect of the game.  There is no health meter, no reticle for shooting, no ammo readout.  NO nothing.  You are IN the game just as a real person would be.  This helps with the immersion in the game.  But what about the Kong Levels?  They are way fun and way short.  they are probably only about %25 of the game.  They are fun though.  A little clumsy on the controls, but fun.  All in all this is a good game.  Not great, but pretty good.  You might wait a month and get it half priced used on ebay.  Whatever the case, you will be pretty happy with your purchase.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-30-2005"}

With hundreds of customizable cars and hundreds of performance and visual upgrades, this game really sets a high standard for future racing sims.  There are so many features in this game that it's actually difficult to list them all.  Buy, win and/or purchase cars from online XBOX Live auctions.  Customize and race, sell or auction your car when you're done with it.  Store dozens of cars in your garage, customize the look and auction it with a locked visual package so your personalized car will be out there with someone else racing it.  If you get tired of racing, hire a driver to race for you for a portion of the winnings.  Then sit back and watch to see how your car does.  Very detailed custom tuning options allow you to tune your car to your specific driving technique.  In game physics are fairly amazing, but seem to lack when it comes to crashes.  Loading time can also be a little long at points as well.  All in all the game is pretty awesome.  Give it a try and I think you'll be pretty impressed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-10-2008"}
{"product_name":"B0041OWQTO","reviewerName":"Hunter D","summary":"Lots of fun!","reviewText":"Purchased the version with same cover as picture without any mentions of Voucher, which I've seen those at local stores. Gameplay is pretty typical FPS stuff, but equipment and abilities are not new to this genre but well implemented into game. I think the gameplay is much improved versus similar games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series on PC.The cell-shade graphics works well after spending some time in the game world. The main problem is cartoon like graphics takes away from fear effect of common 3D graphics engine like UE3, CE3, etc. Monsters just don't look as scary so the effect isn't as effective on the gamer's emotions such as Doom 3, F.E.A.R.,Metro 2033 or S.T.A.L.K.E.R.S.. The game's frame-rates does stutter and dip quite noticeably low, but never for long instances.The game world consist of open big area exploration with barrier off zones. Exploration can reward rare equipments that can make gamer more effective sooner. Leveling up gives players points to put into ability like attributes. The game play is quest based and majority of side quests can be completed in any order. Primary main quest(s) needs to be completed first to unlock others. Can be a lengthy game experience depending on gamer.Local split-screen co-op with different PSN accounts is great and a much appreciated rare occurrence on PS3. Online play is based on host's current progress while keeping your stats and equipment. Overall, very fun and entertaining long initial campaign. Haven't even tried the add-on DLCs yet, which are included on the disc to be installed. Definitely recommended for gamers looking for lengthy fun action adventure game experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-09-2011"}
