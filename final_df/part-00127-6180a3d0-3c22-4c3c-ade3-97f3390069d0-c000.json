{"product_name":"B006VB2UNM","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Fulkerson","summary":"What a major disappointment","reviewText":"I can ignore the misgivings of this franchise no more.  EA has made no qualms about their complete disinterest in making games that satisfy the people who buy their games, but Madden 2013 sets a new benchmark for the scary disconnect they have from the individuals who have made them the gaming juggernaut they are today.  Through frustrating gameplay, a mind-bogglingly bad menu system, and their constant insistence in changing things that don't need to be changed, this game pretty much solidifies the choice to never purchase another Madden game again.I'll get the few good things out of the way first since there are so few to mention.  Graphically, Madden still looks pristine, and the faces of the players look exactly like their true-to-life counterparts.  You can tell a lot of time has been spent designing realistic tones in the players and stadiums, and that doesn't go unappreciated.Another nice new addition is the commentary from Jim Nantz and Phil Simms.  They are the best football commentators out there, and getting rid of Gus Johnson received a huge sigh of relief from me.  Oddly, though, Simms and Nantz are constantly stammering and saying \"uhhh\" and \"ummmm\", and generally sounding confused with their own inane thoughts.  My guess is that EA told them to talk like idiots to play down to the simple morons who don't usually play football video games, but it still sounds dumb to hear Simms stumbling so much when he never does in a real life football game.Generally, the game plays pretty much the same, as well.  They added this new Infinity engine which really adds nothing to the game.  When you tackle someone it's supposed to be more sensitive to contact, but all it really offers are moments of amusement more than reality.  For instance, once you take a player down, he'll get up and bounce into a defender and start spazzing out.  Arms and legs will flail around and it's kind of funny for a second, but then it dawns on you that it has nothing to do with the real world.  A big neutral stance when it comes to the Infinity engine.Pretty much everything else with this game is a headache.  The same old stupid weirdness abounds in this game with the flying linebackers making interceptions, suction tackling and blocking, and magical moonwalking safeties traversing half the field in a millisecond in order to make a one-handed interception while hanging upside down from half a shoelace.  It's frigging ridiculous, it's existed forever, and they STILL haven't fixed it.  But guess what?  They've added a all new and IMPROVED annoyance this year!  That's right, if you needed one more reason to be frustrated with this franchise, it comes in the form of receivers dropping passes.  I would say, conservatively, that receivers will drop 1 out of every 4 passes.  Your QB will be stroking it, putting the ball on the numbers, evading the pass rush, doing everything he can to get the ball to the receiver, and your guy will flat out drop the pass.  And it's not like the receiver will be under heavy coverage.  Your receiver will drop a ball while being wide open with nothing but open field in front of him.  This phenomena has never happened to me, by the way, in 20 years of playing this franchise.  I tried a little experiment after dropping 3 passes in a row and jacked all of my passing and receiving skills up to 100.  I caught more often, but still dropped passes, and for no reasons at all.  It seems as if EA has decided that passing is too easy in this game, so they decided to make it arbitrarily difficult by dumbing down the receivers and giving them banana hands.Did I mention the flying linebackers?  After several years of seeing this ridiculous move of the MLB jumping 20 feet in the air to make an INT you think I'd be used to it, but it's back this year and with a major vengeance.  Pretty much ALL defensive players possess bionic strength, and you have to be cool with a defensive end who weights 350 pounds to be able to jump on a dime and intercept your pass.  And the magical third quarter dominance of the CPU is still in full effect.  In all Maddens of the past ten years, you pretty much have no chance in creating any offense in the third quarter, and all of my interceptions happen at this point of the game.  Your tight end will be wide open in the flat, and the safety will just appear from nowhere to make a miraculous interception.  Unbelievably annoying, and incredibly unrealistic.The menu system is AWFUL.  Each time I start up a saved game I have to go into the clunky menu, deselect the \"gameflow\" option, rearrange the depth chart, simulate each preseason game instead of just simulating the entire preseason, blah blah blah.  The menu system is so cumbersome you'll want to take a nap after trying to navigate through it all.The most mind-numbingly flabbergasting aspect of this entire franchise, though, is the tweaking of the things that don't need to be tweaked.  This year Madden has done something inexcusable in my book, and I will never return to this franchise again because of it: NO FRANCHISE MODE.  I sat there dumbfounded when I first popped the game into the Xbox to partake in what I have partaken in for years.  Franchise mode is the only reason I play this dopey game, and they have completely discarded it.  Oh sure, EA will tell you that Franchise mode is now \"Coach's Career\" mode or some nonsense, but guess what, EA?  I WANT FRANCHISE MODE.  I DON'T WANT COACH'S CAREER MODE.  What the hell is this??  It's very simple, EA: I pay you for what I play every year, you deliver.  How is that hard to understand?  I sat there for a half an hour trying to find SOMETHING that corresponded with franchise mode, and it all could have been avoided if they had named it.....you guessed it....FRANCHISE MODE.  I'm a college-educated individual with a Master's degree, and I couldn't find the damn thing for 30 minutes.  Why should I have to?  WHY does EA mess with things when they don't need to be messed with?  Because of change?  Is it that important to change something that isn't broken to the point where you lose faithful fans of the Madden series?  LEAVE IT ALONE, EA!  For the past 13 years I have bought this game knowing that, at the very least, I can flip to Franchise mode and it will be there.  I've had this game for two days and I still can't believe they decided to remove it.  Also, if you're a gamer who likes playing franchise mode with a friend, forget about it, because it's GONE.  That's right, EA has waved bye-bye to a major part of its audience by taking away something that has been a staple in their series for years.  I just signed in to the EA network before playing the game, and a window popped up saying, \"looking for Franchise Mode?\", so it's clear there has been an outcry of annoyed gamers.  Sorry EA, but you tried to get cute with a beloved aspect of your game, and you will now pay the price.  The people who play your game aren't stupid, and they will not forget this!Having said all this, Coach's Career mode is kind of like Franchise Mode, only you can't edit, there is no fantasy draft, and basically none of the aspects that were consistently present in past iterations of Madden.  EA will fall over themselves selling the Coach's Career mode to you, but don't be fooled.  IT'S NOT THE SAME.EA has made their final mistake to me as a consumer, and I will no longer support them by buying their products.  Last year they started charging extra for golf courses in the Tiger Woods series, and I stopped buying that game.  Earlier this year, they charged extra for an episode in Mass Effect 3 that should have been part of the original game, and I will never play that series again because of it.  Now, they get wise with their Madden audience and start poking around with tried and true advances that brought gamers back for more each year.  I'm done looking the other way with the Madden series, and look forward to ANY other football video game that comes down the pike.  It's highly frustrating because I do love this series.  What other options do we have as gamers?  If you want to play with the updated rosters, you have to play Madden.  EA has a monopoly on this sport in the video game world, and they mess with their fans simply because they can.  They have our money, and now they're laughing at us on top of it all.  EA's cynicism toward their fans makes me ill, and it is unprecedented in the gaming world.  The fact is, the Madden series topped out a few years ago, and these designers are completely bankrupt for new ideas.  They feel like they have to change things up each year because it's glaringly obvious they have no wit or ideas of their own.  So they take things way, rename other things, and give us rehashed visions for top dollar.  Not anymore, EA!  You just lost a faithful fan of 20 years, and I'm never coming back!","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-31-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00BMFIXT2","description":"","reviewerName":"Lucas","summary":"Best gameplay for AC yet","reviewText":"First off, the gameplay of this game is absolutely amazing. They have the perfect balance between land and sea that I never got tired with either one. In previous installments I got sick of running around forever. In AC4 I just hop in the Jackdaw and take off on my sea voyages. The scenery is absolutely beautiful, also the best in the AC series. Instead of the dull colors of previous games, this one is set in the Caribbean with a beautiful sea and lush forests.So, as I said, the gameplay and scenery is the best yet. But there is one problem with the game, which is why I take off 1 star. I felt no connection with the storyline or characters, especially Edward. After the events that ended AC3 they had a perfect chance to start over and take the series down a more interesting path. I don't feel like they capitalized on that fresh start. The main character, Edward Kenway, isn't nearly as bad as Connor Kenway in terms of likability and connection, but didn't start to touch the connection myself and most other people felt with Ezio.Overall, buy this game! It's a beautiful game. You'll spend hours getting lost on the sea in your ship and enjoy every minute of it.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-07-2014"}

Granted, there are times when I feel like I'm stuck taking a fitness test more often than I'd like (as there's no way around it - if you've got the game in and are ready for a workout, and it just happens to be your fitness test day, you HAVE to do the test before the game will let you access your workout). Even still, though, it's nice to have the game help you gauge your progress, and keep track of your information, regardless of how basic it may be in comparison to other fitness games out there.The graphics illustrating Maya, the fitness coach, won't win any awards, but the backgrounds are nicely done, and, I find, often soothing. As you progress through your workouts, more music and workout setting options are unlocked, which may prove to be a motivator for you. I find that, with this workout game, I DO get a good workout, and work up quite a sweat. I also find that my muscles ARE sore the next day and the day after. As with any fitness game or gym workout, you'll only get out of it what you put into it, and I enjoy being in the privacy of my own home and STILL getting a good workout in without having to leave to fight others for the machines I want to use.I own EA Sports Active (the well-known Bob Greene Wii game), Wii Fit Plus, Gold's Gym Cardio Workout (another favorite, as far as upper body workouts go), Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party, and Rayman Raving Rabbids TV Party (which, if you set it to Expert and use your Balance Board, you can get a great and SUPER fun workout from in the Dancing With Dweebs game). This game is still one of my favorites, even though it's simple and basic.If you're looking for a good workout game at a good price, I think this one's worth every penny that you'll spend on it, as long as you're willing to push yourself enough to get a quality workout in.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-19-2009"}

Armed with her four enchanted guns known as Scarborough Fair, she battles both monstrous behemoths and angelic enemies. By combining special magic attacks, summoning primal forces and unleashing devastating weaponry, she impressively punishes anyone who gets in her way. From its fluid and intuitive combat system to its gripping story line, Bayonetta is one action thriller that won't disappoint.Unleash your powersView larger.Amazing graphicsView larger.","reviewerName":"Armando N. Roman","summary":"A little polish could go a long way.","reviewText":"Bayonetta is the kind of game that I want to like. It has a memorable heroine, lots of action, a story that doesn't make sense so it doesn't matter if you skip cutscenes, and the challenge doesn't suddenly spike at a certain point in the game. At the same time, many aspects of the game feel rushed and a huge patch is needed to make the ps3 version here play a little bit closer to the 360 version. That's not console fanboyism either, folks- there have been many comparisons between the two, and unfortunately, ps3 owners got the short end of the stick this time around. Before playing this game, if you can go online with your ps3, do so and get the patch for Bayonetta. It'll take a while to download, but makes the frequent load times a bit easier to handle. It's just too bad that the patch doesn't make the story more interesting, or completely delete a certain Space Harrier-esque level.You play as Bayonetta, one of the last surviving witches who wakes up in the current times after being put into a deep sleep hundreds of years ago. A deal with the devil was made, and Bayonetta has to slay angels in order to walk the Earth. If she can't keep up her end of the bargain, she gets pulled down under, and I'm not talking about Australia. At first you just run around, taking out angels like it's just another day at the office, but Bayonetta soon bumps into another witch that she knew before her memory seemingly got erased. But it doesn't stop there: you also encounter a little girl that refers to Bayonetta as her mother, and a cry baby journalist that has a grudge against Bayonetta for killing his father years ago. Truth be told, you're better off skipping the story and just playing for the [mostly] fun action and huge boss fights. Gameplay is similar to that of the Devil May Cry or newer Ninja Gaiden games, where you can do crazy combos on the enemies. Slain angels leave behind halos, which is currency that can be used at the Gates of Hell. Here, you can buy new techniques, accessories, items, costumes and alternate appearances for your weapons. Bayonetta has her signature handguns both in her hands, and on her shoes and later on gets a katana, whip and fire/lightning gauntlets. The weapons can be changed in the middle of a combo, allowing the player to come up with some pretty insane moves.Where Bayonetta shines is the combat. Being able to change weapons whenever you want is a great feature, but it doesn't make things any easier- you still have to watch out for the enemies. Just like how dodging and blocking was the key to survival in the first new Ninja Gaiden game a few years ago, the same applies here. If you dodge an attack at the last second, Witch Time is initiated. This slows down the action for a few seconds, and pretty much lets you go nuts on the foe without having to worry about being hit. Some battles with both bosses AND regular enemies will drag on unless you're either really good at pulling off the heavier combos, or make use of Witch Time regularly. Attack with the equipped weapon by using the triangle button, kick with circle, and shoot with square. And you know what? There's more. Bayonetta's hair is a weapon in itself, and can decimate enemies if a certain combo is done, dealing even more damage. She can also execute Torture Attacks if you have enough energy in the magic gauge, which do the most damage to angels. Did you ever think you'd see hair turn into an iron maiden or guillotine? I sure didn't. I also love the character of Bayonetta, and had a blast seeing her reaction to situations as well as hearing her one-liners. Despite the boring story, I'd usually at least hear what she had to say. And how can you not love a hero that gets naked for her strongest attacks, and has a nice hip swing when she walks? It's just a bonus to her intelligence and coolness. The other thing I can give the developers credit for is really going into detail about the angels. You can look up information about each one in the menu, and it's pretty fascinating to read up on some of these guys. It almost makes you feel bad about killing creatures that stand for good things when you find out that an angel who helps those in need just got devoured by a tarantula made of hair. They sure don't hold back in showing how Bayonetta just obliterates each one of them...especially the bosses.But while combat is fun, the rest of the game definitely needed polishing. It got old fighting the same couple of enemies over and over, and I was surprised I was still fighting some of the same ones in the final levels. Shouldn't some new guys have shown up at some point? How many times did we need to fight the fire/lightning angel dudes, or those dog-like ones? Even with the patch installed, there's noticeable slowdown when many enemies are on the screen. Even worse is the one-two second loading needed just to bring up the basic game menu. Does it really need to load every time I want to use a healing item, or simply pause the game? Something that really bugged me was the stupid decision to have certain cutscenes play out in stills with a film border around them. Was it that hard to animate the characters talking? Why the heck are we staring at characters not doing anything while the dialogue plays out? How come so many other cutscenes are animated properly? It doesn't make sense! If this was supposed to be for style, it sure doesn't work. This was one of the main reasons why I gave up and ended up skipping them most of the time. The other reason was that I just didn't care. Ok, we get it- Bayonetta and her rival knew eachother long ago but something happened between them. Got it. Now this journalist dude keeps showing up without adding ANYTHING to the story. Great. With how much the guy whined about his dad at every opportunity, I couldn't help but wonder if we were going to get a scene of him typing up a journal entry ala Doogie Howser about his angst. A lot of character models are also dated and look like something from an arcade in the late 90s...notably the journalist dude. There are also two levels thrown in later on in the game that have Bayonetta riding a motorcycle and a missile. The motorcycle one could've been fun, but I couldn't tell what I was doing for the first 5 minutes, yet got through without being hit once. The key problem in this part is the positioning of the camera being so close to Bayonetta (wow, 'never thought I could complain about that). Luckily this segment doesn't go on for too long. The missile level however, my god...I felt like I was playing that stage for over an hour, when it was closer to 20 minutes. It's a tribute to Space Harrier, complete with remixed music, and isn't even a fraction of the fun that Space Harrier was. I'm sure whoever thought this was a good idea is the same person responsible for all the Sonic games that've come out over the past 10 years.If you want a mindless action game with some style, I suggest Bayonetta for a weekend. It can be completed in under 8 hours and at the current price, you won't feel ripped off. The game just feels like a long demo of something better that should've come out, but didn't. At the same time, they managed to make this be one of the few action games that rewards you for getting better and learning the battle system. I'd love to see a sequel as long as more care goes into it. Until then, I'd be fine just having a screensaver of Bayonetta walking away from the camera but not going anywhere.Swingy-swingy-swingy...","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-01-2012"}

The Pokemon alone are so immensely helpful in making words make sense.* Perseverance - when you lose the battle, it's simple: you just come back and try again until you achieve the mission or catch the Pokemon you want.

If you grew up with NES, SNES, Playstation, PS2  etc  as a kid you definitely remember the Sly games and probably owned them at one point.  All 3 games were classics on the PS2 in the adventure category just like God of War 1 and 2 were classics in the action category.If you never got the chance to play the 3 sly cooper games,  or simply wish to replay them all over again in HD this is a great package.  $39.99 is a tad steep it seems for 3 PS2 era games but  you end up with 3 PS2 era \"classics\" that even on their own could topple a $60 current gen release.  Each game is fun with a nice bit of humor thrown in -  each game can take upwards of 8-12 hrs to complete also  so you are looking at 24-36hrs of gameplay hereThe Games themselves have a very unique feel to them --  You sneak around levels gathering clues, coins, avoiding traps/security systems to reach your goal.  Along the way you can crack safes and get the jump on some baddies.  The games are quite kid friendly yet just like little big planet, has enough there to keep even a veteran gamer happily glued to it; a nice mystique about it.The Mini-games are linked to the MOVE system (but I simply used a PS3 controller) and are pretty much silly.  You can tell the mini-games were just tossed in there for Sucker-Punch to test out the MOVE system before adapting it to major titles (like inFamous 2).  **** This game is not 100% move compatible. Only the mini-games work with MOVE ****The remastered HD graphics look amazing.  Despite some roughness,  Sly looks great in 720p.  The game plays very smooth with no graphic hick-ups , frame rate issues or tearing you might see in a simple texture upscale.  Very professionally handled upgrade to 720p** Overall if you heard about sly and never checked it out - or simply wish to relive a classic you once owned this package is perfect.  The price is fairly reasonable since you automatically know you are getting 3 classic, A+ games  instead of paying $60 for perhaps a bust.  The Sly Cooper series is definitely a unique series of games that will provide you with hours upon hours of fun , laughs and not once feel as if the game is being repetitiveEdit (12/10/10)After re-reading my review I might as well throw in what scores I'd give these 3 games and the mini-games.Sly 1 - 97%  a great game for people of all ages and brings a unique look at being a thiefSly 2 - 86%  still a great game for all ages, but doesn't seem nearly as memorable gameplay wise (an overload of mini-games maybe)Sly 3 - 94%  Combining what made Sly 1 and Sly 2 so great, Sly 3 fires on all cylinders making for a well paced adventure.Sly Mini-Games -  21%  yeah that's right. In fact I'm being nice about it.  They use Move technology but honestly, you'll play these once probably to get the trophies (which can be done on your first play w/ a regular controller) and never revisit them again.

Baldur's Gate was a truly landmark game and this is as close to a spiritual successor to the Baldur's Gate titles as is likely possible in today's gaming market.You are a member of the Grey Wardens, a warrior group trained to sacrifice themselves to dispatch the Darkspawn, who are invading the land of Ferelden due to the Blight powered by the Archdemon. True, the story SOUNDS patently lame, but it really is enjoyable and deep. You have a party of four (out of a group of a dozen or so) that are interchangeable, and unlike many games, actually fairly self-sufficient. In fact. in some cases, they can help you immensely and almost win fights for you.All of your characters have interests and they are not all complimentary. Do something to please one member and you could easily alienate another one. You can even possibly cause party members to leave due to your actions. The motivations of everybody, however, are actually logical. You don't have to wonder WHY they believe certain things.The combat is pretty easy to pick up, but has more depth than most RPG titles. You can mix and match battle arts, use poisons, etc. You can also eventually lead armies, which is quite beneficial.All in all, the game is great. Visually, it is unadultered crap, but you won't notice it after a short bit of time. I dislike the lack of humor --- the story tries so hard to be heavy --- but the story itself is engrossing and, again, that everybody is a believable person makes the story so much easier to tolerate.A great classic RPG and one of the best examples of Western RPG.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-23-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00000DMAX","description":"Mario Kart 64, one of the first games released for the Nintendo 64  platform, is an updated translation of the very popularSuper Mario Kartfor the  Super NES (SNES). And while the game clearly takes full advantage of the graphics  power and speed of the N64, a few components that made the original so compelling  have been left out of this release.Still, Nintendo's expertise at sucking players into the game world is strongly evident, andMario Kart 64offers enough challenges to keep players (especially casual  gamers) entertained. Placing a familiar Nintendo personality behind the wheel of a  sputtering kart powered by a 50, 100, or 150-cc engine, the game lets players race  computerized opponents or up to four other players on a variety of well-designed tracks.  Because karts lack the power and speed of race cars, drivers must focus on collecting  power-ups and nonlethal weapons rather than negotiating hairpin turns on two wheels.  Grabbing and using on-track items is the heart of the game's fun: a strategically-placed  banana peel sends the unlucky victim into a spin, nailing an opponent with a turtle shell  launches their vehicle skyward, and a rocket provides a quick boost to near-breakneck  speeds, if only for a moment.The multiplayer mode provides enormously chaotic fun for up to four players--flip it on  at a party and watch the guests congregate around the screen.--Eric TwelkerPros:Well-designed tracksSimple controlsStrong multiplayer appealCons:Computerized opponents sometimes pull off questionable feats","reviewerName":"Robert Evans \"Robert\"","summary":"One of funnest games on the N64","reviewText":"Mario Kart 64 Launched with the N64 and it sure did good with the sales but Ultimatley this is disapointing.

It combines driving elements, stealth, and combat.  This game tries, and for the most part succeeds at taking elements of GTA style 3rd person gaming with Assassins creed style stealth and movement. The learning curve is steep for this game: figuring out how to seamlessly move and hack cameras, cell phones, or spike strips takes a bit of getting used to. But once you get the hang of it, the gameplay is very satisfying: especially when you use focus time to pull of headshots and hacking skills to cause massive explosions for a huge kill combo.Much like GTA the game has a main set of missions and various side missions you can complete. Like an RPG, completing side missions and regular missions unlock skill points which can be used to level up your character using the skill tree. Broadly, your skills can improve in combat, driving, hacking, and crafting skills. Which skills you unlock will depend on your playing style - although the skill tree never collapses or narrows so you can unlock all the skills eventually.While the gameplay is really satisfying and the RPG-type progressions is great, the story and graphics keep this from being a 5-star game. The story requires quite a bit of suspension of disbelief and plot holes abound. The graphics, sadly, are pretty bad. Most of the characters are unrecognizable blurs at even a medium distance on screen and there's not much resolution even closer in.

Based on my experience with those products, I decided to split this review into three portions, each focusing on a primary element of the G27. I tested the G27 using SimBin's GTR2, Race 07 WTCC, and GTR Evolution in Vista Business 64-bit edition.Pedals-----------------------------------------------------The G27 pedals offer limited adjustments via the use of a 2.5mm hex key/allen wrench. By removing the 2 screws of any of the pedals, the user can change the spacing of the pedals to suit the size of their feet or for easier heel-toe downshifts. By comparison, on modern cars, the brake pedal and throttle pedal tend to be spaced so far apart that it becomes difficult to execute a proper heel-toe downshift.The actual pedals are made out of stainless steel and the edges are all deburred. The round \"friction dots\" are actually just part of the plastic backing plates. They're not actually rubber or polyurethane like the ones used on real cars. The angles of the pedals are rather steep, as it was uncomfortable for me to use for long durations. The user must adjust their seat and desk/table for a proper driving posture.  The pedals are also sitting well in the middle of the base unit which can present problems on certain desk arrangements.The resolution of the pedals is very crisp in my driving games. I could tip the throttle as needed to control a drift or limit the amount of wheelspin. My DFGT pedals started to act weird after a year and didn't offer the same amount of sensitivity or resolution. Overall, the G27 pedals are a slight improvement over the ones used in the G25 mainly due to the available pedal spacing adjustment. The only recommendations I'd make to Logitech would be to push the pedals farther back if possible, use rubber/polyurethane dots for better grip (and realism), and *maybe* consider including a dead-pedal platform to rest the clutch foot.Shifter-----------------------------------------------------My biggest complaint about the G25 shifter was that it felt like a toy shifter. There was an excessive amount of play and it didn't feel realistic at all. The G27 shifter removes the option to use it as a sequential, but otherwise keeps everything else almost the same. There's quite a few buttons and even a directional pad to offer various on-the-fly adjustments while racing.The G27 still does not provide enough resistance in each gear while shifting through the gates. As-is, the G27 shifter feels about the same resistance as any car that is either idling or shut off. You can easily shift through the gears effortlessly. While driving any car that has a synchronized manual gearbox, there's quite a bit of effort to go into the gears at wide open throttle because it takes time for the synchros to match speeds. With the G27, you're easily clicking through the gears at WOT which doesn't feel right. It just feels too sterile. In addition, shifting into reverse is quite difficult at times due to the need for pushing down the shifter.As many drivers know, almost every manual gearbox has a slightly different way of shifting into reverse especially with the 6 speed gearboxes. Some require you to push down the shifter and move to the left gate of 1st gear, some require lifting a lockout ring, etc... From a design standpoint, I don't see how Logitech could have done it differently and still satisfy a large number of users - it works fine as-is, but it takes some getting used to. However, I can tell you this - the G27 shifter feels a lot better than the actual shifter used on the 2008-09 Mazdaspeed3!The only recommendation I'd make about the shifter is to increase the amount of resistance through each gear to simulate what the real synchronized gearboxes go through when you're racing. As-is, it feels fine for normal driving, it just feels a bit too sterile for speed shifting or powershifting.Wheel-----------------------------------------------------The best wheel I've used has to be the Driving Force GT. It's not as sleek as the G25/G27 wheel, and it has a poorly implemented \"paddle shifter\" setup. However, the numerous buttons, knobs, horn button, etc... work very well for a lot of racing games. The red knob resembles the Manettino knob used on the Ferrari's.  The G27 improves on the G25 by including a few more buttons, the use of helical cut gearing, a LED tachometerThe stainless steel used for the wheel itself and the paddle shifters is high quality. I did not see any blemishes nor did I find any burrs. They deburred or radiused all of the edges to prevent cuts, and the paddles feel extremely sturdy.The additional buttons come in handy, but I wish they added more buttons and include a few dials/knobs ala the Driving Force GT. I recall an interview they conducted at Logitech where the Driving Force GT designer said they applied lessons learned from the G25 to make the DFGT wheel even better. It looks like whoever designed the G27 ignored the lessons learned or wasn't able to include them on the G27 for whatever reason.The helical cut gearing quiets down the unit when you steer. The traditional spur gear design allows for better torque handling but are extremely noisy and makes your steering wheel sound like a cheap toy. The G27's helical cut gearing is almost silent and gives much better feedback. I was able to tell exactly when my 550 Maranello was over-rotating on the track and able to correct it rapidly. The G25 and Driving Force GT feel vague by comparison.The LED tach indicator is a great idea in theory, but it sits too far down for me to even use it while driving my sim games. The LEDs aren't bright enough and the adjustment is not available through the profiler software. For Race07 and GTR Evolution, I had to go into the profile.rcs (profile is the name of your profile) file and change the G27 LED Range Low setting down to about 0.20 so that it would actually light up at lower RPMs. This file is located in your Documents\\SimBin\\Race07\\Userdata\\Controlset\\ folder. However, it still maxes out around 5500 RPM. It would be nice if there was a simpler way to tell it that I want each LED to represent 2000, 4000, or 6000 RPM or whatever resolution I desire, or perhaps tell it directly what the limits are and let it sort out the resolution. The Reprogrammable Performance Display in the 2008-2010 Chevrolet Cobalt SS Turbocharged allows you to change the min and max for the tachometer VU/bar meter and it works beautifully. The G27 LED indicator just doesn't work as cleanly, and its hardly visible to me unless I look down at my wheel. Some users may have special seating arrangements that move the wheel higher so their peripheral vision picks up the LEDs, but they're not very bright to begin with. A setup similar to the BMW Performance Steering Wheel works much better where the bars are integrated into the wheel itself at the top 2 quadrants (9 to 12, and 12 to 3).I realize that a lot of people tweak the FFB settings and steering ratios to get the right feel. Logitech's documentation is very poor when it comes to this. I wish they would release some recommended settings for a few games so it eliminates the guess-work. PC users aren't strangers to tweaking and adjustments, but Logitech would attract a larger group of users if they made things simpler (like the G9x, set and forget, no drivers needed). Anyhow, the settings I normally use:**Profiler - 540-630 degree lock, FFB enabled, 100%, enable centering at 0% force, allow game to change**SimBin games - 50% sensitivity for everything, no speed sensitivity. FFB -  maximum setting, 50%-75% force, reverse effects**SimBin cars - set a steering ratio for about 15-18:1. Calculate steering ratio: [Wheel rotation/2] / steering lock. The wheel rotation is the # of degrees you set in the Profiler, and the steering lock is the adjustment setting within the game for your car. A 630* rotation with a steering lock of 21 degrees gives you a ratio of about 15:1, which is about the same as the real Nissan GT-R and 2005-2009 Mustang GT. See what I mean about tweaking and adjustments? I'm not an Apple fanatic, but Steve Jobs would never let this fly with an Apple product. It'd be a bit more user friendly. Granted, it's not easy to achieve this particular goal because of different racing game interfaces although it'd be something to aspire towards.The cable management remains tricky on the G27. I had problems keeping all of the cables tidy on the G25 and the G27 wasn't any better. The wires kept popping out of the guides, so I used clear tape to \"seal\" them in and make it neater. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to detach everything in case I need to use the top of the desk. I'd have to take off all 3 units at the same time and that becomes a hassle if I had to do it a few times a day. It's best to set up your G27 on a semi-permanent basis. The A/C adapter isn't too shabby on the G27. Instead of being a huge brick that hogs up 8 spaces on a surge suppressor, it's similar to the A/C adapters used on laptops.Pros: Some definite improvements over the G27. Solid construction, sturdy feel, the best simulator-grade hardware you can buy that is also affordable.Cons: Shifter needs to have a bit more resistance at each gear to simulate what the gearbox is doing while powershifting or speed shifting (very abusive on a real synchronized manual gearbox), the pedals could use a bit more grip (e.g. rubber/polyurethane dots), cable management can be a nightmare if you expect to use the desk for normal projects/work as well as gamingOverall: A solid 4 out of 5 stars. I'd give it 4.5 just because it was a worthwhile improvement over the G25, but I still think there's room for improvement like Manettino knobs and more buttons on the wheel itself.UPDATE: 2-27-2010I didn't think of this at first, but you can move the shifter over to the left of the wheel to simulate RH drive cars (Japan, Europe, Australia). Then when you're in the mood for LH drive, move the shifter to the right of the wheel. I also used my Brother P-Touch 1880 to print a bunch of thermal labels to identify the functions of the various buttons in my racing sims.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-31-2009"}

An obvious step up in fact.  Enemies and obstacles are twice as aggressive.  Maybe it's just me but I feel the music isn't nearly as good as the first two MM games.  In fact MM4 and 5 have significantly more interesting theme music as well.Again, just like my experience with the other MM games in the series that aren't MM2, Mega Man 3 will be remembered for being yet *another* game in the series that had a challenge too overwhelming for me a youngster.  I believe I completed one stage and that's it.  This would have been back in the early 90's.  It's a shame I felt the game was too hard back then and gave up.  Nowadays I can approach any kind of challenge with open arms and play it despite how many times I'll probably lose.What makes this game so hard are the boss fights, and a few of the stages as well (such as the first portion of Gemini Man's stage- I can't tell you HOW many times those fireballs knocked me into a nearby bottomless pit, ugh!).  These boss fights are much MUCH faster and target Mega Man more precisely than the boss fights in the rest of the MM games.  This means you better be prepared to walk into the battle well-equipped!  If not, well, kiss your robotic buns goodnight, haha.  The trade off is that the part where you have to re-fight the 8 bosses before the final Wily confrontation can be finished in several seconds if you go into the battles completely certain which weapon is weak against said boss.Rush the dog is awesome.  He can boost Mega Man to higher areas or glide Mega Man across the screen away from all danger below.  He's very convenient for a game like this.  I also notice in one stage with bubbles that it was probably an influence for Bubble Crab's stage from Mega Man X2.  Overall, great game with a big challenge- it takes skill and a whole lot of patience to master these older Mega Man games.  Actually it takes skill and patience just to figure out the proper order of the stages/bosses, which helps ease the challenge a bit.  Great game though.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2012"}

Just know up front that there are long load times for a 2011 game even loaded to the hard drive. I do not get the graphic glitches that other speak about though and the game loads large sections at a time. The graphics are definitely 1st gen 360 and sometimes on par with Half-life 2 as a measuring stick. It is definitely better then anything before that. The difference being that this game has a 1999 feel to it. It is definitely old school and that is what has been advertised since the beginning. There is no reason to expect this game to be anything like a current title. The first thing I thought about when playing is this game is a cross between Duke 3D and Half-life. there is definitely a high amount of inspiration from Half-life 1&2. I am not saying that level of quality but it has the feel of it. For old school hard core fans this game will be a treat to play though. Just remember that is what you are getting. Rent it, buy it, wait for a price drop or whatever you want to do. I would definitely play through it. This game is full on Duke and all his one liners which truly made me laugh. The combat feels good to me and I like the pacing of the game. Dont rush through the game there is a lot of nostalgia in place. Grab a drink, sit back and take a trip down memory lane.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-15-2011"}

Took me about 10 hours to play. The combat was a bit generic, and the story wasn't that great, but combining all the powers into the platforming was a lot of fun. The combat was a breeze as well. The two challenge arenas (one from uplay, the other for beating the game) were also pretty fun, but combined only took about 12 minutes of play time to beat. For the 10 dollar price tag, this game is certainly worth it. My favorite part would have to be the platforming, which could occasionally get frustrating at the parts where you needed to avoid spikes and such.

The game saves automatically and there seems to be no way to restart a specific chapter. The automatic checkpoint is not your last checkpoint, but puts you in a room with no exits. This is a room you passed by before, only both doors are now locked. I restarted, rebooted, but nothing changes this. The only option left is to restart the game and replay the 11 hours.This is too bad, because the game itself is probably one of the better POP to come up lately. I don't mind replaying it sometime, but I do mind replaying it on these terms.Even with this bug, I would have rated this higher than 1 star, but with Warrior Within having a similar issue, this is really sloppy work from the developer, especially for a $60 game.How to avoid the bug: in the last chapter, there is a long section where you have to jump from one vulture to another, same as you did in the other chapters. At the end of this section, you have to make solid the block you need to land on. Try avoid falling and restarting in this area and will probably be ok once the game saves again.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-22-2010"}

If there was anything I was afraid of it would be that they'd start turning Kratos into a more caring and sympathetic hero as sequels sometimes do. They did the right thing. Kratos is still as uncaring for others as he always was, killing anyone including begging innocents to further his ambitions. This is the most impressive franchise to grace any system in a very long time.There are some games that are just really good games.And then there are some games that will forever change an entire genre of games. The God of War franchise easily slips into this category of infamy.After thinking long and hard to make the difficult decision over which of the two was better I ultimately still like the first one best, but God of War II makes it very hard to determine which is the favorite which says a whole hell of a lot.

An airborne division of the PLA lands to claim the island as the sovereign possession of the People&rsquo;s Republic. Russia turns to the US for support aid and they&rsquo;re quick to respond.

With a wealth of weapons and vehicles available, engagements can play out very differently depending on tactics and the pros and cons of chosen armaments. The game features set missions as well as quick fight, fire team engagement and several multiplayer modes for varied gameplay.

Nonimowse. \"bomber214\"","summary":"Massive potential, just plain not fun or enjoyable","reviewText":"Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is an ultra-tactical shooter that has you managing several elements on varying battlefields through out a developing story arc set in the South Pacific (if I recall correctly).  The backdrop for the game is a war fueled, ironically, by a lack of oil resources.The mission variety is immense, as are the terrains and weaponry.  You definitely feel engaged in a variety of forms of war and can easily become immersed in military tactical shooter goodness.  Different troop types, vehicles, artillery, military resources, weaponry, etc all contribute to a game that feels heavily diversified within its guidelines.  The story arc and mission structures contribute to a very realistic feeling.The game is just plain not fun.  It is best in small doses and taken with a very large grain of salt.Your friendly AI is just plain ineffective.  I've read commentary that they won't obey self-destructive orders, and I disagree.  They just don't react well at times and do things that make no sense.  Your success is highly dependent on your squad mates -- a factor that might be nullified if you play co-op with friends.  Your method of interaction is slow, clunky, and imprecise.  For a game that does require tactical positioning and execution you aren't really given an effective way to achieve this.  Many times it is easier to just leave them somewhere safe, have them make noise, and then creep around and finish off the enemy.Another factor that detracts from fun:  enemy sharp shooting skills.  You can be picked off by enemies that you can't even possibly see -- which is another issue, you can hardly make the enemy out anywhere.  They, however, can pick you up almost instantly no matter where you are.  They are incredibly lethal at any distance and can be very difficult to sneak up on.  This ties into another complaint:  time.  The game is clearly designed to be a very slow moving creeper-flanker of a tactical shooter but you are often saddled with very constricting time limits.  It is difficult to enjoy the game and make use of its subtle nuances when you have to literally run, full bore, across areas or suffer dire consequences.  As one frequent commenter points out, \"Military missions are often under time constraints\".  I understand.  It still doesn't change the fact that this is overdone and seriously detracts from the fun.The checkpoint system is another serious flaw.  Setting aside that it has infrequent checkpoints, they are often in strange and tactically dangerous places.  This also ties in with the way point system -- if you follow the way points you'll end up dead quickly.  Sometimes you have to \"touch\" a way point in order to trigger a scripted event.  Often times I've been killed only to have the check point reload and have an enemy literally right behind me -- peeled within five seconds of a reload.  Next reload: no enemy there.Overall, I've found the game to be very frustrating -- it has so much potential, so many cool ideas, and yet it has so many seriously detracting factors.  For all it could have been it honestly fails to execute.  Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising is a game as good as it is bad.  One minute you are enraptured by it and the next minute you are googling the developers so you can send them hate mail.  Do yourself a favor and rent it before purchasing to make sure that you are really interested in what the game has to offer.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2009"}

Wii owners should be pleased to know that it plays well on the Wii as well!The graphics are certainly less sharp than what you get on the Wii, but not horrendously so - it still immerses you fairly promptly into the golf playing fun with a selection of players - Yoshi, Princess Peach, and many others. There are a number of courses to play on, with their own personalities. There are a number of games as well, for from one to four players.If you're playing on a Wii, make sure you buy the special GameCube controllers in order to play. You *cannot* play this with either the Wii controllers or with any of the other controllers that you might get with the system. You can get both wired and wireless versions from most game stores. Also, make sure you get a Nintendo GameCube memory card. There's a spot in the top of the Wii to insert it, to save your games.Back to the game itself. It is a fairly straightforward golf game, in that to swing you hit a button on the back swing, and then again on the forward swing. So it's something even newcomers can get the hang of. Those who are better at golf (or gameplaying for that matter) can tweak the club they use, the exact placement of the club on the ball, and many other details.There are some situations where the lesser graphics of the GameCube become apparent. When you're trying to put on the green the various lines showing you the slopes can be very cluttering on the screen with their blockiness. It can be hard to see exactly where the hole is, amongst everything else. Yes you can temporarily remove all of those lines, but on modern systems you can have both on the display without it being a giant mess. Also, speaking of putting, the precision of button pressing in order to make a perfect put is pretty challenging. You would think Mario Golf would be a game for kids, but I imagine most youngsters would be frustrated by doing such a precise pair of button pressing for the putt activity.Still, there's a great collection of games and tutorials in here, so you can keep replaying and enjoy it each time, especially if you get friends involved. Also, there's a nice feature of being able to save a game part way through, so if you have to take a break for some reason, you can easily come back and start again from that point when you are able to.Well recommended if you're a golfing fan!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2010"}

My biggest gripe is that the field of vision is way too narrow and limited.  It makes it tough when fighting bosses, for one.Gameplay: Here is where this Metroid loses points.  Maybe I am too old for this (I grew up with the original Metroid back in the late 80's), but the whole structure of the game is much, much too linear.  Explore area A, get powerup A, Fight boss A.

Either way, if you are victorious in your takedown you'll get the chance to talk some trash as you exchange Mugshots with your victim via an optional camera hooked to your gaming system or your gamertag/PSN avatar if you prefer to keep your identity on the down-low.Showtime: Crash Anywhere, Any TimeAnd finally since a newBurnoutrelease wouldn't be complete without a little something special in the wreckage department,Burnout Paradisecontinues the carnage with an update of its familiar 'Crash Mode.' Renamed 'Showtime Mode,' players can now crash, bounce and scatter their ride in any location and replay the wreckage over and over in slow motion. One of the most addictive and down right fun features of the game, players activate the mode by simply pulling both triggers on their controller and if they are good enough can also immortalize their Showtime moments on the leaderboards for all to see.Driving fans this is Next-Gen at its best and definitely theBurnouttitle you have been waiting for.","reviewerName":"Scott W.

They have redesigned this game to make it even more open ended and realistic.  The handling of the cars is excellent.  The graphics are the best I have seen for a racing game of this scale.  And the game performs great on my PS3.You have to drive to the individual races and also you drive through the streets so you can take shortcuts or go the wrong way accidentally.

I play MMO's casually. I played WoW back in 2009 for about 3 months. Got bored and quit. Played SWTOR for about a month got bored and quit. I got into the Tera beta and really liked it. I don't play PVP. I like PVE. Picked it up at launch on Tuesday and I've already reached level 20 which, by my standards, is a lot of dedication. Didn't make it past level 17 in SWTOR and maxed out at 30 in WoW. I'm having a lot of fun with the combat. Which is why it's so much better than SWTOR and WOW. No sitting around pressing 1 for attack and 2 for next attack. Tera takes Kingdom of Alamur type of combat and puts it online. It's great. I really recommend it for anyone who likes action games and want's to get into MMO's. It's also possible to pretty much solo anything up to level 20. I don't know much after that. The Instance bosses will need groups, but finding a Guild in Tera isn't that hard either.Now, I might add the game is quite stunning. I don't have a beast of rig, but I'm able to run the game at high settings on a mid range ati 6670 and I get above 40 FPS in the huge areas. It's really nice to look at. The lighting is great.

I have been a long time fan of the Medal of Honor series ever since I played the first one on the old Playstation system. I even enjoyed the European Assualt title and thought that the fire fights were a lot more intense than the ones in Airborne. Don't get me wrong this is a next gen game, but the matter of fact is that WWII games have been done to death. With so many great titles out there within the same genre, Airborne does not push the concept far enough to win over the competition. You are still fighting on with the same assortment of weapons (pistols, submachine guns, assualt rifles, sniper, bazzooka and a few others) you are still fighting the nazi regime, you are still running through houses for close combat and fighting outdoors in the countryside for long range combat. You are still fighting inside trenches and on top of bridges.In order to bring something new into gameplay the creators of Airborne made the game into \"open world\" level maps. You begin each mission with a briefing of objectives, weapons selection followed by you jumping off a plane with a parachute. And this is where the open world concept is used; you can land anywhere on the battlefield map and engage the enemy in close combat or snipe them from afar. It is not linear like most FPS that force you to go along path to advance through the level. The way to advance in Airborne is to kill enemy germans in any of the battles taking place at the same time. If you leave an area of battle and head to a different part of the map, you will encounter more enemies and alllied bots engaging in battle.Since there are mini battles taking place all over the map, this lets you devise a strategy for flanking enemy positions and sometimes even coming up behind them to gun them down. You can also land on roofs of houses and go jumping from one roof to the next while shooting down at the enemy positions on the ground levels. You can pick up ammo and switch to weapons dropped by dead enemies. Although you use the same basic WWII weapons found in most FPS, Airborn lets you upgrade your weapons the more you use it by killing enemies. You can get faster reloads, steady aim, bigger ammo clip and a few surprise attachements.I know that I will get a lot of flak for this (pun intended), but even with its open world design and upgradeable weapons, MOH Airborne, did not meet my expectations for a next gen title. There are no destructible objects, multiplayer is boring, and the missions do not get my adrenaline pumping up. There is just nothing remarkable about it to justify me purchasing yet another WWII shooter when, Call of Duty is still more intense and immersive than Airborne. And consider the fact the COD is an older title.Pros:+open world maps+excellent controls+excellent music+cool weapon upgrades+ragdoll physics+detailed statistics and leaderboardsCons:-Not as intense as COD-another WWII shooter-no vehicles to drive-boring multiplayer-weak missions in single player","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-11-2007"}

Kane has been drafted into Rhino Squad, one of the squads of space marines currently assaulting the planet Stroggos, home of the strogg aliens.","reviewerName":"F0X H0UND","summary":"Pretty long & tideous, but fun none the less","reviewText":"In Quake 4, you control Mathew Kane - a Marine who is recruited to the feared \"Rhino Squad\". As Kane, you and your squad are tasked with taking down the central communications hub of the enemy known as the Stroggs. Sounds easy right? Think again. Eventually the Strogg get a hold of Kane and basically make him one of their own. But before they get to engage a neural link that will make Kane fully Strogg, the Rhino Squad saves him. Now half human-half Strogg, and filled with an unyeilding rage, Kane takes his mission personally.This game doesn't really bring anything new to the FPS table, but it' still retains the never ending fast paced & heavy action seen in the other Quake games. You see the world through Kane's eyes as he and his teammates engage in brutal and bloody firefights using a huge array of weapons which include, but are not limited to, an assault rifle, a shotgun, grenade launcher, a \"lightning gun\", and a rocket launcher, against thick hordes of enemy Strogg. The Strogg come in all shapes & sizes, some with sheilds, others in robotic walkers, some massivley huge & intimadating, others with just pulse rifles.. you get the idea. If you have a medic or a technician following you, they can heal your health or fix your armor which is pretty cool. Also, the technician every once in a while will upgrade some of your weapons.On the bonus disc you can play Quake 2, which is a really good game though outdated. However, this review isn't for Quake 2, so I'm not going to bother with that. Also, there is a multiplayer both off and online -- but I haven't played either, so once again I'm skipping this.The graphics of this game are almost identical to Doom 3 for the X-Box, so if you played D3 you know how realistic it looks. Both the enviroments and character models (both Strogg and Humans) look extremley real and move with fluid motions, such as their mouths match what they are saying or their eyes follow you when they speak to you. The lighting was absolutley great, and unlike Doom 3, you can use a flashlight and a gun at the same time!!There wasn't much music, but there sure was a lot of talking. The voice acting was alright, nothing too spectacular, and like Gamespot said - it sounded muffled & really low a lot of the time. A few of the guns sounded really weak which was a downer, but the explosions sounded great.Quake 4 is a pretty long game, and after a while, feels a bit dragged on. It starts off with a bang, and it's fun for a bit, but after awhile you may feel as though the game never ends. I believe the campaign was 10-15 hours long (faaaar to long for a FPS in my opinion), and ontop of that, the game wasn't really easy at all. A lot of the time you get so overwhelmed with Strogg that it appears impossible.... in otherwords, at some points it may feel like a chore (and very frustrating) to play Quake 4.Additionally, the ending was miserable. Kane destroys the hub and goes to rejoice with the remaining members of Rhino Squad. Just as he lands and begins celebrating, he is given new orders..... then the credits roll and you never know what happens. After 15 hours, I expected to see a lot more..such as medics and doctors reversing the effects of the Strogg's experiments and making Kane a human again, but no you dont see that.Shockingly the AI was really, really good and was (in my opinion) better than that of Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter. Your Marines actually shot and killed enemies a lot, and were actually fun to fight side by side with.Also, like GSpot said, the game does slow down at some points. But it only happens when there are a lot of enemies coming towards you, you're firing wildly, and things are blowing up all at once. Sure it could be bad, but with all the action I guess you can look over it.To end this review, even with it's $35 price tag (thats pretty low for an X-Box 360 game), Quake 4 is only real good as a rental. Sure the action is thick, but there is only so much of shooting Strogg one person can take, and 15 hours of it is unbelievable. Not to mention the ending isn't really worth all the hassle. So like I said, if you own an X360 then rent this game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2006"}

Nicholson","summary":"Dead Island...the Pros and Cons","reviewText":"\"Dead Island\" is a new computer game from Deep Silver. I purchase my game through 'Steam'. It took 15 hours to download and retailed at $49 at that time.The game is an tropical island zombie stomp where you can either play single or 4 player co-op. The game style is that of a FPS with RPG upgrades to skills, weapons and health.The Pros:1.) stunning graphics with smooth animation...never had a single crash to desktop and only the rarest of momentary slowdowns (usually when my computer decided to do something else).2.) a tense and engrossing main mission (get off the island) plus many side missions that give you the opportunity to explore the lush world of this tropical island and at the same time earn cash, XPs, modifications for weapons (a real must!) and find new and better weapons.3.) an intriguing game as a single person but it's the 4 player co-op that this game shows its stuff.3.a) CO-OP...you can play with friends or a set of random players. If you opt for random, the game matches your skill level AND area of action with the players that are comparable to your skill and location. So your not going to end up with one player at level 23 and another at 6. About the only thing impossible to take into account in setting up a random player game is how the 4 players wish to play the game...some may want to play straight MAIN mission while others may wish to play the side missions and explore for goodies. So it's possible to have a random group with two different ideas as to how they want to proceed in the game. If this happens, you might be better off finding a new set of players for random co-op.3.b) SINGLE PLAYER...if you are playing single but hit a tough section you can join a co-op in the area your in and get help. The really good thing is that any bonuses (money, guns, XPs etc.) you get while playing co-op are transferred back with you when you switch back to single player again.4.) some really interesting puzzles...not all enemies need be killed (especially if you low on health or weapons)...explore for ways around if your situation warrants.5.) decent replay value...at the beginning you can choose between 4 players as your avatar...each with different specialty skills and attributes. Also you may want to play the first time around concentrating on the main mission and then a second time by doing more exploring.6.) a huge variety of weapons with available mods. Later in the game it's almost impossible to proceed without some specially modified weapons.7.) vehicles for traveling AND a quick travel system allowing you (once you've visited an area) to be transported from one place to another without having to physically retrace your steps...HUGE timesaving feature.8.) your active quest is shown in a mini-map at the bottom of the screen giving you directions. An absolute must as the island is huge and some quest quite long.Cons:About my only complaint was that there was no instructions with the downloaded version from Steam. Early on I was puzzled, for example, as to how to open some doors, throw weapons etc. Also there was little info on how to join a co-op game. Of course these problems were all eventually quickly learned through experience, but were frustrating when starting out.Conclusion:Simply a great game. An addictive FPS with RPG upgrade qualities. Playable as a single player  or with 4 friends OR random players in co-op.Much, much better than I'd hoped.  5 StarsRay Nicholson","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-22-2011"}

A game focused more towards a younger audience, most of the puzzles are fairly straightforward and easy, relying more on an intuitive combat system to keep the game difficult. The game is also only capable of holding two saved games at a time. Not a problem if you're the only one who plays, but don't expect to be able to share it with many friends.

Johnson \"Pyrochaos\"","summary":"Such a workout!","reviewText":"After playing kinect for quite a while now, this thing is great.  Some of the games work a lot better than others, but overall it's been a very positive experience.Space:  They say you want about 8 feet for 2 players, and about 6 for 1 player.  The thing is, Microsoft has said that if you move the sensor from the bottom of your TV to the top, that is equal 1 foot of space in the sensors eyes.  If you have a wall mount and have it behind your TV, that's even more space.  So there are ways to get around the space requirement.  I am 6'4\" and mounted it above the TV and it doesn't have a problem seeing my entire body, so that should be a pretty good indication that it works well for tall people.Voice recognition:  This feature works very well.  If you are signed in, it seems to recognize only your voice (or similar to yours) when you are trying to control the xbox.  This is good for people who have kids, or annoying roommates, or a wife that just likes to mess with you while you are playing xbox.  For now, not many of the games use voice recognition.  So I am hoping more use this in the future since it works so well for the dashboard and movies.Lighting:  I usually play more towards late afternoon to night time.  I don't like having a lot of lights on when I play either.  The kinect's infrared sensor picks up movements very well in low lit situations.  It's almost as if all the lights are on.  The manual says that you should calibrate in different lighting (day, night, ect) to get the most accurate control.  I've only calibrated once and it seems to still work perfectly in all lighting.Motion control:  This is what kinect is.  Motion control.  That's what separates it from the herd and makes it more than just a Wii clone.  It takes a little getting used to, and kinect has it's own dashboard and guide type of button as well.  Some games seem to have an excellent handle on the in-game menus (Dance Central's slider) which make things go faster.  And some are just plain and generic (like kinect sports, and kinect adventures) but it still gets the job done.Overall it seems there is a lot for developers to work with, and there is a lot that can be done in terms of updates.  The games lay in the hand of developers, but with the next wave of hybrid games that utilize the controller with kinect leave a lot of possibilities in the hands of developers.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-08-2010"}

Youll be playing and notice a lot of \"slowdown\" as if theres somehing wrong with the physics of the game and the movement of your character seems off like hes dragging a bit, quite a bit. This is still a fun game but a little bit of a disappointment that with such a good story and cinematics nothing could be done to polish the player movements up a bit.  To its benefit, for some reason or another, this almost gives the gameplay a realistic type feel sometimes making you feel like you are a part of the action. You would have to play it to see what I mean.  Overall this game has flaws and does not run as smooth as Allied Assault or Call of Duty but it is still an engaging game that will be seen as a gritty fight while your playing it.

How many Ratchet and Clank experiences can a person be expected to take in, after all? While I love the series, the last thing I wanted was more of the same. Luckily this entry introduces some ingenious elements into the gameplay. If you played any earlier R&C games, you probably loathe the idea of playing as Clank, with no Ratchet. And it looks as though the developers have grown wise to that bit of truth. Clank may be a great addition to Ratchet's back, but he's just a bore on his own. At least he was before this game. Here you have a Clank who can use bombs to slow time and use recorded clones of himself to progress through challenges. This gives the title a great amount of real puzzle action. Clank also has some great shooter-type challenges here as well. You will look forward to playing with him in this game. The ability to travel through open space and take on side challenges was a great addition too. Even Ratchet has been given new abilities that make this a truly original platforming experience. The numerous ways in which you can customize weapons almost makes this game too good to be true. The series has always been focused on great platforming, wicked weapons, and the best stories you'll find in the gaming world. A Crack In Time is no exception. My only real complaint here is that a few of the weapons aren't as memorable and don't control as well as they did in Up Your Arsenal. But Insomniac doesn't seem interested in making carbon copies of its older games, so we may never see weapon control capabilities that strong again. Regardless, it's a very minor complaint. The combat still controls ages better than other platforming games I've played. There's lots of replay value here, the game is enjoyable for people of all ages, and the platinum trophy wasn't that difficult to obtain. This is one of the best games available on any system.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-26-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00BGA9WK2","description":"","reviewerName":"Cim","summary":"10 thoughts on the PS4","reviewText":"Here are 10 thoughts I originally emailed\\posted to friends.I hooked up my PS4 with a 1TB hyrbid hard drive and it went smooth with no issues. Here's 10 thoughts I had from launch day and a few weeks playing a bit of Black Flag, a clone of Defender and a non next gen title called Knack.1 - Speed. The system boots fast. Everything is fast, the menus the loading, the downloading, switching between apps and even the PSN store... all on a day when their network was getting hammered. Little or no ads on the dashboard. The only faults I can find is that you can't seem to sort things the way you want to. I like the PIN feature on the Xbox 360\\Win8 so this is a bit of a bummer but maybe I just can't figure it out.2 - Controller is a huge upgrade over the PS3's. The triggers the response when moving around the dash or selecting things and playing arcade type games like Resogun felt great. Somehow I can't go back to the PS3's controller ever again.3 - Games are installed quickly and you can play almost immediately, granted I have a hybrid SSD installed so my drive may be faster. Resogun loaded in about 10 seconds. Assassins Creed 36 seconds including all the menu's the UPLAY checkup and agreements.4 - Resogun is a Defender clone and a free game for PSplus users....its highly addictive and responds well with the controller. It has voice features through the controller which was kind of nice and it's something I would have bought for sure if not for the free download this month. Excellent retro game.5. Your games automatically record while you play. Hit the share button if you want and upload the clip to facebook or Twitch (youtube comes later). Trim it. Take screenshots....it's all simple and you can finally keep a nerdy collection of your beaten games to show off to people or to yourself. I found it really easy to do even though I'm not interested in this sort of thing but it can keep some memorable moments in games6 - Knack is not a launch worthy game and it suffers a bit from framerate issues but at the same time has some very good graphics in spots and plays well with lots of unlockable things to do. This game should have been a download or at least $29 or $39 bucks tops. With all that out of the way it's not a BAD game, it's a very simple platformer, jump and punch is all you do for the most part and has stuff from many games mixed into it. I think it's the perfect game for just zoning out and relaxing and I think most retro fans will like it but &#34;modern gamers&#34; may not. I'd recommend it if it was a lot cheaper.7 - Assassins Creed Blackflag plays well and is like other Creed games but the graphics really shine here. I mentioned that to me these console launch games look like a high end PC and even better. I read some people say that this isn't good enough of an upgrade but I tend to disagree. It looks really great.8 - PSplus and Xbox Live are now totally worth the subscription fee. I got Resogun and Contrast (which I haven't tried yet) for free and a few more to play around with called Warframe and Blacklight Retribution. So I bought two games and got a bunch more games for my subscription. Nice.9. The console looks like a PS2 which is good and is lightweight about the size of a PS3 slim. The power button and eject buttons are hard to see though and it has a wobble which doesn't affect gameplay. I didn't notice the wobble until a friend pointed it out. The nice thing too is it charges controllers in standby mode which means the system is basically off except for a few things. Hit the button on the controller and your right back to it.10. It doesn't play PS3 games.....but somehow I completely don't care.Amazon by the way poorly shipped mine but thankfully I had no issues. It was a beatup box with only one air bubble thrown in and I could easily shake the system inside the box. I won't remove a star for this as I'm reviewing the system and not Amazon's lackluster shipping methods.It's a great system that blows away the PS3 in every category and this time around it feels like a game machine where the PS3 felt like I don't know....something that tried to do too much and never did anything really well.The only shortcomings are the lack of any great games. That's pretty much all I can think of.Did I mention the controller is great? Yes I did. In fact it is my favorite controller that currently exists.Sony nailed it this time. Congrats to them.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-09-2013"}
{"product_name":"B00012TIW8","reviewerName":"C. Johnson","summary":"Not as good as original. Gets a bit boring in later levels","reviewText":"I really enjoyed the first Splinter Cell so when I found out that the sequel was coming out, I made sure I got it the first day it came out.  This game was pretty good but compared to the first it is not a good or as fun.The game starts off very well as far as the storyline goes.  Fisher is called again to solve another threat.  The storyline while very interesting at first, seems to have been rushed near the end of the game.  The news broadcasts between levels cut off way too early to get a good feel of the story.  I agree with what a lot of other people are saying about how you as a player do not feel as &quot;involved&quot; and as a part of the story as in the original Splinter Cell.The graphics again are very good.  The lighting effects of this game are done flawlessly and I also noticed that Ubisoft did a lot of work on the outside levels.  When you walk through tall grass, the grass moves with you and it almost seems real.  Same goes true for walking through water.  In the first splinter cell, the water seemed to be stagnant even when you walked through it; not in pandora tomorrow.  The water effects in this game have had a major overhaul and now when you walk through water, it ripples depending on how fast you are going and makes water like sounds as well.The sound is OK.  Nothing spectacular here and in some case the background music annoying drowns out character speech so you can barely hear what people are saying unless you turn down the BGM volume.The game play is probably the most disappointing part of this game.  When you first start the game, you will notice that some of the original button assignments have changed, some are necessary because of the new moves that Fisher can now do.  However some button changes are totally unnecessary and make the game a bit frustrating in the beginning until you get used to it.  For example, in the original SC to get Sam to bring his legs up when he is hanging on a pipe/pole you press B and to get him to jump down you press Y.  However in SC:PT, you have to press Y again to get him to bring his legs up, pressing B (which is what so many of us have become used to) will cause Sam to let go of what he is hanging on, which in some situations will send you plummeting to your death causing you to restart from your last save point which bring me to another point on game play.  The save points in SC:PT seem much further spread out then in the original game.  This wouldn't be so bad, but the game is a bit more difficult due to the greater concentration on stealth (more on this in a second).  Because of this you will be restarting sections over and over and over and over and over again if you do one thing wrong.  This makes this game more of a &quot;How long to the next save point?&quot; instead of really having the opportunity to really enjoy and appreciate the game and surroundings.  This causes the game to be more frustrating than fun in many areas.  Many of you will notice that the game has a lot less &quot;action&quot; because this game seems to focus more on stealth.  I personally prefer stealth games because they are more fun and require thinking.  However I couldn't help but be annoyed at the countless number of &quot;one alarm-mission over&quot; missions.  And on top of this if a guard so much as sees you, (or thinks he sees you) an alarm would magically go off and mission over.  He doesn't even have to run to an alarm panel.  I got over it, but during later levels the game got very frustrating because I always had to restart from a save point that I got to over 15 minutes ago.  When I got towards the end of the game I as so frustrated and annoyed I just rushed through the levels when I could just to get to a save point.  The last level was pretty disappointing as well as the ending.The multiplayer is a bit disappointing in my opinion as well, I played a few times and enjoyed myself, but the time required just to find a game is just not worth it.  If you try to join a game and its full (which usually is), the game starts you over from the main multi player menu, meaning you have to go back and enter your search criteria again!!  Bad developing!In closing I must say that while I really enjoyed the game during the first part of the game, the later levels seem rushed and are painfully boring.  Additionally, the game play is more frustrating than fun, I was a bit disappointed.  I played and completed the original SC at least 10 times and enjoy it the same every time I play it.  I recently beat the original after beating Pandora Tomorrow.  Will I be playing SC:PT multiple times?  Probably not.This game gets 4 stars, but BARELY.  (3.8 is more like it).  More time should have been spent on this game to make it a blockbuster like the original.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-25-2004"}

{"product_name":"B000ZKA0J6","description":"","reviewerName":"J.  Martin","summary":"Exceeded My Expectations - Superbly Done!","reviewText":"I didn't expect Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty to live up to the hype and it's spectacular predecessor. Fortunately for me, I was completely wrong. The game's campaign has an interesting storyline, good character development with introduction of some new characters I'd just LOVE to see more of in the franchise, and added many new features that blow other RTS games out of the water. The graphics look beautiful, and don't require a super high-end machine to run reasonably well.As far as the single-player campaign goes, say goodbye to the boring old briefing rooms of the old Starcraft and of many other RTS games out there, and say hello to the headquarters of a new Terran revolution: on board the battlecruiser Hyperion! On board the Hyperion, which can be accessed and utilized during times when not in combat, you can do everything from spending earned credits on new technologies, upgrades, and hero (mercenary) units, to following storyline developments by talking to other characters in the game on the ship.Yes, rather than just boring old briefing rooms and new units randomly being added to your arsenal at various points during the campaign, Blizzard has, almost without flaw, integrated this game development aspect into the single-player campaigns of Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty. In the new Starcraft, developing new technology and new units has taken an interesting turn. You are frequently provided with the option of securing artifacts, vehicles, or other pieces of technological hardware on the battlefield that can be studied by Terran scientists in the Hyperion's lab to provide you with upgrades and new units for your campaign arsenal. In my view, this is a solid mark of improvement over the original Starcraft. Instead of just doling out and assigning new units, players in Starcraft 2 will be able to spend credits earned on missions to purchase hardware upgrades of their choosing. This allows for much more variation of gameplay from campaign to campaign, and engages players while enabling them to try different tactics and strategically customize their arsenal of weaponry and technology while in the campaign in ways they could never do in many other RTS games, including the original Starcraft itself.Following suit, the single player campaign also allows you to make some of your own decisions about who to side with at some times. Rather than having the game's story play out like a movie with players being more like passive viewers, Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty engages players and allows them free choice. Do you want to ally with this character, or with an opposing faction? What will the consequences of that decision be? This new feature engages players and provides far better replayability.The multiplayer aspect of the game is even better than the original. Blizzard scrapped the old 12 unit and single building selection limits, allowing for more opportunities to micromanage units and make strategical decisions to alter the course of the game and battle opponents - rather than allowing the game to devolve into a clickfest to see who can mash hotkeys faster for the win.That said, there are a couple significant downsides to Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty that you should be aware of. The new bnet system has included a game censorship feature that censors all manner of completely innocuous comments and words by gamers. Furthermore, the amount of words that have been censored is so large that it occasionally will censor even completely ordinary sentences that trigger the new bnet censorship system. While incredibly irritating, and clearly a waste of programming resources that should have been spent on improving the game's features, at least Blizzard provides gamers with the option to deactivate it in the game's options menu.The new bnet system also doesn't have a system of private channels like the original did, though Blizzard claims they will add a channel feature in the future that sounds more restrictive than the one we had in the original Starcraft. Why Blizzard left out some of these fundamental features of the old bnet multiplayer system and instead devoted costly programming resources to idiotic language filters that more often than not merely inhibit ordinary communication between players is beyond me.Possibly the most irritating downside to Starcraft 2 has been the game's awful resolution support. While it is worth noting that SC2 technically supports resolutions like 1920x1200, it is also important to know that Blizzard's implementation of that resolution support was done in a bad way. Basically, if you use any resolution that is not 16:9 on your monitor, you will be at a significant disadvantage in multiplayer matches of SC2 because the game will crop off your vertical field of view. Of course, you are free to go ahead and set your game to a 16:9 resolution, but changing the resolution to a resolution lower than and different from what is native to your monitor reduces the visual quality of the game significantly. It's pretty disappointing that in 2010 there are still PC games out there that don't support 16:10 resolutions correctly. As far as resolution goes, Blizzard should take a lesson from Valve and do the job right. Hopefully better resolution support will be patched in... but I say don't count on it. For anyone with a 4:3 or 16:10 monitor, you must put up with either a significant reduction in image quality OR have to put up with being able to see less of the battlefield than your opponents online can see. Blizzard is basically punishing you for having a monitor with the wrong aspect ratio.That said, there are also a few improvements in the new bnet system that should not be overlooked. Blizzard has included a new game achievement system quite similar to the game achievement system gamers have enjoyed on Valve's Steam service for years now. Blizzard has also included optional microphone chat for players to enjoy during games.Blizzard also deserves credit for the new DRM system that has been implemented on Starcraft 2. Blizzard has followed the trend of many other gaming companies and ditched obnoxious, intrusive, and difficult to delete and remove DRM methods such as SecuROM in favor of their new bnet system that is designed to be largely pretty similar to Valve's Steam service. Of course, being produced by Blizzard instead of Valve, and being entirely new, the new bnet DRM is somewhat different. Nonetheless, if, like most gamers, you're cool with Steam - you should look on the new bnet DRM system with favor, since it's quite similar. Like Steam, you can apparently download digital copies of purchased games in the event you lose or damage your CD. Likewise, once you've created an account and registered your game, you need not worry about losing the CD key since the game and its key is tied to your bnet account.Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty has crafted a superb single-player campaign experience with wonderful player-driven story development options, an appropriately enjoyable though in some ways lacking multiplayer experience, and wrapped it all up in some beautiful new graphics - all while breathing new life into that superb story that begun roughly a decade ago with the first Starcraft games. While it has its flaws, Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty is nonetheless not a game to miss!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-07-2010"}

I was pleased with that but I thought it would be much better to play the old original on the NES. I couldn't help it so I set out to find it and surprisingly, someone was willing to let me play their copy.Let me start off by saying no matter how you look at it whether its on Final Fantasy Origins or on the original NES that prologue is amazing! You start off by being asked to rescue a princess that's been captured by Garland.  So you head off to the Temple of Fiends (Temple of Chaos on FFO) and battle Garland the first boss in Final Fantasy history.  When you go back and return the princess the King will have the bridge rebuilt to the north. When you finally cross that bridge the words \"Final Fantasy\" appear on screen. That moment in my entire RPG career (well next to the opera scene in FFVI) will remain to be quite possibly my most memoriable. I've never seen an RPG do a prologue like that eversince. Not even FFIV's was that spectacular.Now I'm sorry but if you're like some people my age you don't really care for this and you'd much rather have the eye candy and so you're sitting around playing Final Fantasy X (sorry but eye candy sickens me!). But I found it very nice to play the origin of the series and it shows me now why Final Fantasy X isn't the best one in the series.Again, this is old-school and so the storyline doesn't get off to a great start. But I'd played Dragon Warrior and when I played Final Fantasy I was glad that it wasn't a save the princess deal (as most games on the NES I played were.).  It was actually a story about saving the world. Something that in the 80's I never got from gaming. The story paces a little slow but in the 80's when I played Dragon Warrior, that paced slow too.The storyline is actually one of my favorites in the series. You go around restoring the crystals that restore piece to the land. Then you go back 2000 years into the past and prevent any of the events from every happening.  It was one of the greatest in the series. Plus, it was actually FANTASY!My only gripe with the original NES version was what most people didn't like.  The fact that if all your characters targeted an enemy and the enemy died before all the characters attacked it they'd attack an empty space.  Luckily in the Final Fantasy Origins package this was remedied.  Still, one of the best Final Fantasy games in the series.  If you want an example of what the perfect RPG should be this is a great example.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-05-2003"}

There are about 180 of these red coins scattered throughout the games stages (6 in each act) that when collected will unlock something special! There is no \"true\" ending so one does not need to collect them all. A player is also awarded a rank for finishing a stage, though once again, getting the highest rank isnt required for something special. Player times can also be shared via leaderboard online. The powerups are creative and useful for getting through stages, as many stages have special routes, so playing and returning to stages once more wisps powers are unlocked are vital. An example of a wisp power is a rocket that can be used to transform Sonic into a rocket and he can blast off high into the air then hover downwards.Worlds are pretty colorful and varied, one is a mountain of sweets, another is a tropical resort, and another is a carnival type theme. There are more, but once again I wont spoil them. Ultimately, theres enough variety that players should be able to not get too tired of playing the same type and there are just enough to also easily have favorites. Some of the levels are a bit mindblowing, such as the carnival one makes the level materialize right in front of Sonic, while others have numerous spirals, loops and rails to slide on...theres even a rollercoaster!The game looks great for a Wii game, colorful, bright, and occasionally interesting lighting effects and particle effects. The graphics are so good that one has to truly play it on a big screen to take all the color and such in. It would have been interesting to see this game in HD, if they had made it. Cutscenes look great too, the voice acting was believable and great (some purposefully cheesy but hilarious lines too), and the musical selections were awesome.  The themes for the intro (Reach for the Stars) is fitting and is always great to sit through when booting the game up. The ending theme too is memorable and fitting. The soundtrack was good and perhaps SEGA knew this as they did release the soundtrack on iTunes immediately after the game came out.Ultimately, if one is looking for THE Sonic game to play, Sonic Colors is the one. With no drastically \"night and day\" difference in gameplay, it is just Sonic in a pure form speeding through levels and saving the helpless, essentially, doing that which he does best. Truly check it out and \"reach for the stars!\"*Local multiplayer was not played, though it is in the game, separate multiplayer stages*","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2011"}
{"product_name":"B00005NZ1G","description":"This action shooter takes place on a mysterious alien world. It offers a combination of team-based first-person-shooter gameplay (reminiscent ofTribes) and third-person vehicle combat elements. Gameplay kicks off with the player heading down to the planet's surface in a troop carrier, &agrave; laAliens. As the player and fellow marines exit, the remaining troopers form a flank in reaction to an oncoming onslaught of human and alien enemies.It's this smart AI system that makes for a noticeably unique gameplay feel. Another very nice feature is the seamless transition into vehicular elements. As you venture through mission objectives, a variety of enemy flyers and on-ground buggies are yours for the taking. Come across a vehicle and the camera will pull back to a third-person view as you strap in and motor through crossfire. A co-op mode allows a friend to join you in the single-player missions. For chaotic fighting action, up to four players can duel in split-screen deathmatch mode or link systems for LAN play. However you choose to hero your way throughHalo: Combat Evolved, the action should break in your new Xbox in explosive style.","reviewerName":"obryanstars","summary":"Greatest Game Ever!...Until HALO 2","reviewText":"HALO, the game all XBOX owners can brag about owning and playing, is a blast.  You really can't find a problem with it from story, graphics, gameplay, controls, and even down to every game's flaw; the camera!  There seems to be nothing wrong with this game, and that's what makes it great!Here is a little bit about (in case u haven't heard) XBOX's greatest game, HALO: Combat Evolved.1) Gameplay: So much fun!  You have dozens of guns, vehichles, and of course, Aliens to shoot and kill.  You must work as a team with your men and (optional) your human counterpart.  You have grenades, machine funs, pistols, and have the option to pick up and use Alien weapons as well.  The key here is, you can only hold 2 weapons at a time...which adds a twist and a challenge to the entire game.  Now, you must kill dozens of Aliens, find bases, save lives, drive jeeps, destroy buildings, and take out Alien Ground-troops.  You are Earth's last hope! Good luck soldier!Now, you can drive dozens of Vehichles in this game, ranging from Jeeps (with a gunner on the back and a side), Hover-crafts, tanks, etc...  You can use these to run over aliens, transport yourself long distances, and even, as cover against enemy fire.  The whole thing is a blast and the Vehicles are just a part of the whole experience...awsome fun!2) Graphics: Superb!  Luscious green grass, crystal clear ocean water, moons, Earth, the ring planet, explosions, ships, etc...All brought to life in a way only the XBOX could!  And though this got an M rating, the gore here is extremely minimal.  Blue blood comes out of dead aliens, and when your men die, red blood appears.  But there are NO guts, no excessive bleeding, and NO GORE that most parents would have to worry about their kids (11 and up) of seeing.  Everything looks crisp and clear, dust kicks up fron shots on the ground, water splashes, people get dirty and muddy...it looks so real!  Truly a revolutionary game in terms of graphics!3) Sound: So awsome.  Your men talk to each other, with lines like \"My bad!\" when they accidently shoot each other, or \"I had him!\" when u shoot an alien another was aiming at.  Jump off a cliff (driving a jeep)...and land it, the men on your jeep cry out in joy and yell with excitement.  When Aliens are killed, they brag to each other \"Did u see that shot?\" or yell \"There's plenty more where that came from!\"  The voice acting here was great, and it's just fun to fight with your men and yell in joy...as they will yell back and cheer at the sign of victory!The explosions are huge and make you jump, the engine roars when stuck in mud (on a jeep), you here cars flip and crash, and even here the last yells of a die-ing comrad.  When one of your men die, u really feel you lost a soldier...even a brother (well, I wouldn't go that far, *lol*) because it brings to life everything we've waited for in a video game.4) Options: Tons!  You can do up to 4-player split screen (or connect up to 16 players through Lan), 2 player co-op (where you and a friend work together through all the missions...will you survive?).  Dozens of game types, vehicles, etc...you'll be spoiled for choice on what to play next.  Dozens of missions, exciting gameplay, HALO is a winner in terms of having fun for a LONNNNNNNNNNNNG TIME!5) In game moves: You can jump, shoot grenades, turn a helmet light on or off (lighting is incredible as well), crouch, hit or punch aliens with your gun or arm, trade guns with one on the floor, and hop into dozens of positions in vehicles (gunners position, driver's position, side shot, etc...).  Good controls will help you 2, as you'll never be board of playing.Overall I'd reccomend HALO to anyone older than 11 and loves hard-core action.  The story, 2-player Co-op, multiplayer and system Lan, this game will keep you entertained for many hours of gameplay to come!  And when it finally does end...there's HALO 2 too look forward to in the next year (can u say XBOX Live).Enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-10-2003"}
{"product_name":"B00005Q8LR","description":"WhenLuigi's Mansionwas first announced, many assumed it would  follow in the legendary footsteps ofSuper Mario WorldandSuper Mario  64. The game doesn't approach the epic scale of either of those titles, but  once you get used to its smaller scale, the various charms of this game do  become obvious.The game involves you, as Mario's brother Luigi, trying to exorcise a haunted  mansion of ghosts by sucking them into a vacuum cleaner. It sounds easier than  the previous cinematic attempts by theGhostbustersand theCatholic Church, but it's not.  The complications and cleverness of the game manifest in the use of light and  shadow. Many ghosts cannot be seen unless you reveal their shadows or manipulate  the objects in a room to make them appear. These imaginative--but never  frustrating--puzzles add to the otherwise simplistic process of catching the  smaller ghosts by freezing them with a beam of light and sucking them up with  your Hoover backpack.It's only a minor classic, butLuigi's Mansiondoes show off some off the  GameCube's graphic effects and provides a game the whole family can enjoy. If  only it were a bit longer.--David Jenkins. --Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Katie \"Dark Musashi\"","summary":"An extremely stupid game, but amusing","reviewText":"Okay, what the heck is up with the vaccuum cleaner??? That's your weapon. Interesting. This game is somewhat entertaining, however it is not exactly cool and action-packed. The whole point is to suck up ghosts with the vaccuum and rescue Mario. It's one of those games you sit around and play all day when you're bored. It will keep you entertained for awhile anyway. Check it out if you're into the Mario games, as I said, it's certainly...interesting.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2002"}

Lindquist","summary":"A Great Prequel","reviewText":"I can't believe I am the first after weeks of this game being released to make a review!Nonetheless, here we go.This game is amazing for a portable game. The graphics and sound are just far above what you expect when you think portable gaming and they actually tied the story to the original well too.Gameplay: The Gameplay is top notch. Not only do you explore towns, talk to NPCs and have the Final Fantasy experience you would expect, but there are also side missions that act as a quick fix incase you don't have enough time to actually focus on the story. You can play these whenever you find a save point and they serve as a nice way to get you some extra potions and experience. Interactivity is similar to what you would find in the classic game as far as finding items by exploring the environment and seeing unique sights because you were curious enough to explore every nook and cranny. There are even side missions like having professor hogo making you face huge monsters in an attempt to kill you because you disturbed him. The Story is what shines the most in this game, and it is by far one of the most engrossing stories of the series.Graphics: This game seriously looks like the first Kingdom hearts on the PS2. Their facial expressions and animations are the best you can find on a portable system to date. This game could be ported to the PS2 and considered to have gorgeous graphics. The CG scenes are on par with Advent Children.Sound: The Voice acting is actually pretty good, and the music from Final Fantasy VII that was redone for the game isn't bad either, but the new music to the game is pretty forgettable. I honestly can't stand the shinra building's theme, which feels like it is 10 seconds long and just set to loop. This is one of the game's biggest strengths and downfalls at the same time.Replay Value: You could speed through the story and still expect hours upon hours to be spent doing side missions. The story itself takes a good amount of time to beat. Expect to invest maybe 30 hours into this game.This game is a fantastic deal. Expect to have a blast with it and you wont be disappointed.SPECIAL NOTE: There are some things to this game that you might want to take into consideration. I started playing this game on my old PSP then early into it bought the new model. The difference is HUGE. The load times on the new PSP are cut not only in half, but takes the load time from up to 18 seconds at some points to maybe 3-4 tops. There is also a very low amount of blur when Zack is running around on the screen on the new one compared to the old one. The new screen is brighter, higher refresh rate and the load time on the new one is way shorter. The new PSP is almost a must for this game otherwise load times will destroy the experience.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-24-2008"}

Kingdom Hearts was an action RPG that was marred by a loathesome camera, a shifting difficulty and hack and slash battle system. While there's some camera problems, it's overall a much improved game with slight difficulty problems for some and some new additions to its battle system.Story: Never played Chain of Memories but the game picks up afterwards. Sora's back as well as Donald and Goofy, as well as a new type of enemy called Nobodies and a group known as Organization XIII. You'll also travel to worlds with little mini-plots.Graphics: Some improvements from the first one with slight noticeable enhancements. The Pirates of the Caribbean level looks pretty great for the facial detail and in-game graphics look more detailed than before. Sora's new moves greatly benefit from the new graphics as well.Sound/Music: The music is always spot-on except the themes you might not like. Voice acting is kind of a mixed bag with Haley Joel Osment and Hayden Panettiere doing good jobs as always but then we have the ghastly sounding Aeris by Mena Suvari or the hick sounding Cid. Another offender is whoever did Scar's voice, it's so emotionless it was painful and funny to hear. There's also lots of sound alikes that are kind of distracting.Gameplay: Nothing much changed except for a few new things. Added is the Drive system where Sora combines with Donald or Goofy for the Wisdom Form or Valor Form respectively. They're more stronger versions of the characters in a way. Sora's got some added combos that makes him a bit more of a powerhouse than last time. Also added is Reaction Commands, certain moves you can do against an enemy. Example is fighting Cerberus and instead of being chomped on, you press Triangle and you do some moves for some good damage. Only complaint is that quite a few enemies don't even have any.As for difficulty, some say it's way too easy even on hard mode, others struggle through it and keep getting hit. It's kind of unbalanced at times since some enemies are no problem while others won't even let you attack and they cheap shot from the back. That last round of bosses in particular will probably make you start swearing too. Also munny personally is rather scarce. In the first one, I usually had 1000 leftover by the time I finished shopping for items and equipment, here I barely have 40 bucks by the end of everything.It's the rare sequel that tops the original. Yes it's got extremely minor flaws and it might rear its ugly head but you end up ignoring it. Since Okami and Final Fantasy XII are quite a ways, kill time with this one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-01-2006"}
{"product_name":"B0050SWR6M","description":"","reviewerName":"M. Dotzler \"Kasaru\"","summary":"Best racer on Vita by far","reviewText":"Need For Speed: Most Wanted for PS Vita is absolutely amazing. It is the full console experience on the Vita, with just about everything intact.The graphics in this game are absolutely stellar. Maybe not as good as its console brethren, but it is mighty close. The intro video seemed to have a couple of graphical hitches to it, so I figure it was the transition to a smaller screen and resolution. With the exception of that, and the noticeably HORRIBLE lights of oncoming cars (I noticed fire in Uncharted: Golden Abyss had the same problem), as well as the low resolution shadows (also another reoccurring problem), the graphics in this game are without a doubt, some of the best on the system. Every detail is there, and clearly visible and defined. The sparks from a blown tire or collision, the reflection of the sun off the car, the smoke from the tires as they spin. The environments are absolutely stunning as well. The buildings aren't just some low resolution texture, they're actually there, and look great. The environment is destructible, so as you're careening through a billboard, you're going to see it splinter and break. Everything is there, and it looks amazing.The gameplay is absolutely amazing. As I said, it is the same exact game that is on the consoles. The cars feel great and controllable, realistic physics, great handling, and like I said, beautiful detail. There is no start up menu, which is actually a good thing. You can get right into the action, which you're going to very much want to do so. The menus are easy to navigate, and again, touch controls for menus are not necessary, and I don't even know if they're an option, that's how much I hate to use them. But anyways, gameplay is solid, if not better.It is quite obvious this game is nothing but a blatant port however, there are some things that need to be worked on. Like I said before, during the transition to a smaller screen and resolution, some things were not taken into account, such as the bad quality of the intro video. However, the HUD too, was not changed, and some things are much too small. The map should be remade for the Vita, because it is too small and too much crammed into that small square in the quarter. And in an open world racing game like this, the map is an essential part of the gameplay. As well as the menu on the top right, it is too small to really be able to use it while driving, like is intended. Instead, you have to stop the car, and squint at the small letters and stats that are also so pivotal in the gameplay. Other than that, the whole game is there in a nice package, and well worth it.The muliplayer is where its at in this game. The multiplayer is not toned down whatsoever for this game, except the player count. Consoles can have up to 8 players, while a lobby on Vita has only 4. Which isn't a big deal, I had such a blast with only 3 other people, I think if there was more, it might get too crazy and take away from the fun of it all. The multiplayer is open world, players can go wherever they want to, until the next race starts, and you have to race your way there. So really, there's a race in a race... you earn speed points and for the 6 set races or so, you rack up points by placing, taking down opponents, and other objectives. Very fun, very addicting.Autolog is a big part of this game's selling point. \"The most socially connected racing game ever\". And they're right. It is, and its a big part of the game. Unfortunately, all my friends on PSN are stupid and have not picked up this game, or ACIII: L yet, so I have no way of judging if it is any good or not. But if the Autolog features are as strong as the rest of the game, especially multiplayer, if you have friends with the game, you're going to have even more fun, and the game will have an even higher value to you.There are trophies with this game, and not really anything special to report, but I did get 7 in my first 20 minutes or so of playing... I'm hoping it won't be as easy as Resistance: Burning Skies or Skyrim...I'm pretty disappointed that there was no Cross-Buy deal, or even any Cross-Play. The games are essentially the same, it would be nice if you could save your data on the PS3 and pick up where you left off on the Vita. But I guess you can't have everything...So there it is, the best racing game on the system, thus far. I've been waiting since launch for a decent, long lasting game, and I think here it is. We'll see, but for now I've got my hands full with this game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2012"}

Yet, there still was somthings that were not there for die hard owners like the overshadowing of Sonic CD. Now, the classics keep on ringing.Sonic Gems Collection is more like a supplement to the critical Sonic Mega Collection for Gamecube owners. The compilation is mainly consisted of some lesser known greats Sonic had been featured in. The main games are really the diamonds in the rough. Sonic CD, the cult classic from the Sega CD days, has been reissued here and remastered graciously well as the main diamond for die hard Sonic fans. The other ones also please very nicely including Sonic The Fighters, a cult classic video arcade fighting game that was released overseas from the Saturn era, but now has made its U.S. debut right here.

The list includes greats like Sonic Triple Trouble, Sonic Spinball, and Sonic 2 to name a few. Unfortunately, there were a few omissions here that should've been showcased that were featured from the Playstation 2 & Xbox Sonic Mega Collection Plus editions: the original Game Gear version of Sonic The Hedgehog, and the well-compiled and mad dashing 1993 Sonic Chaos games, instead of lesser games like Tails Adventures and the Mario Kart knockoff Sonic Drift 2. There also a few greats that also are worth unlocking here, the cult-classic Genesis Vectorman series which was just a pure exciting smash as one the last greats from the 16-bit era.Despite a small amount of flaws, Sonic Gems collection is a pure delight for die hard Sonic fans.

I've gotten into medieval fantasy stuff lately too with Game of Thrones books and show so this fits into what I'm interested in at the moment.I've not played the Elder Scrolls games before but Skyrim was pretty much everywhere you looked on the net for a while there and I'm now unemployed so I've been playing more games than I usually do. I thought I'd give it a try and don't regret it, even though I was trying to stop video game playing. This game is too addictive!PROS-Huge, beautiful open world of European mythical style, Vikings, etc.-Music is wonderful. I usually turn off game music because it's so cheesy but this is great.-AI is great with comments, actions, etc. makes the game more fun.-Story is actually interesting, like Roman Empire Vs. the Northern Barbarians.-Dragons are cool!-Easy on most PC's. I have a Q6600 with 4GB RAM, Radeon HD6850 and it uses about 50-75% of my PC while playing at 1920x1080 Very High auto settings. A more modern PC would handle it even better.-Fantasy means so much more possibilities.CONS-Too addictive, I can't put this thing down! My arse hurts!-Travel to NEW destinations is way too slow, horses can't really run and are always killed fairly quickly and easily.-Skills upgrade menu is confusing. I still have not completely figured this out.-Sometimes it feels like the caverns are too similar in structure.-When sent to certain locations it doesn't have them listed on your map. Kynegrove etc.-Bugs, read the online forums for that.-Online activation, etc headaches.-Can't set lower resolution. I'd like to play in lower resolution than my LED but when I set it to 1680x1050 or lower WITH the full screen option checked it simply displays black bars around it instead of stretching/fitting it to my screen size.-They chose violence over sex here, I've never thought something that includes one but not the other can really be that complete. This is certainly aimed at all ages but it's a shame that in the USA violence is OK but sex is not for all age groups. I'd like to see more adult options in this game you can interpret that how you will. We are too hypocritical and prudish here: religious organizations and the government.

The game is fast I admit, and you barely find yourself having any lagging problems. Yet, for a next generation system you would expect a lot more details and better graphics. The bad graphics alone take two stars in my opinion.Having said that, I would really recommend this game because you will have a lot of fun playing it. WE can choose between three different mercenaries to use for the entire game, and we have the freedom to move in a huge map any where and at any time of our choice. It's like an open real life environment where we control what we do and how we plan our attacks on the enemies. By the way, if we want we can choose who we want to be friends with or who we want to be our enemy. I have not read all reviews here, but I am sure a lot of people have included a lot of details about the game. So I will move on to strongly recommend Mercenaries 2, but because of the graphics the game should cost twenty dollars less than its actual price.I believe this is one of the most fun games to play, but I dont think this is the best. Three stars should be a fair rating for this game in my opinion.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-06-2008"}

Create. Share. That's the general theme behind Media Molecule's latest Playstation 3 exclusive, and the game delivers in every aspect. The main character of LittleBigPlanet is an adorable, little burlap sack of a person, aptly named \"Sack Boy\", who must navigate over 90 pre-made levels, as well as whatever wacky, intricate level designs the community can come up with.Players will use the same basic commands throughout levels - jump, grab, drag, etc - to reach the end of the level. Levels are littered with your typical platforming hazards, such as bottomless pits and scrolling enemies, in addition to various vehicles. Along the way, you collect blue orbs, which go towards your score for the level. You can also pick up new items, decorations, and stickers, which can be used in creating your own levels. You can play through levels - competing or helping each other - online or locally along with three other friends. Some levels will even require extra players to gain access to certain items or sections of the level.The game opens up with a few tutorial levels that ease you into the game at your own pace, so you can get your footing. The learning curve is incredibly fast because the control scheme follows a typical platformer control scheme; you move with the analog stick, jump with X, and grab with R1. The square button opens up your \"Poppit\", which allows you to perform various tasks on the fly, such as customizing your Sack Boy's costume, using the text chat feature, or covering levels in stickers or items. The menu is accessible at any time during a level and it's a breeze to navigate.The poppit is also used when in the \"Create\" mode, where users are allowed free reign to craft their own levels from scratch. As you progress through levels either in the story mode, or online, you gain more and more items that can be used to create your own levels. The level creator is incredibly extensive, and will require going through a considerable amount of tutorials before you can really get the hang of it. However, after some hands on time and practice, it will become immediately apparent how fun and impressive the level creator is. You have the ability to create any type of level you want, from a standard platformer, to a racing game, to a bank heist. You can even hop into the create mode with up to four friends, who can help you work on your levels. Less creative users will still be able to access all of the content generated by their fellow gamers, as well as the main story levels.Visually, the game is gorgeous, whether playing in high-definition or not. What makes the visuals more impressive, however, is the endearing art design. The game looks incredibly unique, and each level has it's own artistic visual flair to go along with the adorable patchwork of your Sack Boy. The game also features a pleasant soundtrack, full of various tunes to fit any level. The songs are all catchy, all fitting, and there are even a few memorable ones. The soundtrack is accompanied by hilarious sound effects either directly from your Sack Boy, or from all the different aspects of a level.The main draw to LittleBigPlanet is the game's ability to transcend genres, and even create new ones. While the main game is a varied platformer at heart, the incredibly in-depth level creator offers endless possibilities. In the short time the game has been available, I've seen faithful recreations of beloved stages from gaming past, new and inventive platformers, levels that, aside from being fun to play, are down right hilarious, an actual working calculator; even levels that will play music for you note by note as you ride along a manmade vehicle. The sheer amount of possibilities to be explored is endless, and with a bevy of user-created content being uploaded on a daily basis, you could play this game for the rest of your life and never be bored. Each and every level is essentially its own game.When LittleBigPlanet was announced for the Playstation 3, it promised to revitalize the faltering platformer genre, as well as provide one of the most unique experiences the video game world has ever seen. The game has already made good on those promises, and can only be expected to deliver more and more unlimited, amazing content. There isn't anything like LittleBigPlanet anywhere. It's an incredible game, and an even more incredible creative tool, putting immeasurable power in your hands. It truly is a near-perfect game.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-23-2010"}

It didn't quite live up to the hype that it recieved and wasn't as good as i expected it to be.  The moves aren't as cool, there aren't as many weapons, and the items become so expensive that you just can't buy them once you need them later in the game.  The graphics are great though, and the new enemies are awesome.  There are more bosses and they aren't impossible to kill (always a plus) and there is even a brief appearance by phantom (the magma spider from DMC).  Now on to the characters. Dante is his usual b@d@ss self and his moves (though more limited than the last one) are very cool to watch (especially the matrix style wall run).  Lucia, on the other hand is just bad[].  She is essentially a much weaker, far less cool version of dante with an even shorter game than dante's ludicrously short playthrough.  Now for my main problem: Plot. Yes, that's right, i'm one of those whackos who needs a good plot before i can enjoy a game.  this one is weak, and set up seemingly halfway through (i have no idea where lucia even came from, much less what the hell she has to do with dante).  to sum up all this crazed ranting: gameplay:good (with dante, anyways) plot: bad.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-26-2003"}

Not only that, but we have three paid accounts here.First, you must know that this box doesn't contain all you need forever, but it's a good start as long as you know this....you can play 'for free' for a trial of ten days (maybe a month in some cases, depending on what free trial you get?) but then..it's FIFTEEN DOLLARS A MONTH TO PLAY.What do you get for that money?You get to make I believe it's NINE characters which I will go into later.  This means mom can make one, dad can make one, the kids can each make one, then you can even make a few more.Once you have those characters, you must delete one to be able to make one new one (or switch realms which I wont go into at all)...BUT only ONE PERSON can play at a time.  So if Dad is playing his Warrior, mom can't play her mage until dad is done.  Thus...you end up with three accounts like me :)Next, you DO NOT HAVE to buy Wrath of Lich King or Burning Crusade now!  Or ever..but those expansions allow what used to be a max level char of 60...to go to 70 and so on.  I know you have no idea what that means if you are new to WOW...just know you don't need them yet.So, you get this, load it, load patches (let me insert something important here.  If you do not have a GOOD computer with a GREAT graphics card, dont bother with warcraft.  This is a HUGE game with basically streaming video and intense graphics.  If you try the free time, it's a good way to know what will slow down your game etc...like the big cities usually will.  My brother in law had an e-machine that was 'only two years old' and it slows and stalls all over the game.) and now you are ready to go...You choose a character (hunters are probably easiest to start off with) and you can change a few things about them like hair and such...but not much. This is no Sim's game.You start out in an area, let's say, and what happens?  There is your hunter..and next to her/him you see a guy with a question mark over his head.  Run over to him, click on him.  He gives you a QUEST...dah dah dum!  Oh the drama...the excitement!  He may tell you to go find 7 of some plant.  You run around that area and will see something sparkle...it's the plant!  You run to them, click on them...them find more.  When you are done with the 7, they stop sparkling to tell you that you are done.  You run back to that guy and turn them in.  WOOHOO!  You get a new quest, some money (copper, silver and eventually gold) and some junk items you can sell for money.All over the game are 'non playing characters' which will buy the junk and give you money.Now the fun part...all over the game are OTHER REAL PEOPLE!  Let's say you log on and find my character running around!  We can run over to eachother, say hello, give eachother gold/silver/copper...chat about stuff, go do quests together in the game!By the way, the game is HUGE. I am not kidding when I say we have all played for a year and a half.  You can start out playing in a snowy area with white tigers and funny looking old dwarfy things...then run to another area that is like a lush jungle with crocs and flying dragons...then to another area that is like being on mars...barren and rocky and tilted :)There is a LOT to do in this game. Questing is the biggest part, you must complete quests like I said to 'level up'.  You start as a level one with limited armor and skills. It's easy to learn what you are doing, slowly, as the game progresses.  Then you complete quests and hit level two! Now you get a new skill, new armor to use!  At the time I wrote this today, the max level is 80.  When you are a level one, you hit level two within moments!  But it took me about a week and a half to go from 78 to 79!Then there are 'professions' etc.  You can learn to fish..super easy to do, just get a pole and some bait (sold all over) and drop your line in the water.  You can do first aid..which means when you loot a bad guy you might get cloth mixed in with that silver/gold and quest items (like the plants we talked about earlier)..which you can click on to make into bandages! It's not tough.I can't multitask much and I'm not born to win at video games.  This game is FUN and you learn as you go.You can also join a guild, which means there are players that have come together to help other players who join their guild.  Fun, super helpful.Rather than go on and on, let me say this...it's fun. It's addictive (the pattern is, you get wow...you play all night at first, then you call in sick to work, you plan your vacations around the game..) and I mean like ADDICTIVE.  But, there are bad things.  First, it's usually down ALL DAY LONG on Tuesdays...every Tuesday, for schedulted maintenance. Trust me, if you play, and are off on Tuesdays, you are going to be mad about this.Also, there are jerks in 'chat'.  You can turn the chat off, and if you have kids I suggest you do.  There is always someone saying something crude in chat.  Blizzard does not care..they offer you to turn off chat or ignore one person at a time.I have not even covered battle grounds...playing lots of players against lots of players! But suffice it to say, in my opinion, this is the greatest game ever designed.  If it was ten a month the whole planet would probably play.  If you have a great pc, get it.  If you only think you do, learn about what you really need to play.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-14-2009"}

Each role seems at least reasonably compelling, as far as the story itself, although why some of the background actions (like the opening war) are not always clearly or believably explained.Story 6.8/10Odin Sphere has been widely praised for its \"beautiful 2D graphics\". Yes, a lot of work has been done including crouching and looking up, but that doesn't save it from looking the same a LOT of the time. There is a great deal of repetition in the moves, enemies, and areas that draws down what should have been a pretty game.Graphics 6/10Sound effects and magic sound appropriate, and you can choose either English or Japanese dub from the start and change that at will from the in-game options menu. However, you can't independently alter voicing or effects. Limited options pulled this score down for meSound 6/10Some of the music is pretty, but the majority of it is the \"barely there background\" type. When I have game music, I like to notice that there IS music rather than it being usually indistinguishable from silence. No options for volume leveling pulls down the score a little.Music 5.7/10Despite there being minute differences between the characters (some characters take longer to use items and eat food), and having nominally different weapons (spears and swords). However, the areas are the same circles and actual game play consists of the exact same 'swing, swing, pause for action gauge to refill, repeat' that got tiring before I finished the first character. It's also extremely easy to be interrupted from attacking or using items - if a boss hits you while you're trying to eat a bun, you drop the item and lose MORE health, and typically are stunned on top of that. Frustrating, not fun. The fact that characters share maps and you'll be running around the EXACT same areas many times does not help.Gameplay 3/10You can replay cutscenes, but as repetitious as the game is you likely won't even want to play the other characters, much less come back to replay the rather linear greater play.Replay 4/10It looks nice and it has both dubs to serve your preferences, but the sound and music seemed lackluster and the frustrating, boringly repetitive gameplay was a quick and consistent disappointment.

Yet after the dust had cleared, at the center of the blast crater is a lone man, Cole. He is in a coma, but has survived the event and neither he nor the world will ever be the same.An everyday guy doing his best to make ends meet, Cole had been a bike messenger. Just before the blast he had been sent to ground zero to deliver a package. In the aftermath of the catastrophe, he awakes to find that somehow he has gained strange electrical powers. Empire City is in shambles though. Riots have erupted, breeding chaos and emboldening powerful criminal gangs hungry for power and profit. In the panic that follows the city is quarantined from the mainland, and television broadcasts packed with damning security camera footage link Cole to the scene of the explosion. Cole is now a wanted man, but his extraordinary electricity-based powers and perhaps a semblance of responsibility for the well-being of Empire City are growing. Who is really responsible for the blast though? As an evolving mystery unfolds, Cole must learn how to wield his newfound powers as he searches for the real culprits behind the blast in an attempt to rescue Empire City from complete anarchy.GameplayBuilt around open-world gameplay where the player decides how to deal with both criminal gangs bent on destruction and devastated citizens who need help, action ininfamouscontains the standard mix of mission play, in which players are given specific goals and activities to meet, and free play scenarios, where you can wander Empire City doing what they will. In both, developing and learning to control Cole's electricity-based powers is crucial. Cole can not actually generate energy, so these powers are based on energy manipulation instead. This manipulation comes in three basic forms: discharge of energy at living or inanimate targets in either diffused or precise bursts; generation of energy shields used as protection against the weapons or special powers of enemies; and the infusion of objects with time-delayed destructive energy for use as grenades or mines. As impressive as these powers are they do have drawbacks though. Because electricity can cause combustion, Cole can not wield firearms and can be hurt by items he blows up. Also, like anything electrically driven, his abilities require a power source. In the damaged, but not destroyed Empire City, these sources can be found throughout the gameplay area, but players must note that certain actions drain energy faster than others and that enemies will become aware of your need of a power source as the game proceeds and accordingly attempt to destroy those sources.This need for power also provides a major illustration of the game's morality system. As battles rage throughout the gameplay area and power sources become either scarce or destroyed, Cole is faced with the ethics of his 'bio-draw' ability. Through this he can harvest electrical energy from living organisms. This will provide the energy needed to survive in a pinch, but may also have consequences as to how the game develops over both the short and long-term. In addition to this, players will also face similar game-changing choices in dealing with more casual scenarios involving the citizens of Empire City. As well intentioned as a hero may be, in many cases he is just as likely to be hated as he is to be praised. Choice is the deciding factor in this, and that resides squarely on the shoulders of players ininfamousKey Game Features:Be a Hero- Take on the role of Cole, an everyday guy and urban explorer, who develops a wide range of electricity-based powers.

A must have for the PS3","reviewText":"PSN iD GremDUDE. This is an excellent game that really shows the power of the PS3. There are little or no load times. YOu have a huge open world to explore. Tons of main missions and side missions to accomplish.In terms of graphics, and gameplay, this game is near the top of my list for the PS3. The story ain't the best(Despite the cool twist at the end) I really did not find myself caring for Cole, Trish or Cole's buddy( I cared so little about him that I forgot his name.)What makes this game cool is the exploration of finding out your new powers and using them against ever increasing power enemies. For the person who said there is no replay value, you are kind of missing the point. If you started a new game with all of your powers, it just wouldn't make sense. More than half of the main story missions involve you going into the subway to gain new powers. If you already have the powers, why would these missions be enjoyable? Once you complete the game, you can still search for the all the shards you missed or just start a new game and play it all evil(or good if you played it evil the first time) This changes the story enough. Seriously, just playing through once with all missions was probably about 20 or 30 hours of gameplay. If you play it again, there is 50 to 60. How much value can you get for your $40??My favorite part of the game is that by the end you feel like a total bad ass which is kind of the whole purpose of video games and this one delivers in spades. The only negative I have has to do with the final boss. SPOILER!!!!GEEEEEZZZZ. He was just ridiculous. I beat him on normal difficulty but honestly, it is more a battle of how long you want to chip away at a gigantic health bar without getting killed. I finally found a the place where the whole game starts(on this lifted section of earth)and then just went around backwards in circles for 20 minutes or so while constantly mashing the R1 button and managed to beat him. WHy bother getting all these powers if you can't use any of them against the final boss--seriously.Besides that, this is a great game you just have to pick up!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-22-2010"}
{"product_name":"B00GANWVJE","description":"","reviewerName":"Destitute","summary":"Classic Zelda is back!","reviewText":"The Zelda franchise is still going strong after over 25 years, yet it's been a while since we've had a traditional &#34;classic&#34; Zelda game. The last two portable entries The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, had the top-down view, but relied on touchscreen gimmicks and weren't quite my cup of tea. But finally, we have some classic Zelda on the go, and it's in the form of a sequel to one of the finest entries, A Link to the Past. Being a sequel, the world map, as well as many of the locations, are similar, and it even has its own Dark World, which is called Lorule (so punny.) However, it's not just a mere copy/paste of its prequel. It has enough changes to make even veteran ALttP players feel like they're experiencing a new game, and the dungeons are all-new.GRAPHICS: Graphically, the game really does feel like what ALttP would look like in a more 3D style, complete with colorful environments, chibi characters. Some of the models can look a little rough around the edges in cutscenes at times, but other than that, it's a joy to look at.MUSIC: Being a sequel to ALttP, a majority of the music is lifted from that game and remixed into something that is quite the nostalgia bomb. I also loved how the overworld music feels more epic the more you progress through the game. It's really quite the ear candy, and the new tracks are great as well.STORY: While I would have liked something that expanded upon the ending of Skyward Sword, this is a decent story. You're a new incarnation of Link from the one in ALttP, who has to fight the wizard Yuga, who's turning people into paintings. It has your basic &#34;Grab the pendents to get the Master Sword and then save the Sages&#34; song and dance. There isn't a whole lot to it, but there are some nice twists that keep it interesting.GAMEPLAY: It's where the game really shines, as you'd expect. If you've played ALttP, a lot of the key mechanics are here, including the fact that there isn't much hand-holding in telling you where to go. Dungeons can actually be completed in different orders, something that you haven't seen in a long time in the Zelda Universe. The dungeons themselves are pretty well-designed, with some puzzles that may stump you. They take advantage of all of the new mechanics in the game. Bosses are easy, but that's a problem that most Zelda games have.Saving is done through various weather vanes throughout the world. Besides telling you that you're playing the game too long (seriously, Nintendo, quit being our nannies,) they can be used as fast travel, too. It's a useful feature in the game, and you'll be using it a lot.Since most of you know how a Zelda game works, I'll cover mainly the new features. First, the painting mechanic. Link is able to merge into walls and turn into a painting, allowing him to cross over gaps, slide through cracks, and travel between Hyrule and Lorule. It's used a lot, and is implemented well. You are invulnerable while as a painting, but you can only be one for a limited time, as you have a magic meter that goes down. The meter is used every time you use a weapon as well. It recharges, sure, but it makes you strategize in what you need to use.Speaking of weapons, no longer are most of them found in the dungeon. Instead, you rent them. They are not too expensive, but if you die, you lose all of them. You can permanently buy them, but each weapon costs a pretty rupee. While I prefer getting my weapons through the dungeons, this is an interesting mechanic, especially since it gives you punishment for dying, something that many games are sadly lacking nowadays. The new weapons are creative, yet I feel like they're a bit lacking when compared to what ALttP had to offer.The sidequests and minigames are fun as well. While some minigames need work, there are a few greats. I enjoyed the tower where you battle in different floors, and I enjoyed finding all of Maiamia's babies, which gave you awesome weapon upgrades.Really, this game is a joy to play, and my few nitpicks are nothing. It's one of the most fun Zeldas in a long time, it's a huge nostalgic rush for the old fans, yet a good one for the newcomers as well. If you have a 3DS and are a Zelda buff, then buy this game and love it.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2013"}

I started reading the reviews and to be true all the gamers here convinced me to buy this game, and you know what, there is no regret on that decision.Even on PS3Forums, the forums I use to visit, there was a thread highlighting that this game was wrongly reviewed, which I agree 100%.First of all, this game ain't an arcade type of fighting, if you are looking for something easy, where you can perform special moves and things like that, the THIS IS NOT YOUR GAME, you should read carefully the reviews, this is a simulation game, more especificlly, a fighting simulation game; as so, yo have to block, move your character back whe you are near your enemy to perform a good hit, things you can normally imagine on a real fight.This game is also aimed to be evaluated as a fitness game, it estimates the calories lost during fights and how much you have accumulated. Which is goog, for I guy like me, who works, want to do some exersises and doesn't want to spend time traveling to a gym. Yeah, you'll get swet near the end of your first two matches, this shows you how good it is.If you are looking for simulation, a real fighting simulation, where you are better when you practice and get fit, the this is your game.

The violence and gore is ridiculously over the and I can see why it was controversial. That being said, I liked it. The violence and gore content is so high that you quickly get used to it and it fades into the background. The graphics are amazing but that's pretty much a given nowadays. The story is fun although the acting is pretty one-dimensional. One reviewer mentioned that there's no difference between the robot Ishi and the human Ishi and that's so true. I'm impressed that the developers came up with such original and awesome new weapons and so many interesting new ways to kill people.

{"product_name":"B003O6E1JS","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason Bean","summary":"A solid, well-made fighter!","reviewText":"I'll admit I haven't played a Mortal Kombat title since the original games came out on Super NES. I was always more of a Street Fighter/Virtua Fighter fan as I liked the more responsive controls and tactical minded gameplay. What Mortal Kombat lacks in speed and precision it makes up for in presentation and brutality. This new Mortal Kombat game is everything a fan could want and is such a well-made package that any fighting game fan should be entertained!The game modes in Mortal Kombat are literally split up into different segments: There's the usual Ladder or 'arcade' mode if you just want to jump in and fight. There's a tag-team mode as well (for fighting with two fighters), and a 'king-of-the-hill' mode which lets you spectate on fights online with your own user-created avatar before taking your turn in the fight. The mini-games like 'test your might' are back in full swing along with different challenge modes. There's even an area you can explore and spend your earned points to unlock alternate costumes and other extras.The one feature that really sets this game apart is it's 'story' mode which features a full-length narrative incorporating each fighter into it's tale. The story itself is silly and over-the-top, but it's entertaining and easy to follow. The only down-point is that the fights in the story are horribly unbalanced so you want to make sure you've tried out each fighter before choosing this mode (though the game does save as you progress).The gameplay in Mortal Kombat is the same, somewhat sluggish fighting we've seen in previous Mortal Kombat games. The gameplay doesn't quite get the adrenaline pumping the way Street Fighter does, but each character controls smoothly and it's easy for anyone to pick up a controller and play. Also, along with the usual super-moves and fatalities there's x-ray moves which let you deliver brutal combos in the middle of a fight while getting a 'Romeo must Die' view of your opponent's internal damage. I did notice slightly longer loading times between each menu and each fight but once the game started I didn't care.The graphics in Mortal Kombat are very stunning and VERY bloody. Your character takes damage in fights as you see bloody scrapes, broken masks and torn clothing. The background levels are very detailed and extremely well-animated. Everything in this game is easy on the eyes (even when covered with blood and gore).While Mortal Kombat doesn't break any new ground in the fighting-game genre, it presents itself as a more complete and accessible package than most fighting games out there. Non-fighting games fans won't be swayed, but if you're a Mortal Kombat fan or just looking for a good-looking, fun-to-play fighting-game to kill some time with this game should fit the bill!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2011"}

Theres lots of cons, and a few pros","reviewText":"The good stuff: every now and then this game will feel like a 3D version of the old 2D Baldur's Gate games.  But it is just a whiff.  The larger storyline is inert, but the characters are interesting.  The voice work is often great, but the visual character models of both allies and enemies are way too generic.  Oh look there a mage in a robe and all of the robes look nearly the same.The disappointing stuff:  Oh geez, the combat.  Everything is on cool-down timers like a MMORPG style game.  And \"fatigue\" will slow your character's timers.  That is the basic concept.  That by itself isn't a deal-breaker but the combat uses grossly overpowered area-of-effect spells like firestorm and icestorm and earthquake that will decimate 95% of your foes before they ever get to you.  Rinse.  Repeat.  At hard difficulty, there's more tactics needed but it is still a simple process of spamming elemental spells at your enemies.  Ice and rock fist are lower level spells that can stop just about anything other than a boss.  The only time you have a challenge is on the rare occasion where there is an enemy mage.  Then you have to make a bee-line for that mage and _then_ spam your elemental spells at the other enemies.BioWare made a genuine effort to make something like a modern version of Baldur's Gate but they also tried to please every kind of gamer.

Featuring enhanced graphics, sound and control, Silent Hill Origins sets a new standard for this survival horror classic.","reviewerName":"Brian Long \"Brian\"","summary":"A great chapter, though porting could've been better","reviewText":"Silent Hill: Origins is essentially a prequel to the orginal Silent Hill game. I'll attempt to speak in vague enough terms so those who haven't played a single installment won't have the experience ruined. You play Travis, a truck driver with a vaguely trouble past, who makes the mistake of chasing a girl he believes he hit with his truck into the titular town of Silent Hill, where he rescues a girl who nearly burned to death in a fire. Following the girl to a nearby hospital, he is suddenly plunged into a world of cult rituals and demonic forces.Graphics: think Silent Hill 1. As this game was based on the PSP, the gameplay graphics a rather blocky, but still manage to create a feeling of unease and general creepiness. I'm a hard sell on this though. I haven't seen anything so far as skin crawling as the general setup of the original. The cutscenes are much better, and were scaled up well, but don't expect anything earth shattering. The combat graphics are also well done, though they can get a touch annoying. The screen darkens and begins to spot out like a very old movie reel.The only downside is brightness, which you cannot control in game. While the game is supposed to be dark, not being able to see you hand in front of your face defeats some of the purpose.Sound: The sound is overblown during the combat scenes, but the death metal is definitely in line with what you'd expect, though the score wasn't expanded much in the port, and could've been redone for the PS2 version with relative ease. While annoying in the extreme, it isn't bad, but nothing stands out as being overly good either.Gameplay: The puzzles so far have reached a happy medium. They aren't spelled out for you, but neither do you need a doctorate degree or be an expert riddler to solve them either. The beginning ones are find and place items, but several are information hunting for combinations and the like, and have a good chunk of general horror.Combat finally begins to make sense. Not only do you have the ability to block some attacks, but you have fists! I never knew you could you those in self-defense! What a concept! In all seriousness, that's been a grip for me from the beginning. Stomping on monsters to kill them though is infuriating, and nearly impossible for a relatively simple command. Weapons finally break, and are inventive, like toaster ovens and TV's, though many weapons do not do a realistic amount of damage given their one shot nature.Story: The character is belivable and well played, though the story needed to be expanded significantly for the PS2, and wasn't. Theres no comments on the fact taht the town is essentially abandonded and overrun with monsters, not to mention the classic clefts in the roadways blocking the easy route from point A to B.All told, this is a nice addition, and barely warrants a 4th star, as it does have some nice creepy added in, but should've been worked more before it was released.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-11-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005B8G1","description":"The Game Boy platform (which includes the original unit, the Game Boy Pocket, and the Game Boy Color) came to market when most video game consoles had a life expectancy of just a few years. More than a decade later, the system is still going strong. How did the Game Boy successfully compete--and in some cases bury--an onslaught of faster, more powerful handheld and home console systems? Let us count the ways: affordability, a huge library of games that consistently made the most of the hardware's limitations, smart power management that extended battery life, and uncluttered controls. But perhaps it was the system's ultraportable design that allowed devotees to play video games around their schedule, making it the must-have system for kids and adults alike.Now the Game Boy Advance (or GBA as people are already calling it) comes to us with power that would have been unthinkable back in the day. The portable's 32-bit RISC CPU runs circles around the former's 8-bit workhorse, allowing it to process program instructions much faster. What that means to everyday gamers is more intricate visuals, more simultaneous movement on the screen, and better sound. In fact, the often-annoying beeps and boops of old-school Game Boy titles are being replaced with digitized stereo sound. The extra processing muscle also means you can even network up to four Game Boy Advance units together, via the communication cable, for multiplayer fun off of one shared cartridge. Only two Game Boy Color units could link together, and each unit had to have its own copy of the game.What's not being replaced, however, is the wide selection of Game Boy games. Because the Game Boy Advance system is backward-compatible, it will play its own line of colorful games--including such launch titles asSuper Mario Advance,F-Zero: Maximum Velocity,Army Men Advance,High Heat Major League Baseball 2002,Tony Hawk's Pro Skater, andReady 2 Rumble Boxing: Round 2--as well as all of the monochrome and color games that have already been released for the previous Game Boy systems (nearly 500 in total). Players can view the older games in their smaller, originally square dimensions, or, with the touch of the shoulder button, expand the game to fit the GBA's larger screen. We tried enlarging the screen on a Game Boy Color edition ofTony Hawk's Pro Skater 2and found that Mr. Hawk was much easier to see.When you first pick up the system, you'll be amazed at how lightweight it is. At fewer than 5 ounces and a little larger than a deck of playing cards, the system easily fits into a shirt pocket without any sag. The GBA's wider shape fits better into a wider range of hands. The former design too often pushed the left and right thumb knuckles together during gameplay. The new layout should be comfortable for all ages, and the center screen orientation makes it easy to see.Game Boy Color owners will find the GBA's larger screen somewhat darker than they're used to, but that's because the screen is outfitted with antiglare technology. Like the old Game Boy Color, the color LCD is not backlit, so you need pretty good light to play by. Unlike that system, though, you won't be craning your neck and tilting the unit to see around the hot-spot reflection of the light bulb in your screen.But you'll also notice the graphics. Sporting what's basically a redesigned SNES technology, you'll see things on the GBA that the big consoles do, such as scaling (making objects larger or smaller) and rotation effects--technological advances that will affect the look of everything from crossing a finish line to throwing a touchdown pass to crawling through a dungeon.Some might argue that Nintendo could have tried to put even more power into this Game Boy Advance. After all, the 32-bit video game had its heyday more than five years ago. Perhaps, but after handling this new handheld, we're inclined to think that Nintendo wisely struck a balance between size, price, and power consumption. And considering how well the old 8-bit system weathered the decade's technological storms, we think the Game Boy Advance is here to stay, and we're glad.--Porter B.

I, at the time, was also quite exited, as I had been wanting a GBA for over a year.  Well, when she bought the system (I myself bought an XBOX instead), and played it for a few hours, she loved it.  I, persounally, was easily bored.  \"Why?\"1) Games: Not too good.  I've played dozens, and I haven't really found one that I enjoyed.  For example, Mario Kart Advance for the GBA.  You can race as 8 characters in dozens of arenas.  You try to get 1st place in any arena.  Sure, this is fun, but after a few hours, it gets pretty dull.  The screen is small and sitting there looking straight down at it hurts your neck, the controls are limited with just four buttons.  And the truth is, 90% percent of the games are aimed at kids.  Your not going to find a really deep RPG, or an awsome fighter, or even a decent shooter.  The graphics here are still handheld, and the most this system can support is Mario.The games are usually quick, easy to beat, and lose interest after a few hours of gameplay.  I was not impressed by the games that I played, the controls, and the graphics.  It it pretty fun on a road trip, but around home, it gets BORING.As for the few good games you do find, they are quite fun.  But is it something you're going to be playing for 20-30, even 40 hours?  Ask yourself before u make this investment, as most of the games itself cost 20,30, even ...bucks each.  Are these games right for u?2) The system itself: Very good system actually.  It can play all current and past Game Boy games (Game Boy, Game Boy Pocket, Game Boy Color, etc...).  Meaning u can probably find a few ... Game Boy Color games that will keep you entertained for hours.  But u know, your old Game Boy Color can do that too!The Game Boy Advance is very small, and can easily be brought along on a road trip, in a purse or back pack, or even some big pockets.  And for how small it is, it can do a lot.  You can connect up to 4 Game Boy Advance's together and race each other in Mario Kart, or battle in a game of Sonic.  It can hook up to a TV, or even link to a local GameCube, and be used as an additional controller, be used to visit special levels in games on via GC and GBA (Animal Crossing comes to mind), and it even has headphones, so u can enjoy your favorite Mario game during a long bus ride or use them to not disturb others on a roadtrip.  It can do a lot of things, and is probably the greatest handheld ever made.  That's why it's sold millions, that's why I enjoy playing it.On the down-side, it can't support graphics like major consoles can (for example: Madden, Tony Hawk, etc...both looked TERRIBLE) as most of those games look decent at best and are in 2D.  It only has 4 buttons, so its hard to enjoy any games that require a lot of options (sports games, fighting games, games that require tricks, etc...).  And by far the system's WORST problem:THE LIGHTING!: You can never see the screen.  You have to turn a lamp on (sitting next to your couch) or carlight to play it...in broad daylight.  In roadtrips, you'll always find yourself aiming the screen right at the window for light, and even then u can't read text or see much detail in color!  The Game Boy Advance can't be played half the time because in many places, u JUST CAN'T SEE!  And even with those handy snake lights, they take up 2 or 3 batteries every few hours, and cause glares...even more seeing problems!  This took a large part of MY enjoyment, and brought my rating of the GBA down from a 4 out of five stars to 3.3) Overall- The GBA is a very advanced system.  It has a HUGE lineup of games, not just for the GBA, but all of the old Game Boy, Game Boy Color, Game Boy pocket, etc...It has a ton of features, and while it can't support Super Mario Sunshine, it's graphics look awsome in games like Super Mario Advance 2.

Obtain a disguise, find a way in, and silently finish the job unnoticed--or kick down the front door with guns blazing and take everybody out. It's completely up to you how to fulfill the contract. Be warned, some of your targets are heavily guarded, as well as completely paranoid. They'll be expecting you.","reviewerName":"bayou_hannibal \"bayou_hannibal\"","summary":"Fell short of my expectations","reviewText":"I never played the original \"Hitman\" because it had no in-level save function, but I was eagerly awaiting the release of \"Hitman 2\".  It definitely takes a leap forward as far as being the \"thinking man's shooter, and it has a handful of levels that are so good, they make the game worth buying.  This game falls short in a few crucial areas though.The AI for this game is extremely tough, and the best I have ever seen.  Not when it comes to firefights, but when it comes to remaining undetected.  Doing anything suspicious while you are disguised will almost certainly get you caught.  The AI is so sophisticated, that you will arouse suspicion if you carry an unusual weapon.  For instance, if the guards in the area normally carry AK-47's, and you're carrying a sniper rifle, you're going to get attacked.For the most part, the graphics and animation for this game are great, as well as the music.  The voice acting is great.  \"Agent 47\" is simply a great main character for a video game.  He's like Garrett, from \"Thief\", except he's big and bald.  The graphics are so detailed, that you can look at shadows on the wall to see what weapon you are carrying.  Some of the environments look astonishing, like a snowy mountain valley at night, and a penthouse apartment overlooking the big city.There are some truly fantastic levels in this game.  These are the parts that exceed the game's lofty expectations.  This is the only game where you can sneak past 25 guards and kill your \"mark\" without firing a shot, and then sneak out.  In this game you can pose as a flower delivery man, a doctor, a Russian soldier, a bodyguard, a patient, a pizza delivery boy - the list is endless.  The variety for completing these levels is also endless.  You can frequently find circuit breakers and shut all the lights off, and in one level, you can start a false fire alarm to distract everyone.  Using lots of stealth requires immeasurable patience (not to mention tolerance for reloading your saved games), but it's worth it.  I love that feeling of devious satisfaction that you get from nonchalantly walking out of a building past the clueless guards (right after whacking their boss).  The \"professional\" kill is a feeling that no other game has.Unfortunately, every time that I was ready to fall in love with this game, it would throw out a stupid and poorly designed \"commando\" level that spoils the \"Hitman\" theme.  There are some really bad levels in this game that appear to be in there just as filler.  They generally involve the \"boss\" being so well-guarded that the only way to complete the level is by gunning down everything in sight.  There is one level where you have to kill a guy who is guarded by four thugs in the room, and then plant something on his body.  The only way to finish the level is by killing all of them.  This ends up being absurdly easy, since your \"hitman\" can take more bullets than a tank.  There is another level where you have to avoid a bunch of snipers who can somehow see through your disguise from 1,000 feet away.  Thus, these bad levels are impossible using stealth, and way too easy using aggression.  It's poor level design.The storyline for the game is weak.  It's  too bad, because the game could have been better if it had an exotic plot to match all of the exotic locations that you go to.  \"Deus Ex\" and \"No One Lives Forever\" succeeded at this, but this game fails.The interface and the controls generally stink.  It's probably due to this game being a multi-platform game, instead of just a PC game.  The camera is very unresponsive to the mouse, unless you crank the mouse sensitivity up to the highest setting.  When you do this, it makes the menus almost unusable, because of the hypersensitive mouse.  The mapping function is mediocre and underdeveloped.  The maps look bland and ugly, like something you would have seen in a game made five years ago.  This game sorely needs a mini-map, but as-is, there is only a map screen.  When you look at the map, you must remain stationary, but your enemies continue to move.  This becomes annoying when you are trying to plot a path to avoid the guards.Should you buy this?  If you are a huge fan of the first \"Hitman\", or if you enjoy thinking man's action games like \"Thief\" and \"Deus Ex\", then you will enjoy this game.  It still gives you an experience that no other game can give you.  The great levels in the game make it worth playing through its faults.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-29-2002"}

An ice covered planet called Tau Volantis has been found along with the ruins of an old colony.  It's revealed that this planet is the Marker home world which spawns the undead Necromorphs.  More startling is that someone apparently found a way to turn off the markers and stop the Necromorph outbreak.You once again play as Isaac Clarke, the beleaguered engineer protagonist of the first two entries.  Clarke has been living in hiding after the events of in Dead Space 2 but soon soldiers of the last battalion of EarthGov track him down to enlist his aid.  He at first refuses until he finds out the woman he loves, Ellie Langford, has gone missing along with her team on Tau Volantis.The action begins immediately as Clarke and the two soldiers are ambushed by Unitologist forces, a zealous order that has sprung up that worships the Markers.  Isaac will travel to Tau Voltanis, first to find Ellie, and then to make his way across the frozen wastes of the planet, battling the Necromorphs and making an even more startling discovery about the planet and its nearby moon.Dead Space 3's story unfolds itself often in cluttered, confusing chucks but that is pretty much on a par with the previous games in the series.  Subtlety has never been the franchise's strong point.  But what it might lack in comprehension it more that makes up with its visuals and ability to build tension.  I've never played a game that took place in a snow covered environment that felt so real.  You also feel like the strength of the wind and the show pelting you with threaten to knock you down.The game's soundtrack and sound effects meticulously add to the terror of the environments that you can feel as your heart pounds away, unsure of what lies behind the next corner.  Noises come from all sides, and you're often not sure if the threat is close or nipping at your heels.Dead Space 3 introduces several new gameplay elements that make the game as much a shooter as a survival horror.  First we get true drop in and drop out co-op play.  Your partner will play as Sergeant John Carver and what's cool is that the players will experience the game in different ways.  One play may see something that the other does not or find himself trapped against a horde of Necromorphs.  Co-Op play also opens ups several optional co-op only side missions.The Weapons Bench is a new weapon upgrading system that allows the player to cobble together pieces of different weapons found within the game to create all new weapons. This can make for some ultra-cool weapon combos and while the process can be time consuming it is never boring and you feel like a mad scientist throwing together parts to make something completely unique.  Also added is an organic cover system which will allow the player character to grab cover when it makes sense instead of having to always need to execute a button push.And you will need all of the best weapons you can build to takeout the Necromorph enemies, including several new insidious versions.  As always blowing the limbs off the Necromorphs is a great way to dispatch them but new enemies will require new tactics to kill them in the most efficient way.Despite a storyline which is flat and sometimes repetitive, Dead Space 3's deep weapons system, fantastic combat, and incredible graphics makes this one another winner.  Figure upon 10 - 20 hours to complete the campaign, depending upon how many side missions you do and how much time you spend looking for loot.Tim Janson, Mania Entertainemnt","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-07-2013"}

Unfortunately BORDERLANDS is not one of them.There have been excellent RPG/FPS hybrids, likeFallout 3orS.T.A.L.K.E.R.. But BORDERLANDS is not one of them either. And, this is not even the real problem. The real problem with BORDERLANDS is that it does not even know what it is...trying to be!The graphics are color-book cartoonish. They did stay inside the lines but they get no brownie points for the end result. Unique designs and creative explosions are nowhere to be found; instead, the environments look like they were designed with a cookie cutter. Loose focus for a moment and you might find yourself hallucinating of having entered a violent PIXAR cartoon - complete with a Wall-e lookalike. One without a real story that is.For a game that pretends to be an RPG it makes no real difference what \"class\" you choose to be (the hunter, the siren, the soldier, or the berserker), the \"special abilities\" fail to offer distinctive flavors. Leveling up is just window-dressing, as the enemies not only they re-spawn but they seem to match your level. And, on top of that, the quests are really boring (I had not been so bored with an RPG ever since that pathetic sequel to a great game,Dungeon Siege II).Speaking of DSII, remember how paying to have your weapons enchanted was useless because the items you could buy outright were far superior? Guess what, the quest rewards are far better than anything you can find. Sure, there are different weapons galore but quantity of weapons could never outweigh a couple of well-thought out weapons.Finally, could someone please explain to me since when do CPUs need...drivers - and what is this stupidly packaged game doing installing an AMD DRIVER on my INTEL i7 PC? Honestly!Now, let's talk DRM. Again, 2K GAMES insists on special, custom-made versions of SecuROM. Using SecuROM as a disc-check is my red line. I can accept it as a barely palatable solution. BORDERLANDS is supposed to do only that but it clearly cannot shake its RootKit ...pedigree.There have been reports from gamers who managed to buy the game before the official release date and could not activate the game before that. That's right BORDERLANDS requires OnLine ACTIVATION (one can install offline ONLY after downloading and installing a third party LICENSE driver). So much for a simple disc-check...An OnLine ACTIVATION means you do NEVER ACTUALLY OWN the copy of the game you paid for. The possibility of you reinstalling and replaying the game again in the future depends on the availability of the required activation servers AND the will of the game publisher to ALLOW you to do so (neither of them a given).I find it infringing on my rights as a consumer and a citizen when the products I pay in full get stolen back by the seller himself under the guise of ...\"fighting piracy\" (an ironic excuse already).BioShockwas a good game ruined by its overzealous DRM scheme. In the end its publisher smelled the over-brewed coffee and had the Installation Limits (but not the Activation requirement) removed.  At the time of its release BIOSHOCK was a good game but not good enough to be worth its trouble.Well, BORDERLANDS is not even good.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-30-2009"}

I am not a big fan of strategy RPGs so this game was a bit of a hard sell for me. I'm still not a big fan of them, but this game is about the best you can get. Certainly on a portable system. The controls, level design, interactiveness, etc. are all perfect. I particularly appreciated how they took advantage of the 3DS's capabilities despite being essentially sprite-based. There is also a great deal of character interaction including a marriage system where you can set your characters up. This can lead to a sort of creepy eugenics race where \"breeding\" the correct pairs leads to superior offspring, but if you ignore thinking too much about that then the interactions are just fun. There are an awful lot of sidequests and extra options to pursue here once the main story is done. The game itself can be completed in about forty hours, but if you want to get all the dialogue options it can take over a hundred.

{"product_name":"B00AKIPBNS","description":"","reviewerName":"ChibiNeko \"Sooo many books, so little time!\"","summary":"Very fun!","reviewText":"I was curious about this game, but I was ultimately pushed to get it because of the GameStop clerk's ringing endorsement that this was one of the best tactical RPGs released on Nintendo's handheld system, and certainly the best one this year. Best ever? I might hold back on that as the first two Golden Sun games will always have a certain spot in my heart. Despite this, there's no denying that this is definitely an addicting and immersive game with relatively decent replay value.The first thing that will strike a lot of gamers will be the graphics. They're stunning for a 3DS, at least in my opinion. There's a huge attention to detail in the fight scenes, the characters, and to my joy- the backgrounds. That's often something that has to be occasionally sacrificed on the handheld systems, as constantly moving backgrounds can sometimes trigger glitches or eat up memory space. Not so here, as you can see various background bits move about, such as small animals in the margins of the screen. I didn't pay much attention to the 3D aspect since it tends to hurt my eyes at worst and is distracting at best, although it was decently done. The music and voice acting were both well done, and occasionally I'd turn the sound on just so I could hear the BGM or the occasional snippet of dialogue. The real cream in the graphics coffee would have to be the animated portions that would show up at the most key points of the story. They're fun to watch, although there is one live action frame that was pretty surprising and well done.The game play is somewhat of your typical tactical experience, which is something I absolutely adore. What pushes this above other tactical games is that you have the option to pair up your characters with others and gain bonuses for this action. If a fighter is directly paired with someone or standing alongside another character, that other character gives a bonus during the fight- either a boost in stats or an extra attack. If you're directly attacked, the other person can block for you. This can be invaluable when you're trying to grind up lower level characters... and you will want to grind to get them higher, as certain characters can gain a closer relationship with one another and gain a better bonus. Depending on who it is, some of these characters can even fall in love and have kids, who you can later pair off with whomever you want. This is probably one of the more intriguing parts of the game for me, as the Avatar can marry anyone of the opposite gender of either generation. It doesn't make an overwhelming impact for the game, as the female characters will have the same child regardless of the father, but depending on who you pair together the stats for the progeny might change.Overall I really loved this. The additions didn't keep the grinding aspect from having the usual tedium, but it was still incredibly fun. So much fun that I actually gave in and bought some of the extra \"chapters\" available through the portal. There's really a lot that you can do here that's aside from the main gameplay, which is why I believe it has a decent amount of replay value- especially since replay will allow you to hook up with those characters you didn't choose the first time around. Die-hards will want to play all of the chapters, even the ones they have to pay for, as those help explain a little more of the story that you didn't get to see.

Keywords: Playground of Destruction.  You can blow anything up, hijack anything, and, just like in GTA, when you die you magically appear good as new at the local hospital, or Allied MASH in Mercenaries.  As a long-time fan of the Grand Theft Auto series video games (I own them all on every platform), Mercenaries is my kind of game.By the way, I am aware that everybody is comparing this game to Grand Theft Auto and I try not to follow in everybody's footsteps, but this game is so much like GTA it is not even funny.  The first thing that popped into my mind when I played this game was, \"Wow...this is Grand Theft Auto: Korean War.\"  Play the game once and you'll agree.Upon hearing the great things about it from a friend of mine in my Sociology class (what a place to hear about shoot-em-up games), I went out and rented it for my Playstation 2...I was hooked.  How sweeter could it get?  It was like my two favorite games, GTA and Battlefield, collided into one entity.  Grand Theft Auto-style mayhem with an open-ended storyline (killer for gameplay, I might add) in a war-torn Korea.  When I heard the game was released on the X-box, I had to buy it for the X-box.Like all other well-made X-box games, this game has got superior graphics and sound.  Even during explosions in dense fog (which actually looks like fog), the game does not lag a bit.  It is smooth, crisp, and easy on the eyes.  Hook this game up to a Dolby Digital 5.1 receiver, and you'll think you were actually in the combat.  The sound in this game is great.  The one thing I was very impressed with, however, were the games controls.  They were easy to learn, and very easy to manage in-game.All-in-all this game is incredible.  The open-ended storyline that you can shape the way you want it each time you play the game gives it one major improvement over all the Grand Theft Auto games, but still keeps that GTA style alive in a warfare simulation.  If you are a die-hard or somewhat-die-hard fan of the GTA series video games, and you're like most gamers out there who beg for intense war simulations, then this game will tickle both those fancies simultaneously.  For any X-box gamer out there, this game easily is a \"must add to your collection\" title.  You won't be disappointed.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-13-2005"}

Your Decisions.","reviewerName":"Yu-jin &amp; Tracy Chia \"Yu-Jin Chia\"","summary":"Just when you thought you'd seen it all...","reviewText":"Let's face it, the Real Time Strategy genre is getting old, and I don't just mean that it's been around for a while (which it has). One might say the same for WW2-themed games of any sort. How, then, can a WW2-themed RTS possibly be one of the best PC games of this year? I'm still not entirely sure what the answer to this question is, but I do know that Company of Heroes fits the bill.Anything coming from Relic can be expected to have decent production values, but for CoH they have outdone themselves. This is a title spit-shined and polished to do any parade ground GI proud. I happen to be a military history buff, and can attest to the fact that what you see and hear in this game is the genuine article. The campaign story could have been taken, practically verbatim, from the pages of Stephen Ambrose's \"Band of Brothers\" and \"Citizen Soldiers,\" making the game's name more than apt.First and foremost, the graphics are impressive. And by impressive, I mean they are clearly superior to any RTS to date. The units, down to uniforms and weapons, look real. They animate realistically, and the environments are detailed to the point that they resemble pictures taken during the war. Even the mission briefings look like what you'd see in a military ready room. I've heard it said that the game can crawl on older systems, but it ran perfectly smooth with all settings turned up to max on my (admittedly high-end) rig. Stability is superb- I have not seen the game crash a single time.The game's sound is likewise superb, with excellent voice acting and the best effects I've heard in any RTS to date. There's liberal profanity, which is one of the reasons this game is rated what it is, but this is realistic. Being shot at and shelled tends to warrant expletives. When artillery comes down it actually sounds like artillery, and your men will let you know if they're in the middle of it.As can be expected, the AI is advanced. Troops move and react realistically, dropping behind cover or falling prone if under fire. Units support each other and lay down suppressing fire. The computer can be downright brutal, even on moderate difficulty settings.Campaign design is superb, and multiplay is available. Gameplay in general is somewhat similar to the earlier Warhammer: Dawn of War, especially in terms of the strategic point system. The big difference is that there's different kinds of points and 3 different resource types, and the points must be linked in a chain to your headquarters to provide anything. Innovations include the use of resources to facilitate special attacks, most of which don't require any sort of research, as they do in other games. For example, you can have infantry throw grenades, provided you have enough munitions available.The one big downside is there's only two factions- Axis and Allies, but there's also separate commander 'trees' for each side. Axis (essentially the Germans) have Blitz, Terror, and Defensive; Allies (essentially the Americans) have Infantry, Armor, and Airborne. You gain experience by completing objectives or destroying enemy forces, and then spend points in one of these trees. The differences are significant, so there's essentially 3 ways to play each side. Additionally, the two sides are very different to play, with unique weapons and abilities.I'll readily admit, despite the fact that I was once a hard-core RTS player, I've started to lose faith in the genre and stray to things that were formerly of secondary interest- most particularly, RPGs and MMORPGs. However, Company of Heroes has demonstrated to me that there is hope yet. In fact, it's the only game that has actually managed to divert my attention from World of Warcraft; no easy task, I can assure you. If you have even a passing interest in real time strategy or World War 2, you owe it to yourself to get this game as soon as possible.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-16-2006"}
{"product_name":"B00005QDPZ","description":"Star Wars Rogue Leader: Rogue Squadron IIfeatures some of the  best graphics ever seen on a home console, and it is a proper, old-fashioned,Star Warsgame. If those two facts don't raise at least an eyebrow of  your interest, then there's probably not much in the world of video games that  will. Thankfully, the jaw-dropping graphics are matched up to a very playable  shoot-'em-up concept that works as a slightly more in-depth version of the PS2'sStar Wars Starfighter,  except without any of thatEpisode Inonsense. Rather, it re-creates  everything from the Death Star trench run to the Battle of Hoth.The game is actually a sequel toRogue Squadronfor the N64--an excellent  game that many only remember from the rather lackluster PC version. It's  structurally very similar to the original, with a dozen or so levels and a Star  Destroyer full of secret levels and ships. The game does feature a few new  ideas, such as controllable wingmen and ground troops, and some of the levels  are set in deep space rather than planetside, but at its heart this is stillRogue Squadrondeluxe.What elevates the game to an object of worship is the graphics--they really do  look almost identical to the movie's, with several scenes appearing like exact  copies. The ships move with a fluidity and grace you wouldn't have thought  possible from such a tiny purple cube. The only flaw is that the missions are  needlessly short, but there's plenty of replayability, and by gosh there's those  graphics.--David Jenkins--Amazon.co.uk","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Great for flight lovers, but others should test first","reviewText":"Subtitled Rogue Squadron II, this GameCube game lets you fly spaceship in the Star Wars universe and take on the original Star Wars universe.I've always been a huge fan of space combat games, from the other Star Wars games to the Wing Commander games. The graphics were very nice, but not hugely better than those other games. The flying and ships are in the same arena.The gameplay itself is pretty straightforward. Eleven missions, each with its own objectives. They're not always clear about where to go next or what to do. If you die, you're sent back to the beginning of a section to start again. If you happen to catch on, this means you can win the entire game in a few hours. if you happen to get stuck on a given area, you could be replaying the exact same scene OVER and OVER again.Definitely a must-have for any true Star Wars fan, to relive the fun of that first movie.

This game is hugely ambitious, featuring an expansive story with multiple endings, a large cast of characters, varied locations, hundreds of quests - all wrapped in a detailed and lovingly crafted world that is a unique mix of sci-fi and fantasy. It also has one of the most annoying and amateurish interfaces I have ever dealt with in an RPG, not to mention a few other blunders that will routinely spoil your pleasure as you play.To summarize quickly: You play Geralt, a member of a dying breed of Witchers. Witchers are mutants of some sort, capable of using magic and genetic enhancements to augment their natural talents. These they put to use to survive in their trade - monster hunting. While useful, Geralt's \"witcherness\" causes all sorts of problems too, mostly because everyone seems to be a flaming racist. Dwarves hate Elves, Elves hate humans, and everyone hates Witchers. Fortunately, Geralt has lost his memory so he (like you) gets to wander Temeria as a blank slate. Your ultimate goal is revenge, and as you make progress you will have to make choices that will change which quests you get later down the line. There is an emphasis on realism here that is in stark contrast to games like Oblivion - no matter what you do, you will not be able to do every possible quest on the first playthrough because some choices will exclude these quests from the story. All told, the land, characters and history of the world in which the Witcher takes place are explored in some depth, giving one the impression of being part of a real, living and breathing culture.Ok, so how does a game set in such a compelling world actually play?First, the Pros:- Hours and hours of play time. The main story has more than 6 chapters and after a good 20 hours of play time I was still on chapter two. There are so many side-quests and optional areas to explore, people to talk to, and items to find...there's never any lack of things to do.- Beautiful locations: lovingly crafted environments from swamps to castles to mountain peaks. The level designers really did a fantastic job.- Main story: It's really intricate and well done. You'll find yourself wanting to keep playing and playing to learn more about this world and uncover the mystery of Geralt's past.- The enhanced edition comes with the strategy guide which is very useful for getting a hint when you're stuck.Now, the cons:- Ugh, some of the voice-acting is terrible and much of the dialogue is uninspired. There are a few excellent voices, and the random NPC chatter is well done, but for the most part the critical cutscenes are marred by SoCal accents and flat deliveries.- Interface woes abound. Inventory management is a particularly frustrating chore, especially given that this game is not really about collecting loot. It's hard to tell what items you have at a glance, impossible to determine what the value of an item is, and so on. Using potions and switching weapons is central to effective combat, but the mechanics of doing so are far from seamless. Learning the hot-keys helps with the whole pause:switch-weapon,switch-combat-style game mechanic but it doesn't completely mitigate the action-killing effect of getting cut to pieces while the sword switch animation plays out.- Loading screens everywhere. Boo.Ultimately, this game is only worth playing if you're really into the genre, in which case, it is totally worth playing. Otherwise, I can't see a person putting up with all the frustrations and quirks of this game. Recommended for fans of fantasy RPGs, but not the casual kind - be prepared to earn your enjoyment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-20-2011"}

It is somewhat larger than a 360/PS3 controller, but it has a very good weight, and the buttons and d-pad are nice.  As for its shortcomings, my biggest obstacle in fully enjoying this controller is the placement of the buttons.  They simply do not work tucked underneath the right analog stick.  They are also too far inside the controller area, so it can be a stretch to press the Y button.  I've only played Ninja Gaiden 3, and having to constantly mash the Y button actually causes a bit of strain on your thumb (at least it does on mine).  Also, I hate that the ZR and ZL buttons are not analog like their 360/PS3 counterparts.As far as compatibility, keep in mind that as of the date of this review, the Wii U is still a brand new console.  Like the original Wii Classic Controller, the Wii U Pro Controller only works with games that support it.  And right now, the Wii U's library is decidedly small.  You will need to look at the back of the games' cases to see if it will support this controller.  However, it is certainly worth buying if you have a game that does support it.  In the case of Ninja Gaiden 3, this controller is practically a necessity as the Wii U GamePad is too bulky to comfortably play a button-masher like that game.  I really wish it were compatible with New Super Mario Bros. U though...and there's really no reason for it to require the GamePad other than Nintendo's insistence that we use it.  Also, as of today, it is not compatible with original Wii software, which is a shame.  Hopefully this will be patched later.So yeah, not the greatest controller ever made, but it's still highly competent and fairly necessary to get full enjoyment out of some games.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

Knapp \"ViperMan\"","summary":"This game SUCKS.","reviewText":"It's disappointing to me how games like this get such rave reviews - how the almighty dollar can propel a game far further than it should be.Modern Warfare 2 is one of those games.  It's nothing special, it's certainly nothing new, it redefines NOTHING in the first-person shooter genre, and yet it's raved as \"the best game of 2009.\"  Bull.  Absolute bull.Here's what you do in MW2.  You run through crazy action scenes following a nearly nonsense plot, and participate in super-scripted events.  You can't deviate from the plan - there's no creativity allowed whatsoever.  You follow the instructions, point, and shoot.What's even more frustrating is that some of the things we've come to expect from any shooter game is blatantly missing from this game - like any kind of cover system.  What's even more frustrating is that you'll watch the AI - on both sides of the fence - make awesome moves like rolling from cover to cover, blind firing, hugging doorways and corners...  but you can't do any of that.  So in the end it's just more running and gunning.And God the gunning - it's never been more frustrating.  Now I'll admit that I'm not much of a FPS fan - it's not really my cup of tea.  I enjoy RPG's that give you more of a system that allows you to improve your skills, and feel a natural progression through the game.  But I've never died so much at regular difficulty in any game... ...ever.  Of course, all you have to do is die enough times until you memorize what happens, because the game doesn't deviate from it's plan under any means whatsoever.This game is simply boring.  There's no challenge except finding the ambition to keep playing.  And there are dozens of FPS games that are much better than this.  I found Gears 2 much more fun to play, and I didn't like Gears 2 much, either!I gave it two stars for some memorable moments, such as using the predator missiles.  I also enjoyed using the Javelin rockets in one particular mission.  Unfortunately those moments were few and far between, and only briefly gave you the feeling that you were actually doing anything to help move the battle in your direction.  The rest of the time you just felt like you were following a pre-determined path, and hoping that you'd only have to RE-follow that path 2 or 3 more times...I can also say that multiplayer is passable.  It's still nothing new, except rewarding you for multiple deaths as encouragement to keep trying.  There's also some neat rewards for success, though I rarely get those...  In the end it's still more running and gunning, but at least it isn't scripted.Kids, if you're going to spend your entire lives as couch potatoes playing video games, at least get a game that demands more of you - a game that requires you to manage a team, or an inventory, or a character.  Games like Fallout, Oblivion, Mass Effect, Dragon Age - games that require more than just \"follow the instructions until you're done.\"I told myself, \"Don't buy this game.\"  I'm glad I listened, as I drop it into the return box at Hollywood Video...","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-17-2010"}

Now if you wanted a better story I can say it is good but it doesnt have the same effect as the first Modern Warfare. This one is more about the action and excitement compared to the first which led up to it and surprised you with a big epic moment! I still like the story alot but others may not.On the other hand, the was multiplayer a lot more then I was expecting! Everything is great and will keep you playing for a very long time. The perks are the biggest change. There are so many perks to make each person unique with what they choose. Off the top of my head I cant remember the names of the perks, so I'll say what they do.

Every perk also has a pro ability which is an upgraded version of that perk and very much worth earning it. The multiplayer is also very in depth as well. Everything is at your disposal! You can upgrade anything and everything to make this experience even better. One thing that really dissapointed me was no Party Chat during alot of the multiplayer game modes.

Hopefully there's a patch or a new game mode for party chat. Also you can't change the look of your multiplayer character. Sucks but it isnt necessary. Everything else is great though.Last but not least is the Special Op's mode. They are short and straight to the point missions either solo or Co-op with a bud. It reminds me of Rainbow Six: Vegas Terrorist hunt or Gears of War's 2 Horde modes. They are very fun and add a lot to extend how long you were going to play this game anyways.

Pohle","summary":"Great game, despite a technical problem with 3rd party fighting sticks....","reviewText":"I really like this game, it has got great presentation, the controls are responsive and precise, and it is definitely a nostalgia trip for those familiar with the previous games.  The fatalities are cringe worthy.  Anyhow, this review is really not so much a reflection of the game (there's not much I can say about it if you're familiar with the previous games, if not read all the other 5 star reviews) as it is bringing to light a technical issue that I haven't seen mentioned anywhere else.  I just would like to forewarn buyers about a fairly significant problem regarding 3rd party arcade fighting sticks if you own one and don't intend to play with the controller.I own my own Hori stick. The thing is, the game will not allow for me to create my own custom button layout. The nature of the Hori stick's button positioning makes all the different attacks, blocking, and throwing to be all OVER the place using the 360 controller's default button assignments. This of course would not be such a problem if I could go into the options and reconfigure it, which strangely the game allows and tells you it saves. But then I try training and various other modes, and it defaults back. I go back into the options, and there's my layout. I play the game, it's the way it was. There are four other pre-sets that can be selected while playing and they work, but are still inadequate and not what I want. Some make it even worse.Now if you don't mind playing with the controller, then no worries.....buy this. But for anyone with your own arcade stick (I can only speak for Hori's here, but have heard of others having the same problem), you should be aware that you may not be able to re-assign the buttons to how you want.  On the other hand, I've read of other sticks working fine (someone mentioned the SF tournament one works great).  What I DO know is that Hori's doesn't.  To me it looks like a glitch and will hopefully be patched soon.  So if you own a Hori stick, beware.  If you're unsure I'd say rent it first if playing with an arcade stick is really important to you to see if it is configurable to your liking.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-22-2011"}

This is a bit of a change for GTA. Previous games had good, but not great, graphics.*The story, in-game music, and radio DJ's, as most gamers know, have always been an integral part of the GTA experience. Rockstar has maintained its usual high standards in these areas. A great new feature is that each radio station plays its songs in a random order instead of repeating the same sequence ad infinitum.*Rockstar has changed the default driving controls to match the setup in most racing games, where the accelerator and brakes are on the trigger buttons rather than the X-O-^-' buttons. I'm sure a lot of people welcome this change but I prefer the old configuration. Fortunately, Rockstar lets players customize the controls somewhat.*It's not as easy to memorize all the streets, shortcuts, and alleys as it used to be. That's why a lot of the cars have GPS. Get used to using the GPS system in conjunction with the traditional map and radar screens--you're going to need it!*Vehicle storage is limited to 2 per safehouse. This is a bummer if you like to collect vehicles and aircraft.*Having money to spend is more important than ever because \"free\" weapons and ammo are few and far between. What makes this a bit of a drag is that outside of completing missions, there is really only one (very labor intensive) way to earn cash.*Perhaps the biggest difference between GTA4 and the rest of the series is that GTA4 keeps the player almost exclusively focused on advancing the storyline. Many of the minigames of the past have been drastically shortened or removed altogether. Hidden Packages are still in the game (as something that needs to be shot to be collected) but there aren't any incremental rewards for finding them. Overall, there is a lot less reason to throughly explore the entire game map. It's a pity because the city is incredibly detailed and has lots of nooks and crannies to discover.Bottom line: a very good game that is just short of being a full knockout.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-09-2009"}

{"product_name":"B000AVBFU8","reviewerName":"mdizzog","summary":"Pretty Good RPG","reviewText":"Tales of Legendia is a lot like the recent Tales of Symphonia. All of the \"Tales\" games have been very similar and they've made suddle changes each game that makes each one play a bit differently. There are many good things about this game.One of the best things about the game are the graphics. At first, you might hate them. The first dungeon looks terrible in my opinion, however over the game the graphics improve. Some of the dungeons are extremely well done, and each one has a different style. The character designs themselves are really good. At first I was a little bit put off, but after a few battles they grow on you.Another great thing about the game is the voice acting. Practically the entire game has voice acting(with the exception of random npcs in towns and a few lines here and there). Senel has a very good voice actor. One of the best I've heard in a long time. Vaclav also has a great voice actor, as he kinda sounds like Jeremy Irons.The battles are like the other tales games. You run left and right and perform combos. There are some interesting new additions to the battle system. One of them is the ability to combine various abilities into a new ability. You won't do this often, but the new abilities you create can be very powerful against certain creatures.The story is good. It is cliched, but it is well done. There are interesting characters and a very interesting relationship between the main character and his sister. The game is long enough so you develop a lasting attacthment to the characters.I would highly reccomend that any fan of the Tales games picks this up. I don't think it will stand the test of time, but it's definetly a great RPG right now.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-02-2006"}

It fixes the flaws in Sonic The Hedgehog 1.PlotAfter defeating Dr. Robotnik in the last game, Robotnik gets back to work with his usual scheme of taking over the world. Like in the last game, he's captured a bunch of animals and is turning them into malicious robots, and is building a devastation space weapon called the Death Egg. You take control of Sonic again to thwart Robotnik's plans, and this time, a two-tailed fox by the name of Tails Prower tags along and helps you.If you're familiar with the way Sonic 1 plays, then you know how to complete this game. However, they added a critical improvement in Sonic 2, which is the spindash. All you do is crouch down (By holding the bottom d-pad) and hit the jump button to start spinning, and when you release both buttons to go much faster than without the spindash. With the spindash, you can also plow into most Badniks and they'll get destroyed.All the power ups like the Ring monitor, Invincibility monitor, Shield monitor, and Extra Life monitor are in this game.There's also a point to getting Chaos Emeralds. If you collect all the Chaos Emeralds (now its seven emeralds instead of six) and get 50 rings, you turn into Super Sonic. Super Sonic is a yellow juggernaut. Other than drowning, bottomless pits, and getting crushed, nothing can hurt Super Sonic, as he's not only invincible, but he can run extremely fast and jump over really long distances. The only drawback to Super Sonic is that your ring count gets deducted at one ring per second, and once you run out of rings, you turn back into regular Sonic.The Special Stage is different from that in Sonic 1. Instead of collecting 50 rings and jumping into a giant ring at the end of an act, you collect 50 rings and jump into a bunch of rotating stars that pop up when you hit a lamp post. You also race through a half-pipe and need to collect a certain number of rings before each checkpoint. When you clear all the checkpoints with the required amounts of rings, you get a Chaos Emerald.You also have the option to switch between Sonic & Tails, Sonic solo, and Tails solo when playing the one-player mode.There's also a 2-player mode for this game. Basically, it's a split-screen racing game where you and a second player choose as Sonic or Tails and race each other until the end of the acts. The acts to choose from in the 2-Player mode are Emerald Hill, Casino Night, Mystic Cave, and the Special Stage.The soundtrack is even better than that in the first game. Aside from having more levels and therefore more music tracks, a good deal of the music on here is better than in the first game. Standout tracks on here are for Chemical Plant, Aquatic Ruin, Casino Night, Mystic Cave, Metropolis, Sky Chase, Wing Fortress, and Death Egg. Death Egg is the perfect music to hear when you're in a high-tech spacecraft. Mystic Cave is worth mentioning because the opening melody is really reminiscent of the Inspector Gadget theme, and that the music itself is pretty creepy. Casino Night and Sky Chase have really relaxed, upbeat feelings to them.The 2-player levels even have their own versions of the music.Of all the \"classic\" Sonic games and with the entire Sonic game library, this one fixes the flaws of the first game It's been re-issued countless times and is available with other Sonic games like Sonic's Mega Collection etc and available as individual game downloads on Steam.BossBoss battles are just as good but when you go to the death egg u encounter silver sonic a robotic looking sonic prototypeSonic The Hedgehog 2story 10/10control 10/10Music 10/10graphics 10/10Boss battles 10/10my final thoughts Sonic The Hedgehog 2 is a great sequel and I hope Sonic's third game is just as great as many other Sonic games","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-16-2012"}

{"product_name":"B003O6EDSM","reviewerName":"D.G.M.","summary":"An incredibly epic space opera that should not be missed","reviewText":"The Mass Effect Trilogy is quite simply one of the best collections of games out there, bar none. You are Commander Shepard, a soldier of the Systems Alliance who uncovers a dangerous secret that threatens the safety of the entire galaxy and it's up to Shepard and his/her crew to figure out a way to end the threat. The game's story is an extremely important aspect of the series, so nothing further about it will be revealed in order to avoid spoilers. Rest assured though that the Mass Effect universe is deep, intricate, and fully realized, and as you uncover more about the different alien cultures and enemies you encounter, your in-game encyclopedia will add more background information to be viewed at your leisure. Furthermore, how the story unfolds depends on the myriad choices the player has Shepard make throughout his/her journey. Everything from Shepard's gender, appearance, character class, dialogue options, and how he/she chooses to deal with friends and enemies are up to the player, and many of these decisions will have lasting impacts on future missions, both positive and negative. Certain decisions in the first Mass Effect may not see any resolutions until well into Mass Effect 3. The range of these decisions is staggering. Shepard will be dealing with hostage situations, search and destroy missions, rescue missions, etc., and in many of these situations the player will be faced with moral choices which can range from the selfless Paragon all the way to the opposite end of the spectrum of the selfish Renegade, with some neutral gray areas mixed in there. Unlike in certain other games like the Infamous series which require you to choose only between being a saint or a monster, this series allows you to shape Shepard into any kind of person you desire; an honorable soldier with a bit of a rebellious streak, a bad seed with a largely ignored conscience, a mostly neutral \"go with the flow\" type of person, or even the previously mentioned saint or monster.The Mass Effect Trilogy manages to combine the best aspects of an RPG with those of a third-person shooter. The player can choose from several character classes for Shepard which determine what weapons and powers he/she will possess. Certain classes are more skilled in specific types of weaponry such as pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, and sniper rifles; their uses and functions differ depending on which game you're playing. In the first Mass Effect, weapons have unlimited ammo, however firing a weapon repeatedly in rapid succession could cause it to overheat, requiring the player to wait a few seconds for the weapon to cool down before being able to fire it again (this can be remedied by switching to another weapon). Mass Effect 2 and 3 end up throwing this gameplay element to the wayside and have you rely on standard ammunition for your weapons. While there is normally enough ammo lying around for you to pick up, it's still possible to run out of ammo in certain high risk firefights. Both of these gameplay elements for weapons have their own perks and limitations and can tense things up in their own ways, however I personally preferred the overheating weapons in the first game.On the flip side, the first Mass Effect had more limitations on the types of weapons you could use depending on your chosen character class. Aside from the Soldier class, the other ones could normally make use of only one or two types of weapons. The Vanguard class for example can only effectively use a pistol and a shotgun, and although that class can still carry a sniper rifle and an assault rifle, they will not be able to do much damage with those weapons or even aim with them. Mass Effect 2 and 3 change things for the better and give each class a wider range of weapons to use effectively. Upgrades to weapons and armor also differ between each game. The first Mass Effect will give you scores of additional upgrades which can be purchased or found during missions that can affect armor and weapons, whether they include adding regenerative properties or stronger shields for your armor, or using radioactive or heat ammunition for your weapons. These upgrades can be changed or removed at any time during gameplay. In the other two games, mostly in Mass Effect 3, weapons and armor are given more general, but still useful upgrades that also affect weapon strength and the effectiveness of armor and shields. However, most of these upgrades have to be either purchased or traded in for mineral elements (the latter option is prevalent in Mass Effect 2). Furthermore, whatever upgrades you choose to start a mission with are for keeps until the mission ends (unless you find a new weapon or a weapons workbench along the way in Mass Effect 3).Complimenting Shepard's weapons are special powers that he/she possesses depending on the player's character class. Most classes have special powers that revolve around the use of tech and biotics. Tech abilities give characters skills that allow them to not only bypass locked doors and security systems (mostly in the first Mass Effect), but also affect synthetic enemies and launch attacks that affect enemy shields and armor. Biotics give characters the ability to manipulate dark matter and attack enemies with the power of the mind using levitation, immobilization, or shockwave attacks. These special powers operate on a cooldown timer, so once a power is used and its cooldown period has ended, the player will be able to use that same power or other powers again without having to worry about running out of \"mana\" or \"MP\". Much like with the weapons, the way these powers function differs between each game. In the first Mass Effect, using a power will make it unusable until its cooldown period ends, which could easily take 45 seconds or longer depending on the power, which is quite a long wait. Thankfully, while you wait for one power to cooldown, you can still rely on your other powers so that you're not completely defenseless. Mass Effect 2 and 3 change things by making all your available powers unusable after activating one of them until the cooldown period ends. In other words, after you use a power against an enemy and its cooldown period starts, you have to wait until the cooldown period ends before you can use any of your powers. However, the cooldown periods have been significantly reduced to an average of 6 to 10 seconds, sometimes even less depending on the power. In this particular gameplay element, Mass Effect 2 and 3 again come out on top.The biggest difference between the first Mass Effect and its two sequels is planet exploration. When Commander Shepard and his crew land on a planet in the first game, there is normally a lot of ground to cover. When on foot, Shepard and his crew will typically be in a large base or port where they can interact with lots of NPCs, and in order to reach another main area they will have to ride in an APC type of vehicle called the Mako. The areas in which the Mako can be driven are normally very large and roomy, although they're actually more linear in the main missions than they are in the side missions. Also, depending on what planet you're on, the environment could be flat and sprawling or rocky and mountainous. In some cases, the environment can even be hazardous to your health if you step outside the Mako for too long. In Mass Effect 2 and 3, the different environments are far more linear in design, especially when in an area with enemies. Certain hub locations with shops and other points of interest require more exploration, but are still comparatively linear. On the plus side, the environments in the second and third games have more variety in terms of appearance and architecture compared to the largely carbon copied environments of the first game. Due to the more linear structure of the second and third games, vehicle exploration is largely nonexistent, however Mass Effect 2 has a couple of DLCs that require you to ride a hovercraft vehicle called the Hammerhead in order to advance. While the Mako was a slower ground vehicle with far superior armor and stronger firepower, the Hammerhead had much greater speed and an impressive jumping ability that allowed it to fly circles around enemies. On the downside, the Hammerhead had almost no armor and could be destroyed by just a few well placed shots by even standard weapons fire, although its armor could regenerate much more quickly. Both these vehicles have their advantages and disadvantages. Fans of the games have expressed very polarizing opinions on the gameplay for both the Mako and Hammerhead, and many have expressed which vehicle they find to be the superior one (I'm team Mako). It is largely due to these differences of opinion that Mass Effect 3 has no vehicle use or exploration whatsoever. For better or worse, Mass Effect 3 is still a blast without access to a vehicle.Throughout the majority of all three games, Shepard is accompanied by a large collection of trusted squad mates. Some join you no matter what, but most squad mates (especially in the second game) can be recruited at your leisure, should you choose to do so. While cruising around in your Normandy starship between missions, Shepard can chat with his squad mates to find out more about them, gain their trust, access specialized missions, and even gain new powers and abilities. Many missions and cutscenes will play out very differently depending on which squad mates you have with you during missions. Shepard always has two squad mates at his/her side during missions and they can normally hold their own against enemies, but the player can also issue commands to have them take up better defensive positions or attack enemies and targets with specific attacks. However, there will be times when some squad mates will simply ignore your commands or even move back to hide behind a wall and leave you to do most of the fighting; this appeared to be entirely random. In short, my squad mates were normally right there and had my back during most firefights, but every once in a while they would suddenly decide to be extremely incompetent for no apparent reason and just stop shooting at enemies. Despite the bipolar tendencies of my A.I. companions, the action packed gameplay was a joy to experience. Enemy variety is a bit on the low side, but most of them are fun to fight. Most are human, alien, or robotic enemies who shoot at you with guns and use their own tech and biotic powers. There are also the occasional mechs and more freakishly monstrous enemies to help round things out, as well as a handful of boss fights which are normally just tougher versions of normal enemies. As simplistic as this may sound, the game's combat is still great and doesn't get old, although some repetition may creep in at some point during the first game.The last gameplay element that also goes through slight changes between each game revolves around navigating the galaxy map and setting courses for the Normandy to visit different clusters and solar systems. The first Mass Effect was the most straightforward of the games with regards to exploring the galaxy: you simply point and click at each solar system or planet and poof, you're there. Mass Effect 2 and 3 add a bit more depth to the exploring aspect. While in a certain cluster or solar system, you control a miniature representation of the Normandy and fly it to whichever nearby planet you want to visit. While traveling between solar systems, the Normandy uses up fuel, which must be replenished at some point at fuel depots. Scanning planets and using probes to find important materials or locations also play a big part in both games, although while Mass Effect 2 kind of overdid it with the amount of scanning required in order to find things, Mass Effect 3 streamlined the whole scanning process to make it less time consuming. Furthermore, Mass Effect 3 adds a risk taking element to scanning solar systems and planets: if you use the Normandy's scanners too much while in enemy territory, then enemy ships will eventually locate you and attempt to destroy you, forcing you to hightail the Normandy out of your current solar system and return later after things have cooled down.There aren't many negative things I can say about this trilogy. Some cutscenes may glitch out to the point where the sound cuts out or the lip-synching of character dialogue may be off; or in one particular case I experienced, an entire scene may be skipped. These glitches seemed to occur more with the first Mass Effect and Mass Effect 3, with Mass Effect 2 being largely glitch free. Also, combat and general movement controls tend to feel a bit stiff in the first game, but greatly improve in the sequels. Fans of epic science fiction featuring aliens, starships, and galaxy hopping will do themselves a great injustice if they choose to pass on this series (and this is coming from a merely casual fan of similar series like Star Trek and Star Wars). Those who enjoy action-RPGs should also give this trilogy a shot due to its solid gameplay and incredible story that can change on so many levels simply because of the many choices you make. By the way, make sure to download the extended cut for Mass Effect 3, it greatly enhances the different endings to an astounding degree and provides true closure. A must play series if ever there was one.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2014"}

Of course notice my praise is followed by - \"on the Wii.\"Anyway there's Metroid Prime and there's Resident Evil 4 in the (top) two spots in no particular order.  And  Conduit (arguably) comes next.I probably had more fun with Red Steel, but that was at launch time nearly 3 years ago when the Wii was new and fresh and I was more forgiving of a game's faults.Certainly Red Steel had a more interesting design and/or was easier to wrap your head around.  But it had more tech problems too.  And if I went back now I might cringe and vomit.Conduit's aiming controls are better, but next time just give the player your best 3 aiming configs in addition to the configuration encyclopedia you put into the game.  MP3 did this and it was enough for 95% of players.  Surely Conduit can also make this simple addition.Conduit is a straightforward fps game.  Move around, shoot guys.  Find door openings.  I found it disappointingly sloppy and disorienting.  Frame rate is quite often suspect and the overall look gives a person headaches especially with the various effects in the game.  You'll also find yourself quite often bumping into the door frames as you go through doors.The multiplayer is fun.  It's always fun to shoot buds online.  And if you notice I said you could arguably put this game behind RE4 and Metroid Prime as the top first person games on the Wii.  Well that would Conduit the top first person online game on the Wii since the other two don't have mp let alone online mp.But multi-player suffers from frame rate drops and bugs like your screen turning black.  I've played online 5 times or so and I have seen these problems at least 3 times.Anyway you can get much better fps games on your computer as long as your computer is no more than 3 or 4 years old.  And these games would cost you next to nothing since they are now $10 titles.But on the Wii you don't have much choice.  And so this game is one of the better picks.  (let's forget Gamecube games for a second.)Overall though Conduit isn't by no means a AAA game.  Metroid Prime and RE4 are AAA games.  Extremely well-polished and well thought out.AFter that the quality of the first person titles on the Wii drops off dramatically.

Willard","summary":"Much like the original","reviewText":"By \"Original\" I meant it is a carbon copy of Fallout 3 as far as coding goes. :)Ok lets get the bad out of the way. People have been slamming this game saying it crashes and there many bugs. I have been playing it for days and have not had any actual bugs at all. I did have one crash about 3 hours after installing it but since then, none. It has played fine. I don't have the best system either. I'd say, it's a mid-range gaming machine if you looked at todays out-of-the-box gaming rigs.STEAM!! Well, after a long installation (20-30 min) and STEAM registration and then updates (maybe another 20 min), it worked fine. I have had no problems with it being a STEAM game (other than the regular complaint that you can't resell or give it away once you're done and stuff). The positive of STEAM is that if you buy a new PC and have lost or damaged the original DVD, you can still reinstall it from the STEAM engines/website.IMPORTANT: Once you have installed it (must have a good internet connection), you do NOT have to maintain an internet connection to play. You can play offline after it's fully installed and running.That's about it. The So-so:It feels and looks almost exactly like Fallout 3. Now, Fallout 3 was awesome, right?You do not \"raise\" your character so it has been said you do not care for them as much as you did in the old Fallout. You start out as a grown man/woman and have been left for dead. Saved by a robot and a doctor. Now let's go get revenge...or...don't. Put a bullet in my head and see if I turn the other cheak. I found the more I played, the more I was building my character by my choices. My character looks just like Wolverine so you know the choices I'm making.The enemies are HARD! I fired round after round into some enemies and it took so many rounds to take them out, I was running away sometimes to find more ammo or running up to dead guys (while still in the fight) and taking their weapons to keep fighting. Save save save.The good:Details in the new weapons are very well done. Such as; LUCKY the .357 I found (now have Pew-Pew the laser gun). It's my baby. My go-to gun. Or, the new plasma rifle that looks like a plasma rifle on steriods. It's called the Q-35 matter modulator (Now have a Gauss rifle that rocks). It's so cool to find something entirely new that wasn't in the old Fallout 3. HOLY HAND GRENADES!! (Monty Python Reference)Familiar enemies are here with some interesting mutated versions of them as well such as the return of Geckos and new mother, baby, alpha male and the legendary deathclaw. The Nightkin are an awesome new Supermutant.Aaand, you can now have characters (NPC) join you and assist in firefights and they may give more info on a current quest if they have input.-Danny Trejo (tech guy) voices a ghoul you will meet at Black Mountain. Free him and he can join your group.-Boone a sniper - help him find out about his missing wife and he joins.-ED-E Eyebot you fix and it joins you-Rex cyberdog - Help get his brain fixed and he joins you-Lily the Nightkin Supermutant - help the doc and Lily with an stealth experiment and she will join if you do not have a human companion.and a few more.Wasteland Radio: Errrrm. Well, Wayne Newton voices the DJ Mr. Las Vegas and the songs he plays are limited and will become tiresome but he gives updates in the news as you do things in your quests. The alternative radio station plays some extra songs but are very country oriented and the same as other stations, will become tiresome. DLC should allow more songs or more stations.I recommend this for anyone that trusts their system and is a fan of the Fallout series.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-25-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I0J5UQ","description":"","reviewerName":"Jason","summary":"A Risky Approach to Detective Work","reviewText":"What do you get when you mix an open world approach to a detective game set in the 1940's?  In case you haven't heard it's L.A. Noire, the question you might be asking is, \"Is L.A. Norie worth it?\"  The short answer is yes and no.  The long answer is what follows and as they say, the devil is in the details.Graphics:The graphics in this game are good, really good, character models look great, the facial movements are quite good in game but aren't as amazing as I had believed from reading other reviews.  The graphics of the world are good for an open world game.  The cars, the buildings all look believable, though of course you can't go through every door or always into every room.  What you can explore looks incredible-there's a fine attention to detail.  There were 1 or 2 spots I found some terrible textures but overall this game looks great.Sound:Everything in this game sounds good.  The music is of course authentic to the time period and the detective style music that helps you understand where clues are is well done.  Even car noises and birds and doors help immerse you in the world, the sound is well done though it doesn't stand out as something I noticed while playing, later as I focused more on it I realized just how much time and effort was put into the sound department.Presentation:L.A. Noire does a great job of offering a great presentation between menus, your note pad and the way L.A. itself is remade and rendered, it really makes the whole thing seem quite believable.Story:The overall story I hoped would be amazing.  So far it's been almost awful.  Cole Phelp's character is a straight shooting man who believes in justice, right and the american way.  He's often seemingly naieve about reality though he seems caring and genuine so I never had a problem with him.  **SPOILERS** Until, at one point in the game he does something so out of character from everything you're lead to believe about him before that, that it's simply mind blowing.  I have ceased to care about his character at all since that point 75% into the game. **END SPOILERS**  The only other aspect of story there is, is a flow of newspapers articles outlining current events that make sense in the end and Cole Philip's back-story from the war that is boring and uninteresting.Gameplay:This game succeeds for me when I'm solving homicide crimes and am looking for murders, asking questions gathering evidence.  The other desks (mostly the \"vice desk\") didn't interest me as much (due to more confusing leads, too many characters to chase down and the repetition of the game at that point).  Sadly, this game does get rather repetitious half way through you find yourself searching crime scenes for clues, interviewing people, driving to a destination, getting a call for a street crime driving across the entire city to reach that point and then continuing on with your case.  You find yourself running suspects down, chasing them down, shooting them down and eventually perhaps locking them down.  The driving is ok, it gets better later on when you get some faster cars, but the other traffic makes it a bore and while the city is nice to look at, it's a pain to drive slow and try to swerve around that other traffic.  The fist fights and shoot outs are easy and only occasional clue that you fail to find will frustrate you simulating any sort of challenge.  I wish there'd been more homicide cases that offered more variety because that's where I felt L.A. Noire really shines.Conclusion:I think L.A. Noire does a good job trying to recreate a 1940's L.A. Noire feel detective story and gameplay.  However, the open world concept doesn't bode well for this game as the typical \"open world game\" elements don't work quite as well in L.A. Noire.  There's little to collect and the city is unmanageable to go free roaming looking for hidden film reels or other trinkets you might have missed.  While you can collect cars and finish street crimes (side cases), there's little to take advantage of the open world offered in L.A. Noire.  Eventually, you find yourself just noting what color door handles are to help you know where you are allowed to go. The story falls short because by the end you no longer care for the main character and there is little resolution to cases that you've finished and many lose ends remain hanging.  What this amounts to is a fun game that does a lot of things right from presentation, graphics and sound to a detective game stand point but when it tries to include open world elements and a disappointing story makes the game feel a little hollow, like a pretty picture without much heart.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-24-2011"}

This will simply be an \"old\" guy talking about how much fun (or not) a game is.Since I have only had it for a few hours, I can say very little other than it looks pretty good. It has the same feel as the original. It does feel like the zombies are a bit more fierce and deadly this time around. I was initially a little disappointed that you could not import your previous character and his skills,it turns out I was too quick on the trigger and missed it...plus being on a new system that did not have the previous game installed, but there is a new guy, so I will be giving him a go just to see what he offers.Stay tuned for more updates in the next couple of days as I get deeper into the game play. And just a note, I don't rush to the end so I can post some mythical \"hours playable\" figure. Most of us normal players don't run a stop watch when we play, and many of us enjoy the side quests and also tend to die...A LOT...while getting the hang of a game. So the updates here will just be about whether the game is fun or not.I have decided to play equal time on all four characters to see what/if the difference might be in the story line. Unlike some of the lames that dash to the finish line and do not take the time to really explore, I am in no hurry. In a few days, I will post an honest update, but for now I will say it looks nice and I am having my guts handed to me pretty regularly by a tougher zombie than in the original. I will be dividing my time between the XBox edition and the PC edition to give just a bit more heads-up on the differences.So, now that I am a few days in and have swapped from character to character, I am a little disappointed that the story line is basically the same across the board. The interactions do not vary. To me, that is a dropped ball. While I am still enjoying the game and looking forward to running around with my friends, and I am getting better at the \"not dying\" part, I feel like Riptide could have gone farther in creating a deeper story.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-23-2013"}

{"product_name":"Logitech G700s Rechargeable Gaming Mouse","description":"","reviewerName":"Genryu","summary":"A great performing gaming mouse with Logitech durability and build-quality.","reviewText":"I previously had a Logitech MX Revolution that has served me well for many years now. It was a great mouse that held on to its battery life and durability all this time, but was finally showing some signs of wireless lag and instability. So I went back to logitech looking for another winner to serve me for the next several years. I saw the G700s on sale so I thought I'd give it a try, and I have to say it is in its own league compared to the consumer logitech mice and other wireless gaming mice as well.The packaging was great, and everything was well placed and easy to remove and get started using. I was up and running in a matter of minutes with everything installed. The mini-receiver is great and I've had no problems with the wireless performance at any point. Just make sure its connected to a reliable USB port (I tried connecting it to a USB hub and the performance definitely was off with that). Please note that although the mini-receiver looks like other logitech unifying mini-receivers it is not compatible with them. This is a gaming mouse so it needs its own dedicated receiver to give you the great performance and accuracy with low latency times and high polling rates.The dpi on this mouse is ridiculous and the accuracy is absolutely fantastic. It is miles better than what you'd get with a consumer oriented mouse from Logitech or otherwise and its worth the spending the extra money on. It's also easy to change too in the middle of a game thanks to the &#34;G&#34; buttons. I initially did have some trouble getting a good grip on the mouse, but after several days I've gotten used to it. I love the new grip-texture they're using on the G700s, it always feels like I have a nice firm grasp of the mouse, and that's a feeling I feel you don't get with the overly glossy plastic mice being sold these days. All of the &#34;G&#34; buttons work great, though some of them are a bit hard to reach and the ones along the thumb-side do feel a bit mushy.I only have a few downsides with this mouse, and they're mostly what I expected going in. First let me say the battery life has never failed me and has gotten me through nearly constant use with Diablo 3 for hours on end. So long as you remember to charge it overnight, you won't come back to a dead mouse. Still, this is a far cry from what you'll see on the Logitech Performance MX mice and others. But for a gaming mouse I don't think you can do better in terms of battery performance. I've tried out the Razer Mamba and I generally feel the Logitech just plain lasted longer. I also don't like the gaudy new gamer-look they've added to the mouse over the previous G700's clean look, but it's not that bad to look at. You can use the mouse with the charging cable attached, but I do feel there's a bit of drag to it as well. Please note that while I think the weight of the mouse is great, it may be too light for some and it does not come with any weight-system like the G500s does.Overall if you want one of the highest performing gaming mice you can buy today I think you cannot go wrong with the G700s. I use this mostly for non-gaming purposes and its just such a joy. From the nice feel of each mouse click to the phenomenal level of accuracy and precision - this is just the best mouse I've ever used and easily puts my Logitech MX Revolution to shame.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-22-2013"}
{"product_name":"B000066JRN","description":"Six years. Six long years we&#x92;ve had to wait for a new Mario game, and finally it&#x92;s here. And even considering the ridiculously unfair expectations,Super Mario Sunshineis almost entirely as good as you&#x92;d hope and expect.The premise of the game is that Mario&#x92;s tropical holiday is ruined when he&#x92;s stitched up by an evil look-alike for daubing graffiti all over the island. Rather conveniently, there&#x92;s a water pump waiting for him to use, which not only washes away the mess but also doubles as a handy jet pack. The jet pack aspect means that whenever you fall off something you have the chance to immediately recover. This built-in safety net means the game can afford to be far more ambitious in its level design than ever before, with massive levels filled with trampolines, tightropes, water-powered windmills, huge coral reefs, and mountains and mountains of platforms.The whole thing looks amazing, too, with the most realistic water ever seen in a video game, and a near-infinite draw distance. On top of all this are rideable, fruit-juice-spewing Yoshis, extra water nozzles, super-hardcore platform levels where Shadow Mario nicks your jet pack, and goop-generating bosses who seem to live to make Princess Peach&#x92;s laundry a nightmare.After the sweet but rather short pleasures ofLuigi&#x92;s MansionandPikmin, you need have no fear thatMario Sunshineis of a similarly brief nature. There are a total of 120 shines to collect--the same number of stars as inSuper Mario 64--and the game world is at least as large and far more interactive. This is without question the best game on the GameCube yet. That may be no more than you'd expect from a Mario game, but it's certainly more than most of us mere mortals deserve.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Patrick","summary":"Very fun","reviewText":"This is my first GameCube game and it's pleased me a great deal. There hasn't been a good Mario title since the Super Nintendo days. Sunshine has revived the series and has brought a whole new level of enjoyment to fans. The style of animation and great level design is the true star of this game. Everything, even the dirt, it beautiful. You'll feel like you're playing a hand drawn animated movie. Two big down sides to this game are the controls and poor camera movements. The control can be very frustrating. Mario doesn't always shoot when you want him to shoot and he doesn't always jump where you want him to jump. They are bearable but they could have been better. The camera is just terrible. You have to fight with it all the time. Not only do you have to control Mario but you have to move the camera yourself also. This can be very difficult during battles or tough situations. While this is an extremely delightful game, it's still not perfect. So out of a perfect 5 I give it:Graphics: 5.0Sound: 5.0Control: 4.0Fun Factor: 5.0","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-26-2002"}

The wasteland is populated with scavengers, mutants, and humans struggling to survive.  It's also populated with retro-ruins.  50's diners, soda pop machines, jukeboxes, and music from the 40's through your pip-boy radio.  The setting is dark, epic, and humorous at the same time.  You can play the game any way that you want.  There are a few minor bugs, but the game is so much fun you can overlook them.Secu-RomYou need to have the disk in the drive to play it.  Lots of people are complaining about this on amazon.  They are whiny and spoiled.  Don't be like them.  Some other games ask you for a credit card, semen sample, and retinal scan; so in comparison, requiring that you have the disk that you bought is very minor.  Sometimes the game didn't recognize the disk in the drive and I had to open and close it.  This is a minor inconvenience.The Graphics... are great!  The post apocalyptic world is eerie.  Seeing the US in ruins after a nuclear war is unsettling.  The characters, enemies, environments, objects all look good and you don't need a super computer to run it.  I would recommend going into the advanced options and turning the actor FADE higher if you can.  For me, on the inital settings, the enemies would attack me before I could see them.  Once I changed the actor fade setting to 8, 9, or 10, everything was ok.The Quests... are imaginative and allow you to solve them any way you want.  Talk your way out of bad situations, make allies, sneak past enemies, blow things up, or snipe people in the head.  It's up to you and you will be rewarded however you play.  There are many ways to finish quests and several different endings to the game.  This adventure is completely up to you.The Combat... is fun.  Most of the combat is gun based, although you can sneak up behind someone and hit them in the head with a sledgehammer.  You can also set traps like landmines and watch unwitting enemies blow themselves to bits.  The combat is real time, so you can click the mouse and shoot as fast as you can.  You can also enter a turn based mode called VATS, by hitting the V button.VATS... is a strategic way to take out enemies.  It allows you to aim at a part of their body and shoot.  If you hit the same area repeatedly, they will die.  You can blow arms, legs, and heads off of enemies and this never seemed to get old.  You can also shoot the gun out of their hands or better yet... shoot a grenade before they can throw it and watch them explode.  VATS is a good thing.  Holding a grenade too long is not.The Economy... is ok.  You start off really poor and then it becomes balanced.  Then you become super rich.  That's ok, because you can own a home in the game and buy additions to it.  When you have extra cash, you can buy luxury items for yourself, so that's ok.Leveling Up... is rewarding!  As you kill enemies, talk to NPC's, finish quests, pick locks, hack computers, etc... you gain XP.  When it reaches a certain amount, you gain a level and you can increase your skills.  You also get a Perk.  This is a special ability that caters to your play style.  If you want to be stealthy, there are stealth perks.  If you want to be a better shot, there are perks that help you do that.  Etc...  Leveling up your skills allows YOU to cater the game to YOUR playstyle.The Acting... is pretty good overall.  Some of the NPC's are better than others and the main characters are good.Replay Value... is through the roof!  The main quest is fairly short... about 8-10 hours, but there are about 50 more hours of side quests that you can play any way that you want.  There's about 200 hours of gameplay here.  There's also user created content available now, so you can pretty much change that 200 to infinity, if you want to download mods.The NPC's... are good.  Their combat AI is basic, but they do things that other games don't do.  If you shoot a gun out of an enemy's hand, he runs and tries to find another weapon.  Here's another example.  I ran into a merchant outside of the main town and we traded.  I traveled across the map and ran into the same guy again.  He was looting a dead robot for scrap metal.  As I approached, he drew his gun and warned me to find my own loot.  I walked towards him and he attacked me.  He actually felt threatened and thought I was going to steal his loot!  There are also a wide variety of entertaining NPC's, raiders, mutants, radiated ghouls, anti-commie robots, lost children, drug addicts, soldiers, wastelanders, etc...  I wouldn't say any of them are good or evil, but they all have their own agendas.  It's up to you if you want to help or thwart them.OverallFallout 3 is a great roleplaying game.  It throws a ton of quests at you and allows you to solve them any way that you want.  Walking through a post apocalyptic Washington DC was eerie, but I thought the game lacked the epic feel of many other RPG's.  A lot of the time, I felt like I was picking through garbage just to survive the harsh wasteland.  I felt more like a scavenger than a hero.  But this is more of a survival horror RPG, than an epic one like Oblivion.  In the end, it's easy to overlook a handful of bugs to experience a game as great as this one.The game is rated M for language, violence, and gore, so it's good for older teens and adults.  I wouldn't let kids play it.If you want a survival horror RPG set in a post apocalyptic future, it doesn't get much better than this!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-22-2009"}
{"product_name":"B000066TS5","description":"Ever wondered what would happen if the worlds ofFinal Fantasyand Disney collided? It&#x92;s an odd concept to be sure, but from the most schizophrenic of acorns the mighty gaming oak ofKingdom Heartshas grown. Legendary role-playing game makers Square have been given unprecedented liberties with the entire Disney universe and have created a game featuring everything fromThe Nightmare Before ChristmastoThe Little Mermaid. This is odd enough in itself when you have characters as disparate as Tarzan and Donald Duck teaming up, but becomes majorly freaky when Square thrown in a variety of their own characters such as Cloud, Squall, and Aeris from the variousFinal Fantasygames. But this incongruity has one side benefit in that the storyline behind the game is by necessity rather vague, which seems to have stopped Square from filling three CDs full of their usual New Age whining about Mother Earth. Instead they&#x92;ve spent even more time on the graphics, and the end result is a quite stunning 3-D cartoon.As for the gameplay, it may come as a surprise to learn that it doesn&#x92;t actually feature, as all theFinal Fantasygames do, turn-based combat. Instead it's essentially a scrolling beat-'em-up-cum-platformer with exactly the kind of complicated Square-style knobs you&#x92;d expect. The game may be a little shallow, but it&#x92;s an impressive artistic achievement and to be quite frank any title that allows you to magically summon Bambi out of thin air to attack evil demons of the underworld has got to be worth some sort of recommendation.--David Jenkins","reviewerName":"Sylph StarWind \"sylphstarwind35\"","summary":"One of the best games I've ever played","reviewText":"Most games have a major letdown at some point. Some have clich&eacute; stories or characters, some have a boring battle system that makes me cry, and some are just too hard for me, and I can't beat the final boss no matter how many times I try. But this game was great in almost all aspects. I guess it's surprising having Disney thrown in with Final Fantasy (although that didn't deter me when I saw the commercial), but it all goes together pretty well. The story is unique, with some new and old stuff thrown in. The fights are fun; you can use a variety of techniques, spells, and summons. The quick spell system and dodging are helpful. I loved the music, especially Simple and Clean. The graphics are awesome; it's all smooth and I think it looks as good as the newer Final Fantasy games. I got through the game alright, not too hard, not too easy. I had to try a few bosses multiple times, but it wasn't overwhelming. You can choose how difficult the game will be, so you can set it easier or harder depending on preference or ability. There are a few flaws, though. You can't skip cutscenes, so if you've played multiple times, you'll have to amuse yourself for a few minutes during the clips. Also, some of the things people say or how their mouths match what they are saying are imperfect. That is a minor problem, though. Lastly, flying between worlds in the gummi ship is boring, and it's difficult to build a new one. I just ignored the whole thing. Still, I can't wait for KH2 to come out. Maybe they'll fix the few problems. I recommend that you buy this or at least rent it if in doubt.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-25-2004"}

I got to say it is a tad different in term of the game-play.  Lot of the moves is the same with existing characters, but the buttons combinations are a little different/charged.  There is a new feature that if you guard too much your character weapon will get weaker or break, which was similar to the original soul blade game.  Your weapons are the same, only the characters will level up.  Game mode is altered a little with online play.  The usual story line, verse, arcade modes are back.  The storyline matches are a little different.  You face 2-3 enemies per round with one life bar, sound hard, but it is actually easy in normal mode.  There are only 5 rounds.  The ending clips aren't that great either.The extra and characters creation is also tweaked a little.  You can't really randomly create really odd characters like before, more like modifying existing one.  I am not sure if all the ending movies can be viewed like before in a theater mode, I didn't find it.  The character bio is really lame this time.  You get like an artwork with the written description, gone is the 3d model that you can rotate and zoom in Soul Caliber III.  Those weird odd mini game and quests are gone from SC3.  There is a tower game, but that is just like a regular arcade version.  No more buying weapons for your character development.  Why are half the scenes from SC3, with better detail?  A lot more female characters are a great plus, Ivy and some of the ladies are quite Taki-ness.The team spent a lot of time on the animation, design and rendering of the characters, and kind of chopped skipped on the extra features that were found in SC3.

This game also has a melee function.  Sneak up on an enemy and kill them with one melee strike.Every operative and weapon has their own unique ratings for strength, stealth, heath, damage, ect.  So going with a different operative will change the experience. Every operative has their primary firearm, a side arm, and an explosive device (either a grenade or satchel charge).  All operatives have their unique weapons and weapon combinations.  You can swap your primary weapon with a fallen enemy's weapon during the game.The game offers great cover taking and cover shooting (especially for a hand held game).  you can take cover behind just about anything.  You can shoot around or above most cover positions and places.  Certain, awkward cover taking places may not allow you to shoot from-the aiming reticule won't appear.  So it's a good idea to test if you can shoot by practice aiming and seeing if the reticule appears before an enemy arrives.  If you can't shoot from certain cover taking places, then just get out of that cover position when an enemy is close.The game offers numerous missions and high value target challenges.Some missions you can go Rambo, others you can try to be as stealthy as possible, other missions require absolute stealth with no alarms going off.  There are also security cameras, security motion lasers and land mines you need to watch out for and disable.For the missions that allow no alarms, an enemy or enemies can detect you, but you will need to kill them within about 10 seconds before the alarm goes off and the mission is aborted.Daily on-line challenges (be sure you have a Wi-fi router in the house), and leader boards and point rankings.I read one review where the person complained that this game caused there Vita to freeze up and crash.  I only experience this one time on my first day of owning this game and my Vita.  After playing this game for about 6 hours straight, it froze up.  I had to turn off the power and restart my Vita.  I never had this happen since.  It's worked perfectly ever since.  So for me, the one-time freeze up was just a one-time glitch.  Be sure to have your Wi-Fi on to ensure you get the latest patches and updates for all your games and gaming systems.IF EVER YOU VITA FREEZES UP, hold down the power button for about 10 seconds or more.  A menu will appear with about 4 options.  Select the \"Restart Vita\" or power down the vita option first to see if that corrects the problem before selecting the other options (restore Vita to it's initial state, ect.)  I selected to restart (or was it to power down?) and that fixed my Vita when it froze up.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-06-2013"}

{"product_name":"B005B8DRVU","description":"","reviewerName":"Alan R \"Alan R\"","summary":"SWTOR - For each step forward, it takes 5 steps in place or backwards.","reviewText":"Emotions and excitement are sky high right now with the release of SWTOR. Many people are just starting their journey and are blown away by the voice acting, cut scenes and story telling. Rightfully so! But with that comes a lot of early reviews from people high on their first experience with that aspect of the game, who haven't had enough time to settle a bit into the ENTIRE game or look objectively at the WHOLE package. Not to say that anyone who likes this game falls into that category, but there are a lot of people who do. I'll do my best to give an objective review here, from someone who has played beta to 50 and has spent enough time with it in both beta and release to really see what the full game has to offer.First things first - SWTOR is the ultimate example of what a theme park mmorpg is, and what I would call the 2000's model mmo. It takes everything that is typical of this model and gives it to you in the Star Wars universe, staying with every tried and true path to come before it. Some things it does infinitely times better (story telling, voice acting, cut scenes), other things are about equal to other AAA mmo's released over the last 3-5 years, and quite a few things are down right poor compared to those same mmo's. The more I've played SWTOR the more it does indeed seem that a huge majority of the money and development attention went towards the story, which resulted in feature after feature that seems to have received just enough attention to make it \"passable\" or \"just good enough\" as opposed to awesome or even just impressive. So let's break things down, from best to worst.- Story, voice acting, cut scenes - 9.5/10This is the selling point for TOR and by FAR the game's strongest feature. It's exactly what you would expect from Bioware and it definitely does not disappoint. All 8 classes have their own unique story which increases replayability a ton. Some may argue that the only difference is the class quests, which are a small portion of the game, so playing a new character isn't that much different - but isn't that still more than other mmo's have to offer? The effect of this feature is that it also increases the enjoyment of questing and dungeons (flashpoints) far above what I've experienced in the competition. Note that there are a lot of instanced quests in this game, but I didn't mind that. Similar to LOTRO, instancing quests affords the ability to make more complex story telling experiences possible in those instances. I would give this feature a 10/10, but one disappointment is that none of your decisions during conversations have real long term consequences or effects. You may alter the course of a quest, or experience different things in flashpoints, but at the end of the day your choices don't have that much impact. Still, that's a minor gripe, just having the small changes is better than nothing - which is better than all other mmo's offering in that regard, no choice at all.- Combat - 8/10The combat in TOR is good, it's nothing revolutionary but it isn't bad. Personally I think the animations are fine, although I've heard some complaints. The combat feels responsive and is smooth, and you do feel slightly more \"heroic\" as Bioware talked about by being able to demolish groups of mobs pretty quickly. I don't have a lot to add on this, it's basically the typical combat style of this mmo type.- Crafting - 7.5/10Crafting in TOR has a few nice twists. It is the typical theme park crafting model, but the ability to use companions, missions, mods and crits all help to make it a bit more unique. It's definitely no Vanguard, EQ2, or SWG crafting system, but it's a step above the system you would see in WOW, RIFT, AION, etc.- Flashpoints - 7.5/10Flashpoints, which are TOR's dungeons CAN BE a ton of fun. Focus on can be. The problem is that it seems they put a lot of time and effort into some dungeons (which are the awesome dungeons), and others are just filler. The great dungeons have a good amount of story, hidden things to trigger, crafting ability use to alter events in the dungeons, but the filler dungeons are pretty much just dungeons minus everything I just mentioned - what you would see in any other mmo. It's a shame that Bioware seemed to go the quantity over quality route in this regard to a degree. If there weren't the \"filler\" flashpoints I would give this category a 9/10, but there are, so 7.5/10.- Questing - 6/10Questing in TOR is a mixed bag. On one hand it's more fun than most other mmo's simply because of the story. The problem, however, is that most of the quests are still just kill, gather, or fetch quests. This is taken to the extreme actually, because other quest types familiar to the genre seem to be either absent completely in TOR or just in short supply such as escort quests, quests dropped from mobs, quests to defend certain areas or NPCs, etc. The voice acting is a nice addition, but it doesn't change the actual gameplay of the questing - which gets monotonous very fast, especially without a little more quest variety.- Graphics - 4/10The graphics in TOR are also an interesting mixed bag. Character models in cut scenes look spectacular, but after that, it is pretty poor. Textures in the world look about 5 years dated and so do character models (character models look different *better* in cut scenes). This is one area TOR is definitely behind the pack, as most mmo's over the last 3-5 years have had better graphics than TOR, at least in my opinion. Clearly they wanted to make the game easy on machines, for broader audiences, but it would have been nice if they designed it to look better for those who could handle it.- Space Combat - 3/10A huge disappointment. I would have rather they not even had space combat for launch and focused on giving us a quality space system down the road than release this. It's one of the few things TOR has to count as a feature not many other mmo's have, but they totally dropped the ball here. It's simple, it's boring, it's monotonous, it's Starfox.- U/I - 2/10Having played the beta, I figured there was no way they would release the game with the UI as it is.... but they did. I will say they are planning on improving it, so there is hope for the future with this. Still, releasing a 2012 MMO with a UI like this is almost insulting - there are literally almost 0 customization options with it and you can't even move your windows around. In general it's also quite cumbersome, as things like the Codex which you use frequently don't have they're own tab, so you must sift through other menus in order to get to it.- Character creation (race selection) - 1/10Another major disappointment in the game. First of all, your only choices of race or species are humans and basically..... more humans. For example, you can be a Zabrak (human with horns) or a Miralukan (human with blindfold on), or Cyborg (human with metal implants), etc etc. What a disappointment! For a game in the Star Wars universe and not being able to play as a Rodian, Bith, Ithorian, etc etc!- Character creation (appearance) - 3/10Your first choice is 1 of 4 body types, the 4th of which is a super fat guy which almost no one is going to want to be, so you have 3 options total for your height and size basically. Then you can choose from a handful of preset faces, half of which are just terrible. There are no sliders anywhere, everything is preset. There are ton of \"complexion\" options but those make very little change. Even the hair is disappointing - no long hair options for example. In general, it's another feature that is \"just good enough\", and another feature I'm shocked they didn't improve for release based on the massive amounts of beta feedback on this issue.**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************- World immersion / atmosphere - 2/10The story in TOR is very immersive, but this isn't about that. When it comes to the actual game world itself, honestly speaking, I have never played a AAA mmo that I have felt LESS immersed in than TOR. I do not say that for shock value, it is the truth. This is actually the first time I've noticed such a thing as this to the point that I'm bringing it up in a review. There are a LOT of contributing factors to this, each of which individually may not be that big of a deal, but add them all up and you've got a world that feels static, lifeless, and kind of like a card board cutout of a world. Let's look at why this is.** 1A. - NPC's - NPC's in social hubs and cities are just \"odd\". There are a lot of NPC statues in TOR, more than most AAA mmo's I would venture to say. Some move, but in a very limited capacity usually, like move lightsaber up, then down, then up, then down, then up, then down, etc. Many also are just locked in place doing what SHOULD be an action, but it's like time just stopped for them (such as a Jedi in the middle of casting a force power and he just sits there forever halfway done with his cast, or 2 people about to duel but they never do, they just sit forever like they are ABOUT to duel or fight). It's extremely weird looking and out of place.** 1B. - NPC's - You cannot interact with npc's. There is no clicking on random npc's for a short 1 or 2 sentence chat. The only npc's you can interact with in the game are vendors and quest givers, so statue npc's seem even more statue like since you can't interact with them.** 1C. - NPC'S - Lack of npc chatter and ambient noise (NPC mimes). There are a few npc background chatter conversations in the game, but not many. You will however see a lot of groups of npc's that are in essence mimes. They will be interacting with each other through animated gestures, but there is no sound to go along with it. Also creates a very weird atmosphere as you may be in a city full of npc's, but it's quiet as a library if the music stops playing (which it does at certain intervals)** 2. - Mobs - There is very little pathing for mobs in this game. What I mean is, almost all mobs and groups just sit in place like statues, waiting for the slaughter. You will find a patrol here and there, but like the npc's, it is a rarity. Most mmo's have static groups of mobs, but I haven't seen it done to the degree that TOR does.** 3. - Critters / world creatures - Where are they? TOR is almost completely void of life besides for mobs and npc's. You will occasionally find a world creature like the beasts in the beginning of Tython, but they are very rare, and like the mobs and npc's, just stuck in place usually.** 4. - Sound - Cities and social hubs need a lot more ambient noise and sound effects. Almost every major city or quest hub feels like a library or morgue rather than a bustling hub of activity.** 5. - Zoning - The fact that TOR has zones within zones really hurts as well because even when a lot of players are on a server, it never truly feels busy, as the game just creates more instanced copies of the same zones.** 6. - Music - There are too many periods with no music playing. It's especially noticeable when you're in a city, because it emphasizes the lack of other sounds even more. It's not uncommon to be in a quest hub or area with lots of npc's but experience dead quiet if the music stops.** 7. - Weather - There are no dynamic weather cycles. Dromund always has a storm, but it ALWAYS has that storm. Key word dynamic. It's not a huge deal, but it doesn't help the immersion.** 8. - Day / night cycle - There is no day / night cycle. Some people care about that, others don't, but again, it doesn't HELP immersion by not having it.** 9. - No swimming - Same as day / night, debatable, but doesn't help.** 10. - Sitting in chairs - Can sit in chairs in your ship, but that's it folks. Another small one, but it factors in for some people.All of these things combined result in world with an extremely static and lifeless feel.**************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************************- PVP - ??????I never pvp in games, so I can't comment on this aspect and won't attempt to talk about it without experience.- Miscellanous:** Guild functionality / features - 3/10 (completely bare bones guild set-up - although this is supposed to be getting addressed)** Galactic trade network (auction house) - 3/10 (needs A LOT of work)** Companions - 8/10 (fun feature and addition)** Music - 8/10 (good when it plays, but doesn't play often enough - too many periods of silence)** Map - 9/10 (loved the map, good job on this)** Extras - 8/10 (Datacrons, lore object finds and the Codex are enjoyable little extras)Overall - (2.5/5) - Chose to give 2 stars on Amazon.Bottom line - SWTOR is Star Wars + Bioware + years of hype, so I think most of us assumed it would be one of the highest quality mmo's of all time. SWTOR, for me, has been one of the biggest gaming disappointments I've ever experienced. I love Star Wars and Bioware games, so I thought this would be a lock as my MMO home for years or even decades in the future. I didn't think it would be possible for me to not like this game, but the longer I played the harder it became to ignore the shortcomings, to convince myself that I was having fun, that this was the high quality game it was hyped up to be. For each feature that is a step forward in QUALITY for the genre such as the story telling, it takes 5 steps that are either in place or going backward. Finally I just had to admit the reality of it, at least how it is to me:SWTOR is an amazing story telling experience, but not a very good game.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-18-2011"}

{"product_name":"B00009WAUH","description":"As renowned as theFinal Fantasyseries has become over the years, the release ofCrystal Chroniclesbrings with it an air of unfamiliarity. Although many of its elements tie into the greaterFinal Fantasyuniverse, this is but a faint echo of what you have come to know and love.While it can be argued that this is a new direction for the series, and therefore shouldn't be put on the same level as the other games, fans have come to expect the best fromFinal Fantasy, and with each passing release, Square has delivered.Crystal Chroniclesmay break new ground, but it lacks the creativity and passion of its role-playing brethren.As stylish as the character designs may be, they are completely void of personality. The story is just as ambiguous. Never once did I feel attached to my character, nor did I care what twists or turns the plot would make. TheFinal Fantasygames are renowned for storytelling, but it seems like an afterthought inCrystal Chronicles. Cinematic flair is also noticeably&nbsp;absent.The gameplay is just as careless and jagged. While the quest can be played single-player, it's meant to be tackled by a group of people (preferably four). Since each player utilizes menu screens often, Square and Game Designer's Studio decided that you could only play multiplayer with a Game Boy Advance attached to the GameCube. Hence, all menu management is done on the GBA screen, and the action on the TV is unaffected. In theory, this is a just solution. As it turns out, though, I found it to be more detrimental to the quest than anything.When a player accesses the GBA, their character on the TV cannot be controlled. Not only does this leave them open to attack, it more or less halts any progress that the group can make. So basically, you still find yourself sitting around waiting for your buddy to make preparations, but instead, you're doing it with a controller that has fewer buttons and dying batteries.To make matters worse, players must also keep an eye on a bucket. To prevent characters from scattering and trying to run in different directions, the bucket emits a field of energy that covers roughly 80 percent of the screen. If you go outside of this barrier, you'll take damage. So you basically must stay huddled together as one person carries the bucket throughout a stage. Without question, this is one of the stupidest ideas in the history of video games.When it comes to the basics of gameplay, the combat is respectable, but by no means great. I really like the timing-based combo system that accompanies both magic and general hack n' slash, yet I absolutely despise losing all of my magic with each new area that I enter. Hence, classes are not defined, and you never really get the impression that your character is growing in power.There's little here that truly excites.Crystal Chroniclesplays like an experiment gone awry, and is unfit to bear the sacrosanctFinal Fantasyname.Concept:A hack n' slash with inventive, yet highly aggravating GBA-based multiplayer connectivity, and a worthless bucketGraphics:Stylish character designs, gorgeous particle effects, and awesome boss designsSound:Not the familiarFinal Fantasymelodies, but memorable nonethelessPlayability:Steers away from button mashing with timing-based chains, manual spell aiming, and multi-person combosEntertainment:A cookie cutter adventure with a lackluster story, poor character growth, and frustrating playReplay:Moderately HighRated:7 out of 10Editor:Andrew ReinerIssue:February 20042nd Opinion:Crystal Chroniclesis here to remind us that every so often, Square Enix actually puts out an average game. It seems like for every thingFF: CCdoes right, it does two things wrong. Combining spells with your teammates is awesome, but half the time it's less effective than two individual castings, and you lose all of your magic between areas. The effects and character models are cool, but downtimes really drag and many cutscenes look awfully similar. The worst part, though, is that character advancement is the slowest I've ever seen. Beat a boss and get your choice of +1 to one of your stats! Thrilling. There is certainly some enjoyment to be had here, but it's sprinkled somewhat thinly among all of the lame and boring parts. On a console with a lot of great four-player titles,Crystal Chroniclesdoes very little to distinguish itself.Rated:7 out of 10Editor:Adam BiessenerSubscribe to Game Informer--Game Informer Review","reviewerName":"Cherrin Kim","summary":"do yourself a favor...","reviewText":"I say stay away from this game.It was 20 dollars wasted.Only good thing i could say about it is its graphics.

The game oozes with artistic creativity that brings to life a form of heavy metal throught the world you explore. I am no heavy metal fan but I enjoyed the soundtrack provided for the game and the influences of it throughout the game. The characters are wildly unique with great voiceovers and animation. The story is while not overally impressive does have an interesting twist.As for the gameplay, it is very different than your typical action title how it layers on strategy elements. With this ability your able to have groups of fighters helping you out at a time and often times they are used to set up stage battles. Stage battles are pretty unique. Instead of using resources such as trees, rocks, gold, or whatever to gain more units, you instead does this by having lots of fans. To get fans you have build stage pieces. The more fans you get the units and better ones you will gain. As for simply yourself, you gain abilities through Ozzie Osbourne who provides you with new weapons, parts for your vehicle, and so on.This game is really fun but a bit short.

{"product_name":"B009AGXH64","description":"","reviewerName":"Bradley Corwin","summary":"Nintendo Changes the Game Again","reviewText":"Whats in it?Wii U 32 GB Black, Wii U tablet controller, Nintendo Land game, tablet charging stand, table regular stand, tablet charging cable, Wii U power cable, HDMI cable, Wii Sensor, Wii U stand, Deluxe Digital PromotionIs it worth the $50 to get the deluxe over the basic?I would say that all the extras more than makeup for the $50.  You'd probably be going out and buying a lot of the extras anyhow and it would cost more in the long run.  I also prefer black over white so that was another deciding factor.Where did you find it?A lot of Target's in my area get regular shipments of them.  I just called one morning and they had one and reserved it for me until I got off of work.  There's a lot of bundles out there too, I don't really think the off-brand extras that are thrown in are really worth the increased price.  Just be patient and you can find one pretty easy, and there's no reason to pay extra to those people that are just trying to price gouge since they got it early.The components themselves:- The console is pretty slick looking, backwards compatible with Wii games.  Something I noticed is there is no ethernet port so you are stuck with wireless (I usually prefer wired connections but I didn't notice any problems).- I like the tablet controller more than I thought I would.  It is very comfortable and lightweight.  The biggest complain I have read is about battery life, I don't play games a really long time and I always put it on the charge stand and haven't had any problems.  My brightness is set to 2.  It is very responsive and I haven't had any problems with it.  On some games you can even play the game solely on the controller so someone else can use the TV.- I do like black consoles over anything else but unfortunately the console and tablet controller are shiny black, being fingerprint and dust magnets.  It doesn't bother me that much but may to some people.- I really like the charging stand, it makes it really convenient to just set your tablet on and let it charge.  I don't use the non-charging stand for the Wii U tablet but I use it for my Nexus 7.  It's also worth noting that your charging stand takes your controller charger cable, so if you want to plug and play you will have to unplug it from the stand.  The Wii U console stands I don't use, I like it laying down, that's also how the logo is written.- You get this slick black console and then the power brick, controller charger, and HDMI cord are this ugly grey.  Why Nintendo why...- Nintendo Land is a decent game that demos out a lot of the ways the new controller can be used.  It's not the same awe effect as Wii Sports but worth playing around with.- Nintendo Digital Deluxe Promotion, 10% back on all digital purchases.  For details see [...]Be warned:Since the console only uses one tablet controller currently you will need your Wii remotes.  Also games like the New Super Mario Bros U (an amazing game) doesn't use the tablet as a \"regular\" controller for multiplayer.  I had a tablet and Wii remote and the tablet was only used as an overview / create helpful platforms for the other player.  To \"truly\" play two player you will need two Wii remotes.The game selection:I only have The New Super Mario Bros U and Nintendo Land- The New Super Mario Bros U is an amazing game that lives up to the Mario name.  It is like a HD Super Mario 3, that takes inspiration from every Mario created.  It is amazing and really brings you back to the old days.  I would say the console is worth it solely for this.- There are a lot of game currently out that have gotten mixed reviews or say is it really any better with the new controller.  It will take time for developers to know how to use this technology but there is a lot of promise there.  Also considering things like Xbox SmartGlass are on the horizon I can bet that it will have a similar effect as the Wii U tablet, so I think game developers are already working on new ways to incorporate those technologies.The software:As you probably already know there is a pretty large update for the console when you turn it on if you want access to any of the network functionality.  What you may not know is that each app and game also has a decent wait time while they each get updated.  Right now launching any apps like Netflix or Amazon Instant Video is a little slow.  I think this will easily be fixed with some software updates in the future.  Try not to get too upset and be patient.  I have watched a movie on Netflix and Amazon Instant Video on the Wii U and it plays fine.  The tablet incorporation is a little laggy and can be improved but again, look at any last generation console from what it looked like when it came out and what it looks like now.  That's the beautiful things about the consoles now, they can keep getting updated and be made better as we learn more.Can the Wii U hold out against the upcoming Playstation and Xbox?Nintendo always survives based on its ingenuity and its franchise games.  The truth is with so few details on what's coming it's impossible to say.  If you are a Nintendo fan then you will have no regret getting the Wii U.  Based on the past releases I would also guess that the Playstation and Xbox will be a lot more expensive.Final thoughts:If you are a Nintendo fan and love the games then this is an easy buy.  I love the console, mainly just for New Super Mario Bros U right now.  Look through the launch and if you think it's something that you want then go ahead and try it out.  If you are unsure, are satisfied with your current console, or are not really a Nintendo fan then just wait for more details to come on other new consoles.  I see for all consoles the software getting better and games changing the way we play them, the future of gaming is very exciting.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-05-2012"}

All in all, if you managed to blast your way through GTA IV, Episodes from Liberty City is a must have, and it's great to see it finally hit the PS3.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-14-2010"}

Durham \"Big Evil\"","summary":"Fun re-invention of the RE/light gun formula","reviewText":"Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles marks Capcom's long running horror series' return to the light gun shooter formula.  For those that remember the series' first foray into the genre, the less than enjoyable Resident Evil: Survivor for the PS1, have no fear that Umbrella Chronicles improves on the formula in nearly every which way.  With environments and characters straight out of previous games in the series (including the classic mansion and Raccoon City), long time fans of the series will be rejoicing at all the nostalgiac touches that populate most of The Umbrella Chronicles.  The shooting action is more than solid, and the Wii controls are quite good as well for the most part.  What hurts The Umbrella Chronicles are the repetitive moments that also populate the game, as well as graphical and character animation glitches.  It won't take you long to see a majority of the enemies the game has to offer, and as far as light gun shooters as a whole go, Umbrella Chronicles doesn't offer anything new.  Despite that though, there's still a lot to admire.  The music score is spooky, the side quests are fun with extra content to unlock, and the boss fight with Nemesis is worth the price of admission alone.  All in all, Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles is a fun re-working of the RE/light gun formula, and is worth picking up for light gun shooter and Resident Evil fans alike.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-15-2007"}

{"product_name":"B0010YOQIW","description":"Seven years prior to the events of FINAL FANTASY VII &#x2014;   The Shinra Company is rapidly increasing its influence through its monopoly on mako energy and military might. With the burgeoning city of Midgar as its base and symbol of prosperity, Shinra is on the verge of establishing absolute dominance over the world. SOLDIER is a group of skilled combat operatives within Shinra. The elite within the group &#x2014; those strong enough to be deemed SOLDIER 1st Class &#x2014; are respected and idolized by the citizenry.   Zack is a young SOLDIER 2nd Class who aspires to become a 1st. He spends his days carrying out assignments under the guidance of his 1st Class mentor, Angeal. During an operation in Wutai, a large number of SOLDIER members, led by 1st Class operative Genesis, go missing. The severity of the situation prompts Shinra executives to deploy even more SOLDIER operatives in hopes of bringing an end to the war with Wutai&#x2014;and conducting an investigation into the mass desertion. The ones assigned to the mission are Zack, Angeal, and the 1st Class hero who is known the world over as Sephiroth...   What truths lie behind Genesis's disappearance? What secrets bind the three SOLDIER 1st Class operatives? For Zack, a cruel and fateful struggle awaits...","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"4.5 Stars: An Amazing Addition to the Final Fantasy VII Collection","reviewText":"Pros:+Amazing storyline+Impressive graphics and CGI+Easy to learn combat system+Plenty of side missions+Remixed music sounds greatCons:-Gameplay can be repetitive-Not always the best voice actingWhether you care to believe it or not, Final Fantasy VII became one of the most influential video games ever made.  More than ten years later, the game is still a milestone in gaming, with fans playing it religiously, even to this day.  Dirge of Cerberus didn't exactly make a big splash in the Final Fantasy VII fandom.  However, Crisis Core not only succeeds in the places where Dirge of Cerberus did not, it also helps to fill in many gaps found in the original storyline.Crisis Core is a prequel to the main game and centers on Zack Fair, a member of Shinra's SOLDIER Unit.  He dreams of one day being a hero, and he gets his chance when a member of SOLDIER 1st Class suddenly goes missing in Wutai and Zack is sent to investigate.  This sets the stage for the events leading up to Final Fantasy VII in an amazing, detailed story that helps to answer a few lingering questions from Final Fantasy VII, and helps us see Zack as much more than a mere plot device.  The story is told through some CGI cutscenes that look as though they were ripped straight out of Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children.  Needless to say, the story sequences look spectacular.  Throughout the story you'll get to know some new faces and you'll see other characters pop up from Final Fantasy VII and even Dirge of Cerberus.  Any devoted fan to the original Final Fantasy VII will be absorbed and enthralled by the storyline.Crisis Core is, first and foremost, an action RPG.  At first the combat can be slightly confusing.  As you traverse through areas you'll enter Combat Mode where you'll fight many enemies at once.  You'll mostly be mashing on the X button to land attacks but you can also block attacks and dodge attacks.  The L and R buttons also let you cycle through your attack, items and materia.  Battling is very similar to Kingdom Hearts.  Including the button mashing experience.  The game isn't too hard to get into, but some of its other mechanics concerning battling can be a little confusing at first.Crisis Core utilizes what's called a Digital Mind Wave (DMW).  The Digital Mind Wave is a slot machine in the corner of the screen that is constantly spinning.  At first this may just seem like something to give you a little boost in battle.  From time to time you'll find that in a battle you can use Magic without losing MP, or you'll get a bonus that keeps you from being knocked down by attacks, or even a moment of temporary invincibility among other things the DMW can do.  However, as you'll soon discover, the DMW is also responsible for increasing levels, performing limit breaks, and leveling up your materia.  You have no control over the slots, but much of the system actually works in your favor.  You'll come to realize you get level ups and perform limit breaks quite often in battle.  In short, the DMW in no way interferes with combat itself.  The learning curve to Crisis Core is relatively simple.Final Fantasy wouldn't be Final Fantasy without sidequest.  When not going through the main story, Zack can undertake missions for Shinra.  If there was anything that Crisis Core lacks, it's creativity in its side missions.  While there are literally hundreds of them, they all simply send you off to dispatch more enemies.  While some of them are fun (particularly boss battles) it can become repetitive rather fast.  On the bright side, however, they yield some great rewards and they often go by quickly.Graphically, it's needless to say that Crisis Core is arguably the best looking PSP game out there.  You'll be amazed at how detailed everything is.  You'll also revisit areas from Final Fantasy VII and they look almost exactly the same, only being given a huge face lift.  Even some Playstation 2 games don't look as good as Crisis Core.Musically, the game actually sounds pretty good.  A lot of the battle themes grow on you and become catchy after a while.  The music presented in many of the areas is also really good.  There are also some tracks remixed from Final Fantasy VII that sound really good.Does Crisis Core have any real problems?  Yes, but they're not huge problems by any means.  For starters, the voice acting isn't the greatest.  There are some good voice talents, but there are also a couple of wooden voices here.  In addition to that, you can't skip any cutscenes, which can serve as a major problem if you happen to lose a tough battle.  You also can't control the camera in battle which would really help the player out when the enemy clouds your vision (you can, however, control the camera outside of battle).The biggest problem with Crisis Core is that you spend much of your time just mashing on one button throughout the game.  Even worse, the game's combat system is a little too easy to take advantage of.  It's a great combat system, but it is also a combat system that doesn't really challenge the player enough.At the very least, however, the story is more than enough to make up for the shortcomings.  Fans of the original game will more than likely be overcome with nostalgia when they reimmerse themselves within the world of Final Fantasy VII.  If you loved Final Fantasy VII, by all means pick up Crisis Core.  It's a treat for any and all Final Fantasy VII fans.  Needless to say, if Final Fantasy VII wasn't your cup of tea, then Crisis Core is most definitely not for you.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-26-2008"}

{"product_name":"B00005NZ1K","description":"The power-packing Xbox hardware delivers the third Oddworld title in one of the most brilliantly realized settings to grace any gaming system. Blending unique gameplay, humorous characters and interactions, and the aforementioned graphics,Munch's Oddyseesimply feels unlike any other game in the 2001 console gaming lineup. Players control two characters in the game: Munch, a wheelchair-bound hero, and Abe, a character some gamers will recognize from previous Oddworld games. Their goal is to find and free the Mudokon queen, keeper of the remaining eggs of an endangered species.Both characters feature unique talents that, via a tag-team style of play, propel the player through the game. For instance, Abe can climb and jump to reach new areas, as well as temporarily possess an enemy's soul via a chant. The web-footed Munch can swim to new areas and, when on the roll in his wheelchair, use his sonar plug to control machinery remotely. Saving an entire race also requires a coordinated effort on everyone's part. To get the job done quickly, players can deliver verbal commands to kinsmen. They'll gladly greet you (in a witty manner), then gang up on a mean-spirited enemy or accomplish difficult tasks for you. As with the rest of the game world, the finely detailed characters and environments, as well as a refreshing charm, draw you into an experience with the quality of a Pixar film. Prepare for gaming to get very odd indeed.","reviewerName":"K. Cardinell \"cardine\"","summary":"Kind of Weird","reviewText":"This game is really wierd.  But it is fun in the end.

McKenzie","summary":"Terrific Experience No Matter How You Play It","reviewText":"I'm gonna assume that if you're reading this review, you are someone who is either:*A) new to the \"Metal Gear Solid\" series, and are just catching upor*B) wondering what the differences with each \"MGS2\" release.First off,\"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\" was released in Nov. 2001 for the PS2.In March 2003, \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance\" was released, with extra content.Well, if you're new to the series, the answer is simple:Yes, you must play these incredible titles, and I highly recommend getting the \"Metal Gear Solid: Essential Collection\" to get yourself caught up.  Just make sure you have a PS1 Memory Card to save your data for the 1st game.  \"MGS2\" & \"MGS3\" need the PS2 Memory Card.  The version you'll get from the Essential Collection is the definitive release.Now, onto those of you who're looking to \"Metal Gear Solid 2\" ONLY.\"MGS2: Substance\" is the version to buy.  To avoid confusion, Substance is the version that includes everything, adds more, and removes nothing.  Other than price, there is no reason to purchase \"Sons of Liberty\".A lot of time, deluxe versions and rereleases add worthless content just to sell more copies.  But \"MGS2: Substance\" greatly increases in replay value through it's VR Missions, Snake Tales, and Skateboarding modes.  Skateboarding is basic, but a fun little diversion.  Snake Tales is a great way to revisit the \"Metal Gear\" world with alternate storylines (although it'd have been nice to have cutscenes instead of text).  And the VR Missions are inventive and are guaranteed to enhance your abilities in the regular \"Sons of Liberty\" playthrough.Was \"Sons of Liberty\" a great game?  Absolutely.  It still is.But to me, \"Substance\" adds so much more, why just settle for the story?Besides, there are those who think MGS2 just went crazy with its convoluted plot.  Maybe you oughta get some bonus content just in case you fall into that category.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-15-2010"}

Origin began as a secret military project run by the Aramacham Technology Corporation (ATC) . In an experiment run by Alma's own father, her DNA was used to create two clones that possessed her impressive psychic powers in an attempt to engineer a telepathic military commander. In the end, the research team became worried about the dangers of Alma's powers, and they tried to kill her.While her heart stopped beating and her physical body died, her psychic energy continued to exist, and she manifested herself in many forms, including both a child and a deformed adult figure that betrays the gruesomeness of her ordeal. Due to a string of events tied to both her clones, Alma has escaped the disastrous explosion of the last game and the facility where she was held, and the haunting manifestations of her power are at work all around you, adding an unpredictable, nightmarish quality to the world.Strange Events in a Supernatural SettingIn order to get anywhere in the rubble of the city of Auburn, you'll need to survive firefights, stay calm in the face of surprisingly graphic events, and uncover the terrifying and mysterious nature of your real enemies. Your character's phenomenal reflexes allow the much-talked-about slow motion effect from the original title to persist here, giving you an edge in combat and adding to the unique nature of your perspective.Improved Details and Enemy AIAn enhanced graphics engine means more detailed environments to explore and better effects. The vast destruction in the city opens up a huge variety of spaces and enhances the other-worldly feel of your mission, and you better be ready to stay on guard because all-new enemies powered by improved AI don't just act more realistically than their predecessors, they employ advanced combat tactics and know how to use the environment against you. But they aren't the only ones with more resources at their disposal--additional world interaction enhancements allow you to create cover and protect yourself or remove obstacles from your path.While it may be the horrific action and the details that first catch your eye, the tactical demands and the way story elements are slowly unveiled promise to help keep you interested as gameplay wears on. And for those times when you're not in the mood for a prolonged single-player campaign, this title also offers the ability to battle with or against friends in multiplayer mode.","reviewerName":"PM_SuperFreak","summary":"An excellent, creepy shooter","reviewText":"When F2 first came out years ago, I tried a demo but didn't like it because the environment was extremely dark and didn't display well at all on my old TV. Now that I have a modern TV set, I decided to give this game another try, and I am very glad that I did. This shooter is crafted extremely well in terms of environments and level design. The maps are super detailed and the lighting effects really creeped me out in several areas. Although it is a linear in nature, the gameplay does not feel linear at all because the maps are large and you have to explore and find your way.Enemies and weapons are varied enough to keep you engaged. Enemy AI is top-notch; they will take cover and keep moving as they take shots at you. You don't see the glitches that exist in Crysis such as enemies running against walls or just standing there not moving at all.Also, there are some mech levels that break up the flow/feel of the game a bit. Nothing too revolutionary but serves as a good change of pace. I was expecting some supernatural powers but I may have confused this with FEAR3.If you haven't played this game yet, definitely get it as it is real cheap now. It took me at least 8 hours to complete the campaign mode. Definitely going to get FEAR3!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"08-04-2011"}

Scott","summary":"Halo with a new coat of paint","reviewText":"The graphics are great, cept master chief's armor looks different, which makes no sense storyline wise.The Story is very anime-ish, it feels like a Halo fan-fiction instead of a Halo video game. It has some really cool moments but most of the game you'll be scratching your head and wondering where all the fun went.Very Retcon-ny, and does a poor job of incorporating the story from earlier games.Controls are tight and multiplayer, though very differently organized, plays the same as Reach. Though I didn't like the overly complex customization in reach and its back but worse in this game. Non of the multiplayer armors look like spartans. Everything is just a jumbled mash of metal and glass. Lacks the artfulness of Halo 3's simple armor permutations.The stupid Cr currency is gone, thank goodness.Strange side note: Nearly every sound effect is different. While the sounds varied from game to game, the guns and vehicles do not sound at all like they did before. In my opinion this hurts the game as it makes it feel farther removed from the original halo games.Conclusion:If you liked Reach more than Halo 3 and Halo 2, you'll like this game. Unfortunately, I didn't really like reach. However, this game is still king when it comes to tight gameplay and addicting gametypes. If you buy for story, you might be disappointed, but those buying for the multiplayer only with be satisfied.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-10-2012"}

Like FF Tactics, this is a battle rattle for RTS boys, with a glut of sophomoric Japanese idealistic fantasizing about teamwork, plus a few cloyingly sweet short movies for FF's other demographic, infantile girls.  But seriously folks, I have a real beef with the creators of this game:  The gratuitous gory details about viera outcasts were peurile and underdramatized, to quote Wednesday Adams.

Being created by the same developers and getting some awesome reviews, I decided to give Red Dead Redemption a shot, contrary to the fact that I am not a big fan of wild west genre either. After playing 30+ hours of story mode and few hours online, here is what I thought.*************PROS.*****************TOUCHING STORY: The story, to me at least, was the strongest aspect of this game. I personally loved it. The game is about life and struggles of \"a cowboy\" called John Marston. Unfortunately, I can't describe more without spoiling, but as you will progress through the game you will learn some shocking facts about this main character and story will introduce you to some mind-blowing surprises that you will not see coming.GREAT OPENWORLD WILD WEST GAMEPLAY: After the story, this is the second most appealing feature of the game. You are free to roam in relatively huge open world and do variety of activities, which include but are not limited to shooting bandits and thieves, gambling, playing various games, catching and taming horses, hunting and ranching. Words are simply not enough to describe these gameplay or the joy will get from it. Play it to experience it.PLENTY OF MISSIONS AND SIDE MISSIONS: The story of this game is divided into missions. You will be traveling from one point on the world map to another to get these missions like GTA games and doing a huge variety of things (see above section). Completing each mission will unlock new missions. In addition to main missions, you will have plenty of side missions. To me both doing missions and side missions was very rewarding as completing them would unlock more of the fascinating story or humorous events.GREAT IN GAME GRAPHICS, ANIMATION AND ART: This game looks wild west looks gorgeous. I am so amazed contrary to taking place in big open world, everything you see and experience feels so real. From creation of different land structures to plants, trees, animal and people, everything gives you the feeling that you are in actual wild west. Gorgeous simply gorgeous!CINEMATIC CUTSCENES: Cutscenes are so nicely designed in this game that sometimes you forget you are playing a game and it simply feels like a movie. Part of that is due to the solid voice acting and part is due to detail in facial expressions of different characters. There are a lot of cutscenes, but most are short and well placed between the missions.GREAT LENGTH AND REPLAYABILITY: As stated above, I am 30+ hr into the game. I have finished the main story, but there are still many side missions and miscellaneous activity to finish. These days when most games are 6-10 hr long, having games like this makes my day (or month to be precise).ONLINE GAMEPLAY: Not a huge fan of online gameplay anymore, but to those who care, it is available in this game and from little I have played, it feels quite addicting. Please refer to other reviews, as I am not a big fan of this.DOWNLOADABE CONTENTS: While it is not free, to those who care you can download few DLCs off online. To me, the most interesting one seems the undead nightmare.*************CONS.*****************WATER=INSTANT DEATH: Hate it, simply hate it. I can understand if you say the main character can't swim, but then create invisible walls where you have bodies of water. What will happen is you will go near a body of water because it will have a chest there and before you know it you move your analogue stick in slightly wrong direction, fall into the water and die. So stupid!MINOR GLITCHES: Hate to point it out, but there are minor glitches in the game. There are places you will get stuck or fall. But don't worry, it is nowhere near as bad as Fallout 3.*************CONCLUSION***********I give this game 9/10. Some of you may ask why give it such a high score after describing such cons. But the fact is this game has faults because the developers have been daring and tried to create something unique and big. If it can please me (a non GTA and not Wild West genre fan) then I would say it is a must buy for those who love either GTA or Wild West genre.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-14-2011"}

This MMORPG delivers everything that can make a burnout RPG player feel like they are level 1 again and thrown into a huge world full of conflict and whatever they can go take advantage of. Even the new starting zones for two new races are very unique and make you wonder why weren't they there before.I /salute Blizzard once again for delivering a high quality product to keep us end gamers busy.

Paying tribute to Mega Man creator Keiji Inafune, Capcom's Mega Man Anniversary Collection anthology set will collect Mega Man 1 through 8 in a single package in addition to two arcade titles never before released in the U.S., Mega Man: The Power Battle and Mega Man: The Power Fighters. In addition to an updated soundtrack, fans of the blue hero will also find a cache of unlockable bonus features that include 30 minutes of anime (PlayStation 2 version), producer interviews (GameCube version) and a history of the series.","reviewerName":"Dennis Laycock","summary":"Button configuration makes sense, if you think about it","reviewText":"Like 99% of the reviewers below, I was at first stymied and annoyed by Capcom's choice to make the A button shoot and the B button jump, a set-up that goes against the last 20 years of video gaming.However, I started to think of the alternative:  Since the rapid-fire button is above the fire button, that means if B fired, you'd have to switch fingers to go from single shot to rapid fire.  Capcom simply was trying to keep the two fire buttons together, and it works, after a few minutes to get used to it.Now that that's out of the way, the game:  I believe that the first three Mega Man games are three of the best video games of all time, and certainly three of the top 20 platform games ever.  The quality starts to slide after that (sometimes in graphics, always in playability), but this disc is worth having for the first three games alone.The variety is the reason Mega Man is so fun.  One screen might be filled with small enemies to attack; scroll over and there's a jumping challenge with disappearing platforms; the next screen has a large mini-boss; then there's a tall obstacle you have to find a way to get over, etc.  It's not just mindless, dull jumping and shooting - the levels are expertly designed.  The sound and music also stands out.  The tunes are insanely catchy, and I love the chirping sound Mega Man makes when he lands after a jump.Of course the novel idea behind Mega Man is choosing the order of the bosses you fight and using their own weapons against the next boss.  Finding out that one weapon that destroys a certain boss when nothing else makes a dent is hugely satisfying.Overall, this is an awesome package, and it's PRICED RIGHT (see Nintendo's current GameBoy Advance Classics series for an example of how not to price 20-year-old games).

This really harkens back to a time when many games had environmental puzzles like Soul Reaver and other great of yore, most games today are only about the action and forget the exploration and \"good\" puzzle solving.- Great comic book inspired art style nothing in this game looks bland and all the enemies look/move great. Also the game has a great uses of color and gets away from using the many grays, browns, and blacks found in many other action games found today.BAD:- The story here is pretty by the numbers and forgettable but is sort of connected to the end of the world concerning four horsemen from the Book of Revelations in the Bible.IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:- A 3D action beat-em-up type of game similar to that of Devil May Cry, where your beat up enemies using swords ands such with \"flashy combos\" just that this title can be over the top with violence it uses in its finisher moves like that found in God of War.- The game also has many environmental puzzles like that found in the famed Legend of Zelda series where you use items like boomerangs, gliding, and grappling hooks to find your way through the world and to your goals.- You play as mostly a silent protagonist named War (supposedly as one of the four horsemen from the Book of Revelations in the Bible) who is big as a tank (he would fit in with the crew from Gears of War bulk wise) but strikingly nimble and fights with a large sword.- Much like Zelda as well as Devil May Cry you can backtrack to any area and get items you missed and at certain points in the game you have to go back and backtrack to complete objectives. There is also a warp system to make travel easier.- At one point in the game you ride a griffon to get to a far location, this plays as an on-rails shooter and is very similar to gameplay found in Panzer Dragoon (Sega Saturn) or REZ (PS2).- Killing enemies grants you souls of different colors, green for health, yellow for your abilities meter, and blue for currency.- Almost all your upgrades, weapons, and items you have to buy from an in game store using collected souls of enemies that you slain (blue souls). There is a demon that runs this store and is a bit funny.- You also at different times in the game get a scythe as well as gauntlets for hand to hand combat, and even a gun.- Towards the end of the game you get an ability to make portals to a limited degree, this works much like the popular Valve game Portals, even to the point of having blue and orange colored portal openings.- About halfway into the game you get a Horse name Ruin, this horse can only be ridden in certain areas in the game (namely the desert area). While riding Ruin you can still hit enemies with your sword as well as shoot at them with your gun.- Pretty early in the game you will get a yellow meter under your life bar that fills when you get yellow souls, you can use the energy in this meter for a few different abilities like making spikes shoot from the ground to harm enemies, stone skin for extra defense as well as a poison mist that will harm enemies.- Later in the game you will get a type of rage meter that fills when you kill enemies, when this meter fills you can turn into (for a short time) a huge red and black looking demon that does massive damage and is invincible.GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:- Dante's Inferno (360, PS3)- God of War 3 (PS3)- The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess (Wii)- Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (PS1, Dreamcast)ADDITIONAL NOTES:- All the art for the game was done by Joe Madureira AKA Joe Mad of 90's Marvel comic fame, Joe Mad also had a popular but short lived comic series called Battle Chasers.- Those that pre-ordered this game or got it very early enough got a slip of paper with code to be entered at the THQ website for a free copy of Red Faction: Guerrilla, As well as a mixed media DVD with Darksiders videos as well as art.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-08-2010"}

If you liked the first two, you'll really like the third. If you hated the first two, then you'll probably hate this one too. GOW 3 takes everything done well on the first two and improves upon them. The story is cleaner, the gameplay is crisp and refined, and the graphics are really sharp. There are some new weapons and enemies, but by and large you can pick up this game and play immediately and it will feel familiar to fans of the series.Even with 5 stars, I think their online play needs a lot of work. It takes me five to ten minutes to get into an online Horde or Beast mode of the game. I've been dropped on every multiplayer mode except co-op campaign (only because I haven't tried that yet).  Epic needs to take a lesson from Bungie and get online right before making such a robust selection of game types. If you're expecting to play mostly online modes, be prepared for serious frustration.I still think GOW 3 is a five star game. It's the sort of game I imagine I will still want to replay years down the road (e.g. GOW 1 and 2, the Halo series, Mass Effect, etc.).

{"product_name":"B002I0H79C","description":"Gears of War 3","reviewerName":"Michael J. Tresca \"Talien\"","summary":"Mad World Indeed","reviewText":"When I heard Gears of War 3 was written by Karen Traviss, author of the Gears of War novels, I hoped that we would finally have a campaign that would break the mold of the traditional rail shooter/pointless dialogue/tired boss fight.  I was wrong.Let's get multiplayer out of the way first.  Gears of War 3 optimizes the already awesome multiplayer experience.  I play every Wednesday night in Horde mode and it simply can't be beat. Halo fans will miss the ability to jump, but the rest of us will enjoy the same ducking, covering, and chainsawing action we've come to know and love is an integral part of the multiplayer experience.But it's the campaign that I enjoy playing with my brother, and here Gears of War 3 falls short. SPOILERS OF WAR: By necessity I need to talk about what happens in the game in order to critique it.  You have been warned!First, Dom's death.  Dom, who memorably put his tortured wife out of her misery in previous games, has another emotional moment in the third installment. After journeying so far to find a fuel tank for their super-secret submarine, Dom decides that the only way for them to escape is by smashing his vehicle into said fuel tank. So he does, to the accompaniment of the solo version of \"Mad World\" that was so memorable in Donnie Darko (apparently no one saw this movie, because so many reviewers mention that they first heard the song from the Gears of War 3 commercial). But music alone does not a poignant moment make, and Dom's death seems pointless.  Where do our heroes get their fuel after journeying so far?  Shut up and chainsaw grubs!Gears flirts with these mysteries throughout the campaign, and almost all of the story's flaws are pointed out by Baird.  Why is Phoenix's father working on a cure to the Lambent problem? Why does the Queen hint that humanity shares a common history with the native Locusts?  Why is the Queen a human leading the Locusts?  None of these issues are resolved or explained.Oh there are ways to find out.  There's mythos and lore scattered throughout the three games that suggests certain conclusions, but the end game's dialogue brazenly asks these questions openly...and never answers them.  It's almost like Traviss was overruled with the developers.  It's a frustrating experience for those of us who appreciate a good story.It's not just the story. The boss fight is repetitive and anticlimactic - we don't even get a multistage monster that forces you to change tactics.  Instead, you fight the same giant bug ridden by the Queen, alternating between the Hammer of Dawn and another weapon, until it dies.  The Queen is not even a combatant - she is stabbed in the gut by Phoenix in an act that has creepy misogynistic undertones. Phoenix's father, who tested the serum on himself, doesn't turn into a giant monster like I hoped.And that's just it.  This isn't a good story, it's an excuse for He-Man action figures with chainsaw guns to tear up Locusts.  Unfortunately Tom Bissell was right that we said that we need to bring art back to gaming; but he was wrong in thinking the solution would be to hire more authors. This most recent Gears of War 3 is proof that even with the author of the novels at the helm, the campaign is marginally engaging at best.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-17-2012"}

San Andreas is the only GTA game where you CAN do anything your twisted little heart desires. The graphics may not be the best, but they're an improvement over the previous titles. Soundtrack, I felt was a little weak compared to Vice City. All it is mostly is rap music(unless you're into that kind of thing) but the cool thing is it has some good rock songs and the infamous Lowrider song. Controls are almost the same, except now you can aim with any weapon, which is really cool. Also worth noting is the ability to wield dual weapons like 2 Tec-9s, sawed-off shotguns, and 9mm pistols and new to this is the heat-seeking rocket launcher. Now as for vehicles, you can pretty much steal anything that moves. Trains, planes, cars, bikes, you name it, you can take it. The size of the game is too big for words. It almost defies logic of how it can be so huge and have so much to do. Upgrade your character to get muscular or fat, hairstyle, clothes and more gives this game a more realistic feeling. Topnotch acting with the likes of Samuel L. Jackson. Tons of missions and side-missions. This is one of THE games to get. The only ones that could compete is Metal Gear Solid 3 and Devil May Cry 3.

With true-to-life race car steering, shifting, braking and acceleration, your game gets so real you may want to buckle up.","reviewerName":"Phantasmagoria","summary":"Bumps, shudders, pulls and corrects like a real wheel","reviewText":"The only VG wheel I ever had was a dreamcast 3rd party nightmare that had pedals and rumble but the play from side to side made all of the DCs driving games unplayable.  Force feedback always sounded like fun to me if they could get it right though, and Logitech who really seem to be churning out some quality accessories lately has stepped up again.The wheel unit with its plethora of buttons attaches quickly and painlessly to the proper type of table (one without a lip) attach the pedals, power supply and usb connector to console and you are ready to roll.  The wheel goes through an alignment spin when hooked up and when a game starts so make sure any appendages especially small ones are out of the way when firing things up.  I tried Burnout Paradise first and the driving and pedals work great, but some of the games important features can't be remapped (EBRAKE square) and this makes the wheel not ideal for this game, but it works and the rumble and force feedback are powerful with this game.  GT5 is the real test and the driving force really gets to show off ripping around the six courses of Gran Turismo.  When you bump another racer or hit grass or rumble strip the wheel lets you know it with an appropriate amount of varied rumble effects.  When you are pulling tightly into and out of a high speed turn, it pulls like the wheels of a real vehicle would and corrects coming out like it should.  The gas pedal sits high and is close enough to the brake pedal to use one foot on both, and is just far enough apart to use 2 feet if you wish. The plastic on the pedals could be a little thicker though.  The wires can be a little much with this unit but the feeling of speed and realistic driving is worth the pain.  The wheel is setup to work for most driving games (Sega Rally Revo, Dirt etc..) but really was made for the tracks of GT THE DRIVING SIMULATOR.  A little pricey but the overall quality (light up horn button, nice wheel grip etc.) make it feel worth the price.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-30-2008"}

Maes","summary":"Clumsy buttons to use, oversized, overweight and unecessary G-shift button make for a very uncomfortable mouse.","reviewText":"I'm really disappointed with this mouse after some people recommended it.It sounds great at first...12 side buttons....You quickly realise you have to change your grip on the mouse and move your palm forward or backward to reach them all. And if you are anything like me..you'll also quickly wonder why you need 12 buttons, even if you're an MMO gamer.Your thumb has a limited range of motion and while you might be able to barely reach all the buttons, actually pressing them became a really clumsy and very uncomfortable experience after a few hours.Actually finding the buttons is problematic too, while two of the buttons have an indentation, and they are positioned at angles, when it matters most I often did miss the button or forgot a button that I didn't use a lot, or wrongly mapped a button and now couldn't access my ability. This mouse is serious micromanagement, it's not a casual mouse by any means.Then there's an even bigger issue. The G-shift button on the right hand side of the mouse. Like the name implies, it's a SHIFT function, that make those 12 buttons into 24 buttons.But here the problems start. Normally people have their ring finger and pinky to support the mouse and they use those to push the mouse around. Because your ring finger is now on the G-shift, you only have your pinky to push the mouse around, and it being such a heavy mouse...makes it really uncomfortable.Another problem is that when you want to use the scroll wheel or click the wheel, you move your middle or index finger, which puts even more pressure on your pinky and thumb because of the massive width of the mouse.In summary:*uncomfortable*most side buttons are not easy to reach or press*the G-shift button was completely unnecessary*the mouse is very heavy, 3 times as heavy as a regular mouse, do not understimate how heavy the mouse is*it's very wide, you need a big enough hand to grip it properly and even then it feels wide*pushing the mouse around is a serious pain after a while because you only have your pinky to do it and the mouse is heavy and wideI went back to my G500S.

{"product_name":"B002I0H738","reviewerName":"Niedducciano","summary":"Pluses/Minuses","reviewText":"I have been an Xbox user for years.  The PS3 is a system that has always intrigued me, though.  It is always louded as the higher level technology especially with the BluRay.  It had integrated wi-fi before Xbox, and the online interactions don't cost money (you don't *have* to pay to play online).  And so, for these reasons, I bought a PS3 250GB system.  Here are my thoughts on it.Pros:As I've already mentioned, the PS3 is a BluRay player as well as game consol.  You can watch movies and play games in 3D (which sometimes can make an okay game epic, or other times make you sick to your stomach - those with vertigo be warned).  You can surf the internet right on your TV.  And you can play online multiplayer games for no additional cost.Cons:Now, I want to point out the issues that I have.  The aesthetics - even though your main home screen isn't exactly ugly, I don't feel like I was just warped into a game universe like I do when I turn on my Xbox.  the menus on the PS3 are bland and unexciting.  They are easy to use, but unexciting with their and 2D format. There is no \"wow\" factor there.Also, the PSN isn't anywhere near as socially friendly (that I can see) or interactive.  So, even though online gameplay is free it can be cumbersome.  There hasn't been an online game that I've tried on the PS3 yet that hasn't taken at least twice as long to log into the lobbies and the actual games themselves as the Xbox.The games seem to be glitchier on the PS3 than Xbox - e.x. Mass Effect 2:  I've played ME2 more times than I can recall off the top of my head on the Xbox and I decided to see if there were any differences between the Xbox version and the PS3 version.  I have noticed *some* differences.  For one, the PS3 version can get glitchy - almost as if you are playing online and you are starting to time out or your internet connection is dieing out.  The difficulty level on the PS3 also seems to be a bit more challenging (which is not necessarily a bad thing).To be honest, I haven't even enjoyed the games I have played on my PS3 enough to be motivated to finish them.Oh - and this is a big one for me - you can't just stick a game into your PS3 and start playing it. EVERY SINGLE GAME I have put into my PS3 has taken between 10 minutes and 4 hours to install game data onto your hard drive and then install that data onto your hard drive.  And then if there have been updates to the game since it was released, then there is another 5 or 10 minutes of downloading and then waiting before you can play your game.  With the Xbox, there are updates to the games, but I have never had to download and install game data directly from the game disc.  Unless there has been an update pushed out for that game, I've always just popped the game in and started playing...3 minutes or less every time.And, I won't really talk about the different controller too much because that is just a matter of opinion - I do prefer the Xbox controller because the PS3 controller gives me left thumb cramps.  But, that is probably just because I got accustomed to the Xbox controller first.  They do make Xbox-style controllers for the PS3 but the reviews I've read on those are very mixed.Bottom Line:  I bought myself a glorified BluRay player that has *potential* to be awesome, but has yet to \"wow\" me.The only reason I don't regret the purchase is because I am simply trying to decrease my overall long-term expenses with regard to gaming and free online play was one of a few things I am doing to do that.  Plus, I have a BluRay player.  If it wasn't for that financial fact or the the PS3's peripheral BluRay capability, I would not recommend this over an Xbox.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-09-2012"}

This is one of the finest piece of fighting game I've played on the N64.  It's even more cool how all of the best Nintendo trademark characters battle it out such as Samus,Mario,Link,Fox,DK, CAPTAIN FALCON AND MORE!  This game had some really impressive graphics on the N64 and once again shocked me at how incredible the graphics for N64 are.  The action is fast pace and never looses its touch and cause me to play hours and hours of none stop story mode AND just plain fighting it out with friends or bots.  The game is incredible and should be played by all Nintendo Fans.  I found this to be far superior then most fighting games But SSBM was better then this but hey this one is a classic!  It features some awesome Levels and great Handicapped matches.  It's cool how you can also set up any match you.  You can also try to beat time records in story mode so you can get New secret characters like Captain Falcon.  The game was very impressive and this is why I gave it the score it got.  Classic...Graphics...man the graphics are just amazing! Really great visuals almost all the games I review I give the visuals Good reviews but hey I can't help it?...ok!!!  Man the graphics for the characters are so cool.  I loved the character desighn for Samus especially.  Fox and Mario looked awesome too.  It ranks up with the other great N64 titles like Zelda.  This is truly not to be missed.Gameplay is fun filled fighting action.  None stop action and fast paces moves make this an action packed thrill ride of none stop ass kicking and you'll do even better if you get Kirby who is the best.  No matter how bad you think the game is you have to admit the gameplay is Action packed and is nothing but nonstop fun!  The gameplay in this game is just worth getting the game.  Ewww Samus never looked so good...blah!The sound is cutting edge punches, shooting and well...fighting..eheheh You can here Yoshi flying in the air from miles away and it is so detailed I think Nintendo Worked very hard on this Title.  The sound is above average, I know it's lame that I review sound but oh well who cares....Well Like I said the sound is above average and is very very very detailed.  Earns a star......well.......From Impressive Visuals to great nonstop action filled fun with some really great Nintendo characters like Samus and Mario to very detailed sound.  And lets not forget about the pretty intence story mode which you can beat time records to unlock hidden characters.  This game will take hours hell probably months till you get bored of this Title but I still play it once and awhile but over all with that said...this impressive title truly earns its..5 out of 5 stars....Like I said...very impressive game...Lates","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2004"}

The world is nothing like the world of the other Mario games, and the enemies and bosses and goal is different.  This is a quest to defeat Boss Wart (instead of Bowser) and you have the options of playing as one of four characters (with the ability to switch every level): Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad.  Each of these characters have different play characteristics.  Toad can pick up any object with no difficulty but is the worst jumper.  Princess is the opposite (no strength, but can float).  Luigi has the best jump (no float), but that becomes its own problem.  Mario is perfectly average.  These strengths and weaknesses come into play in choosing who to use for each level and some are clearly better than others on any given level. Even though I found this game to be the easiest of the bunch, for me it was also the most fun.  This is still a side-scrolling game, but some levels scroll up and down on the screen (keeping the side-scrolling viewpoint, though) depending on if you are climbing or dropping down.  There are shortcuts in many levels and different ways to warp, get extra lives (including an odd cheat for extra lives), or to shorten the game.  In the end, there are a couple of difficult levels, but this may be the easiest of the three on the NES.  Even so, this is my favorite of all of the Super Mario games on the NES.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"05-02-2003"}

{"product_name":"B000099T2E","description":"This sequel features an enhanced health damage system, an upgraded weapons system, all-new character design, and gladiator-style arena battles.","reviewerName":"S. Rhodes","summary":"One of Gamings Greatest Sequels","reviewText":"To put things simple, Ratchet and Clank Going Commando is the sequel I didn't know I wanted until I actually played it.  In my mind there wasn't much the second game needed to do to improve upon the first.  Simple steps were taken to make the experience more enjoyable and more refined.  Small additions made big changes and the package ends up being just about as good (if not better) than the original game.After the events of the first game, Ratchet and Clank became heroes across the galaxy.  A man named Mr. Fizzwidgit manages to get a hold of them in a far off galaxy, however, because he wants the heroes to get back his protopet that has been stolen.  Ratchet will have to undergo training in order to prepare for this mission.  The story is most certainly far better than the first one and presented a lot better as well.  You get the sense that there's actually something going on more so this time around.  Likewise, there are even a few twists and turns.  The story is more complete here with characters interacting a lot more.Much like the first game, Going Commando is set up in a rather linear fashion.  You'll go to other planets where you'll have two or three different paths you can go down, each leading to the objective of various \"missions,\" and all ending with easy ways to get back to your ship.  Because of the much tighter focus on story, however, there are quite a few more places that are more straightforward.  This doesn't mean there isn't much to explore, it simply means that you'll rarely find yourself lost at any given time.  There is plenty of stuff off the beaten path to explore.  You'll be able to collect and find Platinum Bolts or even other hidden gadgets and goodies.  Much like the first you can't really get too far ahead of yourself in any fashion.  You must always find coordinates to go to another galaxy.You'll spend a great deal of time traveling through various locales on foot.  Like before, Ratchet has a ton of weapons and gadgets at his disposal.  You'll begin with a standard Lancer gun and bombs but before you know it you'll also find weapons like the mini turrets that he can set out to blasts his opponents, seeker missiles, chopper stars and more.  If you've got data from the previous Ratchet and Clank then you can also buy those weapons for free.  However, the old additions are no where near as good as the newer ones.  Why bother the bomb glove, for instance, if the Gravity Bomb does the same thing and in a bigger radius?  Likewise, the new gadgets and weapons actually level up and morph into more powerful weapons with use.  The Lancer will eventually turn into the Heavy Lancer while the Gravity Bomb eventually morphs into the Mini-Nuke where it has more power and a bigger blast radius.  The goodies from the original game do not level up at all.There are also a few new gameplay additions and mechanics that make the game overall better.  The weapons leveling up was a nice touch, but other things add to the game as well.  Gun combat, for instance, is a lot simpler because the player now has the ability to strafe left and right and dodge by doing jumps and backflips while in this mode.  This alone makes a lot of the combat moments a lot easier than before.Another thing to mention is that most games when the sequel comes out the characters tend to lose all the abilities from the first game.  Megaman, for instance, never carried over his upgrades from one Mega Man X game to the next.  Ratchet and Clank changes that to a degree.  Many of Ratchets upgrades he got in the first game he either begins with or there's a simple explanation for why he does not have them.  His swing shot and grind boots, for instance, are in Clank's apartment and thus Clank has them.  When Ratchet meets up with Clank he gets his boots and swingshot back.  Likewise, Clank already has his Thruster Pack and Hydropack from the outset.  And yes, Ratchet kept his oxygen mask as well.  It seems like a strange thing to compliment, but I rather liked this as there was no need to find all these things again.  Thus what really happens is that Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando is more about building on the first one more so than anything.  In place are new gadgets for them to use such as the Dynamo which generally makes platforms appear (or move).  The magnetic boots are gone, however and replaced with the Gravity Boots so that he can now jump when stuck to a different surface.  The variety has been increased a lot.The variety has also been changed in other ways.  From time to time there are also now space missions that Ratchet and Clank embark on where they'll pilot their fighter and shoot down waves of fighters.  These levels can also be replayed and the player can attempt challenges as well.  There are overall more side missions than you'd expect as well and the rewards are sometimes worth it.  The biggest addition is the battle arena where you can fight gauntlets of enemies.  Sometimes there will be challenges such as going through a gauntlet only using one weapon.  Another has you trying not to take a single hit of damage.  The rewards is usually bolts, but you'll want that reward more than you know.  In addition to buying weapons, Ratchet can also upgrade his armor and these upgrades are not cheap by any means.  Luckily, you get more bolts than you did in the original game.Not every new addition or change is welcome, however.  In the original game you sometimes came across doors that made you solve a puzzle to get into various rooms.  Those are back here, but they aren't puzzles.  They're mostly mini games built upon the foundation of trial and error.  The Electrolyzer Puzzles, for instance don't really require more than just simply memorizing when you have to change the circuits and the Infiltrator puzzles are ALL about memorization.  They're more of a nuisance than anything that actually resembles fun.Going Commando is also a very challenging game.  Much more so than the first.  Your Nanotech level increases as you kill enemies leaving to have much more than four or five hit points like the first game, but enemies also do various amounts of damage.  What really strikes as odd, however, is that you rarely feel like you have enough ammo to take on the enormous waves of enemies that come your way.  In the final area of the game, for instance, I nearly ran out of ammo in EVERY weapon I had (and they were upgraded).  It seemed overly difficult but for the only reason being that the weapons you have just don't have enough ammo to deal with the hordes of enemies coming your way.  After getting over all those hurdles, however, Going Commando is actually a lot better than the first game because it offers so much more.For the most part Ratchet and Clank Going Commando looks pretty much like the first game.  That's fine by me as the first game is a graphical masterpiece.  There are a few more details in the environments and a lot of creative things, but on a visual level it doesn't look that much better than the first.  But this is fine because it's still a marvelous game and easy on the eyes.  The cartoony like visuals of most games tend to age better than the photorealistic ones.  There's a nice artsy design to this that makes it stand out.  The music, on the other hand, is better than ever.  Going Commando has a much better soundtrack than the first (which was already excellent to begin with) but the real show stopper is the voice acting.  It is better than the first game in every way.  It just sounds more fluid.  Again, the first game didn't actually have bad voice acting, but there's a lot more of it that feels natural here.  The jokes and gags are also quite hilarious making Going Commando just feel like a better package overall.Ratchet and Clank was a hard game to best but Going Commando manages to do so.  Even though it may seem a bit more unfairly difficult at times, it's still a lot of fun.  You never get the sense that it's an impossible game.  At the end of the day, it's just all around fun.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-19-2012"}

{"product_name":"B00DE2W4PK","description":"","reviewerName":"Niedducciano","summary":"I Love It","reviewText":"Okay, so the Playstation 4 (PS4) has been out for a few days, now and there has been some drama over its release. There have been some issues with it, but more or less I just want to give my personal experiences with and thoughts about it.Bottom line up front: I love it.There is no doubt that there are pros and cons to buying the PS4 system. First of all, I will address the more negative stuff just to get it out of the way.Cons (as they pertain to the system during the launch weekend):1) Headset integration: my biggest pet peeve with the system right now is that they did not make it compatible with current gaming headsets. People spend hundreds of dollars on just a single headset, sometimes, and for those to not be fully integrated on day one is a letdown. The only real solution(s) to that is:(a) Buy theTurtle Beach Ear Force PX4, which were designed with the PS4 in mind. (Be careful to read all of the instructions online with regard to how to set these up. If you're having trouble, here is a link that will step you through what the PS4 settings ought to be: [...] I bought these, and once I figured the settings out, I have really been enjoying them. The one down side to using these with the proper settings is that the sound that your system sends to the speaker on your controller won't be routed through your headset. If you do route those sounds to your headset, for some reason, I think it overloads the headset and it can't handle all of that information, so it only sends intermittent signals to the headset at that point until you fix the settings.(b) Use the included mono earbud (singular) with built-in microphone that plugs into the Dualshock 4(c) Use some Apple-like earbuds with a built-in microphone (like the ones that come standard, now) because those actually work - I tested it.-Playstation Plus (PS+) is now required for online multiplayer. This isn't as big of a deal, though, because for one, it's still cheaper than Xbox Live Gold subscriptions, and you can still do everything on your PS4 without PS+ except playing games online with other people. I'll address some of the perks of PS+ in the \"Pros\" section below, though.2) General bugs/kinks that need to be worked out: As I go about exploring and utilizing my new source of joy and adventure, I do notice bugs here or there. One example is the \"What's New\" tab when you first log on to the system. It is supposed to show you all of your recent activity on your machine - like if you've streamed your gameplay, or earned a trophy - but mine has only worked once. Besides that one time, I haven't seen anything on my \"What's New\" tab.3) Social Media: There is no Google+ integration. I really want to see that changed. I want to be able to have my PS4 post a status on my Google+ account just like it does to Twitter and Facebook whenever I earn a new trophy, live stream my game play, or upload a screen shot or video.Here's the deal: Sony has admitted that there have been a number of PS4 that arrived at their new loving homes dead on arrival. The internet has blown up with these complaints and concerns, and to be fair, for those affected, this is a huge concern and they need to know what to do in order to get it taken care of. Which, by the way, one really good resource is this web page: [...] but the issues have been blown out of proportion. Sony has released statements about it and they have isolated the batch of bad PS4 systems. It equates to 0.4% of the systems sold. For math nerds out there, there were 1,000,000 systems sold in the first 24 hours. 0.4% of 1 mil is about 4,000 machines. So, 4,000 machines out of 1,000,000 is a REALLY good track record.So, here's the good stuff, in my opinion.Pros (as they pertain to the system during the launch weekend):1) The system is physically beautiful: It's small, light weight, and simple.2) The Playstation (PS) user interface (UI) has definitely been improved and works wonderfully smooth. I love how easily you can transition between your game (or other app) and the home screen and back. I love how easily accessible everything is. It's intuitive, whereas the PS3 UI was not. Also, all of the system's settings can be found under one single menu heading. So, no more hunting around the UI for the setting menu you're looking for.3) DVD's look as crisp and clear coming out of the PS4 as BluRays do on the PS3. I don't know how this works. I'm not sure what mechanics are at play here, but we have watched a handful of both BluRay and DVD on the PS4 since it arrived last Friday (15 November), and the DVDs play as smooth, crisp, and clear as BluRays.4) PS+: With Sony's PS+ program, you get free junk. There are three or four games available right now on the PS Store for the PS4 that would cost non-PS+ members $15 or more, but they are free to download and use. One game in particular is actually free to everyone, it's called Warframe, but PS+ members get some expansion stuff for free. Also, PS+ is not required to watch media on your Amazon Prime app, or Netflix, Hulu, or whatever other streaming app you like.5) Social media and integration: I love how integrated the PS4 is with Twitter and Facebook.6) Along the lines of social media, there is live streaming: The Xbox One has a very very similar function as the PS4 in this regard, but the PS4 can live stream your game play onto Twitch or Ustream, and it is always recording while you're playing so that if you want to upload a video to Facebook or Twitter, it'll upload up to 15 minutes worth of game play. It also allows you to post screen shots onto your Facebook or Twitter account. You can also watch other gamers' streams directly from your PS4, if you want - AND, in the near future you will be able to go look at someone's live stream, and if you have the same game they do, you'll be able to just hop into their game with them. (They are going to have to push an update to the systems in order for this to work, but this is a function they've advertised for months now and have built the system in order to do this.)7) Sony's attitude towards gamers: This is huge. To be perfectly transparent and honest, this was my biggest deciding factor in buying the PS4. Sony has made it apparent since they announced the PS4 that they made this system with gamers in mind. The innovations they've made and the policies they have established cement this fact. Sony, plus the outpouring of ire on the internet, is the reason Microsoft had to backpedal on some of their policies for the Xbox One which alienated gamers a little in an attempt to lure non-gamers into the gaming console market. I can't emphasize this point enough. Even with the systems that were DOA at launch, Sony has been up front, responsive, and they haven't tried to hide or deny anything. They've admitted that some of their systems are faulty, and every new bug that is discovered, Sony is quickly behind that discovery with a response that they are working to fix it.8) Dualshock 4 controller: When looking at pictures, and comparing those pictures to the Dualshock 3 controller, it is hard to imagine that a new controller that is so similar in design to its predecessor could make an impression; but it did. The very first time I opened my PS4 box, and unwrapped the Dualshock 4, my brain started tingling with endorphins. It was unexpected. But, I think there were three main things (among a handful of things in total) that stood out to me:(a) The first was the material that the controller is made out of. It's smooth, yet it doesn't slip i your hands. It just has this...almost velvety feeling to it. So, I guess you might say that it feels soft, as well as smooth. It just feels good to hold.(b) The buttons and joysticks: the buttons and joysticks are so much more accurate, precise, and smooth. And the new L2 and R2 buttons (the triggers) feel great - and that's coming from a guy who has been converted from the Xbox consoles.(c) The touchpad: So far, my only experience with this is in Killzone Shadow Fall, and even though it was a simple and almost unimaginative use for the touchpad, it clearly works as intended, and it is sensitive and responsive (it is also a clickable/pushable button).When I started gaming on these new consoles, I was an Xbox guy (original Xbox). I stayed with Xbox for the Xbox 360, and it wasn't until I decided Xbox Live Gold wasn't worth the money that I decided to migrate (slowly...very slowly) over to the Playstation family. I only just bought a PS3 maybe 2 years ago. And, it took a lot of adjusting. The PS3 UI wasn't anywhere near as immersive and interesting as the Xbox UI. Games that I loved when I played them on my Xbox 360, I had a really hard time getting into on the PS3. But, now, I feel like I could never go back to Xbox - and mainly because they are losing their focus on gamers, and Sony has kept in touch with it's primary demographic.There is no doubt that the Xbox One has plenty of Pros and plenty of amazing content to offer its customers. But, for me, the choice was clear to gamble on the PS4 when I decided to pre-order a next gen system. And, now that it has launched, even with the hiccups, I am glad that I did. It is an amazing system, and it will only get better over time.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2013"}

The graphics are crisp and a bit angular due to the game's art style. The 3D is great visually: although it doesn't interact with the gameplay too much, it certainly enhances the game overall, especially when its used in cutscenes and scares. The gameplay is excellent.

You can then vacuum them up, and this time there is a small gauge that you can build up and use for an extra burst of power. Luigi visits five different areas throughout the game, not all of them mansions. For instance, there is a abandoned clock factory built out in the desert and a mining project built on a snowy mountain. Each \"mansion\" is divided up into several missions, similar to Super Mario 64 or Super Mario Sunshine. For each mission there is a boo to catch, which is optional, and in each mansion there is a set of jewels that are hidden in nooks and crannies. If you collect them all, you get a Luigi statue. The plot is good, not outstanding, but it builds up over the course of the game. The characters have more personality, especially the generic ghosts, who you can see pranking each other and goofing around. This game is decidedly less scary than the original.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"04-03-2013"}

McKinney","summary":"Best 3DS game so far","reviewText":"Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon is an exceptional game with tight controls and varied gameplay that will keep you engaged for hours. It plays similarly to the original Luigi's Mansion, but the gameplay seems a bit more varied this time. The game's difficulty level is just right--not so easy that it's boring, but not so difficult that it leaves you frustrated. Just two minor complaints. The first is that you cannot save within a mission. Some of these missions are rather complex, so you will be stuck to you 3DS for an extended period just to reach a save point. This isn't a game you can pick up and play for a few minutes at a time. The other complaint deals with the 3D effect. It is difficult keeping the 3D effect in focus just holding it still. Once you begin playing, it's nearly impossible. I just turn off the 3D, which will be more of a hindrance than help while your chasing around ghosts. Such a shame, because the 3D effect looks great, but this game seems harder to keep in focus than any 3DS game I've played. Overall, this is a great game that you'll thoroughly enjoy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-29-2013"}

{"product_name":"B00CMQTVK0","description":"","reviewerName":"Bradley Corwin","summary":"The Next Xbox is Here","reviewText":"I received my Xbox One on launch day and set it all up and have been using it since.  I am an avid gamer and also have the PS4 and Wii U so feel free to ask questions.The box: The first thing that you will notice is that the Xbox One is the size of a DVD player.  It is quite a bit larger but I just throw it under my TV so this doesn't bother me that much.  You touch the Xbox logo to turn it on.  The box is a mix of matte black and shiny black.  I wish it was all matte black.  The console is very quiet.  I have a hard time hearing it when it does anything.Interface:  When you start up your new Xbox it takes a minute to get everything going but after that it's pretty fast.  The setup is relatively easy and I downloaded the Day One update quickly without problems.  I have a hard time finding what I'm looking for in the menus or the marketplace.  It's not horrible but I hope it will get improved.  Snapping is an amazing addition and works well.  You can now scan codes with a QR code instead of typing in a long list of characters!  You can bounce between the home screen and your games or apps very quickly.  The transitions are smooth.Kinect: This Kinect has improved over the last one in most ways.  There are more voice commands and they work as long as you know the structure you are supposed to say them in.  This is annoying at first but once you learn them it's easy.  I find myself repeating commands a few times here or there.  The facial recognition works well in rooms that are well lit.  It knows when my roommate comes in and it will sign him into his account also.  My only complaint is it doesn't seem to have a motor to tilt itself like the previous one did.  If I put it above the TV, it seems too high; if I put it below the TV, it seems too low.Controller: The new controller improves upon the 360 ones.  It is different at first but feels great in your hands.  The new impulse triggers give a new interesting feel while playing games.  Moving the battery back to give your fingers more room is also appreciated.  The Xbox button on the controller feels really weird.  It feels like it gets stuck when you press it down.Headset: The included headset isn't anything amazing but it does the job for a free headset and I like the controls.Games:  I did not purchase any games on the Xbox One.  I had gotten most of them on the PS4 and the rest did not interest me.  I am looking forward to games like Titanfall, Quantum Break and Kinect Sports.  I downloaded the Kinect Sports Rivals Preseason and there is a wave racing game that is really fun.  My roommate and I played it and it would track things all the way down to your hand movements.  With the Kinect included it allows developers to count on having it and know they are not wasting their time if they add cool features.Xbox Fitness: This was one of the features I was really looking forward too and I am impressed.  I usually go to the gym once a week but it's harder to stay motivated the colder it gets.  The Xbox Fitness program steps in great.  They have a ton of free workouts and paid workouts from people you can recognize.  I've done some of the 5 minute workouts and they Kinect can track your movements and see if you are following it.  I see this as a great feature.Media Apps:  You will find all of your usual media center apps here.  The newest one is the Blu-Ray app, I have watched a few disc based movies without any problems and could control the playback with my voice through the Kinect.-Conclusion-Awesome- I can walk into the living room, say \"Xbox On\" and my TV and sound system come on and I am signed in- Snapping apps allows for great multitasking- Xbox fitness- Kinect integrationNot-so-awesome- Most of the Xbox One games have a lower resolution than the PS4- I assumed there would be a Day One branding on the console itself, not just the controller- Game selection is thin- Some voice commands have a crazy structure you have to follow word for word- The Kinect doesn't come with a stand for the top of your TV, that will cost you $20 extraI don't think this is a must buy yet but you won't be disappointed either.  To me right now the Xbox seems more like a decked out media center.  As with all new systems, they will get better over time especially with more games.  I can't wait to see what lies ahead.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-27-2013"}

Even ten years later, some of the special effects are remarkable, even stunning, such as when you run through water.2.  The game camera is super-smooth.  Should have become the industry standard.3.  The fact that the programmers foresightfully included the ability to replace your character with a fully caparisoned character from a previous game really extends the replay value.  Although I do have to say:  what was the point of including this ability, yet preventing you from returning to the shopkeeper's after the Onyx Tower?  If you have two memory slots available, you can effectively return your character to town to sell all the juicy stuff you find in the Onyx Tower and thereafter, although it's a bit of a hassle.THE BAD:1.  The game is not kind to you if you want to play as an archer.2.  Plot really cliched:  something's been stirring up the orcs!  Their attacks have grown bolder!3.  That part where you're fighting the lizard men just goes on for way too long.4.  A \"hard\" level of difficulty is available, but it's not like they follow you or lie in wait for you more cleverly.  So the upshot of choosing \"hard\" difficulty is simply that you'll have to go back to town more often for healing potions.

Those new to Nintendo's enormously popularZeldaseries will be glad to know this game stands completely on its own. Our hero, Link, starts the game as a young boy living in a magical forest village populated by elf-like children. But there is evil lurking in the world. Strange monsters are appearing, and the land is changing. It's up to Link to discover why, defeat the monsters, and stop the evil at its source.The game world's ever-changing environment looks like a fairy tale come to life. Majestic waterfalls, towering castles, and magical forests are a feast for the eyes and ears. Rivers flow, rain falls, the sun and moon rise and set. There's even an erupting volcano! Exploring this world is half the fun of the game. Along the way, you learn musical tunes that you can play on the flute-like Ocarina, a magical device that helps you teleport, alter the weather, even control time itself.Character interaction is important to gather clues. The fairy princesses, singing frogs, and dragons you'll meet can be cute, humorous, or somewhat terrifying. Sprinkled liberally throughout the game are hundreds of secret treasures and enjoyable minigames (one of which, the fishing game, would almost be worth buying by itself). Game controls are easy to learn. There's even an elaborate fight training course built right into the game. Controlling the hero quickly becomes instinctive, and you can concentrate on saving the world. To win the game, you'll have to use not only Link's sword, but your mind as well. This game's challenging and inventive puzzles really make you think. In fact, to keep from getting stuck, it's worth spending a few bucks on anofficial player's guide.

Using the cloud to control AI didn't make the AI any noticeably better, and focusing solely on multiplayer didn't help improve anything about the multiplayer experience compared to the huge variety of excellent FPS games already on the market, many of which have offline play options.Here's the main issue right out of the gate: the multiplayer experience offered by Titanfall has not improved over 2004's Halo 2 and most other top tier FPS games that have come out in the past 10 years. Honestly, hook up Halo 2 to an online LAN server via widely available software, and you can play it online to this day. Hook it up to another Xbox and you can do local matches without an internet connection. Alternatively, you could play single player. Without system link, LAN, or single player, Titanfall gives the player less. It's likely that Titanfall will never function properly without an internet connection, and the day the servers are shut off, the game won't be playable. In 2004, if your internet was terrible or lost service, you had options to play your games offline fully featured in every single game mode. In 2014: no internet, no game. We've seen this before from EA. Sim City was plagued by the same issue, and the justification was similar: they said they needed the online connection to control the citizen AI. That turned out to be a lie. They didn't need that at all. The online-only was done simply to combat piracy. Even so, the pirates cracked the game and were enjoying it offline. It was the paying customers who suffered. Titanfall is no different. You get the same basic game you got back in 2004, which is a good game, but you get no single player, you get no offline options, and you get nothing drastically new.Titanfall features huge robots called titans which you call down to fight alongside you or to pilot manually. Having a titan fight by your side seems cool, but I've seen my titan stand there shooting the ground and other ridiculous things. When all is said and done, titans are nothing more than a glorified vehicle, no better than piloting a vehicle in any other FPS game. They aren't exciting and new. They're vehicles which can follow you around if you want. Imagine if your vehicle in Halo followed you around and shot at people while you weren't riding it: that's basically what it comes down to. It's not innovative enough to simply have titans in the game and just make everything else the same as usual. A deathmatch in Titanfall is still a deathmatch. A capture point game is still a capture point game. I mean, heck, every player gets a titan in every match, usually twice. In other FPS games at least you could fight for control of the various vehicles in a level. In Titanfall the only way to gain any advantage over anyone else is to try to lower the time you are waiting until the titan is ready by playing better than the other people, but getting your titan 15 seconds earlier isn't nearly as useful as simply stealing the level's only vehicle spawn in a different FPS game.On that note, Titanfall really fails to give the skilled players much to set themselves apart in general. Not only do all players get the chance to have a titan on every level regardless of how they play, but there is an auto-aim homing bullet gun which does 1-2 hit kills, and its only drawback is that it takes a slightly longer time to fire it. This means that some guy aiming in your general vicinity might be able to kill you in a couple seconds without any sort of skill. The idea behind this is to level the playing field to make the game less daunting for people who stink at FPS games, but it's really counter to the spirit of playing one of these games. You'r supposed to have to aim and shoot at your opponent. Giving people the option to be lazy may cater to the new players, but it's not making the game a better game.Along the same lines, the game will let people contribute to the team score by killing AI bots who run around the levels, and spawn in large numbers in various sections of the map. You'd think the AI would still be a fair challenge to kill, like fighting grunts and elites in Halo or something, but it's not like that at all. The AI bots are idiots who barely do more than stand there while you kill them. Farming the AI is exactly that: farming. It's not challenging or engaging in any way. Without any effort, I could mow down 5 of them at a time.One neat thing is that Titanfall lets you run at high speeds at all times, and you can run along walls or jump from wall to wall. It's a fun mechanic, and it's simple to do, but it's hardly worth buying the game for. Limitations in mobility in other FPS games don't make those games any less strategic or fun. Sonic the Hedgehog runs faster than Mario and can run upside-down. Is Sonic more fun to play than Mario? It's just a different game with its own rules. There's nothing wrong with Titanfall's mechanics, but it's not worth buying the game for.Along with these thoughts, I'm also rolling my eyes at the slow pace the developers have taken with making the game look next-gen. A bunch of cool effects don't change the fact that the game is launching at 792p, when most people expect next gen to run at 1080p. I can understand that launch titles weren't running at full specs due to time constraints and developers learning to use the new hardware, and the 60 frames per second is nice, but you're looking at a game which is supposed to really sell you on the next gen experience. Lighting effects are nice, but people want 1080p 60 frames per second before they want all the cool effects. It's sad to see the XB1's early system seller failing to at least meet that standard on time for launch.All that being said, Titanfall is a game I could recommend to someone really itching for a online first person shooter, but for anyone else, stay away. If you're a casual gamer looking for a game to play on your new XB1, go for Dead Rising 3 or something with the ability to play by yourself without the internet. In 10 years, when the Titanfall servers are shut down, and you want to revisit your old XB1, you'll be a lot happier if you stick with games that don't require an internet connection. Don't get me wrong, online games have their place, but it takes a lot more to justify them than Titanfall offers.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"03-15-2014"}

{"product_name":"B00004SVV9","reviewerName":"B. E Jackson","summary":"bad game","reviewText":"\"Dear God, please let this horrible game be a figment of my imagination\"Nope, it's real.  What an unbelievable piece of overrated garbage Super Mario Bros. 3 is.  For the life of me I don't get the appeal of this game.  Through each of the eight boring worlds it's just the same thing every time: run to the end of each and every extremely short, uncreative level collecting worthless crap so you can move on to the next short, uncreative level.  Super Mario Bros. 3 is complete baboon poop.  It really is.  Nothing good about this game at all.  No reason for Mario or video game fans to remember this crappy adventure.  No reason for this game to exist.  Thank God there are sensible people out there such as myself to give you the honest truth.Let's get right to the point and talk about all the stinky things:One, and this is the biggest reason Super Mario Bros. 3 isn't any good.  You can only play as Mario and Luigi.  In Super Mario Bros. 2 you can play as the Princess and Toad in addition to Mario and Luigi.  Not so here.  In this game, Mario and Luigi don't even have anything unique to separate the two, so they are basically the same exact person (except Mario is red and Luigi is green).  Remember how high Luigi can jump in Super Mario Bros. 2?  Well now he jumps just like Mario.  Absolutely no reason for this.  If anything, Luigi should have MANY more interesting things about him this time around since, after all, Super Mario Bros. 3 comes AFTER Super Mario Bros. 2 and you'd think the most logical thing would be to continue adding MORE things with each new series.  But in this case, you get less.  I guess Nintendo FORGOT to make Luigi stand apart from Mario.Another problem: this game is so freakin' predictable.  Gee, after the desert world I go to... a water world?  You don't say!  What?  There's an ICE world and a plant world coming up?  No way!  And what's THIS I see?  The final world will be BIG DARK EVIL FIRE WORLD?  I didn't see THAT coming.  Thanks Nintendo, for making Mario fans look like complete idiots.  Way to go.Other serious problems become noticeable after a couple hours of playtime such as the fact that you have to do so much boring jumping in this game.  You have to jump on top of (or over) SO many things that it becomes an absolute chore after world 3 (if you even MAKE it that far without shutting off the game, that is).  If you find anything exciting about jumping over pipes or jumping on top of goombas or picking up and kicking buzzy beetles, then I recommend seeking professional help.Ok, what else makes Super Mario Bros. 3 suck so much?  It can't get any worse, right?  Yes it can.  After you beat the game a message comes up on the screen that says \"Thank you, but our princess is in another castle.  Just kidding, hahaha\".  You mean to tell me, after all that long, hard and tedious work making it to the very end, Nintendo is going to joke around and make like the adventure isn't over yet?  Before the \"just kidding\" part, you might very well rip apart your controller or punch a hole in your TV screen all because Nintendo wants to play around and pretend there's still more to the adventure.  I can't even think of appropriate words to describe how angry this makes me.  Tears of anger are almost dripping down my face.  Nintendo NEVER should have done that.  I bet that most people who first seen that message really thought the princess was in another castle and came THIS close to killing the nearest living thing next to them.  Bad Nintendo.And guess what?  You have to face one of Bowser's kids at the end of every world.  I'm not kidding.  I was honestly expecting to fight Bowser's WIFE before fighting him, but it never happened.  That's probably for the better.  Who knows how horrific she looks.I'm still trying to figure out what everyone sees in this game.  It's old and forgettable.  Honestly, I think nowadays the only people who enjoy Super Mario Bros. 3 are older folks whose children have moved away to college or to start a family, and they left behind their NES and Super Mario Bros. 3 cartridge so their parents had something to do.  All these older folks miraculously happen to enjoy the game so now EVERYONE acts like it's the best game of all-time.  Well it's not.","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"06-27-2006"}

Includes LED charge indicators, a rubberized finish and a 110/240 volt AC adapter that features 2 amps of power that allows you to charge all of your devices simultaneously.","reviewerName":"Stacy \"Amazon Junkie\"","summary":"Charge Me Up, Scotty!","reviewText":"Being a PS3 owner for a few years now, I managed to accumulate several controllers. While I have one of the first versions of the PS3 (with has four [4] USB ports) and a USB hub generally works, thus allowing multiple devices to charge at once, the hassle of needing to leave your system on in order to charge controllers is annoying, at best. It is downright cumbersome and its worst.A few years ago I purchased a Quad Dock for the Six-Axis controllers only. I was impressed with the quality of the item as well as the price; as always something similar directly from Sony was neither available nor priced reasonably. The Quad Dock worked great up until I lost the AC adapter.Since that first docking station, I got a Playstation Move controller. Having two cats (one being a kitten), using the USB wires to charge the devices acted as a magnet for cat abuse. In addition having wires everywhere was chaotic and cluttered. I yearned for a solution to this problem.Finally I went to Amazon and hunted for a new charging dock, remembering the original dreamGEAR Quad Dock from a few years ago. To my delight there was this model, the PS3 Move Quad Dock Pro. It fits the bill perfectly.ConstructionThe Move Quad Dock Pro (henceforth notated as MQDP) is made of a moderately-weighted, rectangular base unit (plastic) and includes an AC adapter. The adapter has a jack which plugs into the rear of the base. When the adapter is plugged in and the unit has power (there is no power button; it is functional with simply an electrical outlet) a blue light emanates from the base of the unit. As a comparison, it looks like the underbody blue fog lights that people sometimes add to their vehicles.There are four (4) charging slots and two (2) extra USB ports, resulting in six available charging options. The MQDP is designed for up to two (2) Six Axis controllers, one Move Navigation Controller, and one Move Motion Controller. Do to the circumference differences with the Move and Navigation controllers, the circular charging docks are not interchangeable.The dock is designed so the Six Axis controllers sit upside-down when plugged into a charging cradle. The Move \"wands\" stand upright. The spare USB ports are available on the back of the unit; I have used them to charge my cell phone and a third Move Motion controller.Overall, the construction is durable and looks nice. Being able to charge up to six devices simultaneously is convenient.UseAs mentioned above, the MQDP is a durable unit that is powered by an AC adapter. The immediate perk to this is not having to leave your PS3 on in \"stand-by\" (when the power light is red but the unit is not actually using software nor loading a game/movie). This also eliminates having USB hubs and charging cords all over the place, cluttering up the area.Using the device is simple; with the Six Axis controllers simply turn them upside down and plug the male USB receiver into the female USB port on the controller. This unit accepts both the original Six Axis and the newer Six Axis/DualShock controllers. Two can be charged at the same time. The last two cradling docks on the MQDP fit the Move Navigation and the Move Motion Controllers, respectively. The male USB receiver plugs into the base female USB port on the controllers. This results in the Navigation and Motion wands standing upright. The only \"difficulty\" with docking the units is that it can be a little tricky lining up the base with the controller(s). After the first few times it will become second-nature.Regardless of which of the first four ports that you use, each docking port is rimmed by the same light as the base of the unit. If the item is charging the light is red; once it is fully charged the light changes to blue. This is very convenient; otherwise the only way to know if your controller is fully charged is by turning on the PS3 to check the battery life. The lights on the MQDP are bright; in a darkened room they can almost serve as a nightlight.Note: there is no light for the two (2) extra USB ports on the rear of the device. With these, you will need to either pop a controller onto the main docks and/or check your device to see the charge level(s).Finally, MQDP is a great way to store your controllers. The unit will not \"overcharge\" your devices; in addition it looks rather snazzy and sits nicely next to your PS3.OverallThis is a must-have unit for your PS3. The freedom of not having to keep your PS3 turned on nor having wires exposed is great. The lighting signals to alert you to whether or not the controllers are charged is nifty, as well. At $20 (or thereabouts), you really cannot go wrong with this purchase.The only real complaint that I have is you can only charge one set of motion controllers, that is, one Move Motion and one Move Navigation wand. While you can use the spare USB ports on the back to charge two more, it kid of defeats the purpose of the unit by having more wires dangling from the base to charge your controller(s). That being said, if you own more than one set of motion controllers, dreamGEAR does sell a dock specifically designed to charge two sets.All-in-all, I am very happy with this purchase. It is well-made and looks great next to my PS3. Having my controllers charged and waiting for me without having ugly wires cluttering my shelf is wonderful. The PS3 Move Quad Dock Pro is, quite simply, a must-have for any Playstation aficianado with more than one controller.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"09-16-2012"}

This is the game that initiated me to PS3. Its graphics, excelsior(latin for \"higher\") story, controls, and environment are all top-of-the-line.

My quick and dirty take on it is this:  GET IT & PLAY IT...You won't be sorry!I didn't really know anything about Bioshock before sitting down to play it...But once you complete the game, you'll know the entire story behind it.  This is shared through a variety of sources of info during the game.  Starting at Ground Zero means you're going to quickly find yourself transported to an absolutely WEIRD and DISTURBING \"Paradise\" that requires you to simultaneously make value judgments while murdering pretty much everyone who crosses your path...The end result is a whole lot of FUN & GUN gameplay, made even better by supplementing std shooter weapons with a quite diverse and inventive variety of weaponry that will often give you a quilty pleasure when you see what they do to your enemies...The Plasmids are just plain out WICKED and you'll certainly be glad you're the one using them instead of your enemies.  Torch 'em...Freeze & blast 'em...Or just send a killer swarm of bees on them and watch as they helplessly flail away while screaming their last breaths of life.  Like I said, just WICKED.  Becoming invisible adds so much to the gameplay that you'll probably use it for the entire rest of the game once you acquire the ability.Rapture is just overflowing with some pretty messed up characters.  It would've made more sense to me if it was set in the future instead of the 40's, since everyone knows the technology required to build an underwater city this diverse and complex didn't exist back then...But since it's a video game so you just kind of accept it and enjoy the experience.I've played through both Bioshock and F.E.A.R. and from what I read, I expected F.E.A.R. to be edge of your seat \"scary\".  It wasn't.  In fact, Bioshock will have you on the edge of your seat so often, you may fall off a time or two.  But Bioshock is also disturbing on a psychological level.  It's always a DARK environment, like F.E.A.R., but the surprises waiting around the next corner are much more mental and sinister in Bioshock.  The Splicers are absolutely INSANE individuals and Big Daddies will pretty much pursue you until one of you dies.  As for the people now running what's left of Rapture, well the old saying about \"the inmates running the asylum\" couldn't be more appropriate...Prepare yourself for some immersive gaming and this is one game you won't be finishing in just 10 or so hours...There is much to explore in Rapture once you start and you'll probably devote every free minute to this highly addictive game.  Just don't be surprised if you wake up in the middle of the night and think you see a Spider Splicer heading towards you on your ceiling...","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-03-2009"}

As these survivors' allies mysteriously fall victim to dementia, it becomes clear that protecting a young girl granting them a bizarre immunity may be their only hope for survival in a struggle that could have implications for all of humanity.GameplayAlthough designed to preserve the feel of the action of the original game, gameplay inExtractionis also quite unique. First, the player perspective has been changed from third, to first-person, placing all the action right in front of you. Also,Extractionis a 'rail shooter,' meaning a shooter game where most of the action engaged in and paths followed are programmed into the mission play, instead of the freeform wandering ability built into the considerably larger Next-Gen and PCDead Spacerelease. The combination of these two changes funnels the players focus onto the combat options available in the game. In dealing with the danger of the alien Necromorphs swarming the game space,Dead Space Extractionutilizes the precision of the Wii Remote in variety of ways. Weapons like the Plasma Cutter can dispatch these enemies from a distance by taking advantage of the remote's pointing targeting ability, while a quick wave can activate weapons like the Ripper, a guidable spinning saw blade. The Wii Remote is also handy for picking up items and hurling them at enemies using the power of Kinesis.Other gameplay changes include new play modes. The most notable of these is the inclusion of a two player co-op play option. This allows an additional player to drop in or out of the action as he/she chooses. The game rebalances the opposition in these cases to make sure that the gameplay doesn't become too easy. In addition,Extractionalso features a Challenge mode in which after certain sections of the game are cleared, areas within those sections are unlocked for bonus arcade style action where players build up points linked to how many Necromorphs are destroyed. Taken together all these changes add up to more action, more fun and moreDead Spacefor players on the Wii.Key Game FeaturesAn All-New Prequel Exclusively for the WiiFollow the lives of several different Aegis VII colony members as they carve a bloody path to survival.Meet a new cast of characters, destroy fearsome new enemies, and wield brutal new weapons.Real TerrorStunning graphics, panic-inducing audio, and a frenetic first-person perspective thrust you headlong into the terror.Play through an engrossing, interactive horror movie experience that raises the bar for storytelling in video games.Intuitive ControlsStrategically dismember your enemies with pinpoint control using the Wii Remote.Wield a powerful arsenal of abilities and weapons to freeze enemies, manipulate gravity with telekinesis, solve puzzles, and fight off attacks from every direction in zero gravity.Co-Op GameplayTeam up with a friend to fight off the invasion on the USG Ishimura with jump-in cooperative play.Combine efforts on engineering puzzles or determine specific roles to create a unique experience with each play session.","reviewerName":"Jean Duque","summary":"You gotta give it a try","reviewText":"The first time i played this game I said: \"On-rails game oh men...\" and I turned off my wii, but after a couple of months I give it a try and let me tell you this game is awesome, great storyline and graphics.

Somebody turned me off to this game, so I waited until it got cheaper.  Surprisingly, this is the one launch title that actually LOOKS next gen.  The textures are far better than anything on current gen consoles and most all of the environments are gorgeous.  Others have already touched on the nature of the gameplay.  I'll simply add that the puzzle encountered through the game are of just enough difficulty that you have to think a bit but not have to consult any outside sources.  The game is a tad short- it should take about 10 hours to beat.  However, those 10 hours are quality gameplay.  I'll also mention the single best aspect of the game: the soundtrack.  The score in this game is the third best game soundtrack I've ever heard (following Primal and Shadow of the Colossus).Really, I just wanted to add my voice to the many here who gave Kameo a shot and realize that game is lot more fun than many others gave it credit for being.

For the most part the games are not bad however each title that they release is truley nothing spectacular.  However for fans this title will not disapoint.The focus on Boudoki is on the combat.  Set in 3D type world the game takes off with some decent results.  There are multiple modes to work with to include story mode, World MArtial Arts Tournament, Duel, and Practice.  Each one is a little unique in it's own way but the fighting stays the same.  Lets discuss each one individually.Story Mode basically tells the tale of DBZ up to the Cell Saga (what not enough time to fit Majin Buu).  The first time through you fight as Goku primarily.  The only other warrior you can control is GOhan at later moments.  However once beaten you unlock more chapters in story mode involving other characters.  Eventually by doing so you unlock more guys for other modes. Teh only other upside is the ability to collect capsuls to customize your own character.Duel is just as it states, a VS mode.  The battles are only one on one and it can be 1P vs CP, 1P vs 2P, or CP vs CP.World Martial Arts Tournament is a little more unique in the way it is set up.  You pick your guy and and difficulty level (the other two must be unlocked) and then compete to earn money.  The ways to win this is to knock out your foe, or knock them out of the ring.  If you win you earn money to be used at Mr. Popo's house.PRactice:  If I have to explain this than you must be at least 2 years old.There are two other customary options, but nothing spectacular.  You have Mr. Popo house which enables you to purchase capsuls to customize your own guy (for Duel, Practice, and WMAT) and than customize enables you to do that.  It is nothign spectacular.Overall this game is fun for a fighting game, but with shallow combat and difficult to pull off special moves this game is more for Die Hard DBZ fans (which is why I gave it 4 stars).  If I was not a DBZ fan than in all honestly I would of given it 3 or less when you compare it to other games such as Virtua Fighter 4, Tekken 4, and Mortal Kombat Deadly Alliance.

When your benchmark is the game for which all in the genre will be judged, it is tough to top that kind of success.  The formula worked so well in GTA III that what else could Rockstar do but expand on the original??In fact, VC is more of the same, but on a much grander scale with more to destroy, shoot, drive, jump over, break through, steal, etc... What really sets VC apart from III is the soundtrack.  Rockstar literally plucked some of the best obscure and well know tunes from the 80's vs. a bunch of unknown songs (some of which were downright awful in III.)

Know how disappointing and almost crushing it is to lose all that progress? If the memory still stings, then Demon's Souls is going to become your new archnemesis. When people say a game is challenging, it's usually just that they die too many times or they never really understood how to \"play\" the game. Demon's Souls on the other hand is never cheap or unfair but it is punishing. It's a perfect description because this game in a sense doesn't tolerate errors or \"oops\" moments, it takes advantage of them and more often than not your deaths will come from those moments where you decided to be a little foolhardy. There's a couple of things that seemingly make it more difficult just for the sake of it but all in all this is the kind of game that if you're in the right mood, the game will enter your mind and sort of linger; thinking about playing, thinking about what you want to accomplish next time you play. Sure you'll swear but you'll probably love every moment of it too, you masochist.Story: The story takes place in the kingdom of Boletaria as the old King Allant the XII ended up unleashing the Old One, a powerful beast which covered the land in a thick fog which brought with it terrifying demons who crave souls. Many have tried to defeat these demons but none of ever managed to be successful. The game starts appropriately enough with your death (get used to it) who is sent to the Nexus, where you can enter portals to various lands around the kingdom and hopefully bring down the demons one at a time.Graphics: Games such as Metroid Prime or a lot of horror games succeed in drawing players into the game thanks to the atmosphere of the game and Demon's Souls is no different. When a dragon swoops down and spouts flames onto the walkway you've just outrun, it's very easy to feel that your in this place. They also are nicely varied as well from a simple castle fortress to a mine and a creepy-as-hell prison. In-game graphics are generally simple with some nice physics effects on things that can be destroyed/blown up and some bosses are just massive and very intimitading. However while NPC models look good, it suffers from the problem of most games with a character creator which is it's very hard to make someone look like they're not a troll.Sound/Music: The music is appropriately creepy at times and almost melancholy. The soundtrack cd that came with pre-orders is a nice listen if you're into music that's not uplifting and high-spirited. Voice acting is generally good though you might not like its...flatness if you will where the actors just don't sound so excited but then again there's no bad line readings from what I've seen or anything where you let out a chuckle but would've been nice for actors to put a little oomph. Sound effects are generally alright and that \"whoosh\" that comes with a successful parry attack called a riposte is flat-out awesome.Gameplay: It's hard to describe Demon's Souls since it feels like something you've played before yet you couldn't think of it if you tried. Essentially imagine the 3rd person swordplay of Oblivion, world traversing of Zelda and RPG elements of pretty much every one you've tried in the past 10 years. You have your lock-on, attack with R1, strong attack with R2, block with L1 and parry with L2. Do a successful parry and R1 and your character will do a badass attack that'll practically kill your enemy in one hit but the timing is incredibly tricky but it's oh-so-satisfying when you pull it off. You also have magic and spells as well as bows and crossbows which feel a bit strange to use since crossbows have no aiming feature like the bow and switching from bow to sword felt strangely cumbersome to me. And you're going to need to learn how to fight because these enemies are not necessarily smart AI-wise but in groups and particularly if you're not careful they can pack a mean punch. Death in this game means that you have to make it back to way you died and activate your \"bloodstain\" where you'll regain all the souls (your currency, EXP to level up) you've accumulated. The brutal thing is that if you died trying to get back to your body, your souls are forever lost and practically negating all the hardwork you did. Yeah, this game wants to make you yell, it seems.Worse is that the game actually gets more difficult the more you die thanks to the concept of White and Black World Tendency which can alter who shows up in what world and what weapons now where it feels backwards to me is that sometimes the best stuff to get is actually in Black Tendency worlds so having the game purposefully get more difficult only to net you some good gear/trophies is odd. In addition, some may not like the idea of no save points or checkpoints and you can't pause in-game either so if you need to answer the phone you need to find a safe hiding place where you know enemies won't come. The nice thing is that enemies don't respawn (they do if you die or re-enter the world though) and other enemies won't come looking for you until they see you. Make no mistake, you need to be absolutely patient with this game because the more time you put into it, the better you'll get and the more satisfaction will come when you finally kill that annoying boss. Downside of course is that there's no place to \"stockpile\" your souls in that you pretty much have to spend or luck out and don't lose any souls since you can't deposit them anywhere save for your level gaining (stat based, not level based) or buying stuff so it's almost encouraged you keep as much as you can till you can spend all of them. No need to be penny-pinching.The most unique aspect of this is the multiplayer which isn't multiplayer per se but more like MMO's without the MMO. Basically practically everyone is in the same level as you and you can even catch glimpses of them via white ghost representations. They can leave messages on the ground to warn you about a valuable goodie ahead or a trap/ambush and even clues as to how to best a boss or enemy. One negative I have of this is that you can't actually spell what you want (obviously to dissuade people using swear words and racial slurs) but say you want to warn people about the dragons in 1-2 and to run to the other tower AFTER they've swooped down and already scorched the walkway. You can't, all you can really say is \"Run right through\" or variations thereof. Bloodstains are also on the ground which'll replay that player's death so if there's a trap ahead and you're not sure how to avoid it, touching the stain will allow you to see how they died and how best to avoid it. In addition, people can come into your world for co-op in case a boss is really laying a beating on you and people can actually invade your world in hopes of killing you and gaining their body back (you can alternate between Body Form and Soul Form). It's certainly unique and I can honestly say I've never seen this before so people, you know those \"Please recommend this\" messages? Please do as you get full health wherever you are and you never know when some player needs a big health boost. Think of it this way, we're all here to beat the thing called Demon's Souls together, not individually...if that makes sense.I got the Deluxe edition though the review is for the regular version since most people probably didn't buy it or preorder but as far as goodies you get a nice embossed cover and an official guide from Atlus with tips, walkthroughs, bestiaries, item and equipment stats and boss strategies. While for some people it might be seen as spoiling the fun but with a game like Demon's Souls, everything as far as help is concerned should be welcomed. Also there was an artbook and a soundtrack cd that came with which is quite nice though it was more character art than concept art a la Prince of Persia, Fallout 3 or Resistance 2's artbooks but oh well.Is this game for everyone? Definately not. The difficulty will be the key factor in determing whether this game is right for you but unlike most difficult games like Ninja Gaiden where the difficulty comes from balanced to completely unfair, Demon's Souls is just a wild beast that'll take awhile to tame. A long while.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"10-10-2009"}

{"product_name":"B001CWXAP2","description":"","reviewerName":"Amazon Customer","summary":"Knights of the Old Republic with Friends.","reviewText":"If you liked Knights of the Old Republic - just stop reading these reviews and order this game. Even if you were never all that into MMOs, this game will at the very least give you at least 400 hours of play time as you play through the story lines for every character type and do nothing else.Questing - Every MMO since the day of UO has struggled with how to make the player feel important and have an impact on the world with thousands of players sharing that same world. SWTOR pulls it off by having instanced parts of the world that only you and your companion are able to enter, these instances may be a whole dungeon or just a room, but the events there are specific to your storyline which does have branches. Your decisions have lasting impacts, you will get mail from NPCs with credits or just follow ups on the fallout from your actions. The final outcome of your particular story line will also depend on the decisions you have made - and no, it's not a simple light side vs dark side ending based on alignment. Speaking of alignment, it's not all black and white and in many ways playing a \"light side\" empire character makes sense. (SPOILERS: The Dark Side choices when playing the empire in general have you serving the Sith or just being unnecessarily cruel, while the light side may have you serve the actual \"Empire\" and it's people. There is distinction between what is good for the Sith and what is good for the Empire. In the Republic, the politicians are horribly corrupt and self serving, you can either embrace that or try to fight it. There are a lot more gray areas in the Republic choices overall - end justifies the means sort of stuff.)Grouping - Admittedly, your personal unique quest will only take up about 20% of your game time. Most of your quests will be shared by other classes as well - this is actually a good thing. For example, you start on Hutta as an Imperial Agent and your friend starts as a Bounty Hunter - you will have radically different personal quests - but they will steer you towards the same area just with different purposes. So you will be able to group together for 80% of the quests and go to the same areas, just not be able to enter each others personal quest areas. The attention to detail for the common quests is as high as for your personal ones. The voice acting is fantastic, the quests are grouped appropriately and even in the rush of the head start there is little difficulty in getting to your objectives. Finally, if you are playing as a light side character in a group of dark side characters, the decisions you make have no impact on your own alignment. For example, if given the option to save or kill someone, all group members pick a response and do a dice roll, who ever wins gets to speak and execute the action, but the choice you made is what impacts your alignment even if the other option won out.PvP - I will admit that PvP in this game is clearly not the main focus at this time. It's there, but it's not perfect yet. There is also some imbalance between the empire/republic therms of population count right now - at least that's what appears to be happening as I've been doing the mixed faction HuttBall pvp instances more than empire vs republic instances. This will probably balance out by release and doesn't matter much anyway as HuttBall is pretty good times. PvP in terms of class balance is decent but most tanking classes start out very weak early on. Finally, there is nearly no distinction between a PVP and PVE server - open world pvp doesn't exist till very much near the end game and the planets are fairly segregated.Crafting - Crafting has been relegated from being a time and money sink to just being a money sink. You do not personally craft the item. Your companions do. In addition they will use crafting components from your inventory as well as your ship bank. This means that you can be crafting while questing, pvping etc. Once you get two companions, there is no reason to not have one of them crafting at all times. The system is well designed but the long term financial viability of some skills is still debatable as the economy at retail will be very different from beta.Itemization - You are able to modify certain items to change their stats in entirely. IE on a gun all the damage is determined by the barrel which you can swap out - the barrel itself has a level requirement and that is passed on to the item. Thus you can stick to the same items for the rest of the game. Oddly it is often more expensive to buy upgrades for an existing modifiable item than it is to buy a whole new unmodifiable one. This will probably change once the economy stabilizes, but right now modifying your gear is wasteful. Quests will often reward you with a choice of an item or tokens which then can be used at a vendor to purchase higher quality gear, as such you don't usually get stuck with quest rewards that you end up selling right away.I can't think of much else to say - the game is running fine on my QX6600 with 2 GTX8800 in SLI(this is an OLD PC) as well as on a 2 year old Asus G51-A1. I have not had a single crash in the last beta build or in the release client. It's still not happy about alt tabbing (slow to tab back), but that's the only issue I have with the release client.

And the reason why I originally avoided buying it proved true. Not only is the game too slow-paced too often, but you are constantly repairing your weapons or else they break and you lose them for good. Yeah, I know, breaking weapons sounds more realistic, BUT 1. it takes away from the fun when you have to repair a baseball bat after only 9 or 10 zombie hits, and 2. why would i have to repair a crowbar or solid steel pipe or anything else that obviously can withstand a lot of real-world damage, and 3. why in the HELL do i have to repair a crowbar as often as i have to repair a wooden stick??? Yes, the durability of the weapons in this game is that screwed up.The Hit Detection is horrible in this game (Zombies can magically hit you while having the same reach as you and yet you can't hit them unless you move closer), and the Aiming of the crosshairs in this game is spazmatic. Literally. You move the crosshairs to aim your next attack and it wobbles around the screen like someone having a seizure is controlling the analog stick.What's REALLY stupid is that in this game you have to go around collecting money to not just buy things like weapons (which is a given) but you have to pay to repair and upgrade and modify your weapons. Sounds like something inconsequential to gripe about, right? Well you repair/upgrape/modify your weapons by collecting things around the island and then you find a workbench and your character chooses from the free things you have gathered and for some reason then have to pay to use them. Umm, if i collect a roll of duct tape and a knife and want to 'modify' my baseball bat at a workbench by taping the knife to the end of my bat, WHY do i have to PAY to tape that knife to my bat when I'M the one doing it and it's MY stuff that I collected??? It makes NO sense, but obviously then needed to institute some sort of system. It's just a crappy, unnecessary system.The game looks good, but even the nice graphics cannot stop the boredom from creeping in. There's a LOT of walking (or driving, but i'll get to that in a minute) around, then you see a zombie or 2 and kill it, then a lot more walking around. Basically nearly EVERY mission is a \"Fetch\" quest where someone needs this item so you go from point A to point B, get the item, then return back to point A where you learn you need to get another item, so you then leave point A and go to point C, get the next item only to return to point A again where now at point D theres another item you need to fetch. Basically that's the missions of this game. And THAT would be fun IF there were a lot more roaming zombies and a lot better fighting/hit detection system in place.Something i REALLY hate is because the weapon system is crap you find yourself using the melee attack button often, the only problem is there are only 2 preset controls and neither have the melee attack assigned to a more \"convenient\" button. One is the default with it assigned to the L Bumper, and the other changes it, but ALSO changes the controls into some weight \"analog\" fighting control scheme I've never seen in any game before that's just awkward and confusing.And now the driving. yes, you can drive, and if you DO play this game remember to get the truck fixed ASAP as if you wait you will be doing a LOT of boring walking around. BUT driving is almost as annoying as walking because the viewpoint from inside the truck is so awkward you are constantly driving into things and getting stuck because it looks like you'll clear by it but you don't.The island IS big, which is cool, and the zombies seem to randomly respawn so it's not like you clear an area and then its forever rid of zombies, BUT with the little amount of zombies sprinkled around the island AGAIN you will find yourself getting bored every few minutes before a short action burts, then back to the boring traveling again.I LOVE Zombie games, and it's hard for me not to like Dead Island as i really tried, but there's just too much wrong with it -even with the free dlc the GOTY comes with- to recommend it for anything more than a weekend rental. TAKE MY ADVICE: if you're looking for a fun zombie game, BUY LEFT 4 DEAD GOTY. It's literally one of the best games I've ever played, one of the funnest, and it beats Dead Island HANDS DOWN in every category.Also, this GOTY version has a new character and stuff but the game only comes with the original game booklet which doesn't say anything at all about him or his skills or specialties or anything. You'd think they'd at least update and put in a newer instruction booklet.I give this game 2 stars. Fighting the zombies is just too annoying because of the shoddy hit detection and the annoying spazzy crosshairs, having to repair your weapons CONSTANTLY (at least until further in the game when you can PURCHASE upgrades) is just plain annoying, and there's just too much wandering around where nothing much of anything happens while you're on one of the too-many \"Go Fetch This-Or-That Item\" quests. Maybe I've given it an unfair lower rating because I can't help but compare it to Left 4 Dead, but that only confirms my advice to DEFINITELY buy LEFT 4 DEAD over this game any day of the week, and twice on Sunday.And REMEMBER: I recommend the ORIGINAL Left 4 Dead Game of the Year edition, NOT Left 4 Dead 2. Although the second one is fun, the original is MUCH better. The second one added in a melee system so you can use bats and axes and whatnot (and funny enough their melee system is WORLDS BETTER than that of Dead Island, too) but they also added in a wider variety of special-type zombies, and the types they added are just annoying to the point that you wish they would have kept everything the same as the original but just made the second one a bunch of more levels.Anyways, there you go and i hope this helps. Just don't blame me if you don't heed my advice =-)","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-13-2013"}

Also this game has a very decent story combined with an expansive game world.The Story:- Takes place in a fictional 1940s-1950s Empire Bay (combination of New York, Boston, and other large cities)- The main character Vito Scalleta grows up in Little Italy, where he and his friend Joe get caught stealing. Joe escapes and you choose to go fight in WW2 instead of going to jail. You come back from the war and start working for the Mafia because of Joe.Pros:- The gameplay is pretty fun, you could compare the gameplay to GTA.  It's a cover-based third person shooter. The controls take some getting used to, but it's not that bad.- There is a decent variety of things to do.- Extraordinary story and great immersion- Good voice acting- The Platinum Hits version comes with all the DLC disk and the DLC is pretty much another game- Chapters are paced pretty well and it doesn't feel like it slows down.Cons:- Rather repetitive.- Being stealthy does offer enough gameplay, it's more fun to just dive in and try to survive gang fights.Other:- I got 860G on one playthrough on Hard- The DLC is pretty much an entirely new game that just takes place in Empire Bay- The main story has 14 chapters.Buy this game:- You want to enjoy an excellent mafia story- It's under $20Don't buy this game if:- You want lots of sidequests.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2013"}

A Carty \"Jessie Carty\"","summary":"Great Fun but Accessories can be Frustrating","reviewText":"My husband and I were at our local vendor at 11:30 waiting for our pre-order and finally went to sleep (me earlier than him!) by 3 am. We had highly anticipated this system and we were not disappointed.The setup of the system itself was fairly simple and straightforward. We discovered quickly that even just setting up the Mii's (your individual \"character\" for such games as WiiSports) was already entertaining as you selected hair color, height etc, reminded me of the Sims but on a simpler level.We first began with WiiSports since it came with the system and within 10-15 minutes could easily use the controllers especially on tennis and bowling. I was surprised at how involved your whole body was in playing these games. For example, when bowling you really have to do the motion (leg involvement and all) of bowling to get a good hit.For launch we also purchased Zelda and Call of Duty 3. They graphics and sound on both are amazing but since we only played them briefly I won't review them further here. The games could have looked 10x better if Nintendo had bothered to release/produce the component cables. We have an impressive TV but without the component cables you could definitely sense you were missing the crispness of the graphics.The only cons I will say are:1-the sensor bar that you have to attach so the wireless wii-mote willwork was a bit frustrating. This was largely due to the fact that wehave cats and they kept walking in front of it. I hope we can find abetter area to attach it to.2-Accessories. As noted, no component cables available, very difficultto get additional controls, and the additional controllers can startrunning up the bucks!!!!This is a wonderful system that could be for the whole family. We can't wait to take it with us on Thanksgiving to have everyone play. I hope more are made available soon as the game selection is much more versatile then other systems on the market and this system, in general, will be playable by a large market base.ENJOY!!!!","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-20-2006"}

The game is still fun, and definately worth renting, but only die-hard fans will want to own this one.The graphics are good.  The sound effects are dead-on, and sound just like the movies.  You can play either from the first person perspective or third.  The controls are intuitive, although you will have to look at the manual to figure out how to perform some functions.The single player story mode is just too quick.  I think most people should be able to beat it on the medium setting under four hours.  Mercifully, there's an instant action mode so you can play Hoth over and over and over again (or whatever your favorite battle happens to be).X-box live is just unmanagable.  With more than two or three people to a room, the game lags to a crawl.  Live would have been a redeeming factor for this game, playing ten other people in the star wars universe would be a lot of fun on this game, and to that end, the system link play might be fun (I haven't tried).

After finishing the game and unlocking >80% of the secret emails, here is what I thought of it.PROS.ACROBATIC ABILITIES: Like in Prince of Persia games, this is one of my favorite aspect of this game. Climbing buildings, jumping from roof to roof, taking leap of faith etc. can be real fun.OPEN WORLD: I truly like open world games. Between three major cities, there are plenty of open world exploration you can do. My favorite part was to get on top of tall buildings and just admire the beauty of the well designed cities.TOOLS FOR ASSASSINATION: As the title of the game implies, it is about assassinating targeted individual and to do so, they give you some pretty good weapons. My favorites are hidden blades. Loved taking down enemies with them.STORY: Have to say, the game has somewhat confusing, but never the less decent story. Can't tell you much without spoiling it.CONS.EXTREMELY REDUNDANT MISSIONS: I was expecting they will challenge you with variety of assassination mission, however, most of them are exactly the same. Unfortunate part is they are also very easy. So the first few assassinations were fun; however, after that I was bored to death killing the targets same way over and over again. And difficulty only increases slightly from initial missions to later missions.EXTREMELY REDUNDANT CHORES: In order to get your mission, you have to do some chores. These chores are EXACTLY THE SAME IN ALL CITIES. By the time you finish the game, you will hate them.ANNOYING CHORES: Some chores involve annoying task like collecting the flags. HATE IT, ABSOLUTELY HATE IT.LIMITED VARIETY IN WEAPONS AND UPGRADES: They have few different weapons and upgrades for these weapons, but I was expecting more. Much more.LIMITED VARIETY IN ENEMIES: There are very few different types of enemies in the game. Again, I was expecting a lot more.ANNOYING CHASES: So after you assassinate someone, you get chased by the guards, very understandable. If you get caught in public doing something stupid, you get chased, acceptable. Initially, all of these didn't bother me, but as the game get more and more redundant, these chases started to annoy me more and more. What was fun before, became torture now.WATER = INSTANT DEATH: What the...?? You are master of so many different weapons and skills, but you can't swim!!!! This would not be a problem if some missions and assassination required travel over the water.To me, Cons easily outweighed the Pros and what was supposed to be an enjoyable experience, turned out to be a great punishment. SO I REGRETTED GETTING THIS GAME.Now while it falls the scope of this discussion, Assassins Creed 2 is a completely different story and a great game.

Danzig","summary":"Hot, Hotter, Hottest Pursuit","reviewText":"I've long been a fan of the Need for Speed arcade racing series, especially the Hot Pursuit variants.If there is anything more exciting than engaging in a high-speed chase with cops in real-life supercars, I can't imagine what that would be -- except for a ride on Coney Island's Cyclone, of course!This latest build of the game makes for an INSANELY enjoyable experience!!!  Famed for its Burnout series, Criterion has handled the development here, and they do NOT disappoint!I've only been playing for an hour or two as I write this, but I can tell you that this is one of those games you simply can't wait to play again, making the rest of the day seem boring and interminable.I have unlocked only a fraction of the cars available, but the \"preview\" races let you lay your lead foot down in some of the supercars to come -- and, well, \"come\" is the appropriate word here, even if misspelled...As others have noted, the handling of the cars is a bit more realistic than in previous NFS games, but it's not as unforgiving as in Gran Turismo.  The graphics are just jaw-dropping, including the cars, the scenery, and the weather effects.The courses have shortcuts, but they don't seem as wacky as those in Burnout, for example.  When you drive as a racer (not a cop), you build nitrous by engaging in bad driving behavior, like driving in the left lane, dodging oncoming traffic.  This feels like Burnout, but unlike that over-the-top series, it seems very hard to run your opponents off the road here.  The cars collide with a solid thunk, suggesting that the manufacturers wanted to tout their products' tank-like build quality!You can race as either a speeder or a cop, and both have an array of weapons, including spike strips, electromagnetic charges, and radar jamming, as well as roadblocks and helicopter surveillance for the cops.Whether you race as a speeder or a cop, you will encounter different types of races.  As a cop, for example, you might have to bust one single offender or a group racing -- or you might simply have to race to help other cops in a given amount of time, being careful not to crash into other motorists or wreck your vehicle.I really only have two minor gripes about the game.  First, the onscreen type is too small -- developers, NOT everyone has large-screen TV's and pilot's vision!!!  Second, I wish the viewing perspective were a little higher above your car, allowing you to see farther down the road; instead a small inset shows the layout of the road ahead, alerting you to upcoming twists and turns.  This approach works, but I would prefer keeping my eyes on the road.I was also unable to log into the NFS website any time on launch day, but I was able to the following day and I believe I have been able to since; the truth is, I really don't care about the online aspects of this game -- I have no need to be slaughtered by a pack of eight-year-olds -- but if you do, you will find plenty of competition online, as well as Facebook-like social networking with other racers.Again, I must emphasize that this is an arcade racer, not a racing simulator like Gran Turismo.  GT may offer a more realistic driving experience but NOT a more pleasurable one by any stretch of the imagination -- or the road.HIGHLY recommended!!!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-17-2010"}

{"product_name":"B001COV1CY","reviewerName":"maninblue \"maninblue\"","summary":"Either you are good or will hate it. Huge learning curve.","reviewText":"This is one of those games that would be a perfect rental first.  People will likely love or hate this game so a quick rent should help choose which side you might be part of.  People will love or hate that it is very different from arcade shooters like Call of Duty.  In MAG, everyone operates more or less like a smaller cog of a greater machine, whereas in Call of Duty and other shooters, everyone is just running around getting kills and ridiculously powerful killstreak bonus that lead to more kills and etc.  MAG requires a large amount of teamwork in order for the battles to function correctly.  Unfortunately, there just are not enough players vocalizing anything that is of much value.  Sometimes you have a squad leader who calls stuff out, but really, its never something that you will die without.  It isnt bad, but the chaotic nature of the large maps and people not knowing whats going on will frustrate a lot of people who cant devote endless hours into studying the layouts of each area.From the start, I thought that my low level was contributing to how much I sucked at this game.  I later found that I was stuck in a rut, because the weapons that you are first given felt like peashooters.  However, the game became quite fun for a limited time once I unlocked the ability to heal and revive my teammates.  Acting as a medic will not get you the most kills, but will definitely deliver the most experience points.Later, I unlocked few other weapons and I just never felt like they mattered.  I played as Raven and had an opportunity to pick up a Valor assault rifle and it was great.  Otherwise, the Raven weapons seemed like junk.  Horrible iron sights tha obscure your target.  Half the time you will get sprayed by someone shooting from the hip and headshotted because you couldn't get the center of your screen on him while he was running. Playing the medic was the way to go because I was a weak soldier, but reviving people got old too quick.Large game modes seemed just too chaotic to be fun.  In huge maps with several squads of 8 teammates attacking or defending various objectives, I never felt the bigger picture in any of the battles.  The map was never helpful enough to tell me the size and scope of everything and by the time you realize you got lost, you died from sniper fire you will never find and wait 20 more seconds to respawn.  Squad members are split up andrunning all over the place because of the rotating spawn timer.The game boils down to needing to work with your squad. When your squad starts getting picked off and some of the team is down and waiting for a medic, some are dead waiting for the spawn timer to count down, and the others are cluelessly still running around outnumbered or outmatched.  For Raven, it seems like we were ALWAYS outmatched. The general consensus on the [...]  forums is that Raven is the underdog.  I can attest to that.  At this point I have no time to dump into switching PMC's and leveling up all over again.This game offers nothing for offline play, nothing for split-screen, and the tutorials to get a newcomer is woefully lacking.  There is nothing to help teach an aspiring squad leader or platoon leader what they are supposed to do or what their responsibilities are once they put the leader boots on.  All the time, there is someone trying this role out for the first time and not knowing what to do.  The rest of the squad gets frustrated and quits or attempts to vote the person off.  Regardless, the chaos and distraction usually results in a loss.  Other people that would gladly take the role, are intimidated by this and don't bother giving it a shot at all.  Its frustrating that the game could not have included some decent tutorial videos to help get people on track with each role.  The game would rather you jump in the hot seat and disappoint your team, thus taking a heavy loss and wasting a half hour in the game. The lack of sufficient briefings set many players up for failure.  In many ways, the entire game feels this way.  Would-be medics run around with their heal-guns out aiming at teammates, but don't understand that they have not unlocked the ability to heal others yet.  Huge battles have no war-room strategizing before the game starts.  Leaders don't know what is going on and call in air strikes while the enemy still has anti-air defenses up.  Players are all over the place.  It takes forever to figure out which weapons suck the least.  Everyone is thrust into a huge warzone with no regard to what is going on or how to do it before hand and expected to perform.Again, Im not saying the game is terrible.  There is much to appreciate here in terms of the technology and potential.  Huge battles can be lots of fun if people know what they are doing.  If the coordination, teamwork, AND skill all line up in every match, you have a winner.  Unfortunately, asking 256 people to get these three things straight every single time is not going to happen.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-08-2010"}

StoryTheGod of Warfranchise tells the tragic and violent story of the warrior Kratos and his dealings with the gods. The ancient world would eventually both praise and damn the infamous ?Ghost of Sparta? as the mortal who slayed a god, but long before his battle with Ares, Kratos sought absolution from his past sins by pledging himself as a champion to the gods. These brutal crusades in the name of Olympus became legendary, but would have far-reaching consequences. InChains of OlympusKratos is pushed to the edge as he is ordered by the gods to journey to the very depths of the underworld after the world plunges into darkness. There he must face the most feared creatures of Greek mythology and is forced to choose between his own personal redemption and saving the ancient world from certain destruction. It is a choice that will shake the immortals from their perches on Mt.

Here not only will your skill with the Blades of Chaos be tested, but your wits as well.As you explore the dangers of the ancient world, players must be prepared to use their navigational skills as they press on through labyrinths of challenging puzzles. Some may be simple tests at manipulating the game?s environment to your advantage, while others much more difficult also requiring precision timing of moves, but each will be different and test you in new ways.An Evolution in Franchise HistoryMore than just a missing piece in the history of theGod of Warfranchise,Chains of Olympusalso serves as an evolutionary link between the origins of theGod of Warfranchise and its future. Originally developed for PlayStation 2, the future of the franchise is slated to make its arrival on PlayStation 3 in the form of the highly anticipatedGod of War IIIin the not too distant future. Not only is PlayStation Portable designed to work in unison with PlayStation 3 in many ways, but both long-time fans and newcomers to the series who choose to watch and playChains of Olympuscarefully may very well pick up clues as to the direction the franchise will be heading in withGod of War III.Regardless, whether you find yourself playing for the current chapter in Kratos? saga or preparing yourself for the battles to come on the PlayStation 3,God of War: Chains of Olympusis a must have title for any current owner of a PSP or those considering getting in the handheld game with one.","reviewerName":"B.

The two entries for the PS2 and GoW III for the PS3 are known for a unbelievable story of redemption and how NOT to piss off a spartan. Especially a spartan that has anger management problems. Anyway, how about this PSP installment? Is it any good? Does it live up to the GoW name? Yes. To all. Visually, its one of the best looking PSP games out there. The story takes place before the original GoW and its an interesting take on a part of Kratos's past. It really doesn't tie into the &#34;I'm going to kill Ares/Zeus&#34; story of the main console titles, but it is still excellently done. The graphic quality of Kratos swinging the Blades of Athena at all the undead foes, and the button mini-game executions is just as satisfying as any GoW game. My only gripe is the stick. As your trying to traverse the world, it can be a great hindrance. If your a die hard gamer/GoW/Kratos fan, this is a no-brainer buy.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-12-2012"}

Roman","summary":"This is what I've been missing all these years?","reviewText":"Fighting games are one of my favorite genres. I've been playing them since Fatal Fury and the first Street Fighter II in the early 90s, and enjoy a bunch of different series. Guilty Gear, Samurai Shodown, Virtua Fighter, King of Fighters, Last Blade, Capcom vs SNK, SNK vs Capcom, BlazBlue, Dead or Alive, SoulCalibur, the list goes on. Tekken was a series I was never that interested in. 'probably because in the late 90s I didn't have much interest in the original Playstation, but it never looked that good to me for some reason. Fast forward to 2010 and I've finally picked up a Tekken game. Granted, the price had something to do with it (just a Fiver), but I was ready to try a new fighting game series. Well, new to me at least. Low and behold, I hated it. I'm sure Tekken purists will go ahead and vote 'no' on this review, which doesn't make sense since these are supposed to be for people who are deciding on if they should get something or not, not people who've already played the game, but I really didn't like anything about Tekken 6, and don't get how anyone can call it the best fighting game on the ps3.Tekken 6 doesn't play like any other fighter I've played. From what I got in the 20 hours (give or take) I played, it all comes down to how well you can juggle your opponent. Characters get launched from attacks that shouldn't launch them up in the air, even when they're laying on the ground. There was a good number of times when I fought people online, and I was knocked down, only to be knocked back up when someone did a jumping kick OVER me. It wasn't anywhere near my character, yet there they went, up and away, getting stuck in another juggle combo. You can argue that juggling is in a lot of fighting games (especially Guilty Gear), but at least there it makes sense. Juggling seems to be the key to victory, just like how the key to victory in SoulCalibur is picking Kilik or Mitsurugi. Throws are pretty broken too, dealing as much damage as some combos. Attacks are based on 4 main buttons- square, x, circle and triangle, with each representing either arm or leg. Some characters have special moves, like shooting with a gun or weird energy attacks, but most of them stick to 'real' moves. It was s a nice change of pace, but everything here seemed very unresponsive to me. Playing Tekken 6, I never felt like I was getting any better, even after spending time in practice modes with characters that are supposed to be newbie friendly. I felt more confident playing Primal Rage in the mid-90s than I did playing Tekken 6.Aside from the standard Arcade mode (complete with stupid huge demon boss that doesn't fit in with the setting), there's a very terrible quest mode. Think of how beat 'em up games were on the ps2 in the first couple of years of its lifespan. Yeah, remember The Bouncer? This is like that. You pick a character and go through different maps, beating up generic baddies while trying to stay awake through one of the most boring plots ever in a fighting game. Controls here are atrocious, since you're no longer going from side to side like in the regular fights, but all over the map like a standard action game. But here your moves are carried over to this new mode, and it doesn't work very well. The only pro is that this is where you'll be getting a lot of the game's trophies, but if you ask me, it's not worth suffering through. Online play isn't worth mentioning, but I'll do so anyway. Get this- the net code is worse than the original Street Fighter IV's. Where you could hop in and play online in no time with regular SFIV, here in Tekken 6, a newer game, you'll be spending a lot of time staring at loading/syncing screens. Sometimes, when I was finally ready for a match, I didn't care any more.Things don't get any better in the graphics department either. Tekken 6 looked stunning in arcades, but on consoles, it looks like it's from the last console generation. I actually said out loud 'this is a ps3 game?' when my first match started up. Textures, animations, everything is lackluster except for the cutscenes, but who needs those in a fighting game? At least the voice acting is decent, if a bit melodramatic (what can you expect from something like this?). I did like the music in some stages, but nothing was very memorable.While I don't feel like I listed enough reasons why I didn't like Tekken 6, in all honesty, the game just bored the hell out of me. I'd rather play any of the Mortal Kombat games before giving this another shot, and I loathe the MK games. I don't feel like I was completely ripped off since I finally got to play a Tekken game and see if I liked it or not, and I at least got some easy trophies out of it (I'm no trophy hound, but I gotta say, the ones here are stupid-easy to get). I'll gladly stick with Guilty Gear and Street Fighter over this any day. You'd think with such a huge cast of characters, I would've found more than just a boxing kangaroo that I liked. Poor Roger Jr., maybe you can make it in a better game sometime...","overall":1.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-05-2010"}
{"product_name":"B002I08RA0","description":"","reviewerName":"Maek","summary":"Assassin's Creed Continues To Evolve...And Impress","reviewText":"First things first -If you haven't played the first Assassin's Creed and subsequent releases (or at LEAST starting with II, and going forward) - go no further. Do yourself a service and start with II as a bare minimum and work yourself forward to this, the 3rd in the Ezio Auditore trilogy. Otherwise, you'll be completely lost.For those of you familiar with the story, you're going to find Ezio Auditore in his twilight years on a quest to find Altair's legendary, yet quite well-protected, library. The Templars have caught wind of it and Ezio is also trying to find his way in to thwart their attempts at worldwide control. This is hardly a spoiler as you're quickly brought into this within minutes of beginning to play Ezio - no further spoilers here.From the standpoint of playing all of the previous Assassin's Creed entries, how does this one fare? Well, I finally played it tonight and I must say that it is really quite remarkable. There's a major change in the way that combat is handled - you select a primary and then a secondary weapon so that you can enter a sword fight and then throw knives at will, for example (no longer do you have to constantly \"weapon wheel\" between sword and throwing knives constantly). Graphic engine has been updated and it's quite smooth; I don't find it stuttering nearly as often as it used to. Even the story itself has been given a facelift - now there's more of a cohesive, unified story rather than a series of seemingly disjointed events culminating in your goal in the first place of killing \"x\" person because he did \"y\". \"Eagle vision\" also has some significant improvements, some subtle and some not. For example, in addition to identifying enemies, you'll actually see faint red lines indicating a guard's patrol route. This enhances the formulation of tactics. In other cases, where smoke bombs are even more effective at obscuring your enemies' ability to attack you, \"eagle vision\" will actually allow you to pierce the cloud and attack your enemies at will. In addition, you will be collecting materials to craft a variety of different bombs (lethal and non-lethal). The animations of Ezio kill moves are superb and some of his abilities show that Ezio, in his twilight years, is deadlier than ever. The music, as always, is very well-done and the voice acting is even better than usual. The beginning of the game reminds me of Matrix Revolutions, but I do mean this in a good way.The environments are breathtakingly beautiful. The game has departed from Italy and finds itself in Constantinople, once the true crossroads of the world between Europe and Asia when the United States was still a mere 264 years away from declaring its own independence. Ezio finds himself with new equipment (the hook blade is fun opening a variety of attacks as well as an ability to zip line around your environment - fantastic!), friends (including a romantic interest), and actually enters into the conflict politically - it's no longer a mere Templar/Assassin conflict. There are layers to appreciate here as Ezio makes an ally and as I am starting to delve into it, I truly appreciate what Ubisoft has created here.If there is one thing that I have to complain about, it's the mode where you have to defend your own Assassin's Keeps in addition to creating them for those of you familiar with Brotherhood. It becomes a \"tower defense\" game at this point...and I don't mean that in a flattering way. It's one thing that Ubisoft could have omitted (or seriously improved upon) without impacting the story whatsoever. It comes off as a silly gimmick that didn't appear to have been given a significant amount of thought in terms of how it flows with the rest of the interlocking parts. This is an oprhan 301st piece in a 300-piece puzzle; it doesn't fit and, quite honestly, you don't really need it to complete the experience.I haven't had a chance to explore multiplayer too much, but what I've seen so far seems to indicate that Ubisoft has taken the best parts of Brotherhood and have added both modes and additional customization not seen before. I'm more into the story then the multiplayer, but Revelations has shown me enough to convince me to give it a try...later. Assassin's Creed is still, first and foremost, about a continuing and quite fascinating story. And the final chapter to the overall story arc (with Ezio's presumably ending here, if rumors are believed) is to come in yet a single year, although how Ubisoft plans to bring this epic to a conclusion in the absence of such a strong character like Ezio has my curiosity piqued.Despite the fault of \"tower defense\", everything else is so vastly improved that I still have to give it a solid 4.75 stars (5 stars on the Amazon scale - don't think it deserves a 4). Enough said - get it and enjoy!","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-18-2011"}

{"product_name":"B000WCN8IW","description":"A fierce struggle is taking place within the realm of the Norse Gods, as the goddess Hel has been banished for defying Odin, Lord of Asgard. Angry at her fate, Hel has raised an army of resurrected Viking warriors to wipe out all of humanity in the mortal realm of Midgard, as she seeks to bring about Ragnarok -- the apocalyptic battle that that will destroy Asgard and the Gods themselves. The task of stopping Hel and defending the future of mankind falls to Skarin, a promising but deeply flawed young warrior, ignorant of the true reason for his favor with the Gods...","reviewerName":"tvtv3 \"tvtv3\"","summary":"GOD OF WAR Light With Norse Mythology","reviewText":"In VIKING: THE BATTLE FOR ASGARD you play a legendary warrior named Skarin. A war between the Norse gods Freya and Hel has spilt over into Midgard (Earth). Hel is upset about being kicked out of Asgard and raises an army of resurrected warriors. She is determined to conquer Midgard and use it as her launching platform against Asgard. In opposition to Hel is Freya who has selected Skarin as her chosen warrior. She gifts him with a few special abilities and sets him out on a path to free Midgard from Hel's threat.The overall gameplay is fairly easy as VIKING: THE BATTLE FOR ASGARD is basically a hack-n-slash game with some elements similar to GOD OF WAR and FABLE. You just keep fighting your way through one Legion warrior after each other. There is some strategy involved as you can gain new abilities and upgrade old ones and certain moves work better on different types of Legions. Also, you are able to upgrade the magical ability of your sword, though you're stuck with that sword and an axe for the entire game.The things I liked most about the game were the visuals and the ease of achievements. The visuals are gorgeous and there are some really scenic shots in different places in the game. Also, when killing Legion, the action turns to slow-motion which shows the hacking of limbs and beheading of Legion soldiers in graphic, gory detail. Visuals aside, what I liked most about VIKING: THE BATTLE FOR ASGARD was the ease of attaining achievements. Most people will be able to unlock about 700-800 Achievement points while playing the game.At the end of each level, there is a massive battle that involves tens-of-thousands of soldiers as well as dragons. The battles themselves aren't all that impressive because Skarin doesn't really get to fight and instead has to go around killing Legion shamans and giants. What makes these large scale conflicts impressive are the cutscenes.There's been some criticism that the game doesn't have a lot of sound. Games with a constant soundtrack and a plethora of sound effects can be enjoyable, but it gets tiring after a while. It's nice to play a game that doesn't have a full-fledged musical score during the entire game every once in awhile.The biggest issue I had with VIKING was the repetition. There are basically five major battles and you go about reaching each battle in pretty much exactly the same way: you kill a bunch of Legion, you free the correct locations, you rescue the correct amount of Viking captives, you collect the proper items, and you call for a dragon. There are only three dragons, but there are some levels where you don't have to call forth another dragon. The consistent repetition makes VIKING easier to play for inexperienced gamers, but also makes it less enjoyable for those who have played more than a handful of video games.I enjoyed VIKING: THE BATTLE FOR ASGARD. I like hack-n-slash games and it was kind of nice playing one that connects with Norse mythology. I found the repetition a little annoying, but it wasn't enough to infringe upon my overall enjoyment.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-24-2012"}

At best it was a disappointment. That's what everyone seemed to be saying, anyway. Sure, there was a voice poking through every now and again saying it was actually pretty good, but they would get shot down by the more vocal \"It Stinks!\" group. I got the game anyways, figuring \"It's Metroid. It can't be that bad.\"And you know what, it really wasn't. Was it the great return to Super Metroid gameplay style Wii fun I was hoping for? The kind of thing that complemented Super Metroid the way New Super Mario Bros Wii complemented those early Mario platformers? No. In fact, there's a lot annoying with Other M. I would read all the gripes about it and think, \"That's a good point,\" and nod my head at what everyone was saying.Yet I kept coming back to it, wanting to play it. I actually liked the story. The story was interesting and kept me staying with it to see what would happen. The EXECUTION of the story was the flaw. The melodramatics, yeah, that was a problem. The way the story handcuffed the open exploration that Metroid was known for, that hurt the game. The long cut scenes when I just wanted to blast away at weird alien lifeforms annoyed. I would argue that of all those flaws, the worst one was the fact that, as I alluded to, the story is told in such a way that it drives the game play to where it needs to go to keep the story flowing. That door you could go down and explore off the beaten path in previous Metroid games? Locked. Previous pathways are taken away from you as the story keeps pushing you in the direction it needs you to go to keep its beats going. This is where the Prime games were brilliant, you discovered the story as you went along, whereas Other M forces it down your throat.The gameplay itself, I don't have much of a problem with. You run, jump and shoot and it feels natural enough. It depends on if you like the auto aim mechanic and I didn't mind it too much. If it took away my ability to shoot the thing that posed the most danger, it would be a problem, but I didn't find that to happen very much, if at all. It was a bit awkward to go from first person to third person to shoot missiles. The \"concentrate\" to restore your missiles and health was lame.The boss fights were challenging, but after the majesty of the Prime boss fights, they felt a little lacking. The game does hold your hand quite a bit, letting you know where all hidden objects are.Look, I thought the game was fun. I don't regret picking it up and it kept my interest throughout the run time of the major story mode. It's just not up to Metroid standards. I do appreciate that something different was tried and I think they came close to recapturing the magic. Metroid Prime was a giant departure from the side scrolling Metroids of yore, but it still had that same magic.In the end, the thing that keeps the game down is the fact that it got away from the fundamentals of Metroid gameplay: the isolated open world exploration. Yes, in the end when you're done with the story, the world opens up for exploration, but it's too little, too late.It's a fun game that people are probably too hard on, but that's because they expect the best from the franchise, and this game did not deliver \"the best\". Instead of recapturing the glory of Super Metroid, it plays more like a watered down Metroid Fusion (and I liked Fusion) with a character backstory a lot of people didn't want.","overall":3.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-04-2012"}

And the overall ambiance of the game is great. Ive read so many reviews on this game , and the one thing i hear is most of em skip the single player portion , or they play only a few levels,and jump into online. Well i gotta beg you please play(ALL) the single player missionS to the ending. You'll be happy you did. I absolutly suggest you put it on the hardest setting. Dont let the first few easy levels lull you into thinking this game is a walk in the park. It gets pretty intense into the later stages. I said the HARDEST setting not the wimpy ones. Yes, Yes I know.. your teamates are dumb@zzes and cant shoot to save there grandma. I usually kill everyone myself anyways. (Im greedy that way.) ...I wish there was a LONE GUNMAN mode where I could go into all missions ala-mode style a.k.a- by myself .err uh well you get my drift.

Other game publishers couldv'e easily made this game into 3 separate $50.00 dollar releases. But SOCOM3 definalty filled this disc to the max and used every last ounce of power the PS2 can leash out.

{"product_name":"B000P46NKC","description":"Resident Evil 4 Wii","reviewerName":"Paul Hemenway","summary":"Clumsy Gameplay","reviewText":"Apparently, according to the other reviews, I'm the only one who almost hated this game. I rented this game for the sole reason that it got nothing but high praise. I played this game for ten minutes, put it away, and never looked back.I'll say this for Resident Evil 4 in that every other aspect of it besides game play is just decent. The story line is just ... well ... okay. The graphics are top notch for the Wii, though. However, it's the game play that ruined this game for me.The use of the Wii remote is extremely clumsy, and not very innovative either. You have to use your joystick on your numchuck, in coordination with a button, in combination with aiming with your wii remote, in combination with another button just to aim and shoot. Sounds simple, right? Not really when you have about 5 or 6 zombies storming you. You end up alot of times getting your view distorted when trying to fire at someone. Your view of yourself gets in the way a lot of times, and you end up seeing a person's legs when you can't see the rest of him because you're so worried about aiming and firing that you forget to hold your C button down just to look up instead of walking right into the person. I ran into this a lot. By the time you think you've got it down, the screen comes up saying, \"You Are Dead\".I will say this, however, to those of you who might actually take this review to heart. I never have liked the Resident Evil games in the past because I always thought the game play was always crap, and always hard to use. I gave this game a try because the view and the way you move around and shoot are changed to fit more of a FPS style. I thought it failed miserably in this aspect, and felt that Capcom could have done a much better job tweaking the controls in this game. Also, to me, the game play is the MOST important aspect of the game. If I can't pick it up and play it without frustration within a short period of time, then I don't like it. I don't care if the graphics and the effects are off the charts. If the game play stinks, which it did in this game, and the story line is bland, like this game, than I'm not going to like it. That's why I gave this game 2 stars. The only reason it got some stars was because of the good detail that went into this game.Bottom line: if you don't mind bad game play and a bland story line, than I suppose this game is for you.","overall":2.0,"unixReviewTime":"07-04-2007"}

Also this is a must buy for those who enjoyed the first game. I enjoyed the first game's story and action but hated the platforming and stealth portions, needless to say I'm glad they were taken out for this game. In the game you play as one of the McCall brothers each with thier own special abilities and playing style. Ray who players of the first game will recognize is all about in your face confrontation. He can duel wield pistols, use dynamite, and even pick up a gattling gun. Thomas is more about long range sniping and clean stealth killing. He's deadly with a rifle and can use a bow and knives for stealthy clean kills. You can play as either through out most of the game execpt in a few levels. Personally I find Thomas more fun to play as because of his variety of different weapons but he's a little harder to use then Ray. Ray is more of a typical cookie cutter nearly invincible FPS protagonist but it just depends on your playing style. The game only lasts 7 hours but you can go through it twice with both characters. The game however isn't perfect, for one the story if you've played the previous game and even if you haven't is somewhat predictable and cliche. Also if you have played the first game you have a pretty good idea what's going to happen. If you haven't played the first though, I'd recommend skipping it until you've played this. Also the multiplayer is almost dead, maybe I got the game a little late but it's kind of disappointing there isn't more interest in this game when the multiplayer is actually decent. The voice acting is pretty top notch too and it sounds almost like something out of a classic hollywood western. Also it's nice to see an M-rated game that handles it's content maturely and artistically. Yes there's violence, harsh language and sexual innuendo but it's not juvenile or excessive. However I still wouldn't give this to a young child but anyone who enjoyed Gun, Red Dead Revolver, the first game or just shooters in general should consider picking this up.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"01-30-2010"}
{"product_name":"B000A0EFHY","reviewerName":"blackaciddevil","summary":"Peter Jackson's King Kong.....Now-this is the way movie games ought to be done...","reviewText":"Peter Jackson's King Kong has to be the best adaption of a game from a movie I've ever seen. Combining the best parts of Ico, Turok, as well as a few other signature games; Kong is an absolute thrill ride you shouldn't miss. Michel Ancel(of 'Rayman' fame) worked closely with Peter Jackson(whom we all know directed the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy) to produce a game that gives justice to the movie. For the most part, you play as Jack Driscoll who is a young screenwriter hired by Carl Denham to make a movie on Skull Island. You play in first-person as Jack using weapons, traps, and your team wisely to survive. And, survive you must. Then, there are levels where you play as Kong..which are absolutely awesome as you break jaws, slam enemies, and throw massive objects as Kong in Third-person Perspective. Over the course of the game, from the very first level to the last, this game builds a certain tension that will make you continue playing just to see what happends next. Alot of that tension comes from having no health bar..when you're hit, you constantly wonder \"Is this the end?\".  Course, you'll know when the end comes. I'm simply amazed at how simple this game is but is so much fun to play. Not putting down Turok but this is how Turok should've been done. Lots of prehistoric monsters coming after you, things to figure out, and whatnot. I absolutely love this game.If I had any gripes with the game, it would be that it isn't long enough and the levels you play as Kong are few and far between. Though, we can't expect a game to last forever-now, can we? Too, the levels in which you play as Kong were pretty good, especially on the last level.At any rate, Peter Jackson's King Kong is a game based on a movie that all other developers ought to aspire to. By keeping things simple yet refreshing, they made a game that could just be 'the Eighth Wonder of the World'. I can't wait to see how the Playstation Portable turns out...so I can play through it all again.","overall":5.0,"unixReviewTime":"12-04-2005"}

Play Godzilla as never before with non-linear story paths and all new Toho monsters.","reviewerName":"Lisa Shea \"be the change you wish to see in t...","summary":"Wide Variety of Monsters and Playing Fields","reviewText":"A new multi-person brawling game featuring the famous series of giant monsters, Godzilla Unleashed for the Nintendo Wii tries to use the Wii remote and motion-sensing features to make a game worthy of the giant atomic lizard and his compatriots.The game's story and gameplay revolve around crystals being dropped on the Earth that cause massive disasters in cities, and furthermore upset the various monsters around the globe. The major population centers become warzones as giant monsters duke it out amidst their ruins. The major storyline piece of note is that there are four factions; the friendlier you are to them, the less likely their members will attack you during a battle. The Earth Defenders don't care much about humans, but really hate the crystals and want to protect the Earth itself, so one must destroy the crystals to earn their favor (and not, if possible, use their power). Their members include Godzilla, Mothra, and Rodan. The GDF (Global Defense Force) is dedicated to protecting humanity, and thus to get their favor you shouldn't destroy buildings and stomp on vehicles whenever possible. GDF robots include Kiryu, MOGUERA, and Jet Jaguar. The Aliens are invaders who want to use the crystals to take over the earth, and so destroying the crystals angers them. Among their ranks are King Ghidorah, Megalon, and Mechagodzilla. Finally, the Mutants want to wreak as much havoc as possible. Their preference is destruction, and so causing as much destruction as possible in cities will get you on their good side.  The mutants include Destoroyah, Titanosaurus, and Obsidius. In total, there are 24 characters, many of which have to be unlocked with points earned through playing the story mode. There is also a multiplayer mode where up to four people can battle it out on whatever stage they wish.The gameplay is a free-roam fighting game with a 3d field. Players can kick, punch, charge energy, or use their powers. Low-power attacks are made by hitting A and B on the Wii Remote (for punches and kicks). High powered attacks are made by swinging the remote while you press A or B (or both, for the most powerful attack). Using the C button on the nunchuk fires your special weapon - for example, Godzilla's atomic breath. C and Z together charge up your energy to use the special weapon. Shaking the nunchuk upwards jumps; shaking both the remote and the nunchuk downwards picks things up. Targeting seems to be automatic in most cases, though you can nudge yourself towards or away from a specific enemy if you want. Besides other monsters, the military is also heavily involved; they'll usually shoot at whichever player is the strongest with a variety of laser weapons and missiles (they can also be customized in the multiplayer mode). For the most part the game plays well, except the combination of moving the remote and pressing a button for the heavy attacks is a little awkward. The characters tend to also be a little slow because of their size, which means reflexes aren't high on the list of player requirements.The graphics are decent for a game that is also on the PS2. It's hard to tell if the Wii version is improved at all, but for the most part they're pretty good. The sound mostly consists of the trademark noises associated with each monster (including Godzilla's famous roar) and the military frantically trying to fire upon the different monsters; nothing too dramatic, really, but about all you can expect from such a game.As a whole, this game delivers what it promised pretty well. There's a wide variety of monsters and playing fields available and it definitely feels like a Godzilla game should. Apart from some minor issues with the semi-dated graphics and Wii controls, this game is pretty good.8/10.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"02-02-2008"}

That game was the worst sports title I've ever played and being a 2K Sports fan, I was a little nervous about jumping back into a Madden game. I boughtMadden NFL 11recently and was sort of enjoying it but I noticed I was winning - a lot! And by a lot! This was after kicking the difficulty up. It felt really arcadey, almost like a NFL Blitz-simulator. Long story short, it just wasn't a football sim.Because of Black Friday, I was debating on picking this Madden up. It looked a little better in videos and I heard it fixed a lot of glitches from 11 while adding some new ones. After I patched the game, I can safely say this is a huge improvement from '11! I'm not even talking graphically, I mean the game actually plays a lot better. Instead of being in All-Star difficulty, I had to kick it down just to get a TD.The graphics/animations are a ton better that make the game look a lot more realistic. Seems like they're working a bit with Euphoria physics. But one thing hasn't changed: Commentary. It's awful. I'm really not certain why they still call this Madden since he's nowhere to be seen. But the guy doing it from 11 and 12 is \"teh suck\". It's programmed wrong too. Several times, I ran into delays from the commentary which just made the presentation feel cheap. For example, I'd kick a field goal from 40 yards, he would say I barely nailed the FG when in fact, I hit the pole and it bounced back. I wouldn't get the score unlike some of the garbage I've seen in '06.Personally, I haven't ran into any glitches outside of commentary.If you're wanting a decent football game, Madden 12 is it. It's got some goofy moments (all commentary related). It's still slightly arcadey in some areas (WR seem to have sticky hands when catching the ball a lot of times) but I'm having a blast with it. I'm already on my 8th game.","overall":4.0,"unixReviewTime":"11-28-2011"}
